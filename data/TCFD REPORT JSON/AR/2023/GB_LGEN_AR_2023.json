        "page_content": "## Introduction\n\n2023 marked the beginning of a transition for Legal & General, with the Company's announcement in January that our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Sir Nigel Wilson, would stand down by the end of the year, and the appointment of Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es, with effect from 1 January 2024, as his successor. It is pleasing in that context to be publishing an Annual report that demonstrates continued good progress across the full breadth of our organisation. This is a testament both to Nigel's personal impact, and the strength of the business he has helped to build over the course of a decade.\n\nAs we look back on the year, I want to reiterate my gratitude, alongside the Board's, to Nigel for his relentless commitment to Legal & General, and for his leadership and contribution since he took up his post over a decade ago. Under his stewardship, Legal & General delivered outstanding shareholder returns, while putting purpose and societal impact at the heart of our choices, through our championship of inclusive capitalism.\n\nFollowing a rigorous global selection process, Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es formally assumed the role of CEO on 1 January 2024. Ant\u00f3nio brings a formidable leadership track record at the most senior level in financial services, working across complex global organisations. His energy, ambition, and clarity of strategic thinking stood out during the selection process, as did his strong belief in the positive role that business should play in society which, of course, he shares with Legal & General.\n\n## Change beyond our business\n\nBusinesses are now becoming accustomed to a new inflation and interest rate environment, with the global economic outlook remaining uncertain. Geopolitical tensions have also accelerated with the impacts of the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and the prospect of several important elections in the coming year. These conditions create complex challenges for investors to navigate, as well as rises in cost of living for many households. Our customers rely on Legal & General to continue to pay their pensions, protect their income and manage their assets. I am proud of the role we play, always keeping sight of our purpose, making a real and positive difference\n\nto people's lives. 2023 was also a time of wider transition in our industry, particularly in our regulatory environment, with the introduction of IFRS 17 and the Consumer Duty. IFRS 17 changes the way insurance firms account for insurance contracts, and the Consumer Duty sets out new rules for delivering good outcomes for all customers.\n\nBoth of these initiatives are important context for Legal & General's business, and I am pleased to report that our teams have done a terrific job to prepare for their introduction. Thanks are due to all colleagues involved.\n\n## Positive momentum\n\nIn 2023, we delivered a resilient set of results, with an adjusted operating profit of \u00a31.7 billion and a 9% growth in our store of future profit to \u00a314.7 billion. Profit for the year of \u00a3443 million and EPS of 7.35 pence reflected mark-tomarket movements and certain one-off accounting impacts.\n\nWe have a strong balance sheet, with a Solvency II coverage ratio of 224%, and capital generation in the year of \u00a31.8 billion. These have supported a final dividend of 14.63 pence, consistent with our stated ambition to grow the dividend at 5% per year to 2024.\n\nOur performance highlights the benefits of our synergistic business model. This year, we have seen more long-standing LGIM clients transition to our pension risk transfer (PRT) business, where we continue to take advantage of our powerful asset origination and management capabilities to match these liabilities with low capital strain.\n\nThe Group continues to build out its international franchises. We have made good progress in the US over the last decade and LGIM continues to expand in Europe and Asia, with 40% of assets under management (AUM) now outside of the UK.\n\nWe remain on track to achieve our five-year ambitions, and ready to set new, stretching goals for the next phase of our journey.\n\n## A growing force for good\n\nActing in both an economically and socially useful way is core to the way we do business.\n\nWe have identified strategic growth areas and in doing so have generated consistent, sustainable, and socially beneficial returns. We are committed to supporting individuals in planning their financial futures, and are proud to help regenerate towns and cities, provide housing and deliver on our climate commitments.\n\nWe are delighted to now be settled into our new office in Cardiff, which brings these elements together to create a workplace with sustainability and wellbeing at its heart. This is the culmination of years of strategic investment and development around Cardiff Central Square - Legal & General has invested more than \u00a31 billion in the city in recent years - and underlines the broad and positive value our approach can generate for our shareholders, customers and our people.\n\nWe continue to take action on climate change, regarding this as both a responsibility and a fundamental element of our business strategy. Our 2023 Climate and nature report highlights our progress against the targets we set out in our Climate transition plan, released in April 2023, and our commitments for the coming years. Our material climate disclosures are disclosed on pages 45 to 48 of this report.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWith a first-class executive team, a strong and resilient business model and platform for growth, the opportunities for impact are plentiful. In our first months working together, following a smooth and well-managed leadership transition, Ant\u00f3nio's dynamism and ambition have been evident. I am confident we can look forward to going from strength to strength under his leadership.\n\nIn closing, I should like to extend my thanks and appreciation to leaders and teams across Legal & General for their enthusiasm and delivery throughout the year, and to our shareholders for their continued support. I look forward to working alongside you, and on your behalf, in the year ahead.\n\nSir John Kingman Chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have seen through multiple economic cycles and societal changes, and evolved to stay relevant. We have proven that we can adapt and thrive in changing circumstances, and support our customers and partners throughout.\n\nToday we are a very significant business a global leader in pension risk transfer, supporting the needs of c.14 million people through our Retail division, managing \u00a31.2 trillion of client assets, and investing alongside them to originate new, socially valuable assets generating returns that help to fulfil long-term pension liabilities.\n\nWith this unique synergistic approach, and our track record of consistent performance and delivery for our shareholders, clients and customers, we are well placed to continue to seize the many growth opportunities in our markets.",

        "page_content": "Central to this success are our people. Legal & General has a reputation for the dedication and expertise of its employees. I was drawn to the Company as a place with a rich culture, in which excellent people thrive. I'm pleased to say these impressions have only been reaffirmed now I have joined.\n\nIn short, Legal & General is a business with strong foundations, and excellent potential. I am looking forward to helping define and lead our next phase.\n\n## What should shareholders expect from you as a leader of Legal & General?\n\nA fresh perspective. I bring experiences from outside the business, which means I ask different questions and look at issues in new ways. I am encouraging us to think broadly about our markets and how we work.\n\nMy first priority as CEO has been to listen. By taking the time to hear from my colleagues, our customers, clients, shareholders and partners, I am learning what Legal & General means to them, getting their perspectives on what matters most, and where they see our future potential.\n\nLooking ahead, I hope to combine strategic vision and focus with consistent delivery. I am working with my team to articulate our long-term growth strategy, considering how each of our divisions needs to focus and evolve to address our biggest opportunities. I look forward to presenting this later in the year, and working with our people and partners to execute our plans.\n\n## How will the experiences you bring from other organisations shape your approach?\n\nI've learned that putting customers at the top of our priority list is how we succeed in the long run. Every decision we take should be with our customer in mind, whether that's a retail\n\ncustomer, institutional client, co-investor or partner. Understanding where our clients are coming from and being able to walk in their shoes is really important - that focus keeps us compassionate and relevant, and helps us to spot new opportunities to add value. I'll be encouraging all our teams to dedicate time to building that connection.\n\nHaving lived and worked around the world, I bring a truly international mindset. I understand what it takes to succeed and scale in different markets, particularly the importance of understanding local culture and knowledge. I am also focused on how we take learning from different contexts to improve and innovate elsewhere.\n\nFinally, with nearly 30 years of experience in financial services, I have a strong appreciation of the complexity of our stakeholder environment, and how it shapes our opportunities and success. I'm committed to ensuring Legal & General continues to be an insightful, thoughtful voice in our industry.\n\n## What are your early observations on the business?\n\nMy early observations are very positive. The strengths I saw looking from the outside are authentic. We are purposeful and commercial; the business is full of talented and expert people. Our track record of delivery against the targets we set in 2020 shows the power and resilience of our business model.\n\nAlongside this, I am focused on our future growth opportunities. The world is hungry for capital and expertise to support new industries and the transition to net zero; institutions want help to navigate a changing economic backdrop; and individuals increasingly need support to prepare for the future financially. With our strengths in asset management and origination, and a respected, trusted brand, we are well placed to help and to benefit.\n\nTo be successful, we need to communicate our vision clearly and crisply. My focus over the coming months is to define a strategy that shows why and how Legal & General will be as relevant in the next 188 years as it has been to date.\n\n## How important are culture and purpose to you as a business leader?\n\nLegal & General is a great example of the importance of purpose and culture in action. Inclusive capitalism has been a powerful galvanising force inside the business and beyond it, and delivered consistent returns for our shareholders. It is motivating to hear how people love being part of Legal & General because we have a clear role to play in society, and to see this reflected in the choices we have made as a business.\n\nBusinesses have a responsibility to help solve problems. All our business divisions are shaping how society and individuals prepare for the future. Our decisions can help make that future as positive a place as possible for the next generation.\n\n## When can we expect to hear more on your plans for the business?\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my first few months at Legal & General. My conversations with our stakeholders, including our shareholders, continue to help me and my team to develop our plans. I look forward to meeting more of our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in May and providing an update on strategy at our Capital Markets Event in June.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Sir Nigel Wilson\n\n## With thanks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The long view\n\nWhen we began our usual planning for our Annual report and accounts in autumn 2023, the team shared with me a selection of those we had produced over the course of my tenure at Legal & General.\n\nIt was striking how much had changed. Legal & General was a part of my life for 14 years, a third of my career. During that time, we saw transformation on a global, national and business level, of a scale that none of us could have predicted.\n\nI joined the Group as Chief Financial Officer, during the Global Financial Crisis. The ripple effects of which led to reflection on the role and responsibilities of financial services\n\ncompanies, and in the UK ushered in a period of quantitative easing combined with public sector austerity. This sustained for nearly a decade, until the punctuation of the Covid-19 pandemic, and then the war in Europe, spurred rising inflation, interest rates and living costs.\n\nPolitics has become more turbulent, in business 'Big Tech' has been dominant, and globally we have recognised the need to transition to a lower carbon way of life, and the extent of change and innovation required to deliver that shift. Developed countries are grappling with the consequences of a rapidly ageing population, and looking to square the opportunities presented by advances such as AI with the potential for equally transformative impacts on the labour market.\n\n## Our approach\n\nLegal & General has had to be alert and adaptable in the context of these changing circumstances. I took over a business which had lost c.70% of its annuity business in the face of pension freedom reforms and disposed of around 20 Legal & General businesses to allow us to modernise, diversify and grow.\n\nIn my early years as CEO, our annual reporting was led with the tagline 'stepping up'. This captured my belief, shared with my colleagues, that we could both positively advance and benefit from the changes around us.\n\nI am proud that the business we built together has shown itself to be not just resilient, but able to evolve and thrive.",

        "page_content": "A large part of our success has been driven by our people, who have seen the opportunity that sits on the other side of challenge, and have encouraged and supported others to do the same.\n\nOver the past 14 years, the make up of Legal & General has changed. We have taken informed and rewarded risks; selling, combining and creating businesses to build the organisation we have today. This enabled us to build a global PRT business, delivered under the stewardship of five talented CEOs: Simon Gadd, John Pollock, Kerrigan Procter, Laura Mason and Andrew Kail, whilst building the UK's first \u00a31 trillion asset manager under Mark Zinkula and Michelle Scrimgeour.\n\nAlongside these milestones, through the creation of Legal & General Capital (LGC), we have taken a significant share of the UK housebuilding market, enabled impactful regional regeneration projects, supported growing industries and invested in c.700 start-ups under Kerrigan Procter and Laura Mason's leadership. Our investment in Pemberton, for example, has seen it grow from a small business, when we invested in 2014, to a major mid-market lending platform, which has raised over \u20ac19 billion from 227 investors globally across seven strategies.\n\nMeanwhile, we have internationalised our operations, opening offices in Bermuda, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, Italy and Switzerland.\n\nOur constant has been the way we have chosen to do business, as an organisation with purpose at its core. Inclusive capitalism led us to look for opportunities to invest profitably in productive assets that address structural societal needs, with the benefits being felt by the members of the pension funds and investments we manage, communities and businesses on the ground, and our shareholders.\n\nOur reputation for combining values with expertise has enabled us to work with some of the most respected universities in the world, the most exciting new businesses, and the most innovative investors across the private and public sectors.\n\n## Continued progress\n\n2023 demonstrated the ongoing power of this approach as we remained on track for the stretching targets we set ourselves back in 2020. In a challenging economic backdrop, this is testament to our resilience, competitiveness and the power of our synergistic business model.\n\nWe recorded our largest ever PRT volumes in both the UK and the US, including the largest ever single transaction by premium in the market with our buyout of the Boots Pension Scheme. In 2023, 99% of our PRT volumes arose from the conversion of long-standing asset management clients. In a challenging interest rate environment, LGIM continued to expand its client offering and despite significant inflationary impacts, we have taken action to keep absolute costs flat.\n\nOur asset origination business, LGC, showed continued momentum against its five-year targets including significant 'crowding in' third-party capital. In October, we announced that Greater Manchester Pension Fund, the UK's largest local authority pension fund, would invest in our joint venture, Bruntwood SciTech, which is leading the way in providing workspace for innovative UK businesses. We also began construction on our first US investment with our joint venture partner, Ancora, a state health laboratory in Rhode Island.\n\nIn our Retail businesses, our annuities arm delivered its strongest ever results with a record-breaking \u00a31.43 billion in sales under Bernie Hickman's leadership. This reflected our persistence in building our offering throughout a time of lower interest rates. Our workplace pensions business, an increasingly critical part of the long-term savings market, also continues to strengthen. In the US, protection sales hit a record high of $175 million annualised premium equivalent (APE).\n\nFinally, we have seen real successes, working with government, to bring forward policy change to set us up for future growth. In December 2023, we saw the passage of the first phase of Solvency UK reforms into law.

        "page_content": "## Our strategy\n\n## Our strategy is driven by six growth drivers that a/ffect everyone.\n\nIn responding to these long-term drivers, our strategic priorities aim to deliver sustainable pro/fits as well as positive social and environmental outcomes.\n\nOur business model is aligned with our strategy, ensuring we derive maximum bene/fit for our stakeholders.\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance issues are central to inclusive capitalism and are inherent to all six growth drivers.\n\n## Short-term influences Climate change\n\n2023 has been the hottest year on record. We continued to see more extreme weather events, including several episodes of flooding throughout the UK and unprecedented wildfires in Europe, the US and Canada. These events demonstrate the rapid and significant impacts of climate volatility and ecosystem health deterioration. Despite this, 2023 also saw the rapid increase in deployment of solar and wind energy. We are making positive progress against our Climate transition plan, and continue to enhance our risk management framework to ensure our business remains resilient against various climate outcomes.\n\n## Geopolitical landscape\n\nOngoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, along with broader geopolitical tensions, could significantly disrupt global economic activity. We are carefully monitoring these impacts to ensure we remain financially and operationally resilient to adverse events.\n\n## Economic outlook\n\nThe global economic outlook remains challenging. While the market continues to predict falls in interest rates over 2024 supported by an easing of inflationary pressures, other factors may slow this improvement. This may impact consumer sentiment, however we believe that our products and services are relevant across a range of economic scenarios helping our customers to achieve financial security.\n\n## Ageing demographics 1\n\nAs populations live longer, their pensions need to last longer too. Companies increasingly need to find solutions to their ongoing pension commitments. At the same time, individuals need to ensure that their retirement funds and other assets can finance longer retirements.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nWe participate in the global PRT market, focusing on corporate defined benefit (DB) pension plans in the UK, the US, Canada, and the Netherlands, which together have more than \u00a36 trillion of pension liabilities.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nWe aim to be global leaders in pensions de-risking and retirement income solutions. During 2023, we wrote a total of \u00a315.2 billion of bulk and individual annuity business globally, up 44% on the previous year. This included our largest ever single PRT transactions in both the UK and the US markets at \u00a34.8 billion and $0.8 billion respectively, whilst individual annuities increased by 50% over 2022. We also announced plans to enter into a long-term strategic relationship with Dutch insurer Lifetri, putting us in a strong position to capitalise on expected growth in the Dutch PRT market.\n\n## Globalisation of asset markets 2\n\nAsset markets are increasingly globalised and growing. North America, Asia Pacific and Europe are all attractive markets which continue to expand. We look for selective opportunities to build and expand our successful UK business model abroad into markets where we believe we can thrive.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nAs global assets under management are projected to increase from more than $115 trillion in 2022 to $147 trillion by 2027, we will continue to innovate in the US retirement income market, expand into European wholesale asset management and increase our presence in Asia Pacific.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nWe aim to build a truly global asset management business, entering new markets and expanding our existing operations. We continue to expand our global footprint with international AUM growing by 81% since 2018 and now representing 40% of our total AUM. New offices opened in Singapore and Switzerland to support our growth ambition in Asia and Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Regulatory reform is enabling better deployment of pension funds to growth opportunities such as building more homes, creating science parks, and investing in start-up companies.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nBy investing capital over the long term, we aim to become leaders in direct investments, whilst investing our assets in an economically, environmentally and socially useful way. In 2023, we invested over \u00a31.0 billion in housing and over \u00a38.5 billion in social infrastructure. We believe investing to address long term, enduring societal needs will enable strong shareholder returns, as well as improve the lives of our customers.\n\n## Welfare reforms 4\n\nThere is a continued need to protect people from financial uncertainty, which includes helping people take personal responsibility for retirement savings, and safeguarding their financial wellbeing and resilience.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFiscal pressures, inflation and an ageing population are placing the state pension and social security system under strain. This in turn increases the need for individuals to build and maintain their financial wellbeing. Workplace defined contribution (DC) assets are expected to grow to \u00a31.3 trillion by 2032, with a growing need for pension decumulation solutions.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nWe continue to deliver value for money for our Workplace DC members, providing a low-cost pension product to save for their retirement. Our Retirement Planner tool helps customers understand their retirement goals and the launch of our podcast, 'A Little Bit Richer', has improved financial understanding and awareness amongst a younger audience. We also offer a range of wider benefits to help customers manage their physical and mental health and wellbeing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Technological innovation\n\nConsumers, clients and businesses look to digital platforms to help organise their finances and working lives. Technological solutions can increase security and improve the ways we work and access information.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nThe market for new individual term life business in the US is expected to increase to $3.2 billion over the next three to five years. We anticipate continued premium growth across our UK and US protection businesses as technological innovation makes our products more accessible to customers and digital transformation creates competitive advantage in the US marketplace, while enabling further product and pricing enhancements.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nWe will be enhancing our digital capabilities in the UK insurance and grow in the US by expanding into adjacent markets. The US protection grew APE from $129 million to $175 million (a 36% increase) in 2023 creating market differentiation through our US digital platform, as well as digital distribution expansion.\n\n## Addressing\n\n## climate change\n\nTo minimise the most damaging consequences of climate change, governments around the world agree that we must limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. This requires a transition to a low-carbon economy while halting nature and biodiversity loss.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nAs global finance supports the changes our planet needs to address climate change and prevent nature and biodiversity loss, this creates a significant shift in investment allocation and the emergence of new industries in climate solutions. Despite the short-term uncertainty, world leaders at COP 28 reaffirmed their commitment to rapidly expanding investment in renewable energy supply and recognised the need for nature-based solutions.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nWe are able to support the fight against climate change and nature loss through the positioning of our investments, our influence as one of the world's largest asset managers and through the management of our own operational footprint. In 2023, we issued our first Climate transition plan and are now focused on delivering against it.",

        "page_content": "## How did Legal & General approach the volatile economic backdrop across 2023?\n\nOur diversified business model helped us to remain resilient despite the volatile economic environment. The store of future profit (CSM + RA) grew by 9%, while the adjusted operating profit result was flat year on year. Growth opportunities continued, with record volumes across PRT, Retail annuities and US protection.\n\nThe continued higher interest rate environment has created significant opportunity in the PRT and individual annuity businesses, demonstrated by the strong volumes. This was partially offset by the adverse impacts in the investment management business, where the lower fixed income asset values drove a decrease in asset management revenues and therefore lower year-on-year profit.\n\n## You implemented IFRS 17 this year. How did the implementation go and how have analysts and investors responded to this new accounting standard?\n\nIFRS 17 is a new accounting standard effective from 1 January 2023. The standard impacts insurance contracts which, in our case, represents business written through our retirement and insurance businesses. LGIM and LGC are unaffected. As outlined in our half year 2023 presentation, the introduction of IFRS 17 only impacts the timing of profit recognition - the economics of the contract remain the same. There is no change to our dividend capacity (or appetite) and no change to Solvency II capital.\n\nThe implementation has gone well and the response from analysts has been positive, as IFRS 17 introduces a more stable and predictable profit profile through the CSM release. For us, this benefit emerges through the deferral of new business profit and demographic assumption changes to the CSM, which will then be spread and released into profit consistently over the lifetime of the contract.\n\nCSM has grown by 9% to \u00a313.0 billion, with \u00a31.2 billion added from new business in 2023, an increase of c.33%. CSM performance over 2023 reflects the high volume of PRT and protection business written, as well as favourable longevity assumption changes.\n\n## How are you performing against your ambitions?\n\nWe are making good progress against our five-year (2020 - 2024) ambitions. Against a cumulative ambition of \u00a38 - \u00a39 billion, capital generation (Solvency II operational surplus generation) stands at \u00a36.8 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nWith the 2023 interim and final dividend growing by 5%, cumulative dividends declared stand at \u00a34.5 billion at the end of 2023, against an ambition of \u00a35.6 - \u00a35.9 billion over the five-year period. The Board has agreed that it aims to continue to grow the dividend at 5% per annum out to the financial year 2024, which would add an additional \u00a31.3 billion.\n\nWe are also performing well against our ambition for Solvency II net surplus generation (which includes setting up capital for new business) to cumulatively exceed dividends paid over 2020 - 2024. In total, we have created \u00a30.8 billion surplus to the end of 2023. This has not been at the expense of ongoing investment in the business. For example, since 2020, we have written over \u00a340 billion of PRT and individual annuities.\n\nWe remain confident in achieving our ambitions, with our businesses closely aligned to long term and strategic growth drivers, which we expect to persist regardless of any short- or medium-term market volatility.\n\n## The PRT market looks set to continue to grow at pace. What is your outlook/ ambition in this market over the medium term?\n\n2023 has seen a large volume of PRT deals come to market given the favourable conditions. The high interest rates have led\n\nto materially improved funding positions for corporate pension funds, that is to say pension deficits have significantly reduced and, in many cases, have moved to a surplus position. This means that a growing number of corporate pension schemes are able to consider undertaking a de-risking transaction with an insurer much sooner than had been anticipated.\n\nWe are a leader in the UK PRT market, driven by our scale and competitive advantage in creating, sourcing and managing assets with relationships across a large percentage of schemes. This is complemented by a disciplined pricing approach.\n\nWith the acceleration of the UK PRT market, we increasingly consider our ambition of writing circa \u00a38 - \u00a310 billion of PRT a year as 'business as usual'. In 2023, we wrote \u00a312.0 billion of UK PRT business at a Solvency II margin of 7.4%.\n\nWe are also seeing similar PRT market dynamics internationally where we wrote \u00a31.7 billion in 2023. We surpassed $10 billion of total written premium with over 100 deals in the US, since our launch in 2015.\n\n## Your Solvency II coverage ratio is strong - how do you think about capital allocation?\n\nThe strength of our capital position provides us with both a significant buffer, should interest rates fall, and the scope to continue both to invest, so as to ensure the long-term growth profile of the Group, and also to maintain a progressive dividend. We have a number of attractive growth opportunities in which we could continue to invest. These opportunities include the acceleration of the PRT opportunity for LGRI, building out our asset origination capability in LGC, continuing to diversify and internationalise our investment management offering in LGIM, and enhancing our accumulation and decumulation platforms and customer experience in Retail.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This relates to the recognition of a deferred tax asset on inception of the new tax regime and will unwind against future taxable profits in Bermuda.\n\nThe tax credit for the year excluding this one-off credit is \u00a327m. This is explained by the varying rates of tax that we pay on our businesses in different territories and the mixture of profits and losses across those territories. Further explanations of our 2023 tax position can be found in our Tax supplement.\n\n## The tax environment\n\nWith the global economic outlook remaining uncertain as people adapt to higher interest rates and inflation, governments remain focused on both raising revenues and promoting growth across the economy, and the tax regime has a role to play here. In the UK, we've seen a number of changes with these aims in mind including the 'super deduction' being replaced with 'full expensing' of qualifying plant and machinery, changes to the R&D regime and the Lifetime Allowance Notification pension rules, and reductions in the rate of National Insurance for employees. At the same time, the corporate income tax rate has been held at 25% and personal tax thresholds remain frozen. These changes have an impact across our businesses, our investments, our employees and our customers.\n\nNew accounting standards, tax legislation and tax reporting requirements continue to add to the complexities that businesses face.\n\nThe introduction of any new taxes or levies must be clear in its aims and what it is setting out\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTax supplement\n\nOur Tax supplement is available on our Group website. See: group.legalandgeneral.com/reports\n\nWe aim for our tax affairs to be well governed, transparent, and fair to our customers, shareholders, and the public.\n\nYou can read more about our tax strategy, our governance, and what taxes we pay in our Tax supplement, which is approved by the Board and can be found here: group.legalandgeneral.com/reports.\n\nto achieve. This is particularly important where the tax regime is being used to target behavioural change, for example where 'green' taxes are being introduced to incentivise businesses and wider society to adopt environmentally friendly behaviours. We continue to contribute to discussions and research on the tax landscape, prospective changes and active consultations on new legislation and guidance, with a view to the impact across society, our customers and wider stakeholders.\n\nWe recognise that governments, customers, investors, and other stakeholders have justifiably high expectations for compliance, risk management and transparency. Our approach remains consistent with a focus on engaging with all our stakeholders and supplementing our disclosures on tax where we believe this will add value.\n\nOur purpose is to build a better society and make a positive difference to people's lives while delivering value for our shareholders. We believe that paying tax is part of the impact we have on the economy and society and that the tax regime should endeavour to balance the needs of all stakeholders across society, whilst ensuring that policies do not create unintended consequences.\n\nWe monitor risks and complexities across all the territories in which we operate, to ensure we pay the right tax, at the right time, in the right place, consistent with our tax strategy. Further detail on our main risk areas - and how we manage those risks - can be found in our Tax supplement.\n\n## The new global minimum tax regime\n\nDuring the year, the UK Government enacted legislation to apply a global minimum tax rate of 15% to multinational businesses headquartered in the UK, under the Model Rules agreed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). These rules apply from 1 January 2024 and will apply to all of Legal & General's businesses globally.\n\nGrace Stevens Chief Tax Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn December 2023, Bermuda enacted a new corporate income tax regime that will apply from 1 January 2025, with a headline rate of 15%. These are all new rules and additional guidance on the implementation of the new regimes and their interaction is expected and will be kept under review for any impact.\n\nThe Group is expected to be liable to UK top-up tax in 2024 and Bermuda corporate income tax from 2025 in respect of profits arising in our global reinsurance hub in Bermuda.\n\n## Changes to accounting standards impacting the tax we pay\n\nOn 1 January 2023, a new global accounting standard for insurance contracts, IFRS 17, came into effect. IFRS 17 is an accounting change only, which does not change the underlying economics of our insurance contracts. It does not change our strategy, capital generation, solvency or dividend capacity.\n\nThe introduction of this new accounting standard impacts the tax we pay in the UK. This is because the UK tax regime is based on IFRS results for the companies in our Group and we have previously paid tax based on our IFRS 4 results.\n\nAt transition on 1 January 2022, shareholders' equity reduced by c.\u00a35.5 billion. Of this, \u00a35 billion reflects the value taken to the balance sheet under IFRS 17 as part of the CSM, which is expected to emerge as future profit. The remaining balance relates to the implementation of IFRS 9.\n\nThe tax regime requires the reduction in equity on transition to IFRS 17 to be treated as a tax credit, which is spread over 10 years. The credit represents the tax that has effectively been paid in prior years on IFRS 4 profits that, under IFRS 17, will now emerge in the income statement in future years. This ensures the same profits are not taxed twice.\n\nAs a result of the above, our tax payments over the next 10 years will be reduced.",

It is the culmination of a process of reducing investment and longevity risk, which began in 2008.\n\nWith support from Legal & General, the Trustee of the Fund was able to react to changing market conditions and transact at an opportune time.\n\n## Opportunities for small pension schemes\n\nClose to 75% of UK DB pension schemes have assets of \u00a3100 million or less and there is strong demand from these small schemes. We have a streamlined small scheme proposition to make the process more efficient for this area of the market.\n\n## Understanding the risks\n\nTaking on the responsibility for pension scheme liabilities and providing income in retirement transfers pension-related risks to Legal & General. In particular, we take on the risk of higher than expected life expectancy, or that we experience defaults in the investments backing our obligations.\n\nWe remain vigilant to the long-term trends in longevity in our pricing and use reinsurance to manage selected risks. Working with our investment management business's credit and property experts, we continuously assess default risks in our investment portfolio, managing exposures to sectors that may be at risk in the prevailing economic environment and, where appropriate, trading out of positions.\n\nIn February, we agreed a buy-in with the Amey Services section of the Citrus Pension Plan, totalling c.\u00a36.5 million, which secured the benefits of 70 members. This transaction demonstrated our ability to carry out fast and efficient pricing in a busy market as the transaction was completed within eight weeks of the trustee sharing the initial data with us.\n\nIn 2023, we completed 22 transactions under \u00a3100 million, which secured total premiums of \u00a3391 million, underlining our commitment to schemes of all sizes.\n\n## US PRT deals\n\nLegal & General Retirement America (LGRA) reached another milestone this year by crossing $10 billion in total business written and over 100 deals since its inception in 2015. As our US PRT business continues to grow, so does our team, with a new office in Stamford, Connecticut allowing a larger team and greater capabilities.",

Of the nine deals transacted, four were with existing clients, reflecting the financial security and service excellence we provide to sponsors and pension plan members.\n\nAs lead administrator, LGRA also completed two transactions in partnership with Reinsurance Group of America (RGA), insuring c.$350 million of a total c.$1 billion premium and jointly protecting the retirement benefits of more than 6,000 members.\n\n## Other International PRT deals\n\nIn the Canadian market, we have executed a reinsurance transaction of CAD$350 million with a Canadian regulated insurer which brings our total premium to date to over CAD$1.5 billion in Canada. There continues to be significant opportunity in the US and Canadian markets, and we are well positioned to execute deals using our global pensions de-risking expertise.\n\nWe formed a strategic relationship with Lifetri in the Netherlands which presents an exciting opportunity for Legal & General to offer PRT expertise and secure the benefits of more international customers.\n\n## Our wider contribution\n\nWe have a major impact on wider society through the financial security we provide to pension scheme members and the capital we direct to investment assets, but also through the direct contribution our people make to the community. For example, this year LGRA held its first community day with teams in Maryland and Connecticut volunteering\n\nin their local communities to plant trees and clean up a park in partnership with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\n\n## Residential investment in Northern Ireland\n\nThis year, we funded a \u00a3150 million residential development in Belfast, committing to the largest real estate investment in the region for 20 years which will fund the development of 627 new homes. This investment will help address soaring rental demand and drive economic growth in the region.\n\nOn completion, the build-to-rent scheme will be managed by LGIM Real Assets as we continue to support Legal & General's commitment to levelling up towns and cities.\n\n## Leeds city centre\n\nIn April, we agreed to invest \u00a3140 million for a residential development in Whitehall Riverside in Leeds, committing to the delivery of 500 new homes which will again be managed by LGIM Real Assets.\n\nThis marks the third scheme funded by Legal & General in Leeds and will bring the number of new rental homes it has delivered in the City to over 1,000. The development will help residents benefit from growing employment opportunities and strong transport links in the area, showcasing our commitment to delivering positive social outcomes.\n\n## Development and conservation\n\nThis year, we invested in a number of impactful initiatives including a senior secured loan to the Republic of Senegal, where funding will span 45 development projects around health, education and transportation. We invested in a 'debt-fornature' swap (Gabon blue bond) to fund marine conservation in Gabon, aimed at conserving\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe country's biodiversity and environmental capital. We also helped fund the world's largest debt-for-nature swap which is linked to the conservation of the Galapagos Islands, where we were the largest investor in the deal.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe UK PRT market continues to grow, and we expect increasingly large transaction sizes in the future, with projections of \u00a3360 billion of new business to be written over the next five years.\n\nAs we proceed to execute deals globally, we will utilise our PRT expertise to identify and transact on favourable deals both in the UK and abroad as we leverage our international experience and long-term relationships.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are continuing to see an unprecedented acceleration in demand, driven by more pension schemes being closer to buyout than ever before. Against this backdrop, we have posted a record year with \u00a313.7 billion of global PRT written.'\n\n## Andrew Kail\n\nChief Executive Officer, Legal & General\n\nRetirement Institutional\n\n## Investment solutions for large schemes\n\nWorking alongside LGIM, we have developed a range of solutions for pension schemes with illiquid asset holdings that are looking to secure a bulk annuity. This includes accepting assets as part of the premium payment or deferring part of the payment to align with asset sales to provide the potential customer with the most flexible arrangement.\n\nIn 2023, we were able to assist four pensions schemes with illiquid assets using these solutions, allowing them to secure full buy-in transactions within their preferred time frame.",

These partners will gain access to our unique pipeline of assets and investments that create long term, secure income streams, underpinned by societal demand.\n\n## 2023 key activities\n\nIn 2023, LGC's alternative asset portfolio grew as we continued to deploy capital into new and existing investments in the UK and internationally, further strengthening our capabilities across a diversified range of alternative assets that are underpinned by structural growth drivers.\n\nThrough our ability to manufacture bespoke assets tailored to create attractive long-term investments, our unique asset origination capabilities continue to be a key differentiator for our Institutional Retirement business when competing in the PRT market.\n\nSignificant third-party capital was secured by our partnership with Bruntwood SciTech, the UK's leading specialist property provider, as well as Kensa, the UK's leading ground source heat pump provider.\n\n## Specialist commercial real estate\n\nAcross the UK and the US, we are investing in specialist commercial real estate (SCRE), including laboratory and flexible best-in-class facilities for innovation-focused high-growth start-ups, scale-ups and global businesses in the life sciences and technology sectors.\n\nDirect investments \u00a3bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n## Growth drivers\n\n- \u00b7 Ageing demographics.\n- \u00b7 Globalisation of asset markets.\n- \u00b7 Investing in the real economy.\n- \u00b7 Welfare reform.\n- \u00b7 Technological innovation.\n- \u00b7 Addressing climate change.\n\nIn 2023, Bruntwood SciTech, our joint venture with Bruntwood, secured \u00a3500 million of additional investment and welcomed Greater Manchester Pension Fund (GMPF), the UK's largest local authority pension fund, to the partnership. The funds will be used to expand and redevelop existing science and technology campuses and city centre innovation hubs across the UK, facilitating the UK's ambition to become an internationally recognised science and technology superpower by 2030.\n\nLGC's 50:50 partnership with Ancora, a US real estate developer and asset manager dedicated to driving life sciences, research, and technology growth in North America, continues to expand with three sites across the US, providing a valuable ecosystem for universities including Yale, Brown and Georgia Tech, all of which are within close proximity to the sites.\n\nAdditionally, construction of a new 210,000 square feet life-and-health sciences building in Rhode Island is underway. When complete, it will provide essential space for public health services, advancing the state's critical public health and safety goals.

OUD expects to have generated over 1.5 million square feet of life science and university space and 3,000 new homes for the Oxford community. Marking a significant milestone for the partnership during 2023, the 270,000 square feet Life and Mind building and the two 135,000 square feet new Begbroke Science Park buildings reached their halfway point in construction.

In 2023, Kao Data secured a further site in Greater Manchester for redevelopment. As a compelling strategic growth opportunity, we have provided further investment into Kao Data, to facilitate its plans to scale across the UK.\n\nIn January 2024, Kao Data secured a \u00a3206 million debt facility, provided by Deutsche Bank. This further demonstrates its growth from a start-up to a scale-up, its industryleading reputation, and both the scale and demand for world-class infrastructure that is engineered for AI.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Clean energy\n\nWe see a huge market opportunity for reliable and effective solutions to deliver the transition to a low-carbon economy.

As of 31 December 2023, we had invested over \u00a3400 million into clean energy infrastructure and technology.\n\nIn May 2023, Kensa (the UK's leading manufacturer and installer of ground source heat pumps), secured an additional \u00a370 million investment and welcomed Octopus Energy as partners alongside LGC.\n\nRecognising the market opportunity and social benefits that decarbonising residential real estate presents, we have now committed \u00a349 million in a breadth of investments from reducing construction emissions to the technology and support needed to retrofit existing housing stock.\n\n## Understanding the risks\n\nOur third-party capital grew to \u00a318.1 billion in 2023 (2022: \u00a316.6 billion) as we further expanded our portfolio alongside like-minded, purpose-driven capital partners.\n\nOur early-stage investments through Legal & General Capital are inherently exposed to the risk that they do not perform as anticipated. Where we undertake construction activity, we are also directly exposed to health and safety, and environmental risks. We seek to closely manage our real estate and housing market risk exposures, including development costs and changes in property valuations. Site health and safety is a core focus area across all our property development and operating activities.\n\n## Bruntwood SciTech\n\nOur joint venture with Bruntwood stands as a pivotal initiative to reshape the UK's innovation landscape, contributing to the UK's 'levelling up' agenda. Bruntwood SciTech has now attracted an additional \u00a3500 million investment, with the Greater Manchester Pension Fund being the first local authority pension fund to actively participate in a UK-wide science, technology, and innovation property platform.\n\nOver the last five years, Bruntwood SciTech has proven its ability to create places that nurture and grow innovation-based businesses, especially those working within the life science and technology sectors. Now the UK's largest innovation property platform, Bruntwood SciTech aims to create a \u00a35 billion UK-wide portfolio that can support 2,600 high-growth businesses by 2032.\n\nIn our clean energy infrastructure portfolio, we continue to scale our strategic partnership with NTR, leveraging LGIM's distribution capabilities and NTR's sector expertise to raise and deploy significant capital into new and existing renewable energy projects. We provided seed capital to back the first close of the LGIM-managed L&G NTR Clean Power (Europe) Fund, which successfully raised \u20ac390 million in April 2023. This deployment will accelerate the construction and operation of clean power infrastructure, facilitating Europe's decarbonisation and energy security.\n\n## Alternative Finance Venture capital\n\nOur venture capital platform remains committed to investing in innovation and growth companies across the UK and internationally through our Fund of Funds and direct investment programmes as well as our venture capital platform.

Our unique proposition benefits from longstanding relationships with the UK's leading research institutions that help create the outstanding businesses of the future.\n\n## General partner investing\n\nPemberton, our leading European private credit manager, continues to innovate and add new products to its platform, with success in the launches of its European Alternative Credit Fund and Working Capital Finance strategy, which hit the $1 billion of committed funds milestone in 2023. We continue to support the UK and European lending market through Pemberton, which delivered revenue of \u20ac108 million in 2023 (2022: \u20ac99 million), with fee earning AUM of \u20ac13.6 billion (2022: \u20ac12 billion) now deployed across 178 companies.\n\nIn March 2023, we announced our investment in ImpactA Global, a women-led impact asset management firm established to help address the sustainable infrastructure deficit in emerging markets. ImpactA Global will provide debt financing for sustainable infrastructure assets, helping to bridge funding gaps in transformational projects. In October 2023, we committed up to $100 million to support its growth strategies. Our partnership with ImpactA Global is indicative of those we seek through our General Partners Investing Programme due to its close alignment with Legal & General's focus on delivering commercially attractive financial returns alongside creating a positive environmental and socio-economic impact.\n\n## Housing Build to Sell\n\nOur Build to Sell business, CALA, gave a resilient performance in the face of a challenging market, achieving an adjusted operating profit of \u00a3112 million (2022: \u00a3169 million) and delivering 2,917 units.\n\n## Later Living\n\nInspired Villages, our Later Living business, backed by a \u00a3500 million 15-year partnership with NatWest Group Pension Fund, has continued to expand its village offering. In 2023, it opened its ninth village in Millfield Green, Bedfordshire. Significantly, this will be the UK's first operationally net zero retirement community.\n\n## Affordable Homes\n\nOur Affordable Homes business has established itself as one of the UK's leading institutional developers and managers of affordable housing, having increased its total number of homes over 2023 to 4,026, with new builds targeted to be operationally net zero by 2030.\n\n## Modular Homes\n\nIn the first half of 2023, we announced our intention to cease production at our Modular Homes factory. Unfortunately, long planning delays meant that we were not able to secure the necessary scale in our pipeline.\n\n## Traded portfolio\n\nOur diversified traded portfolio has reduced in size after a strategic reallocation of funds in favour of direct investments. This year, the traded portfolio exceeded expectations primarily driven by strong overall market performance across equities, multi-asset and short-dated private credit investments. The traded portfolio helps support the wider Group's sustainability objectives by backing funds that support renewables and clean energy stocks through our Climate Impact Portfolio.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe remain well positioned to drive long-term growth in our diverse portfolio as we continue to scale up our businesses by leveraging our strong balance sheet, pursuing international expansion, and attracting further third-party capital to invest in attractive high-yield opportunities.\n\nThe ambition to build LGC's diversified AUM to c.\u00a35 billion (2023: \u00a34.5 billion) across the UK and internationally by 2025, with a blended portfolio return target of 10% - 12% (2023: 8.7%) continues to progress. For investors looking to access investment classes that create long term, secure income streams that tackle some of the major social, environmental, and economic issues society is facing, Legal & General is an attractive partner.\n\nAs we continue to scale our impact in 2024, we will bring like-minded, purpose-driven capital partners searching for private market solutions to invest alongside us into alternative asset classes and partnerships that drive superior financial returns with positive social and environmental outcomes.",

Against this backdrop, our AUM and consequently operating profit declined. However, asset management is a long-term business and we remain confident in our strategy, which positions LGIM for sustainable future growth.\n\nOur strategy is centred around our three pillars - to modernise, diversify, and internationalise the firm. We've expanded into new markets and have been investing in our capabilities\n\n## 2023 key activities\n\nAgainst the challenging economic backdrop, we are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management whilst continuing to invest deliberately and for the long term. We took expense actions over 2023, including selective reshaping of the workforce and restraint on recruitment and variable compensation. These actions led to lower costs in 2023 compared to the prior year, despite significant inflationary pressure.\n\n## Delivering on Purpose: responsible investing\n\nWe are committed to raising standards at the companies and markets in which we invest, on behalf of our clients, to address the challenges of a rapidly changing world. As at 31 December 2023, we managed \u00a3378.1 billion (2022: \u00a3332.2 billion) in strategies explicitly linked to ESG criteria.\n\nResponsible investing innovation remains core to our product agenda.

Last year, we also added dedicated investment stewardship resource in the Asia region, as we extend our reach and influence.\n\n## Delivering on our strategy\n\nOur strategic pillars of modernising, diversifying and internationalising the business remain a key focus. We continue to make progress on our five strategic growth initiatives (SGIs) to expand our investment offering and build our distribution footprint. Two SGIs are focused on internationalising our business, by expanding in Asia and Europe.

The fund, built in partnership with NTR, a leading renewable energy specialist, is designed for institutional investors with a focus on pension funds, insurers and endowments.\n\nThe partnership demonstrated its potential in July, completing the financing of three Spanish solar projects in partnership with NordLB.

With over 75% of schemes now recognising buy-out as their likely ultimate end state, we expect to increase revenue from providing a full range of investment solutions along the de-risking journey. In the US, improved funding ratios due to higher interest rates have increased demand for customised liability hedging strategies.\n\nGiven our holistic 'One Legal & General' approach, we expect many of our DB clients to choose our institutional retirement business (LGRI) as a PRT partner.\n\n## Diversifying\n\nBy selectively adding to our investment offering, with a focus on higher-margin areas, such as private markets and active fixed income, we are building on our core capabilities to improve the business mix. To meet client objectives, we also are increasingly integrating ESG factors into our portfolios, with around 89% of new pooled products developed in 2023 related to responsible investing.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to focus on attracting business into our smart beta and active capabilities, generating positive flows and annualised net new revenue (ANNR) into exchange traded-funds (ETFs), multi-asset and real assets. Our defined contribution (DC) business continues to attract new assets, also generating positive flows and ANNR in the period, as does our wholesale business, which ended the year with record levels of client AUM of \u00a368 billion.\n\n## Internationalising\n\nWe are continuing to expand beyond the UK, with international AUM having grown by 81%\n\nsince 2018 to \u00a3465 billion, representing 40% of our total AUM.\n\nIn the US, we are a leading corporate pension manager, working with clients to implement pensions de-risking strategies. We have refocused our index capabilities, leading to early success with $8.1 billion (\u00a36.4 billion) in higher-margin index plus mandates in 2023.\n\nIn Europe, AUM increased 11% as we expanded the number of relationships with clients, consultants and intermediaries in our core markets of Germany, Italy, the Nordics and Switzerland.\n\nIn Asia, AUM grew by 12% in the year, with new mandates in Thailand, South Korea and Taiwan. We also opened an office in Singapore to serve clients in the region and to build connectivity with our London and Zurich offices in serving the important global financial institutions channel. In Japan, our AUM has almost doubled since 2019 and we are now Japan's seventh largest asset manager.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe remain confident that our three-pillar strategy positions us well to deliver sustainable future growth. Following the success of the first phase of our strategic target operating model programme, the key foundation of our plan to modernise the business, in 2024 we will build on this success and continue to invest in both our people and technology to lay the foundations towards a wider rollout.\n\nWe will look to build on our successes as part of our diversify and internationalise agenda, expanding into higher-margin product areas and global markets where our strengths best align to client demand, whilst maintaining a sharp focus on our core markets.\n\n## Understanding the risks\n\nWe are exposed to changes in the underlying value of the assets under our management, as a result of either market moves or flows into and out of funds. Operational risk losses can occur where services performed do not meet expectations of clients and regulators. Having a strong control framework within which all our risks are managed is integral to attracting new funds under management, minimising fund outflow and operational errors, and managing regulatory and reputational risks. Our continued investments in systems, processes and people ensures our control environment aligns with risk exposures across our global operating model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe market challenges we've seen over the past year have not changed the fundamentals of LGIM's long-term growth strategy.

Legal & General remains the largest commercial Mastertrust in the UK market, offering members value for money with best-in-class governance.\n\nOur research has shown that younger people have low awareness about their workplace pension. Nearly one in five young people with a workplace pension have no idea how much is being contributed to it each month and a third have never checked how much they are paying in. To help bridge this knowledge gap, we have created a series of engaging content pieces and have launched them on social media platforms in line with our commitment to helping the next generation understand the importance of their financial futures.\n\n## Understanding the risks\n\nAs a provider of life insurance, workplace savings, retirement income and lifetime mortgage products, we make assumptions around changing customer health profiles, consumer behaviours, distribution dynamics and forecast lifespans, as well as economic factors including long-term housing market performance. We use our expertise to understand these risks, and price and underwrite our products to take account of them, where appropriate using reinsurance to manage significant exposures.\n\nIn 2023, we have continued to invest in our pricing and underwriting capability, achieving record annuity sales of \u00a31.4 billion this year. To highlight our commitment to providing excellent service and value, we were 'highly commended' in the Best Annuity Provider category of the Investment Life & Pensions Moneyfacts Awards.\n\nWe appreciate that customers have different retirement plans and have experienced both strong demand for our Lifetime annuities and increased interest in our Fixed-term annuity products, which can provide a bridge to any potential income gap in retirement and give customers financial security.\n\nBuilding on the already successful long-term relationships we have with Aegon and Prudential, we have extended our annuity partnerships with both providers for five years through to 2028, working together to continue helping people plan their finances in retirement.",

PTLM helps borrowers access higher amounts of property wealth by committing to pay interest for an initial term, especially helping customers who need to borrow into retirement and are not well served by existing products.\n\nIn 2023, we enhanced our lifetime mortgage range and made the decision to allow new Flexible Lifetime Mortgage customers to make up to 12 repayments each year, up from four, and make repayments by standing order.

The findings of this IRO assessment were presented to the Group Environment Committee (GEC), one of our senior management committees, in early 2024.\n\nWe concluded that the nine most material sustainability topics identified were, overall, adequately addressed in our strategies.

We recommend that readers who want to understand our approach to the whole range of sustainability issues - environmental, social and governance - read these publications together.\n\nIn this section of our Annual report and accounts , we set out some of the basic reporting that is required under regulation and legislation. Elsewhere in this document, we outline our approach to sustainable business, comment on how our commercial activities have contributed to positive environmental and social outcomes, and describe our governance practices.\n\nOur Climate and nature report , prepared in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), describes our climate and environment strategy, scenario planning, risk management, metrics and governance. This report contains detailed data on our carbon emissions and other environmental metrics.\n\nOur Social impact report describes the commercial and not-for-profit actions we've taken in the reporting year in pursuit of our sustainability areas of focus. It also contains people-related disclosures, including workforce data; diversity and inclusion data and targets; and pay gap information by gender and, for the first time, ethnicity.\n\n## Long-term financial wellbeing\n\nLong-term financial wellbeing is important to us because we want our customers and society to feel financially confident and resilient.\n\nAt a human level, this is about the security of being able to pay the bills today, deal with the unexpected, and take steps to ensure a healthy financial future. Conversely, financial difficulties can affect all aspects of human health, especially when unexpected challenges arise, such as recent cost of living pressures. As a leading insurance and retirement product provider, we influence people's long-term financial wellbeing. We are committed to creating a better financial future for the customers and the communities whom we serve.\n\nOur Retail business offers products, services and tools which support individuals' and society's long-term financial wellbeing. We enhance these with extra services and not-for-profit activities aimed at improving our customers' ability to cope with difficult times, creating additional, targeted value for customers who need it most. We also invest capital in ways which look to generate long-term economic value.\n\nChapter two of our Social impact report gives more detail on this.\n\n## Better communities\n\nAccess to quality jobs, decent housing, thriving communities and economic prosperity are key to helping people live longer, healthier, happier lives. Our Rebuilding Britain Index - which ran from 2021, when the UK and other economies were still firmly in the grip of Covid-19, until May 2023 - showed the scale of the challenge. Among the impacts of the pandemic were a decline in GDP and declining health and educational outcomes, with those communities already experiencing some of the poorest outcomes in the UK being the hardest hit.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "As an investor in towns and cities through our capital and real assets business, as well as a major housebuilder, we have an opportunity to use capital in ways which benefit society.\n\nDuring 2022, we developed a model that we employ throughout the lifecycle of an investment, from design and construction to the asset's impact on end users and surrounding communities. 2023 saw us begin to put its principles into practice: driving not only economic, social, and environmental benefits for the people and communities where we invest, but also helping ensure investments maintain long-term relevance.\n\nChapter three of our Social impact report sets out how we have done this.\n\n## Climate and environment\n\nClimate change is a systemic issue, impacting the economies and societies in which we operate. Addressing it is central to our purpose. We see climate change not only as a risk to be managed, but also as an opportunity to invest in the solutions that society needs to manage the transition to net zero.\n\nWe believe that despite the turbulence of the past five years, addressing climate change is the right thing to do, not just for our business, but for the many different stakeholder groups our business impacts. Therefore, our long-term strategic response does not change in the face of specific short-term shocks.\n\nBy investing our long-term assets to support decarbonisation, we are working to protect our shareholders' and customers' returns while helping to create a more sustainable future.\n\nOur approach to climate change is built on three strategic pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 invest: through reducing the intensity of our financed emissions and through investing in the transition\n- \u00b7 influence: through the products we offer and our engagement with companies, governments and policymakers\n- \u00b7 operate: through our operations, our purchased goods and services, and the businesses we control.\n\nWe believe our strategic response to climate change will support our resilience and allow us to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the transition to a net zero economy. It is set out in full detail in our Climate and nature report and our Climate transition plan, which was presented to, and approved by, our shareholders in 2023.\n\nAs well as our actions to address climate change, we also seek to do business in ways which reduce wider environmental harms, both through our investment policies and strategies in how we operate our business, particularly in the construction field.\n\nOur Climate transition plan is clear that addressing climate change must be pursued in tandem with halting nature and biodiversity loss. During 2023, business and finance increasingly recognised the impacts and dependencies we have on nature. We welcomed the release of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) global framework for nature. We are building our approach to nature on the three pillars of our climate strategy, while recognising the unique challenges involved with integrating nature into decision-making.\n\nFor in-depth information about our performance and plans in these areas, please refer to our 2023 Climate and nature report and our Climate transition plan.\n\n## Engaging customers and employees\n\nThe positive impact a company has on the world remains important for many stakeholders, including customers and employees. Our guiding principle is to create a better society, and value for shareholders, by investing in long-term assets that benefit everyone, from housing to renewable energy. This ethos shapes the way we invest, plan, hire and do business.\n\nWe're a market leader in life insurance, workplace pensions and retirement income, meeting the needs of c.14 million people through our Retail division.\n\nWe employ over 11,500 people globally. Legal & General customers and employees are from all walks of life and many different backgrounds. As a business whose products are so connected to the way people live, we can have a material impact on looking after our vulnerable stakeholders and supporting them during the cost of living crisis.\n\nIn chapters four and five of our Social impact report, we describe the steps we take to engage customers and employees, as well as our control framework which ensures we adhere to high standards in the ways we do business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a global investor, we have a vital role to play in supporting the transition and in helping to protect nature.'\n\n## Carl Moxley\n\nGroup Climate Director\n\nSDG contribution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more on our approach to addressing climate change, read our 2023 Climate and nature report",

Our climate-related opportunities and risks and the time periods to which they are assessed are  described on page 46.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impact on our businesses,  strategy and financial planning         | Based on our scenario analysis, our business model is not expected to be significantly disrupted by climate change, however it does  impact how we execute our strategy. As one of our six strategic growth drivers, we have built a three-pillar approach to address climate  change: how we invest our assets, how we influence as an asset manager and how our businesses operate. Our proprietary model on  climate change is used to quantify the potential impacts of climate change on our portfolio. Page 47 shows our key commitments and  interim milestones under each of these pillars, and descriptions of our climate action statements. |\n| Resilience based on scenarios,  including a 2\u00b0C or lower  scenario | Our climate scenario analysis helps us to identify and quantify the sources and magnitude of potential climate-related risks that will  emerge as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy. We describe our resilience to these scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower  scenario, on page 48, and climate considerations are also highlighted in the Group Board viability statement on page 55.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Governance                                                         | Additional information is provided on pages 26 to 29 of our Climate and nature report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| The Board's role in oversight                                      | The Board is accountable for the long-term stewardship of the Group.

        "page_content": "## A sustainable business continued\n\n## Climate risk management\n\nOur risk management approach to the financial risks arising from climate change reflects our climate strategy, the materiality of the exposures and how we operate. When assessing materiality, we consider both how the Group is affected by climate change, as well as the Group's own impact on the climate.\n\nThe risks arising from climate change to which we are exposed to fall into three broad categories: transition risks, physical risk, and corporate risks. The risks from climate change and nature-loss are far-reaching, uncertain and broad-ranging. As much of our balance sheet is based on assumptions and expectations of future experience, risks can materialise through both actual change in experienced profits or losses, as well as changes in those future expectations.\n\nClimate risk management is integrated into our existing risk and governance framework and have carried out a detailed assessment of how we could expect climate risk to emerge across our business model. Given our business model (see page 12), we assess the most material financial risks from the potential impact of climate change on the value and credit rating of our assets.\n\nTransition risks are primarily measured in relation to our carbon exposures, both for our operational footprint (scope 1 and 2), and of our investment portfolio GHG emissions intensity to align with the 'Paris' objective. We deploy a range of management actions to manage these exposures including: our established framework of climate commitments; exclusions and high-carbon escalation; physical risks controls; review of our existing tolerance framework; and active engagement with investees.\n\n## Internal risk management landscape (risks and strategy)\n\n## External risk management landscape (impacts and considerations)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## External drivers\n\nScientific\n\nunderstanding\n\nPolicy and regulation Market demands\n\nEnvironmental solution innovation\n\nGlobal decarbonisation progress\n\nWeather events\n\nClimate sentiment\n\n## Climate scenario analysis\n\nOur scenario analysis enables us to assess how the impacts from climate change may emerge under a range of climate scenarios and time horizons. Our scenario analysis focuses on the financial risks from climate change, both physical and transitional risks, across our major risk categories of credit, longevity and market risk. We have developed four scenarios:\n\nInaction (approximate warming 3 - 4\u00b0C) - failure to act means emissions continue to grow at historical rates\n\nBelow 2\u00b0C (approximate global warming of less than 2\u00b0C) - immediate ambitious policy and investment actions to address climate change Net Zero 1.5\u00b0C (approximate global warming of 1.5\u00b0C) - immediate, highly ambitious actions to address climate change reduces emissions to net zero by 2050\n\nDelayed Below 2\u00b0C (approximate global warming of less than 2\u00b0C) - policy and investment action to limit warming to well-below 2\u00b0C is delayed to 2030 resulting in much more disruptive change.\n\nScenario results for our Group portfolio are produced for the three pathways which are based on transition risks (Below 2\u00b0C, Net Zero 1.5\u00b0C and Delayed Below 2\u00b0C). We do not apply the inaction scenario to our portfolio. We expect most of the associated impact to be driven by physical risks, which tend to be highly localised and manifest further into the future and are hence more uncertain. As part of our assessment of viability we include the impact of the Group's net zero ambitions, and the Group's ability to adapt its operations and business strategy to address the financial risks arising from both the physical risk of climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. The Board regularly considers the potential financial and reputational impact of the Group's principal risks, which includes failure to respond to the emerging threats from climate change for our investment portfolios and wider businesses.\n\nThe nature of our business means we have identified four broad mitigations to our transition risk exposure.\n\n- 1.  Our exposure is largely through financial assets, many of which are listed, so we have significant flexibility to adapt by trading to the desired carbon position. This is the expected outcome should active engagement fail.\n- 2.  We hold mainly investment grade bonds, which are matched against liabilities such that we are not materially exposed to price risk compared to investors who regularly trade their bond portfolios or those holding greater exposures to equities.\n- 3.  We continue to carefully manage our balance sheet and our credit portfolio. We continually analyse our credit exposures and where appropriate, seek out opportunities to improve credit quality at attractive pricing levels. We have incorporated climate considerations within our credit and market risk management and expect these to develop over time. We manage our transition risk from climate change through setting our portfolio decarbonisation targets. These pre-emptive management actions are expected to reduce the credit risk of the portfolio and are expected to reduce the impact of the credit stresses presented in these scenarios. Our decarbonisation strategy also covers our equity portfolio.\n- 4.  The balance sheet is well-diversified across different sectors of the economy. Our initial assessment of our implied portfolio temperature alignment indicates that we do not have an over-weight allocation to the highest carbon intensity names within the market sectors.\n- See our 2023 Climate and nature report for additional information.",

Legal & General is no exception. Our impact is far reaching, and strong business ethics are central to making that impact positive.\n\nGoverning our business in a responsible manner is part of our promise to stakeholders, including our employees. Therefore, we hold ourselves and our employees to high standards of conduct. Our culture is all-important, and it plays a role in attracting and retaining employees who have the skills and motivation to do excellent work for our stakeholders.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion (D&I) Our commitment and strategy\n\nAddressing the challenges identified in our Group strategic growth drivers (see pages 10 and 11) requires us to build a culture which fosters collaboration, constantly improves employees' decision making, and moves quickly to solve problems in innovative ways. We believe that diversity of experience brings diversity of thought and perspective, which in turn drives greater proximity to customers, better-informed decisions, and a culture which more readily embraces innovation.\n\nOur D&I strategy, which seeks to build such a culture, has been in place for two years. We have strong foundations, built on a muchimproved understanding of our people's lived experience and of our organisational culture.\n\n## Our focus\n\nThrough our D&I strategy, we have committed to two outcomes: a more diverse workforce and a more inclusive culture.\n\nWe have three strategic priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 recruit and retain diverse talent\n- \u00b7 invest in line manager capability\n- \u00b7 create opportunities for everyone at Legal & General.\n\nWe measure our success by tracking data about the representation of minority or underrepresented groups at various levels of seniority in our business. We also use data from our listening programmes, such as our Voice survey, to inform our understanding.\n\nWe have set certain representation goals which we publish externally. We believe that the actions taken to increase the diversity of our workforce will, in time, have the effect of progressively narrowing pay gaps because they are aimed at improving representation.\n\nFor more on our strategy, objectives and performance, please see chapter six of our 2023 Social impact report.\n\n## Our goals\n\nWe remain committed to our goals for improving representation of people from minority or underrepresented groups in our organisation. Importantly, this applies at all levels of the Company.\n\n| Goal                                                        | Target  date   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------|--------|\n| 50% of workforce  to be female                              | 31 Dec  2025   | 46.5%  | 45%    |\n| 17% of workforce  to be from ethnic  minorities             | 31 Dec  2027   | 16.9%  | 16%    |\n| 40% of senior roles  held by women                          | 31 Dec  2025   | 37.2%  | 38%    |\n| 17% of senior roles  held by people from  ethnic minorities | 31 Dec  2027   | 17.3%  | 17%    |\n| 40% of Board roles  held by women                           | 31 Dec  2025   | 42%    | 42%    |\n| 17% of Board roles  held by people from  ethnic minorities  | 31 Dec  2027   | 25%    | 25%    |\n\n## Our performance: pay gap data\n\nIn 2023, we saw a slight widening of our median gender pay gap , from 22.4% to 23.6%, the first such year-on-year widening since we began to report pay gap data. We remain committed to a progressive narrowing of the gap as a consequence of our ambition of increased representation of women in senior roles.\n\n2023 saw us publish our ethnicity pay gap data for the first time. We have a negative median gap of -32.1%, meaning that the median pay for individuals from an ethnic minority background is, in aggregate, higher than that of our white employees.\n\nFor more information on our pay gaps, including commentary and our full statutory gender pay gap disclosure, please see chapter six of our 2023 Social impact report.\n\n| Gender  pay gap   | 2023   Mean   | 2023  Median   | 2022   Mean   | 2022  Median   |\n|-------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Hourly pay        | 21.3%         | 23.6%          | 20.9%         | 22.4%          |\n| Bonus             | 45.4%         | 41.2%          | 48.5%         | 37.6%          |\n\n| Ethnicity   | 2023   | 2023      |\n|-------------|--------|-----------|\n| pay gap     | Mean   | Median    |\n| Hourly pay  | -9.8%  | - 3 2 .1% |\n| Bonus       | 9.4%   | -15.7%    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe remain committed to delivering on our workforce diversity goals.

We do this in several ways, with the insights we gain informing the actions we take.\n\nDuring 2023, through our Voice survey, we requested feedback from our entire permanent employee base on two occasions. Voice measures employee sentiment on a range of issues and the data gathered are an important indicator of organisational culture. Employee satisfaction in September 2023 was 79, up one point year-on-year and four points above the industry benchmark. This was based on a 79% response rate.\n\nWhile there is always further progress to be made, overall the strong score in satisfaction, along with a score of 81 on 'intent to stay', were particularly reassuring given the challenges in attracting talent in current markets.\n\nPlease see pages 36 and 37 of our Social impact report for more information on how we engage our people, including information on collective bargaining arrangements, and more detail on the findings of our Voice surveys and other engagement mechanisms used in 2023.\n\n## Development\n\nWe are committed to providing our employees with opportunities to enhance their skills, enabling our business to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving world. Our approach to development is to enable employees to perform in their roles today, develop their skills for the future, and connect with the developmental content and experiences to help keep these skills relevant.\n\nIn 2023, we invested over \u00a35.3 million in people development. We offer targeted development opportunities for all employees, for managers and for senior leaders. These are delivered through a blend of in-house and external training opportunities.\n\nWe focused on:\n\n- \u00b7 enhancing learning accessibility: simplifying our core programmes and making it easy for our people, regardless of location, to identify what's relevant to them and how to access it. This included running sessions virtually and in-person and across multiple time zones\n- \u00b7 increasing our 'in-the-moment-of-need' learning offerings: providing easy access to content such as videos, top tips and how-to guides, which are quick to digest and simple to apply in order to help our people perform when they need it most\n\n- \u00b7 investing in our senior leaders via a new executive development programme called Leading through Connection\n- \u00b7 helping our people to develop their understanding and use of our behaviours, in support of our culture and of individual performance.\n\nPlease see page 38 of our Social impact report for more information on our approach to learning and development.\n\n## Employee wellbeing\n\nWe are committed to protecting the physical, mental, financial, and social wellbeing of our employees. We want to create a healthy and safe organisation that brings together healthy people and healthy work, fostering a positive work culture, improving morale and benefiting both our people and our Company.\n\nWe take our employees' safety, wellbeing and ability to thrive at work extremely seriously. We recognise the importance of 'psychological safety' - creating a safe and open environment where people can be themselves - in achieving this.\n\nJeff Davies, our Chief Financial Officer, was named as our executive sponsor for wellbeing and mental health during 2021, with accountability for our strategy in this area. He remained in this role throughout 2023.\n\nDuring 2023, we developed a new strategy for employee wellbeing, based on the importance of resilience. We believe resilience forms the foundation of wellbeing and that one of the best ways we can support our people is by helping them to build and maintain their resilience. As a more resilient firm, we can respond to change faster while ensuring we continue to deliver for our stakeholders.\n\nOur strategy is based on data about our workforce's needs, gathered through sources including employee surveys and sickness data. We use this to define our approach to promoting better employee wellbeing and in designing services and benefits for our people.\n\nWe continue to offer such services and benefits across mental, physical, social and financial wellbeing. A full list of these, as well as more detail on our wellbeing strategy, can be found on pages 39 to 41 of our Social impact report.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nThe operation of our core offices is managed through a health and safety system aligned with ISO45001 and our offices are audited by a leading health and safety consultancy.

The statement covers, among other matters, how we assess modern slavery and human rights risk in our operations and value chain; the due diligence we perform; and our policies and practices.\n\nWe are committed to maintaining high standards when it comes to the protection of human rights - including a commitment to play our part in eradicating modern slavery.\n\nWe base our approach on standards set by various bodies, including the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, the Gangmaster and Labour Abuse Authority, the Living Wage Foundation and the Ethical Trading Initiative.\n\nIn 2023, we undertook work in several areas to improve our management and mitigation of modern slavery and human rights risk. We:\n\n- \u00b7 joined the UN Global Compact's Modern Slavery Working Group, enabling us to undertake further training on this topic and learn from peers in the industry\n- \u00b7 became a member of Unseen, a UK charity that supports survivors of trafficking and modern slavery as well as providing expert support\n- \u00b7 focused our activity on training; securing external counsel and support; and undertaking audits across our owned and managed sites, looking for evidence of any breaches of modern slavery and human rights.\n\nPlease see our human rights policy and our 2023 Modern slavery statement for more information about our approach.\n\n## Our supply chain\n\nWe have a complex global supply chain and understand that our actions have far-reaching consequences. We recognise the importance of balancing financial considerations with promoting sustainability both within our operations and within our supply chain.\n\nOur procurement approach allows us to engage with our supply chain effectively and fairly, in a manner that manages risk and promotes value in the best interests of our customers, employees, regulators and shareholders. As part of that framework, our contracts set out the commercial and legal parameters of our engagements with our suppliers, including compliance with laws and regulations, and provisions to ensure continuity of services and the security of data.\n\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct sets out our ambition and defines how we expect our suppliers to play their part. The Code focuses on areas like wages, environment and climate change, human rights and modern slavery, and diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nWe continuously adapt our practices to align with evolving sustainability expectations and requirements. We modify supplier evaluation and monitoring processes to ensure compliance with our sustainability standards. This includes assessing suppliers' environmental practices, labour conditions and adherence to human rights principles. Through regular audits and assessments, we aim to maintain a responsible and ethical supply chain.\n\nFor more information on how we manage our supply chain to promote sustainability, please see page 47 of our 2023 Social impact report.\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption\n\nWe will not tolerate any person acting on behalf of the Group participating in any form of corrupt practice, including the acceptance, promise, offer or giving of anything that may be considered a bribe. Our financial crime risk policy applies across the Group and mandates that controls are put in place to prevent and detect such activity.\n\nControls include an annual bribery and corruption risk assessment; regular training; due diligence measures; reporting of suspicions of bribery and corruption; and the control and approval of giving and receiving of gifts and hospitality, political and charitable donations, and corporate sponsorship.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Modern slavery statement\n\nOur Modern slavery statement is available on our Group website. See: group.legalandgeneral.com/ ModernSlavery2023\n\n## Non-financial and sustainability information statement\n\nUnder sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 2006, we are required to include in our Strategic report a non-financial and sustainability information statement.\n\nThis section of the Strategic report (pages 40 to 51) provides the following information required to be included in the non-financial and sustainability information statement:\n\n- \u00b7 environmental matters\n- \u00b7 our employees\n- \u00b7 social matters\n- \u00b7 human rights\n- \u00b7 anti-corruption and bribery.\n\nIn addition, other required information can be found on the following pages:\n\n- \u00b7 business model (pages 12 to 15)\n- \u00b7 principal risks and how they are managed (pages 52 to 59)\n- \u00b7 non-financial key performance indicators (page 44)\n- \u00b7 Climate-related financial disclosures align to the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) requirements (pages 45 to 48).\n\nDetails of relevant policies, due diligence processes and the outcome of these policies and processes, are contained throughout the Strategic report.\n\nOur non-financial and sustainability information statement focuses on the stakeholders and issues that are important for us to deliver on our purpose of inclusive capitalism.\n\nSDG contribution\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our risk management approach supports informed risk taking by our businesses, setting out those rewarded risks that we are prepared to be exposed to, together with risk limits and required standards of internal control to ensure exposures remain within our overall risk appetite.\n\nAs well as managing financial and non-financial risks to our businesses, our risk framework considers broader factors including the delivery of good customer outcomes and the threats from climate change. In focusing beyond pure financial measures of risk, we enable our businesses to fulfil their social purpose.\n\nOur risk section is organised into the following subsections:\n\n## Our risk landscape\n\nThe risks that are inherent in our business arising from:\n\n- \u00b7 the products we write\n- \u00b7 the investments we hold to meet our obligations\n- \u00b7 the business environment in which we operate.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nOur quantitative and qualitative expressions for the types of risk to which we are prepared to be exposed.\n\nAlongside the minimum capital requirements that we wish to maintain and the degree of volatility of earnings we wish to avoid, we set a range of tolerances and limits for our material financial and non-financial risk exposures.\n\nWe seek to deeply embed the necessary capabilities to assess and price for those risks that we believe offer sustainable returns within each of our operating businesses, as well as ensuring the skill sets to closely manage those risk factors which could otherwise lead to unexpected outcomes.\n\nOur straightforward, collaborative and purposeful behaviours underpin the operation of our risk framework, and support a culture of openness and transparency in how we make decisions and manage risks, balancing performance with principles to do what is right.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nOur formal framework for monitoring our risk landscape and ensuring that we are only exposed to those residual risks for which we have an appetite.\n\nOur framework seeks to reinforce the parameters of acceptable risk taking, allowing business managers to make decisions and take opportunities that are consistent with our risk appetite.",

        "page_content": "## Our risk landscape\n\nOur risk landscape comprises asset, insurance, non-financial and strategic risks. Our largest risk exposures, measured by undiversified solvency capital, are to credit and longevity.\n\n## Asset risks\n\nMarket, credit and counterparty risks arise from holding portfolios of assets, including property, to meet our obligations to our customers and to deliver returns to shareholders. Liquidity risks also arise from holding illiquid assets and from investment market conditions. Interest rates and inflation are also risk factors.\n\nCredit risk largely arises in our portfolio of corporate bonds and within our direct investment portfolio. As an investor for the long term, assessing and managing credit risk is a core competency, and alongside setting a range of tolerances to diversify our portfolios, we seek to continuously track a variety of risk factors that could adversely impact credit markets.\n\n## Insurance risks\n\nLongevity, mortality and other insurance risks are transferred to us by the customers of our PRT, individual annuities and protection businesses. The period that customers continue their policies is also important for profitability, as is our ability to control expenses in line with pricing assumptions.\n\nLongevity risks arise in our PRT and retail annuity businesses. Over the years we have built significant expertise in understanding and pricing for longevity, with a range of disciplines including actuarial, medical, public health, statistical analysis and modelling. Mortality, morbidity and policy lapse are inherent risks to our protection businesses, which we assess and price for.\n\nOur risk management approach\n\nSee page 54\n\n## Non-financial and strategic risks\n\nNon-financial risks arise in respect of our business processes and IT systems, as well as broader regulatory and legislative risks that can arise in the environments in which we operate. All our businesses have inherent exposure to non-financial risk.\n\nOur risk management and internal control framework seeks to identify areas of potential weakness that could otherwise lead to customer detriment, reputational damage or financial loss and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to mitigate adverse outcomes.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nOur risk appetite sets the ranges and limits of acceptable risk taking for the Group as a whole. We express our overall attitude to risk using the statements and measures in the table opposite.\n\nBeneath this, we set further risk tolerances covering our specific exposures to market, credit, insurance, and operational risks including, where appropriate, limits on concentrations and significant aggregation of risks. Our risk appetite is used to govern the nature and quantity of risks that we are exposed to.\n\nWhether we are making a direct property investment or pricing a PRT deal, we use our risk management framework to assess the risk profile and potential rewards to ensure we continue to operate within the ranges of acceptable risk taking that we have set.\n\nWhere our businesses directly engage in house building and property development, we are exposed to risks associated with the management of construction projects, including health and safety risks. Alongside construction-related risks, wider safety risks arise in the operation of retirement villages and our affordable homes businesses. The management of health and safety and the broader risks of building safety are an integral part of our wider risk framework, with expertise in risk management embedded across our business operating model.\n\n| Strategy                | We manage a diversified portfolio in which we accept risk in the normal course of  business and aim to deliver sustainable returns on risk-based capital in excess of the  cost of capital.

The process, which covers the whole Group, considers how the financial and broader business risks to which we are exposed may evolve over the planning cycle. Stress and scenario testing is an essential element of the ORSA process. It is used to show us how key risk exposures respond to different risk factors, together with the sensitivity and the resilience of capital and earnings to a range of extreme but plausible events. The stress testing component of our framework assesses the effect of a move in one or more risk factors at a point in time. The scenario element considers group-wide multi-year projections of capital and earnings across a range of downside conditions in financial markets, demographics and the broader economy. The ORSA process is integrated into our business risk and capital management activities and aligned with the strategic planning process to inform forwardlooking decision making. As such, it is a key business management tool.\n\n## Capital management\n\nOur risk-based capital model seeks to provide a quantitative assessment of the Group's risk exposures. It forms part of the suite of tools we use to evaluate our strategic plans, set risk appetite, allocate capital and evaluate product pricing. Our model is also used to assess significant transactions, including large PRT deals.",

This reflects the Group's business and investment models which combine managing credit, longevity and market risks over long-term relationships.\n\n## The Group's long-term prospects\n\nThe Group's prospects are primarily assessed through our strategic and planning processes. Performance against our annual strategic planning process is continuously monitored, and it underpins our business planning model. We consider the sustainability and resilience of our business model over the long-term, including the strategic growth drivers detailed on pages 10 and 11, and longer-term trends in areas such as technology and climate change, as our investment and insurance products and customer relationships are long-standing ones.\n\nThe Group is also subject to regulation and supervision, which requires us to manage and monitor solvency, liquidity and longer-term risks, to ensure that we can continue to meet our policyholder obligations.\n\nThis long-term prospect assessment is over a longer period than that over which the Board has assessed the Group's viability.\n\n## Period of viability assessment\n\nWhile the Board has considered adopting a longer period, it believes that five years is the most appropriate time frame over which they should assess the long-term viability of the Group, as required within provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The following factors have been taken into account in making this decision:\n\n- \u00b7 we have reasonable clarity over a five-year period, allowing an appropriate assessment of our principal risks to be made\n- \u00b7 the assessment is underpinned by our business planning process, and so aligns to the period over which major strategic actions are typically delivered, and takes account of the economic environment and evolving political and regulatory landscape during the relevant period.\n\nOur business planning process is an annual process and culminates in the production and review of the Group's business plan. Our plan is built up from divisional submissions, and considers the profitability, liquidity, cash generation and capital position of the Group. This projection process involves setting a number of key assumptions, which are inherently volatile over a much longer reporting period, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, economic growth rates, the continued optimisation of capital strategies for Solvency II, and the impact on the business environment of changes in regulation or similar events.\n\nThe Board carries out a detailed review of the draft plan during the Group Board's annual strategy assessment, and amendments are made accordingly. Part of the Board's role is to consider the appropriateness of any key assumptions made. The latest annual plan was approved in December 2023, resulting in our current five-year business plan.\n\n## How we assessed our viability\n\nIn making its assessment of viability, the Board has considered a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 a robust and detailed assessment of the Group's risk profile and both material and emerging risks (see below for further detail), in particular those risks which could have a material impact on the Group's future operations, financial conditions or regulatory expectations\n- \u00b7 the impact of various stress scenarios on both the Group's viability (see further detail below), as well as the operational resilience of the Group\n- \u00b7 the stability of major markets in which the Group operates and material known regulatory changes\n- \u00b7 the sustainability of any future capital distributions\n- \u00b7 the impact of the Group's net zero ambitions, and the Group's ability to adapt its operations and business strategy to address the financial risks arising from both the physical risk of climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nThe Board regularly considers the potential financial and reputational impact of the Group's principal risks (as set out on pages 56 to 59) on our ability to deliver the business plan, and we regularly review and refresh our principal risks to reflect current market conditions and changes in our risk profile. In its assessment of viability, not just long-term prospects, the Board has taken into consideration all of the Group's principal risks, as any significant change in the risk profile or outlook of those principal risks, or inadequate mitigation, could have a significant impact on the Group's viability over the assessment time frame.\n\nQuantitative stress and scenario testing is undertaken to enable the Board to consider the Group's ability to respond to a number of plausible individual and combined shocks, both financial and non-financial, which could adversely impact the profits, capital and liquidity projections in the Group plan. For example, during 2023, the Board considered the impacts of a severe market event. The severe market event was set with reference to the Bank of England's latest 'Annually Cyclical Scenario', but modified to reflect the Group's underlying risk profile.\n\nThe scenario is broadly based on the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 for market risks exposures and 2002 experience for rating transitions (downgrades and spreads).\n\nThe scenarios tested showed that the Group would continue to have sufficient headroom to maintain viability over the five-year planning period, after taking into account mitigating actions to manage the impacts on capital and liquidity. The Group maintains buffers and a suite of management actions to maintain resilience to adverse scenarios and preserve the Group's viability. It is clearly possible that shocks could be more severe, occur sooner and/or last longer than we have currently considered plausible.\n\nAdditionally, reverse stress testing and contingency planning gives the Board a solid understanding of the Group's resilience to extremely severe scenarios which could threaten the Group's business model and viability. This analysis assists in identifying any mitigating actions that could be taken now, or triggers to put in place for future actions. Potential scenarios that were explored included severe capital market stresses, adverse regulatory changes, reputational and internal or external events causing falls in business volumes, and severely adverse claims experience. The results confirmed that the Group remains resilient to extreme stresses as a result of the risk management system in place and the diverse range of mitigating actions available, including raising of capital or reduction in the level of dividends.\n\n## Our conclusion on viability\n\nFollowing this assessment, taking into account the Group's current position and principal risks, the Board can confirm that it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, over a viability horizon of five years. The Board's five-year viability and longer-term prospects assessment is based upon information known today.",

        "page_content": "## Letter from the Chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDear shareholders,\n\n## Introduction\n\n2023 has been another year where the Board's role in monitoring and managing emerging risks in the macro-economy, and in markets, has been critical. The UK has continued to face a number of challenges and global market conditions have continued to be volatile during the period. Throughout this, Legal & General has remained robust and resilient, and we have much to be positive about going into 2024.\n\nAs a Board we remain confident in our strategy and in our ability to deliver resilient growth, supported by our strong competitive positioning in attractive and growing markets. Our strategy positions us well to navigate the prevailing market environment. We are confident we can continue to deliver profitable growth as we execute on our strategy and deliver on our purpose to improve the lives of our customers, create value for our shareholders and build a better society.\n\nOur 2023 half year results were the first under a new accounting standard for insurance contracts. IFRS 17 was first conceived in the late 90s, but for most insurers significant work started in earnest in 2017. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone that contributed\n\nto the IFRS 17 programme across the Company. More detail on the implementation of this standard can be found in the Audit Committee report on pages 86 to 91.\n\nAs shareholders will be aware, in January 2023, Sir Nigel Wilson informed the Board of his intention to retire from executive life after 14 years with Legal & General, 11 of those years as Group Chief Executive Officer. Nigel's achievements over those years, and the leadership qualities he brought to the Company, are immense. Nigel has successfully navigated significant geopolitical changes as well as challenges in the regulatory and market environments of each of our core businesses and has steered the Group into a position of strength from which it can continue developing on behalf of its shareholders, customers and people. These achievements were rightly recognised, not only by Nigel's knighthood, but also when we were voted Britain's Most Admired Company by our fellow FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies last year. Under his stewardship, the Group has consistently delivered profitable, sustainable and inclusive growth. Nigel has been a tireless champion for investment-led growth and responsible investment. On behalf of the Board, I thank Nigel for his significant contribution and leadership of the Company and wish him well for the future.\n\nFollowing Nigel's decision to retire from executive life, the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee led a rigorous, global, selection process which led to the appointment of Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es, who joined us on 1 January 2024. I look forward to working with Ant\u00f3nio over the coming years. Further detail on the selection process can be found in the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee report on page 81.\n\nAs a Board we continue to oversee and test the Company's strategy. The development and delivery of that strategy falls to our executive colleagues, led by our new Group Chief Executive Officer, Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es, our Group Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Davies, and the heads of our four business divisions: Laura Mason, Andrew Kail, Michelle Scrimgeour and Bernie Hickman, each in turn supported by their management teams.\n\nThey are highly effective, individually and collectively, and there were a number of major successes across the Company during the period, which you will read about throughout this report. Our divisions work best when they work together: Legal & General Capital (LGC) creates real assets to support the\n\nLegal & General Retirement Institutional (LGRI)\n\nbuy-out deals and fund annuities.

        "page_content": "(LGIM) helps clients de-risk in preparation for buy-out - the majority of LGRI clients have been LGIM clients first. We are also a UK market leader in Retail for life insurance, workplace pensions and retirement income, and our divisions continue to work together to drive synergies to help us maintain excellent customer service, competitive market positions and business growth. Our collegiate and collaborative approach is crucial for maximising opportunities.\n\nI would also like to note the opening of Calon, our new office in Cardiff. 'Calon' translates to 'Heart' in English and was chosen as the preferred name in a vote by our employees. The development of Calon and the wider investment into the Central Square of Cardiff has drawn upon the input of many key stakeholder groups. In addition to surveying our own people to understand their requirements, Legal & General fostered close relationships with local partners, suppliers and communities throughout the development process to ensure that the investment in the office benefits the local community as well as our employees. The office has been designed to operate with a lower carbon footprint than a standard office and is a key milestone towards Legal & General's commitment of achieving net zero carbon emissions from our occupied offices (where we control the management of utilities) by 2030. More information about Calon can be found on page 77.\n\n## Our approach to governance\n\nAs a Board, it is our role to promote the highest levels of corporate governance and ensure these values are embedded within our culture and throughout the organisation. As our business continues to evolve and as we pursue our strategic objectives in an ever-changing environment, our strong governance framework supports the Board in ensuring that across the Group we make decisions in the right way. The Board has worked closely with the executive team throughout the year as the business has continued to navigate the challenges presented by volatile market conditions to ensure our business can continue to flourish.\n\nAhead of 2024, a group-wide project was initiated which has led to the optimisation of our executive decision making across the Group through the implementation of a new executive governance framework, which took effect from 1 January 2024. More information on this new enhanced framework can be found on page 66.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023, we were required to measure ourselves against the Code. The Board has considered carefully the requirements of the Code and I am pleased to report that we have complied with all provisions of the Code throughout the year.\n\nFurther details on our compliance with the Code and how we have applied the various principles can be found on page 67.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nAs a Board, we are very focused on the impact that our business and decisions have on our stakeholders, as well as our wider societal impact. Our stakeholders are key to our decision making and it is hugely informative for us to hear the viewpoints from a variety of parties with an interest in the Company. We were able to conduct a number of face-to-face interactions this year, including site visits to our offices in Hove and Cardiff. I am always impressed during our Board site visits how evident our purpose is and how our values are demonstrated every day in ensuring we are doing the right thing for our customers. I would like to thank all of our colleagues for their significant contribution to our business. Through their roles as Designated Workforce Director and Consumer Duty Champion, non-executive directors Nilufer von Bismarck and Laura Wade-Gery have also conducted a number of meetings and site visits. We view these visits as an important way to meet with our partners and employees and experience Legal & General's culture first hand.\n\nWe presented our Climate transition plan at our 2023 AGM, and I was pleased this was supported by 97.7% of our shareholders. The Climate transition plan sets out our climate commitments and how we plan on achieving them. We spoke with a range of our major institutional investors about the plan who provided useful feedback during its development. Our Climate transition plan details how we are going to make our ambitions a reality, organised under three pillars: invest, influence and operate. It is important that we make our plans for addressing climate change public and ensure that our shareholders are supportive of them. More about our progress against the Climate transition plan can be found on page 43.\n\n## Board changes and succession planning\n\nLegal & General continues to benefit from an outstanding Board with a diverse range and depth of expertise and skills.\n\nThe Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee spent a considerable amount of time this year focusing on executive succession planning, particularly in relation to the Group Chief Executive Officer. Each year, the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee also considers the Board's skills and experience to support discussions around non-executive succession planning, which once again was a focus for the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee in 2023. In September 2023, Lesley Knox succeeded\n\nPhilip Broadley as the Board's Senior Independent Director. Philip remains a non-executive director of the Company and as a member of all five of its Committees. In February 2024, Laura Wade-Gery succeeded Lesley Knox as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. Lesley remains as a member of the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n\nThe 2024 AGM will be held on Thursday 23 May at 11am at the British Medical Association, BMA House, Tavistock Square, Bloomsbury, London WC1H 9JZ, once again in a hybrid format, with additional facilities for shareholders to join and vote electronically. Full details of the business to be considered at the meeting will be included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting that will be sent to shareholders by their chosen communication means and published on our website: group. legalandgeneral.com/AGM.\n\n## Board effectiveness\n\nDuring 2023, we conducted an external effectiveness review of our Board and its Committees. Following a tender process, Clare Chalmers Limited was appointed as the preferred provider to facilitate the review, which consisted of one-to-one interviews with Board members and observations at a series of Board and Committee meetings. The output of this review was considered by the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board, and I am pleased to report that the conclusion was that the performance of the Board and each of its Committees continues to be highly-rated. Further details of the process and outcome of the external evaluation can be found on pages 84 to 85.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow Board members and colleagues at Legal & General for their dedication to the business and our customers. I have confidence that in the coming years Legal & General will continue to adapt, and grow, thanks to our greatest asset, our people.\n\nSir John Kingman Chair\n\n<!-- image -->",

The role of the Board is to promote the long-term sustainable success of the Company, whilst simultaneously generating value for shareholders and contributing to wider society; how the Board achieved this throughout 2023 is outlined in greater detail in our s.172 statement on pages 76 to 78. The Board is committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance across the Group to support the delivery of our strategy, the fostering of positive stakeholder relationships and the creation of long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.\n\nThe specific parameters of the Board's role and responsibilities are set out in the Matters Reserved for the Board and are separated into eight categories:\n\n- \u00b7 strategy and management\n- \u00b7 structure and capital\n- \u00b7 financial reporting and dividends\n- \u00b7 risk and internal control\n- \u00b7 corporate governance\n- \u00b7 key personnel and remuneration\n- \u00b7 product distribution and pricing\n- \u00b7 brand.\n\nThe Matters Reserved for the Board outline the decision-making powers reserved for the Board and underpins the governance framework across the Group. It is reviewed and approved as part of an annual corporate governance review, and otherwise as required, to ensure the role and responsibilities of the Board remain appropriate and up to date.\n\nThe Board, as well as the boards of the Group's principal subsidiaries, operate within a clearly defined, and fully embedded, delegated authority framework. The delegated authority framework ensures that there is an appropriate level of Board oversight of, and contribution to, key decisions and that the day-to-day business is managed effectively. It also enables an appropriate level of debate, challenge and support in the decision-making process.\n\nThose matters which are not reserved for the Board's consideration are delegated by the Board to Group-level Committees and the Group CEO. The Board has delegated the day-to-day management of the Company, and the responsibility of the successful execution of the strategy, to the Group CEO. Throughout 2023, the Group CEO, Sir Nigel Wilson, delegated further decision making onward to the Group Capital Committee, an executive decision-making forum, as well as to his direct reports. Following the appointment of Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es as Group CEO on 1 January 2024, a new governance framework has been implemented. Further information on the changes is outlined on page 66. Although the Board delegates the day-to-day management of the Company, it is accountable for the long-term sustainable success of the Company and must continue to oversee the Group's strategic objectives and monitor performance against those objectives. The Board meets formally on a regular basis and at each meeting considers business performance, strategic proposals, material transactions and critical projects in the context of the Group's strategy, risk appetite, the interests of the Group's stakeholders and our wider social purpose.\n\nThe Board is supported in its work by its Committees, each of which is governed by its own terms of reference, which clearly outline its remit and decision-making powers. The Committees of the Board, and their core responsibilities, are set out in the governance framework outlined on page 67, and each of the respective Committee reports on pages 79 to 119.\n\n## Composition, independence, and effectiveness\n\nAs at the date of this report, the Board is comprised of the independent non-executive Chair, two executive directors and nine independent non-executive directors. At least half of the Board, excluding the Chair, are independent non-executive directors, in accordance with provision 10 of the Code. Upon appointment, the Chair was identified by the directors as being independent in accordance with provisions 9 and 10 of the Code.\n\nWhen considering the appointment of new directors, the Board is mindful of the contribution and skillset that each new appointee will bring to the Board; the Board has an established skills matrix which supports Board succession planning. The Board continues to focus on maintaining a wellbalanced and diversified Board, with the right mix of individuals who can apply their wider business knowledge and experiences to the setting and oversight of delivery of the Group's strategy. More information on the Group's Diversity and Inclusion Policy can be found on pages 82 and 83.\n\nIn January 2023, Sir Nigel Wilson announced his intention to retire from his role as Group CEO after over a decade in the role. Following a rigorous, global, selection process managed by the Chair, Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es was appointed as Group CEO with effect from 1 January 2024. Prior to joining Legal & General, Ant\u00f3nio was CEO of Banco Santander Spain and Regional Head of Europe, and previously spent 13 years at HSBC in various roles including CEO of UK and Europe and CEO of Global Private Banking. Ant\u00f3nio strengthens the Board's experience having worked across complex, global organisations and brings a formidable leadership track record at the most senior level of financial services. Ant\u00f3nio will help ensure that Legal & General continues to deliver on its enormous potential for its shareholders, employees, customers and the communities of which it is a part, through his executive leadership and strategic direction. More information on the Group CEO appointment process can be found on page 81.\n\nA board effectiveness review is conducted on an annual basis. In line with the requirements of the Code, this review was externally facilitated in 2023. As part of this review, board dynamics and board decisionmaking, including non-executive directors' engagement, constructive challenge and contribution to board discussions, is assessed. Throughout the year, there were no concerns as to the operation of the Board or management of the Company.\n\nFurther information relating to the external effectiveness review can be found on pages 84 to 85.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommittee terms of reference All Committee terms of reference can be found on our website at group. legalandgeneral.com/committees.",

        "page_content": "## Governance report continued\n\n## Conflicts of interest and time commitment\n\nThe identification and management of Board members' conflicts of interest is defined and governed by the Company's Articles of Association, law and regulation, best practice and a number of internal policies which are reviewed and approved by the Board, as part of an annual corporate governance review. When identifying and managing any potential rise in conflict of interest, a record is maintained for each Board members' disclosed directorships and appointments. In the instance of an actual or potential conflict of interest arising, if the Board authorises said conflict, a formal record is maintained as part of the Company's records and would be declared at the start of each relevant meeting and noted within the minutes of the meeting, as stipulated and governed by our directors' conflict of interest policy. To ensure accurate records, on an annual basis, Board members are required to formally approve and sign their conflicts of interest register, thereby confirming that all directorships and appointments contained within are accurate and up to date.\n\nAll non-executive directors' letters of appointment outline the time commitment expected of them throughout their tenure on the Board. At times, their commitment may be required to go beyond that set out in the letter of appointment. The time commitment is reviewed regularly. External commitments, which may have an impact on existing time commitments, must be agreed in advance with the Chair and approved by the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee, acting under its delegation from the Board. As part of the external appointments approval process, each director's time commitments are assessed in detail. The significant commitments of each director are detailed in their biographies on pages 64 to 65.\n\nNon-executive directors' time commitments are considered by the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee as part of its ongoing assessment of the Board's composition. Upon review, the Committee assesses the directors' commitments to the Company alongside their other significant commitments to ensure that they continue to be able to fulfil their duties to the Company. Where the Committee approved new external appointments, it was satisfied that they did not give rise to a conflict of interest and would not impact the directors' time commitment to the Company. In line with our conflicts of interest policy, directors absent themselves from any discussions relating to their own internal or external appointments.\n\nThe Board, on the recommendation of the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee, is satisfied that each non-executive director serving at the end of the year remains independent, effective and continues to have\n\nsufficient time to discharge their responsibilities to the Company. Upon making new appointments to the Board, prospective candidates are expected to devote sufficient time to fulfil their responsibilities and duties to the Company and to do so by acting with integrity, leading by example and promoting the desired culture.\n\nThe Chair's commitments were considered on appointment, are regularly reviewed, and are assessed robustly whenever he proposes to take on an external appointment. In June 2023, the Chair took up the roles of chair at Barclays UK PLC and non-executive director at Barclays PLC. The Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee, led by the SID, carefully considered these external appointments and determined that, given the length of the Chair's tenure at the Company and significant experience, he was capable of balancing the time commitments and any potential conflicts, and overall the new roles would be additive to the Chair's experience, and accordingly, to the Company. Thus, the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee was comfortable that the Chair is able to devote sufficient time to the Company.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion (D&I)\n\nAt Legal & General, we are building an inclusive culture that celebrates diversity and creates fair opportunities for everyone. Diversity is important to the Board, and the Group as a whole, because it generates a wider pool of talent by reflecting the broadest range of human attributes, experience and backgrounds, whilst simultaneously supporting good decision making and reducing the risk of groupthink.\n\nIt is important for our Board to have a broad range of insights and perspectives to help us make better decisions as a business and create an inclusive culture for our people. All appointments to the Board are based upon an impartial gap analysis of knowledge, skills, experience and diversity across the Board as a whole. This gap analysis is routinely conducted to review the composition of the Board and make relevant recommendations for any changes; it also takes account of succession plans to ensure a sustainable pipeline of diverse board talent.\n\nD&I continues to be an area of focus for both the Board and the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee. For more information on the Board's commitments to D&I, please visit our Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee report on pages 80 to 85.\n\n## Our purpose and culture\n\nThe Company's three core 'behaviours' embody our values and reflect the belief that it's not just what we do that is important, but how we do it. Together we are: purposeful, straightforward and collaborative.\n\nThese behaviours are the foundations of our long-term sustainable success and define how we do what we do. Throughout 2023, we have reshaped the way we assess our performance culture and reinforced a balance between the 'what' in terms of our achievements, and the 'how' in terms of demonstrating our core behaviours whilst achieving our goals. This approach not only helps us to further enhance our performance culture, but also to ensure our core behaviours are embedded into the way we do what we do.\n\nThe Board regularly receives updates on the Voice survey which provides insights into employee satisfaction. The surveys include questions on purpose, values and culture to enable the Board to understand whether these areas are aligned to the three key pillars used to measure satisfaction; engagement, culture and productivity, and enablement.\n\nAs well as reshaping the way we assess and measure performance against our core behaviours and values, in September we sought to achieve further insight into what it is like to work as part of the Company, by seeking views directly from our employees globally. This qualitatively complimented the findings from our Voice survey and enabled a deeper understanding which was not led or constrained by questions in a survey, but instead facilitated via a forum for employees to communicate their views, in confidence.\n\nThroughout the year, the Board attended site visits across our UK offices, which enabled our directors to meet with our employees and gain insights into our culture and behaviours in action. In addition, Board members meet with smaller groups of employees to speak directly with them, both with and without management present, and hold town hall events to answer questions from employees. The executive management team also held numerous town hall events at various locations throughout the year to update the workforce on topical issues. Employees are offered the chance to ask the management team questions throughout these sessions. These events are run as hybrid events to maximise engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Social impact report\n\nOur 2023 Social impact report is available on our Group website: group.legalandgeneral.com/reports\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further detail on our group-wide D&I strategy and goals, please see page 49 of this report.",

        "page_content": "## Subsidiary boards\n\nAt Legal & General we have benefited from a strong governance framework operating at subsidiary level for many years now.\n\nHenrietta Baldock and Lesley Knox continue in their roles on the board of two of our principal operating subsidiaries: Henrietta as Chair of Legal and General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS) and Lesley as non-executive director of Legal & General Investment Management (Holdings) Limited (LGIM(H)). George Lewis was also appointed as the Chair of Legal and General Assurance (Pensions Management) Limited in February 2024, having been a member of the board since April 2022. This crossover of directors on our Group Board, principal and other key subsidiary boards allows greater interactions, information flows and promotes enhanced collaboration.\n\n## Induction, training and development\n\nThe Board places great value on training and development, and all new non-executive directors are invited to participate in a comprehensive, formal and tailored induction programme upon joining the Board. Induction programmes provide new directors with the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its business to enable them to provide effective contribution to Board discussions, effectively challenge the executive and properly fulfil their statutory duties.\n\nFollowing his appointment as Group CEO, Ant\u00f3nio received a comprehensive and tailored executive director induction to the Board. All Board members receive regular training throughout the year; the Board believes that continual director training and development is important to maximise the effectiveness of the Board and ensures the Board can effectively challenge the executive. The training programme is generated on an annual basis, based on the needs of the Board, and internal and/or external circumstances, including any\n\nrecommendations from the annual evaluation of the Board and its Committees. It is the responsibility of the Chair to help ensure directors continually update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Group, and the Chair does so with input from the Board and the Group Company Secretary. In 2023, the Board received specific training on various topics, including cyber security, biodiversity and AI. In addition, Board and Committee meetings are regularly used to update the Board on developments in the areas in which the Group operates, and specific training sessions for directors are scheduled for key topical issues. As part of their ongoing training and development, Board members are invited to attend site visits to the Group's various offices, developments and investments, with the aim of widening Board members' knowledge of the business, gain first-hand insights and to provide Board members with the opportunity to meet personally with our employees. Throughout the year, site visits were carried out at our offices in London, Hove and Cardiff, as well as individual director visits to Solihull.\n\n## Board and Committee meeting attendance during

It was a fantastic opportunity for all nominees and winners to meet and integrate with the Board.'\n\nJack Maclean Pensions Consultant\n\n## How the Board spent its time in 2023\n\nThe Board meets regularly to oversee the delivery of the Group's strategic objectives to ensure it continues to promote the long-term sustainable success of the Company. Throughout 2023, the Board held 10 Board meetings, including one strategy event, and one additional site visit. Board Sub-Committees were also constituted on a number of occasions in order to deal with particular matters arising outside of the formal schedule of meetings: a Sub-Committee was constituted during the year to oversee and closely manage the Group CEO search process. The non-executive directors have private meetings without the executives present before and after each Board meeting, and otherwise as required.\n\nBoard members meet informally with the executive directors and Group Management Committee on a regular basis outside of the formal meeting schedule. Members of the Group Management Committee and, as appropriate, individuals from the relevant business areas are also invited to attend Board meetings in relation to key items, allowing the Board the opportunity to debate and challenge initiatives directly with the senior management team, along with the executive directors.\n\nThe Board informs itself of the views of shareholders on a regular basis through updates from the Group CEO and Group CFO, as well as an update from the Chair following his annual schedule of investor meetings. Where relevant, Board Committee Chairs also hold meetings with investors.\n\nThe Board has established the Company's purpose, values and strategy, and has satisfied itself that these and its culture are aligned.\n\nThis is reflected in the Board agendas throughout the year, which are set by the Chair, with input from the Board, and consist of regular reports on the following discussion areas:\n\n- \u00b7 updates from the Group CEO, the Group CFO and the Chair of each of the Committees\n- \u00b7 updates from key business divisions on business performance and progress against strategy, key business initiatives, customer and employee engagement, the control environment and culture\n- \u00b7 discussions on strategic ambitions, material transactions and other material initiatives, to ensure alignment with strategic objectives\n- \u00b7 updates about meetings held between directors and key regulators, such as the FCA and PRA\n- \u00b7 implementation of the Consumer Duty and a greater board focus on customer outcomes\n- \u00b7 risk and compliance matters, including regular updates on whistleblowing\n- \u00b7 audit matters, including IFRS 17 considerations\n- \u00b7 legal and governance matters from the Group General Counsel and Group Company Secretary\n- \u00b7 people, culture, and employee engagement matters, including updates from the Designated Workforce Director and updates on the results of the employee Voice survey\n- \u00b7 ESG, climate and sustainability considerations\n- \u00b7 the Group's relationship with various stakeholder groups.

She has had a positive impact on the business and our members, particularly around Diversity and Inclusion and Wellbeing.'\n\nPam Edwards Head of Unite\n\n## My role\n\nThe wellbeing of our employees is a key priority for the Board and we recognise that our success is driven by our people. As Workforce Director, I engage with, and listen to the concerns of, our employees. I seek to support our people by representing their views to the Board and finding ways to address the issues I uncover.\n\nAt the end of 2022, with input from both employees across divisions and the Board, we established my 2023 programme for engagement with our people based around three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity and Inclusion and Wellbeing\n- \u00b7 Collaboration\n- \u00b7 Growth.\n\nThese pillars are relevant to all areas of the business and align with the priorities established by wider management. Engagement with employees during 2023 was structured around these pillars and we tracked the impact and outcomes of my engagement.\n\n## Elevating employee views\n\nThere is a standing item at each Board meeting to discuss my activities as Workforce Director since the last meeting and to provide relevant feedback. During 2023, I reported against the programme and discussed relevant issues and any potential responses or changes.\n\nNot all issues required discussion at the Board and so I decided in each case whether it was more appropriate to raise issues with the relevant member of the executive team and then report to the Board on any action taken.\n\nThe key focus was always to ensure that what mattered most to our people was communicated and, where appropriate, addressed, whilst providing our people with transparency of relevant Board activities.",

Through these bodies, I can gather the views and concerns of a range of employees at a variety of grades across the Group. During 2023, I met with representatives from both organisations every quarter.\n\nFor each business division, I received regular updates on Diversity and Inclusion, Wellbeing and on the Voice survey results and actions being taken following such results. This links to my 2023 programme pillar of Diversity and Inclusion and Wellbeing, but also to Collaboration as I have been able to share best practices across different parts of the business.\n\nI have participated in various events across the business, such as the Women in Business & Finance panel, LGC's 'Grade 5 forum' and the summer internship induction programme, all supporting the focus on Growth.\n\nThrough meeting people at our business locations in Barnsley, Cardiff, Chicago, Frederick, Hove, London, Solihull and Stamford, I have been able to focus on issues specific to business areas and location, building on all three pillars of my programme.\n\n## Voice\n\nI interrogate the Voice survey data to understand how our people feel and this is discussed by Board members at the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee, together with any appropriate actions to take in response. Employee satisfaction is at 79%, and work is underway to improve this even further in 2024.\n\n## 2024\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I will continue to listen to our people, provide feedback, and, where relevant, implement changes through wider management and the Board.\n\nIn 2024, my priorities as Workforce Director will again be aligned with the Board and wider management's focus. I will continue to focus on Diversity and Inclusion and Wellbeing, and Collaboration, whilst Growth will evolve to Performance and Capability.

        "page_content": "## Section 172 statement and stakeholder engagement\n\n## Statement on Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 (the 'Act')\n\nSection 172(1) of the Act requires directors to act in the way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole, and in doing so, have regard to a non-exhaustive list of factors to ensure that the broader implications and interests of stakeholders are considered in their decision-making.\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of nurturing its positive relationships with its key stakeholders and is committed to maintaining strong engagement with them. The Board believes that this engagement provides\n\nmeaningful insights into the views, priorities and issues facing its key stakeholders which can then be considered as part of the Board's strategic decision-making and planning.\n\nThe Board has reflected on its engagement mechanisms throughout 2023 and concluded that they remain effective and have provided the Board with a comprehensive understanding of the interests of its key stakeholders.\n\nA summary of the Board's major decisions and activities during 2023 can be found below. This, combined with our key engagement activities on page 78, makes up our section 172(1) statement. Further information on our key stakeholders and their importance is set out on pages 14 and 15.\n\n## Major decisions and activities during 2023\n\nThe following examples of major decisions and activities during the year illustrate how the Board considers different stakeholders' interests in its decision making and how this supports the implementation of the Group's long-term strategy and its strategic growth drivers (as set out on pages 10 and 11).\n\nWe believe that major decisions are those that are both material to the Group and to its key stakeholders. Whilst not all decisions affect every stakeholder group, the Board and its delegated decision-making forums endeavour to balance the sometimes conflicting needs of our stakeholders to ensure that all are treated consistently and fairly.\n\n## Major decision\n\n## Key stakeholder consideration\n\n## Approval of a \u00a32.7 billion buy-in with the British Steel Pension Scheme\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board approved a final buy-in policy with the British Steel Pension Scheme (the 'Scheme'), totalling \u00a32.7bn, under which the remaining 40% of liabilities was insured. This was the final transaction in a series of four phased buy-ins to fully insure the \u00a37.5bn of the Scheme's liabilities, securing the benefits of all circa 67,000 retired and deferred members. In doing so, the Scheme became the largest pension scheme in the UK to have fully insured all its members' benefits.\n\nThis transaction demonstrates our expertise in pensions de-risking and our commitment to helping schemes find solutions to secure pension commitments against a backdrop of ageing demographics.\n\nAt the core of these transactions, and to insure benefits at this scale, Legal & General developed strong relationships with the Trustees' sponsoring company, the Scheme's in-house teams and advisors and brought together expertise across Legal & General. These transactions signal a successful continuation of our long-term, collaborative relationship with the Scheme.\n\nThrough rigorous board review and decision making, and a series of well-timed transactions, the Scheme capitalised on volatile markets and strong decision making to capture attractive pricing and achieve the Trustees' and Sponsors objective of full insurance.\n\nFor more information on the Group's institutional retirement business, please visit pages 29 to 31.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers\n\nCirca 67,000 members will benefit from the security that Legal & General provides to their pensions. As populations live longer, their pensions last longer too. By delivering on a carefully considered and well-established plan, we helped the Trustees and sponsoring company of the Scheme secure the benefits of their members for the long-term - far faster than initially anticipated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulators\n\nWe continue to maintain strong and positive regulatory engagement with the Prudential Regulation Authority and we provided updates on the transaction through our periodic pipeline reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shareholders\n\nThis transaction has helped us to deliver another strong result for our pension risk transfer business and create long-term value and strong returns for our shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key employee engagement in the year\n\nFollowing the announcement of the appointment of Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es as Group CEO Designate, effective from 1 January 2024, a new group-wide CEO edition of the employee Voice survey was launched in preparation for Ant\u00f3nio's arrival. The survey invited employees to share their feedback on working at Legal & General which was shared directly with Ant\u00f3nio upon his appointment.\n\n## Our strategic growth drivers\n\n- 1 Ageing demographics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2 Globalisation of asset markets\n- 3 Investing in the real economy\n- 4 Welfare reforms\n- 5 Technological innovation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAddressing climate change",

Throughout the year, the Board was updated on the \u00a3475 million regeneration project in Cardiff's Central Square, which included the development of Calon, our new Cardiff headquarters. Our aim was to create a workplace with sustainability, wellbeing and our purpose of inclusive capitalism at its core. By October 2023, all of our Cardiff based colleagues had been successfully relocated to Calon, bringing our people and our Company into the heart of the investments we're making in the city, and their long-term future.\n\nTo celebrate the opening of Calon, our Group CEO, Group CFO, Group HR Director and Retail CEO joined employees and community stakeholders for an official 'opening ceremony' to celebrate our new home for our circa 2,500 people in Wales. In November, the Board held its strategy event at Calon and combined this with an interactive site visit to experience the new office for themselves and to meet with colleagues.\n\n## Major activity\n\n## Key stakeholder consideration\n\n## The development of our partnership with Bruntwood SciTech to achieve additional investment for the regeneration of our towns and cities in the UK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board oversaw the development of our science and technology real estate joint venture with Bruntwood SciTech, the leading property and innovation services provider in the UK, including a new partnership with Greater Manchester Pension Fund (GMPF), the UK's largest local government pension fund, securing \u00a3500m of additional investment.\n\nWe're bringing a fresh injection of capital which reinforces our commitment to investing purposefully in the real economy. The long-term vision for our joint venture with Bruntwood SciTech is to provide the infrastructure that businesses and the public sector need to thrive and to provide the UK's regional cities with the capacity they need to support future growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Communities and environment\n\nWe are committed to creating and supporting thriving cities and our joint venture with Bruntwood SciTech has enabled us to work with cities and universities to create modern science infrastructure. The growth of the Bruntwood SciTech partnership through the introduction of GMPF supports the delivery of a significant long-term investment project that is economically viable and bolsters innovation strategies and regeneration of towns and cities in the UK.\n\nAt Bruntwood SciTech's core is the drive to invest in an innovation backbone for the UK. The new capital will be used to expand and redevelop existing science and technology campuses and city centre innovation hubs, delivering additional world-leading lab and office space in the UK across a secured 3.6m sq ft development pipeline.\n\nOpportunities exist to export our investment expertise internationally to support our global ambitions. The success of Bruntwood SciTech has paved the way for the expansion of our UK business model to the US market with Ancora L&G, where we believe there is significant potential for further growth.\n\nFor more information on the Group's capital investment business, please visit pages 32 to 34.\n\nThe investment supports the drive to regenerate towns and cities in the UK, helping to create highly skilled jobs, increase productivity and drive wage growth, while supporting the UK's target to become a global science and technology superpower by 2030.\n\n## Employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEngaging with our employees throughout the planning and development stages of Calon has supported our inclusive company culture whilst understanding what is important to them in a hybrid working environment. Our workforce is vital to our success. To help us understand the views of our employees, we engaged through formal and informal channels; the name of the new office 'Calon' - Welsh for heart - was chosen in a vote by our employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Communities and envi  ronment\n\nCalon meets the highest standards in sustainable design. There is no gas in the building, and it can generate its own electricity from solar panels and air source heat pumps. It has achieved a BREEAM Outstanding rating and is also targeting Nabers UK 5-star. With over 3,000 living plants and natural lighting throughout, it has occupants' wellbeing at its core.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Suppliers\n\nIn line with our commitment to inclusive capitalism, we utilised local suppliers and products throughout the development process where possible, to further improve the social impact the building delivers.\n\nAs part of this, the Board held an in person town hall and invited all colleagues to join. Updates were provided on diversity and inclusion within the Board, emerging risks and opportunities and Consumer Duty. Employees were invited to ask a range of questions and provide their feedback on their new working environment.\n\nCalon has been designed for sustainability, wellbeing and inclusivity. The new office has been developed using a climate-focused approach and represents the delivery of our socially responsible investing agenda and our continued relationship with all of our stakeholders. It is hoped that Calon will drive an evolution on how cities are suitably designed to be sustainable, long-term.\n\nThe development of Calon is the result of a \u00a3475 million investment by Legal & General into the regeneration of Cardiff's Central Square, run in partnership with Cardiff Council, the Welsh Government and Rightacres. It demonstrates our commitment to investing in the real economy and forms part of our wider \u00a31 billion investment in Cardiff in recent years.",

During the year, the Committee's remit evolved to include oversight of Legal & General's data strategies. This is an important area of focus for Legal & General as we recognise the opportunities that can be derived from data. This change has enabled the Committee to become a more forwardlooking and strategic forum to drive innovation.\n\nThe Committee's focus during the year has been around four key themes: control & risk; capability & capacity; strategy & innovation; and change delivery. These themes have allowed the Committee to explore technology, data and cyber in depth and has created an environment where these key strands can be brought together to support the Board in seizing technological and data opportunities and overseeing the challenges presented by technology and cyber. The Committee is supported by an executive level technology and security governance framework. This framework has provided greater oversight of, and allowed the Committee to place greater reliance on, the Group's executive-level governance arrangements.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee has focused considerably on data as it becomes an increasingly important element of our business. Data touches every application, process and business decision we make. We have an ambition to become a more data driven and insight led organisation, and to do this, we need to ensure data is treated as a highly valuable and strategic asset. The Committee also spent time focusing on how divisions can collaborate to drive greater efficiencies and capabilities. In October, we concentrated on this from a people and capabilities' perspective. This was a useful exercise as it highlighted some shared challenges and opportunities across the Group and recognised that the different markets in which our businesses operate demand different skill sets, experiences and capabilities to meet their divisional needs. I have been pleased to see the formation of a technology leadership community across the Group which is bringing together these shared challenges and opportunities.\n\nAs Artificial Intelligence continues to embed into society, the Committee will continue to discuss and oversee its associated opportunities and challenges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLaura Wade-Gery\n\nChair of the Data and Technology Committee",

Ant\u00f3nio's appointment followed a rigorous, global selection process managed by a Sub-Committee of the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee, led by the Chair. A summary of the process is outlined below.\n\n| Talent management   and succession planning                                        | The Committee annually reviews and assesses the executive talent pipeline to ensure there is a pipeline of credible  and capable successors for executive management, including for the role of Group CEO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.  Constitution of Sub-  Committee to manage                                      | A Sub-Committee of the Committee, led by the Chair, was constituted to provide direction and Board oversight of the Group  CEO succession planning process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| 2.  Engagement with   executive search   firm and creation   of role specification | The Sub-Committee engaged with independent external search firm Russell Reynolds. Russell Reynolds has no other  connection with the Company or its directors and is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search  Firms. Russell Reynolds was chosen for its significant depth in insurance and financial services more generally, a track  record of focusing on diversity, and a strong leadership team who would challenge the Board on its thinking on candidates.  |\n| 3. Candidate long lists                                                            | The search firm produced a diverse long list of candidates which was reviewed, thoroughly discussed and refined  by the Sub-Committee. The long list included internal candidates and best-in-class external talent. In reviewing the long  list, the Sub-Committee was mindful of diversity, including of background and experience, as well as the desired skills  and attributes for the role as set out in the role specification.                                                        |\n| 4.  Candidate short   list and interviews                                          | All candidates on the long list were interviewed by the Sub-Committee, following which a short list of final candidates  was produced. All shortlisted candidates were assessed against the role specification, on merit and with due regard  to all forms of diversity. The final candidates were interviewed by the full Committee, which included a presentation from  candidates. In addition, they underwent psychometric testing, and references were taken on the external candidates. |\n| 5.   Candidate    selection                                                        | Following shortlisted candidates' presentations and interviews, the Board discussed each candidate in detail,  taking into account all elements of the search process. Following this discussion, it was agreed that Ant\u00f3nio  was the outstanding candidate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| 6.   Candidate    appointment  and approval                                        | The Committee unanimously recommended to the Board the appointment of Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es as the next Group CEO,  subject to regulatory approval, and the Board duly approved the appointment. The Remuneration Committee led  on the development of an appropriate remuneration package. Ant\u00f3nio was interviewed by the PRA and FCA as part  of the approval process, and approval for his appointment was granted in October 2023.                                                               |\n\nInduction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA comprehensive, tailored induction programme was undertaken by Ant\u00f3nio upon appointment, led by the Chair and the Group Company Secretary. This included a focus on the markets and regulatory regions in which the Group operates, as well as meetings with all senior management, key external stakeholders, and undertaking site visits to the Group's offices in the UK and globally.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nThe Committee is responsible for overseeing and monitoring the Company's corporate governance framework and compliance with the Code. The Company has complied with all provisions of the Code throughout the year.

        "page_content": "## Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee report continued\n\n## Key activities during the year Board composition, succession and other changes throughout the year CEO succession\n\nA key activity for the Committee in 2023 was managing and overseeing the search for the new Group CEO, Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es. For more information on the appointment process, please see page 81.\n\n## Board composition\n\nThe Committee undertakes a rigorous annual review of the Board's composition to support discussions on succession planning. This includes a capability assessment of Board members' knowledge, skills and experience in the context of the Company's short and medium-term strategy, supported by a self-assessment analysis undertaken by each individual director, which forms part of an overall Board skills matrix. The skills matrix reflects the results of the assessment. The skills matrix is refreshed and reviewed on an annual basis and is used by the Committee to support discussions on succession. Various other considerations, including the tenure of the Board as a whole, independence and diversity, are also considered by the Committee when reviewing the Board's composition. The outcome of the 2023 discussion on composition was that, overall, the Board was of an appropriate size and composition, with key succession plans having been executed over the course of the year. The upcoming focus for the Committee will be succession planning for the Chair and non-executive directors who will be coming to the end of their tenure.\n\nThe Committee also considered reappointments of directors to the Board, and directors' external appointments to the boards of other companies. Where the Committee approved new external appointments, it was satisfied that the appointments did not give rise to a conflict of interest and would not impact the directors' time commitment to the Company. In line with our conflicts of interest policy, directors absent themselves from any discussions relating to their own reappointment, chair appointment or other internal or external appointments.\n\n## Other board changes\n\nThe Committee considered and approved the following board composition changes throughout the year.\n\nFollowing the 2022 and 2023 discussions on board composition, Lesley Knox succeeded Philip Broadley as SID in September 2023. As a result of this change, the Company now complies with the FCA's targets on board diversity to have at least one of the following senior board positions held by a female: Chair, Chief Executive, SID or Chief Financial Officer. Philip remains a member of the Board and we continue to benefit from Philip's experience\n\nand counsel. Lesley was considered by the Committee as the outstanding candidate for the role of SID due to her length of tenure, strong understanding of, and experience in dealing with, the Group and its various stakeholders from her roles as Remuneration Committee Chair, Designated Workforce Director and her role on the board of one of our principal subsidiaries.\n\nBeing mindful of the time commitment for Lesley to take on the role of SID, Laura Wade-Gery succeeded Lesley as the Chair of the Remuneration Committee in February 2024. The Committee considered Laura an excellent candidate due to her established track record as a UK-listed company Remuneration Committee Chair and her strong understanding of the Committee's current workings and short- and medium-term priorities. Laura fulfils the Code requirement for any appointee to the Remuneration Committee Chair role to have served on a Remuneration Committee for at least 12 months prior to appointment. Having discussed Laura's internal and external time commitments, the Committee considered that Laura has sufficient time to dedicate to the Remuneration Committee Chair role.\n\n## Executive succession and talent management\n\nIn addition to reviewing the Board's composition, throughout the year the Committee has focused on executive-level succession across near- to long-term time horizons to ensure there is a credible pipeline of successors for executive roles.\n\n## Subsidiary succession\n\nThe Company benefits from a strong governance framework operating at subsidiary level. The continued strength of the boards of the Group's subsidiaries is vital for ensuring the Group's high standards are maintained and there is sufficient oversight of activity further down the Group, particularly in our principal subsidiaries. While succession planning remains the responsibility of each subsidiary board, it is nevertheless very important for the Committee to have continued oversight of its key subsidiaries and ensure orderly succession plans are in place. In addition, I meet regularly with the non-executive directors of our principal subsidiary boards, without the presence of executive management, to gain direct feedback.\n\nAppointments to the Group's principal subsidiaries are made on the recommendation of the Committee. This year the board of one of the Group's principal subsidiaries, Legal and General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS), approved the appointment of Andrew Kail as its new CEO, following regulatory approval, on the recommendation of the Committee. Andrew succeeded Sir Nigel Wilson who held the LGAS CEO role (in addition to the Group CEO role)\n\nuntil his retirement in December 2023. In making its decision, the Committee highlighted Andrew's knowledge and understanding of the Group and the LGAS business, having run the Group's PRT business for the last two years as well as previously running the Group's Retail Retirement division, meaning that Andrew was well-placed to take on the role.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion (D&I) D&I across the Group\n\nAs a Group, we are working towards a more equitable workplace where all our people can realise their potential. We believe that diversity of experience and skills brings diversity of thought and perspective, which in turn drives greater proximity to our customers and promotes a culture which more readily embraces innovation.\n\nLast year, we set ourselves deliberately challenging ethnicity goals across the Group in order to expand the scope of our D&I agenda and to complement existing goals for gender. These goals are for 17% of our workforce, senior management roles and Board members to be from minority ethnic backgrounds by 2027. During 2022, we built these new goals into group-wide and divisional D&I plans, including key operational areas like recruitment. As a Group we have made good progress on achieving our ethnicity goals by 2027, and good progress on our employees' voluntary disclosure of ethnicity data. However, we are aware that faster progression is required to achieve our gender diversity goals, particularly achieving 40% female leadership at the senior/ middle management level, and we continue to explore areas of opportunity to achieve this.\n\nThroughout 2023, the Committee received regular updates on the progress against the group-wide and divisional D&I plans and the following key D&I focus areas:\n\n- \u00b7 embedding the progress made in 2022, including inclusive recruitment, improving line manager capabilities and the creation of opportunities for those from underrepresented backgrounds\n- \u00b7 evolving the D&I governance and operating model across the Group by increasing transparency, reducing duplication and elevating the voice of our employee networks\n- \u00b7 holding leaders and line managers to account on diversity matters.\n\nThe Committee continues to support the work of the executive management and the D&I Council in driving the D&I agenda across the Group. For more information on our group-wide D&I activity during 2023, including our progress on achieving our objectives, please see page 49 of this report.",

        "page_content": "## D&I of the Board\n\nAs a Committee, we believe that diversity is important as it supports good decision making and reduces the risk of groupthink by providing different viewpoints, ideas and challenge. As part of this, we believe that it is important for our Board to be diverse in terms of gender, ethnic and social backgrounds and have a broad range of perspectives to help us make better strategic decisions and lead by example in creating an inclusive culture for our people.\n\nLesley Knox was appointed as SID in September 2023. This appointment reflects our commitment to gender diversity in senior board positions and complies with the FCA's targets on board diversity as set out in Listing Rule 9.8.6(9)(a)(ii), that at least one of the following senior board positions should be held by a female; Chair, Chief Executive, SID or Chief Financial Officer.\n\nWe are proud to have a Board which is diverse, both in terms of gender and ethnicity. As at 31 December 2023, the Board comprised 42% women, and 25% of the Board was from an ethnically diverse background. Both of these percentages exceed regulatory requirements, the targets in the FTSE Women Leaders Review (Hampton-Alexander) and Parker Review, as well as the goals we set ourselves in our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy. The Board is also compliant with the board diversity requirements in the Listing Rules and discloses its compliance in the prescribed format below.\n\nWhen making appointments to the Board, the Committee only engages executive search firms that are signatories to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms which promotes gender diversity and best practice for corporate board searches.\n\n## D&I of senior management\n\nA diverse senior leadership team is as important as a diverse Board, because we believe that executive decision-making is more effective if it takes into account a wider range of views and opinions. Last year we introduced a new goal of 17% of our senior management roles to be held by people from minority ethnicity backgrounds by 2027. During 2023, we are pleased that our hiring rates for minority ethnicities are trending positively, increasing our confidence in our ability to achieve our 2027 goals.\n\nWe continue to monitor the progress of our gender diversity goals of 40% female leadership by 2025 and a 50:50 gender balance across the workforce by 2025. We have made good progress on the representation of women over the last 5 years, particularly in some of our most senior roles, however the pace of change has been slow. As a result, focus on areas of opportunity for this particular segment of employees, such as optimising incentives, job-sharing and job design, continues.\n\nFrom 1 January 2024, we implemented a new executive governance framework. The Group Management Committee was formed as a formal committee of the Group CEO. As at 31 December 2023, our Group Executive Committee (which existed under our previous governance framework) comprised 40% women*, with 50% of our businesses led by a female CEO. Also at 31 December 2023, representation at the middle/ senior management level was 37.2% women (2022: 38%). We are eager to increase the ethnic diversity of senior management across the Company, which is why we have set ourself the goal of 17% by 2027 - we are currently at 17.3% for this constituency.\n\n## Board D&I Policy\n\nDuring the year, the Committee reviewed and approved the Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy, which complements the Group's wider workforce policies and values on D&I. The Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy sets out the approach to diversity and inclusion of the Board of Legal & General Group Plc, and its Committees, in compliance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR).

In line with best practice, a formal and rigorous review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees is conducted each year. The Board and its Committees undergo a full, independent external evaluation every three years, and an externally-facilitated internal evaluation on all other years. This year, in line with the requirements of the Code, the effectiveness review was undertaken by an independent, external board effectiveness review specialist.\n\nFollowing a robust tender process conducted by the Chair and Group Company Secretary, upon the Committee's recommendation, the Board approved the appointment of Clare Chalmers Limited as the independent external reviewer to conduct the 2023 evaluation. Clare was chosen due to her specialism in financial services firms. Clare Chalmers Limited has no other connection with the Company or individual directors.\n\nThe process, findings and resulting actions from the 2023 effectiveness review of the Board and its Committees can be found in the diagram below across pages 84 and 85. Clare had the opportunity to comment on these disclosures.\n\n## 2023 Board and Committees' effectiveness review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n## Scoping\n\nClare met with the Chair and Group Company Secretary to agree the scope of the 2023 effectiveness review. This included the objectives of the review and the key areas of focus. The agreed aim of the review was to assess the effectiveness of the Board, both as a collective unitary Board and at Committee level. The review focused on, amongst other things:\n\n- \u00b7 board composition, including diversity\n- \u00b7 succession planning for the Board and senior management\n- \u00b7 board dynamics, board decision-making and how effectively members work together to achieve objectives\n- \u00b7 strategy, performance and risk\n- \u00b7 purposes, values and culture\n- \u00b7 stakeholder considerations.\n\n2\n\n## Document review and meeting observations\n\nClare and her associates conducted a thorough review of previous Board and Committee papers, minutes and other relevant documentation to provide context on Board matters and the decision-making process, to help inform the one-to-one interviews. Following this review, Clare observed a series of Board and Committee meetings to enable her to form an independent view of the meeting dynamics.\n\n## Process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chair and individual director performance evaluations\n\nThe SID leads the non-executive members of the Board in an annual evaluation of the performance of the Chair, which includes an assessment of the working relationship between the Chair and the Group CEO. In carrying out the annual evaluation, the SID meets with the non-executives without the Chair present and takes into account the views of the executive directors, as appropriate. Following this year's review, the effectiveness of the Chair continued to be highly-rated.\n\nThe Chair meets with Board members throughout the year to assess their individual performance. Following this year's review, and the insights gained from the external facilitator, the Chair confirmed that the individual directors' continued to contribute effectively to the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Interviews\n\nClare held in-depth one-to-one interviews with Board members covering a broad range of topics, as agreed with the Chair and the Group Company Secretary. The topics for consideration were shared with the Board members prior to their individual interviews. Clare also interviewed certain members of senior management, including the Group Chief Risk Officer, Group HR Director, Group Chief Auditor and Group Company Secretary, to bring useful insights on the performance of the Committees and an overall holistic view of effectiveness. Discussions with all interviewees remained confidential.\n\n## Report\n\nClare produced an initial, draft report on her independent review findings, which she discussed with the Chair and Group Company Secretary in the first instance. Clare then presented a final written report to the Committee and invited discussion on the report's findings and recommendations. No views were attributed to any individual in the final report.",

The report identified a number of key strengths, including the experience and skillsets of the non-executive directors, the level of debate in meetings and the strong contributions of all Board members, as well as the supportive, positive nature of interactions between the non-executive directors and management, both inside and outside of formal meetings. The strength of the Company's culture was also noted, built around good behaviours, positive and open stakeholder relationships and the value-adding engagement from designated board roles such as the Designated Workforce Director.\n\nThe appointment process of the Group CEO was felt to have been well-managed and it was recognised that succession planning for the longer-serving non-executive directors on the Board would be a key area of focus for the coming year, particularly in terms of ensuring that the Board's composition would effectively support the development of strategy under the Company's new executive leadership. The report commented on the strength of the Chair and the Committee Chairs, noting their extensive work outside of the boardroom, as well as the considerable roles performed by each of the Committees in supporting the Board. Clare provided a number of thoughtful recommendations in the report for the Board's consideration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Action plan\n\nThe Board discussed the findings of the 2023 effectiveness review and subsequently agreed an action plan for the coming year. The key actions included (i) continuing to support the new Group CEO as he transitions into the role, (ii) continuing to develop relationships with, and appropriate governance of, the Group's principal subsidiaries, and (iii) continuing to oversee how the Consumer Duty is embedded into the organisation and how reporting on consumers could be more strategic. Progress to implement the agreed actions is underway. Progress is monitored by the Group Company Secretary and will continue to be reported to the Board at each meeting.",

During my first full year as the Chair of the Audit Committee, the Committee continued to assist the Board in fulfilling its core responsibilities, including monitoring the integrity of the Group's financial reporting, the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control environment and the performance and objectivity of both the internal and external audit functions.\n\nA key area of focus for the Committee in 2023 was the final phase of implementation of the new IFRS accounting standard IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts'. The Group has applied IFRS 17, alongside IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments', for the first time from 1 January 2023. These standards have brought significant changes to the accounting treatment for insurance and reinsurance contracts and financial instruments respectively and have had a material impact on the Group's financial statements in the period of initial application. It was therefore appropriate that the Committee spend a significant proportion of its time overseeing the final elements of implementation.\n\nThis included regular updates on the results of a series of 'dry runs' ahead of initial reporting under the new standards and monitoring the development and implementation of the required changes to systems, processes and operating models. In addition, the Committee paid close attention to the effectiveness of the systems of controls over the new IFRS 17 reporting systems and also reviewed, challenged and approved the material accounting judgements, methodologies, policies, assumptions and new reporting metrics.\n\nThe Committee has also received regular updates from KPMG in relation to IFRS 17 and commissioned Group Internal Audit to perform audits on various aspects of the implementation and received regular updates on the outcome of these audits.\n\nIFRS 17 was an unusually complex accounting standard to implement. It required fundamental changes to accounting records, as well as new systems and processes for preparing financial statements in accordance with the required framework. In common with other insurers, the Group began significant implementation work in 2017, some years before the final form of the standard was known. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone that contributed to the IFRS 17 programme for their dedication and tenacity in ensuring the Group was fully prepared for the transition.\n\n## Committee meetings and membership\n\nThe Committee met 6 times during the year this represents 1 more meeting than in an average year due to additional time spent on monitoring and reviewing the implementation",

        "page_content": "of IFRS 17. The Committee comprises only independent non-executive directors and fulfils the experience and expertise criteria required by the UK Corporate Governance Code and the FCA's disclosure and transparency rules. The Board considers that the Committee, as a whole, has a balance of skills and experience to deliver its responsibilities and has competence relevant to the sector and broader financial services industry. In addition, the Board considers that I, as Chair of the Committee, have recent and relevant financial experience and am competent in accounting and auditing.\n\nAll members of the Committee are also members of the Risk Committee, which ensures that there is appropriate identification and management of any issues that are relevant to both committees. The full biographies of all Committee members can be found on pages 64 and 65. Between meetings, I meet regularly with senior management across the Group's Finance, Tax and Internal Audit functions, as well as with the lead external audit partner.\n\n## Review of financial disclosures\n\nThe Committee reviewed the half year and annual financial statements, which focused on the integrity and clarity of disclosure, application of accounting policies and judgements and compliance with legal and financial reporting standards. With the implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, and their impact across multiple reporting periods, including the transition as at 1 January 2022 and a restatement of the Group's 2022 half year and annual results, additional meetings were scheduled in advance of the Group's half year 2023 results to ensure that the Committee had sufficient opportunity to understand, review and challenge those first financial statements and disclosures under the new standards. As part of its review, the Committee received regular updates from management and the external auditor and was able to place reliance on the updates provided throughout the year on internal controls in relation to financial reporting.\n\nDuring the second half of 2023, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) undertook a thematic review of 'IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' Interim Disclosures in the First Year of Application'. The Group received the outcome of this review in respect of the Group's half year report to 30 June 2023. This review was conducted in accordance with the FRC's usual procedures, and accordingly was based solely on that half year report without detailed knowledge of our business or an understanding of the underlying transactions entered into. The review does not provide assurance that the half year report was correct in all material respects. The Committee was pleased to note both that, based on the review, there were no further questions or queries that the FRC wished to raise, but also\n\nthat the FRC's report on their thematic review, published in November 2023, included a number of disclosures contained in the Group's half year report as examples of better practice.\n\nAs part of its review of financial disclosures, the Committee also considered whether the annual report was fair, balanced and understandable (FBU) and whether it provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy, as well as the risks facing the business including in relation to increasingly important ESG and climate considerations. The Committee reviewed the FBU assessment taking into consideration the impact of market volatility and the changing interest rate and inflationary environment and giving due attention to the use of APMs in increasing the level of information available to investors on the Company's underlying performance and the effects of one-off financial events. In conjunction with verification processes, management assurance and a report from the external auditor, the Committee recommended to the Board that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\nThe Audit Committee, together with the Risk Committee, reviewed the key assumptions and methodologies of the risk-based capital model, Solvency II disclosures and disclosures made in relation to internal control and risk management, as well as the principal risks and uncertainties the Group faces. The Committee can confirm that the key judgements and significant issues considered in relation to the 2023 financial statements are consistent with the disclosures of key estimation uncertainties and critical judgements as detailed in Note 1 on page 151. The statement is underpinned by the Committee's belief that all important information has been disclosed and that the descriptions and reviews of the Group's business and performance as set out in the Strategic report are consistent with the financial reporting in the Group's financial statements.\n\n## Climate and other non-financial reporting\n\nWhile the FRC chose not to include any revisions to the UK Corporate Governance Code in respect of wider responsibilities and considerations for boards and audit committees in relation to ESG objectives and other sustainability matters, following its consultation in 2023, the Committee provides close oversight over the Group's climate and other non-financial reporting, in light of ever-increasing stakeholder expectations. During the year, the Committee has received updates on the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the release of the inaugural standards from the International Sustainability Standards Board.\n\n## Other key areas of focus for the Committee during 2023\n\nIn addition to the implementation of IFRS 17, the Committee has also focused on:\n\n## Macroeconomic environment: the\n\nimpacts of economic volatility on key accounting and actuarial areas of judgement and estimates that are sensitive to changing interest rates and inflation, as well as consideration of geopolitical events and their potential impact on balance sheet valuations and valuation uncertainty.\n\nInternal controls: activities associated with the operation and effectiveness of the Group's framework of internal controls over financial reporting and the evaluation of any failings or weaknesses .\n\n## Non-financial reporting: the\n\nadequacy of climate-related and other non-financial disclosures, including recommending the approval of the Group's first Climate transition plan.\n\n## Internal Audit effectiveness\n\nreview: reviewing the outcomes of the assessment by an independent external party.\n\n## UK audit and corporate\n\ngovernance reform: overseeing the Company's approach to proposed reforms, particularly in relation to internal controls, in light of a changing approach from both the Government and FRC.",

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee report continued\n\nIn addition, the Committee has focused on improvements that can be made to the Group's climate-related disclosures in the financial statements and ensuring that there is a coherent link between those disclosures and the narrative in the front half of the Annual report and accounts. The Committee also has responsibility for reviewing and approving the Group's Climate and nature report and Social impact report and, to that end, has sought to understand the verification and assurance framework that is in place to ensure that disclosures were in line with relevant requirements, and were materially accurate, consistent, fair and balanced. The Committee remained supportive of the proposal to commission limited third-party assurance over specific climate and pay gap-related metrics.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Committee has the primary responsibility for the oversight of the Group's system of internal controls including controls over financial reporting and the work of the Internal Audit function. The Committee, in collaboration with the Risk Committee, seeks to ensure that the Group operates within a framework of prudent and effective controls that allow risks to be identified, assessed and managed.\n\nPolicies and manuals in relation to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Solvency II reporting requirements and a Financial Control Framework (FCF) are in place across the Group. FCF is a first line framework that supports the Committee in enabling it to understand and assess the design and effectiveness of controls over financial reporting, covering IFRS, APMs, Solvency II and, going forward, climate and other non-financial reporting. FCF is a risk-based approach with management identification, documentation, testing, remediation (as required), reporting and certification over key financial reporting-related controls.\n\nThe Committee has completed its review and approval of the effectiveness of the Group's system of internal control policies and procedures, during the year and up to the date of this report, in accordance with the requirements of the guidance on risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting published by the FRC. During this review, the Committee did not identify any weaknesses which were determined to be significant to the preparation of the financial statements. Where areas for improvement were identified, processes are in place to ensure that the necessary actions are taken, and progress is monitored by the Committee.\n\n## UK audit and corporate governance reform\n\n2023 has seen a significant scaling back of proposals relating to audit and corporate governance reform in the UK, with: primary legislation required for, amongst other things, the establishment of the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA) now likely delayed until post the general election; the late withdrawal of proposed secondary legislation on the Audit and Assurance Policy, Resilience Statement, fraud reporting and reporting on distributable reserves; and finally the removal of a number of proposed changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code following the FRC's consultation in 2023. As a Group, Legal & General remains supportive of proposals that make the UK an attractive market for shareholders, investors and broader stakeholders through high quality and transparent audit and corporate governance activities. The Committee has been actively engaged throughout the year in overseeing the Group's readiness for the proposed reforms and, while it was disappointing to see such late changes, it will continue to keep a close focus on the changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code that remain, notably in relation to the declaration on the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control framework.\n\n## Audit quality\n\nIt remains an important aspect of the Committee's work to keep under review the independence and effectiveness of the internal and external audit process.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe Group Chief Internal Auditor presents a report at each Committee meeting, to update the Committee on the results of audits since the previous meeting. The report includes: details of any significant control weaknesses and positive assurance provided; themes arising from audits and management's progress in addressing actions related to audit findings; and Group Internal Audit's (GIA) evaluation of the overall control environment for each of the Group's divisions. Key areas of GIA's work reported to the Committee during the year included: financial reporting processes and controls related to IFRS 17; IT and data security; data privacy risk management; IT and operational resilience; Solvency II compliance; financial risk governance including credit, market and liquidity risk; financial crime risk management; third-party oversight including material outsourcing; readiness for the FCA's Consumer Duty regulation; climate change reporting; and major IT change programmes. GIA continues to evaluate the risk and control culture across the Group and includes specific reporting to the Committee on the results of this work. The Committee approved GIA's risk-based audit plan for the year and monitored the delivery of the plan throughout the year as well as the associated key performance metrics.\n\nDuring 2022, Deloitte were engaged to perform an external quality assessment of GIA, which assessed the function's effectiveness including its independence and positioning within the organisation. Deloitte presented its report to the Committee in May 2023. The function was assessed as a mature internal audit function, generally conforming with International Internal Audit Standards and applicable professional codes for effective internal audit in financial services. The Deloitte report noted the function's clear purpose and support from management; appropriate safeguards related to independence and objectivity; mature working practices; a high quality experienced team, and a strong focus on data analytics and continuous improvement.\n\nThe Committee continued to meet with the Group Chief Internal Auditor in private throughout the year. In accordance with the Institute of Internal Auditors' Financial Services Code of Practice, the Committee conducted its annual review of the independence and objectivity of the Group Chief Internal Auditor and concluded that independence and objectivity had been maintained throughout the year. The Committee undertook its annual review of, and approved, the GIA Charter and undertook a regular review of key performance indicators, including: audit plan delivery progress; resourcing and skill levels; and progress in completing actions to implement the recommendations from Deloitte's 2022 External Quality Assessment, which were incorporated into GIA's continuous improvement plan.\n\nBased on regular internal audit reporting, private sessions with the Group Chief Internal Auditor, and taking into consideration the externally facilitated evaluation noted above, the Committee is satisfied with the effectiveness of the GIA function and the appropriateness of its resources.\n\n## External audit\n\nThe Committee has the primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with, and performance of, the external auditor. This includes making recommendations for their appointment, reappointment, removal and approval of remuneration. The Committee reviews and approves the terms of engagement of the external auditor and monitors its compliance with the independence criteria in the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nThe Committee meets regularly and privately with the external auditor. These meetings allow for regular and open dialogue of any issues relevant to the Committee's work. Audit Committee members also meet regularly with management outside of formal Committee meetings to discuss the relationship with the external auditor and the efficiency of the audit process. Throughout the year, the Committee has received updates on the quality of the",

In addition, the Committee has overseen the succession of the KPMG lead audit partner in 2023.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nIn order to safeguard the auditor's independence and objectivity, the Group has in place a policy setting out the circumstances in which the external auditor may be engaged to provide services other than those covered by the audit. The policy applies to all Legal & General subsidiaries and other material entities over which the Group has significant influence. The core principle of the policy is that non-audit services (other than those legally required to be carried out by the Group's auditor) should be performed by the auditor only in certain controlled circumstances. The policy sets out those types of services that are permitted (permitted services) and those types of services which are not permitted. The policy pre-approves a number of the permitted services, provided the fee is below a certain threshold; all other permitted services must be specifically approved in advance by the Committee.\n\nThe policy is reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that it is fit for purpose and that it reflects applicable rules and guidelines. The policy is aligned with the FRC's requirements and includes the requirement to consider the self-review test under the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) Code of Ethics, applicable for periods beginning on or after 15 December 2022, before a proposed engagement is assigned. It is also aligned with KPMG's own internal policy on non-audit services for FTSE 350 companies, which broadly restricts non-audit work to services that are 'closely related' to the audit. Any changes to the policy are required to be approved by the Committee. This is in accordance with laws applicable in the UK and FRC guidance, pursuant to which audit committees of Public Interest Entities are required to approve non-audit services provided by their auditors to such entities; and subsidiary Public Interest Entities in the UK - such as Legal and General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS) - can rely on the approval of non-audit services by the ultimate parent's Board Audit Committee.\n\n## Appointment\n\nThe Company confirms that it has complied with requirements governing the appointment of an external auditor, notably the requirements of the Competition & Markets Authority contained in the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Uses of Competitive Tender Process and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, including requirements for mandatory audit firm rotation.\n\nFollowing a competitive tender carried out in 2016, KPMG was appointed as the Group's external auditor with effect from the financial year ended 31 December 2018. In May 2023, KPMG was reappointed as the Group's external auditor for the financial year ended 31 December 2023, which is their sixth year as the Group's external auditor. In accordance with the ICAEW's requirements, Salim Tharani stood down as KPMG's lead audit partner during 2023, and was replaced by Phil Smart, who had previously shadowed Mr Tharani during the 2022 audit.\n\nThe Committee considers the quality and effectiveness of the external audit and recommends to the Board, on an annual basis, whether to recommend the reappointment of the external auditor for shareholder approval. On the basis that KPMG continue to maintain their independence and objectivity, and the Committee continues to remain satisfied with their performance, there are no plans as at the date of this report to conduct a tender exercise for external audit services before the end of the current required period of 10 years. The Committee believes it would not be appropriate to tender before the end of this period as it recognises that, while it is important to ensure the audit firm remains objective and does not become overly familiar with management, there is an important balance to be struck with the investment of time required both from management and any completely new audit team for them to gain sufficient understanding of a large and complex organisation, such as Legal & General, to ensure a top-quality audit.\n\n## Audit fees\n\nThe Committee assesses the external auditor's fee structure, resources and terms of engagement annually. Total fees paid to the auditor for the year were \u00a323.1 million (2022: \u00a317.5 million), of which \u00a31.9 million (2022: \u00a31.7 million), was spent on non-audit and other assurance services. \u00a31.6 million (2022: \u00a31.6 million) was spent on audit-related services required by legislation, which is excluded from any calculation of the ratio of non-audit to audit fees in accordance with the UK FRC Revised Ethical Standard for Auditors (2019). Further details can be found in Note 29 to the consolidated financial statements. The non-audit fee represents 10% of the total audit fee for 2023.\n\nIncluded within KPMG's fees for 2023 are additional audit fees related to the implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, and specifically work to support KPMG's audit opinion in respect of the transitional impact to the Group's balance sheet and equity position as at 1 January 2023. The Committee is satisfied that this level of fee is appropriate in respect of the audit services required for the\n\nGroup and that an effective audit can be conducted for this fee. The Committee continues to work with KPMG to ensure costs remain appropriate and proportionate to the services provided.\n\n|                                        | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Audit                                  | 19.6   | 14.2   | 9.3    |\n| Audit-related required  by legislation | 1.6    | 1.6    | 1.3    |\n| Other audit-related                    | 1.0    | 0.9    | 1.2    |\n| Other assurance                        | 0.9    | 0.8    | 0.1    |\n| Non-assurance                          | -      | -      | -      |\n| Total                                  | 23.1   | 17.5   | 11.9   |\n\n## Assessment of independence and effectiveness\n\nThe Committee is responsible for assessing the effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the external auditor. This assessment is on-going throughout the year and concludes with a formal, internal, effectiveness review, which was conducted in December 2023. As part of the on-going assessment, the Committee assesses the external auditor against a number of criteria, including but not limited to: provision of timely and accurate industry-specific and technical knowledge, maintaining a professional and open dialogue with the Audit Committee Chair and members at all times, delivery of an efficient and effective audit, the ability to meet objectives within the agreed time frames and the quality of judgements and audit findings, management's response and stakeholder feedback. In addition, the Committee holds private meetings with the external auditor to discuss the audit process and relationship with management.\n\nOverall, the assessment of KPMG was positive, with a small number of areas noted for consideration in future audit cycles. Taking into account the result of all of the above, the Committee concluded that KPMG maintained its independence and objectivity and that the audit process was effective. Upon the Committee's recommendation, the Board has recommended that KPMG be reappointed as the Company's auditor, by shareholders, at the 2024 AGM.\n\nTushar Morzaria\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChair of the Audit Committee",

The Committee conducts a thorough review of the risk management framework on an annual basis to ensure it remains /fit for purpose.'\n\nI am pleased to present my report as your Chair of the Risk Committee. I joined the Committee upon appointment to the Board in 2018 and assumed the role of Chair in 2022. Since becoming Chair of the Committee, I have further developed my knowledge and understanding of the risk environment in which the Company operates and sought to ensure that the Committee continues to operate effectively. Throughout 2023, I have continued to engage with my fellow Committee members to understand their views, in particular, on any risk areas which they feel require further oversight and challenge. This has been supported by my active and regular engagement with key colleagues in the business, with particular emphasis on the support received from the Group Chief Risk Officer and his team.\n\n## Oversight of risk management\n\nIn a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, the Committee has continued to oversee, robustly challenge and provide advice to the Board, on the Group's current and future risk exposures and profile. During the year, geopolitical risks have continued to heighten with ongoing conflict and rising political tensions. Macroeconomic risks have also increased as many major economies faced slowing growth against a backdrop of high inflation, energy market shocks and rising interest rates, abating somewhat in the latter part of 2023. The Committee has continued to monitor the ongoing global economic uncertainties and, with the prospect of several important elections in the coming year, this will continue to remain an important focus for the Committee in 2024. Despite these challenging market conditions, the Company has remained resilient to a number of risk events and has largely continued to operate within risk appetite. The Committee, in conjunction with the Audit Committee, keeps under review the effectiveness of the Company's risk management and internal control systems, which monitors and reviews all material controls including financial,",

In addition, we closely monitor risk appetite and tolerance levels and challenge management to ensure these are regularly stress tested to ensure they are able to withstand wider macroeconomic risk events.\n\n## 2023 activity\n\nGiven the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, the Committee has spent a significant amount of time during the year hearing directly from the business, alongside risk and compliance colleagues, about how they are managing the associated risks and what mitigating actions are being taken. In addition, the Committee receives an update from the Group Chief Risk Officer at each meeting which covers an in-depth overview of the risk profile, outlook and landscape. During the year, the Committee paid close attention to the Group's capital and liquidity position, in light of the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape, and received in depth updates on credit, insurance, longevity and market risk. A particular area of focus for the Committee during the year centred around property risk. The UK commercial property markets continued to reflect the broader uncertainty in the economic outlook and the Committee paid close attention to the Company's exposure to commercial property, particularly the office sector, and the management action being taken to mitigate the risks.\n\nIn addition to the geopolitical and macroeconomic climate, the Committee has continued to focus on the management of the Group's non-financial risks. The Committee received regular updates, and challenged the progress made by management, on operational resilience, embedding the Consumer Duty regulations, change management, governance controls around technology and data risk and operational risks such as those related to conduct risk and ensuring appropriate mitigations are in place to prevent the facilitation of financial crime.\n\nAlongside the Group Chief Risk Officer's report, the Committee is provided with management information on risk appetite, comparing actual positions relative to the Group's risk appetite statement and quantitative analysis of the Group's exposures to financial and operational risks, including risk-based capital requirements in relation to the core risks implicit in the Group's businesses. The Committee also receives an assessment of the overall profile of conduct risks for the Group; analysis and trends in complaints data and a suite of customer service metrics designed to enable the Committee to assess the management of the customer journey.\n\n## Risk appetite review\n\nIn July 2023, the Committee considered the risk profile of the Group's strategic plan and its alignment with the Group's risk appetite. The Committee undertook a detailed review of the operation of the Group's strategic risk appetite and the key metrics and tolerances used to determine acceptable risk taking. As part of the review, refinements were recommended to the metrics to ensure a more reliable and accurate measure of the Group's performance against risk appetite. The Committee also conducted an annual review of emerging risks and continues to encourage management to be alert to areas of emerging risk, particularly in light of the rapidly evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical climate to ensure that the Company remains well diversified and robustly protected against market shocks.\n\n## Risk-based capital model\n\nThe Group's risk-based capital model (internal model) is used to determine the capital requirements for the Group and forms the calculation engine for the Solvency II internal model. During the year, the Committee reviewed and approved the internal model development plan and validation report. As part of this review the Committee takes into consideration:\n\n- \u00b7 key assumptions, methodologies and areas of expert judgement used within the model\n- \u00b7 activities undertaken to validate the outputs of the model\n- \u00b7 development of the model to ensure that it reflects the business lines and risk profile of the Group\n- \u00b7 processes to ensure that changes applied in the model are undertaken in a controlled manner, and in line with model development plans.\n\nIn addition, the Committee also reviewed and approved the 2023 recovery and resolution plans as well as ORSA policy and scenarios, which are an ongoing assessment of the risks to which the Group is exposed and an assessment of the capital resources available to ensure that the Group is able to sustain its business over the plan horizon.\n\n## Climate risk\n\nIt is widely recognised that actions taken today can influence the likelihood of different climate outcomes, and impact on future risk exposures. This, alongside climate scenario analysis, informs our risk management framework. During the year, the Committee considered the Group's climate risk management approach and reviewed and approved the 2022 Climate report, prepared in line with recommendations by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. In addition, the Committee reviewed and approved the Group's climate goals and commitments, including our stated\n\njourney to net zero, as well as the Company's Climate transition plan, which was presented for a shareholder advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting in 2023.\n\n## Working collaboratively\n\nThe Committee continued to work closely throughout the year with the Audit Committee on risk and control matters as well as the Remuneration Committee so that risk management and risk culture are properly considered in setting the Remuneration Policy and determining remuneration outcomes. In addition, the Committee also works closely with the Data and Technology Committee to consider technology risk. An important element of this will be the emerging risk and opportunities that Artificial Intelligence presents. The Committee also reviewed and approved the Group Technology Risk Policy and Technology Risk Appetite statements during the year.\n\nLegal & General has a strong subsidiary governance framework in place to support the Board in discharging its responsibilities for the Group. Directors of the Group's principal subsidiaries (LGAS and LGIM(H)) are members of the Risk Committee; this brings valuable insight, oversight and challenge to the Committee's discussions on specific aspects of the Group's operations. An overview of the Company's risk appetite and risk management approach, as well as our principal and emerging risks, can be found on pages 56 to 59.\n\n## 2024 priorities\n\nThe Committee has an important role in supporting the Board in the oversight and management of the risk framework. During 2024, the Committee will continue to focus on:\n\n- \u00b7 impacts and associated risks arising from the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, regulatory landscape including the UK Solvency reforms, and global climate change, with a focus on consideration of emerging risks\n- \u00b7 management of capital and liquidity risks\n- \u00b7 oversight of the current and emerging non-financial and conduct risk exposures of the Group, including operational resilience, change management and the embedding of the Consumer Duty regulation\n- \u00b7 review the output of the Bank of England's system-wide exploratory scenario exercise, investigating the behaviours of banks and non-bank financial institutions following a severe but plausible stress to financial markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGeorge Lewis\n\nChair of the Risk Committee",

With effect from 26 February 2024, I have stepped down from my role as Chair of the Committee, and have been succeeded by fellow non-executive director, Laura Wade-Gery. The Board considered Laura an excellent successor due to her established track record as a UK-listed company Remuneration Committee Chair and her strong understanding of the Committee's current workings and priorities. Laura fulfills the Code requirement for any appointee to the Remuneration Committee Chair role to have served on a Remuneration Committee for 12 months prior to appointment.

        "page_content": "customer and culture, and risk as well as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) metrics, as described in more detail on page 106. These act as a moderator to the overall AVP outcome.\n\nAs in previous years, the Committee chose to exclude the beneficial impact of mortality assumption changes from the financial results when determining bonus awards, resulting in bonus outcomes of 52.7% to 53.8% of maximum for the executive directors. Targets and outcomes are summarised in the 'Quick read' section on page 99 and in further detail on page 105.\n\n## Performance Share Plan (PSP)\n\nThe long-term incentive (PSP) awards granted in 2021 were subject to EPS growth and Total Shareholder Return (TSR) growth over the three-year period ended 31 December 2023.\n\nEPS growth is determined based on measuring the change in EPS over the three-year performance period. However, the introduction of IFRS 17 from 1 January 2023 prevents EPS from being measured on the same basis from the start of the period (on an IFRS 4 basis) to the end of the performance period (on an IFRS 17 basis). In order to fairly measure the EPS growth performance, the Committee has considered the annual change in each of the three years, as the EPS for 2022 has been reported on both an IFRS 4 and IFRS 17 basis. On this basis, EPS grew by 52.3% over the period (15.1% per annum). Further details on this are provided on page 107 of the report.\n\nTSR grew by 23.1%, out-performing the median of the FTSE 100, but below the median for the bespoke comparator group.\n\nThis resulted in 61.1% of the 2021 PSP award vesting. In accordance with the remuneration policy, the Committee assessed the formulaic outcome, considering overall performance, risk management progress against ESG commitments, and other capital and solvency measures, and determined that the outcome was appropriate in all the circumstances, and no downward adjustment was required. Under the terms of the PSP plan for executive directors, the vested shares will be deferred for a further two years and released in 2026. The PSP performance targets and outcomes are summarised in the 'Quick read' section on page 99.\n\n## Board changes Sir Nigel Wilson\n\nIn January 2023, we announced Sir Nigel Wilson's intention to retire as CEO of Legal & General Group. Sir Nigel agreed to continue in the role until a successor was appointed and to support a smooth transition following their appointment. In June 2023, we announced that Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es would be appointed as the new CEO,\n\nsubject to regulatory approval. Regulatory approval for the appointment was confirmed in October 2023 and Ant\u00f3nio joined the Board as Group CEO on 1 January 2024.\n\nSir Nigel's departure was confirmed by the Company once regulatory approval for Ant\u00f3nio's appointment had been received and he will remain employed for his 12 month notice period in order to ensure a smooth transition. Consistent with his service contract and the executive remuneration policy, Sir Nigel will continue to receive his current base pay and benefits until his employment ends. Sir Nigel will not receive an AVP award for performance in 2024 nor will he receive a PSP award in 2024.\n\nConsistent with the remuneration policy and the rules of the SBP and PSP, Sir Nigel will be a good leaver and as such his outstanding share awards will be treated in line with the good leaver provisions in the respective plan rules. His deferred AVP awards for 2021, 2022 and 2023 will vest three years from the date of grant. His outstanding PSP awards will be pro-rated with reference to the proportion of the performance period that has elapsed upon leaving and will then vest based on performance to the end of the performance period and will be released, subject to performance, on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.\n\nSir Nigel will retain a shareholding in Legal & General Group of at least 325% of base pay for two years post his departure from the Board in line with the Director's remuneration policy.\n\n## Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es\n\n## Context\n\nAs reported previously, following a rigorous, global, selection process managed by Sir John Kingman, Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es was appointed as CEO in June 2023, and took up his post formally on 1 January 2024.\n\nWhen determining an appropriate remuneration package, the Committee considered our current remuneration practices and shareholder approved remuneration policy, relevant market practice and Ant\u00f3nio's remuneration levels at his previous employer. As part of the Remuneration Policy renewal last year, we made a number of changes to assist the Committee in a recruitment scenario.\n\nThis policy was supported by more than 95% of shareholders and this additional flexibility was critical in allowing us to secure Ant\u00f3nio's appointment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has continued to be mindful of both the immediate and long-term /financial wellbeing of the wider workforce, particularly in these economically uncertain and challenging times. We made a one o/ff payment of \u00a3750 in July 2023 and approved an increase in the employer contribution to pension of 1% of base pay e/ffective from 1 April 2024, with a view to aligning employer pension contributions with those for senior management.'",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report on remuneration continued\n\nThe total remuneration package provided to Ant\u00f3nio at his previous employer was significantly higher than both the previous package provided to Nigel Wilson and the package Ant\u00f3nio is now receiving at Legal & General.\n\n## Ongoing remuneration policy\n\nWhen determining the final remuneration package for Ant\u00f3nio, the Committee adopted a number of principles. Firstly, in acknowledgment of the fact that Ant\u00f3nio's pay would be higher than Nigel's, we sought to deliver the majority of the increase through variable pay rather than fixed pay. This ensured that a material portion of pay was linked to performance, and therefore would only be realised if stretching performance targets were met. Doing so also means we could moderate the level of fixed pay required to secure Ant\u00f3nio's appointment, where we know absolute levels of fixed pay are a focus area of investors.\n\nThe second key principle the Committee adopted was to ensure that the remuneration package we offered was broadly in line with other FTSE 100 companies. This ensured that we operated within market norms and shareholders' expectations. With this in mind Ant\u00f3nio's remuneration package consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 a base salary of \u00a31,175k. This is between the median and upper quartile of FTSE 100 financial services companies\n- \u00b7 pension of 10% of salary, in line with the current rate offered to the wider workforce\n- \u00b7 benefits in line with our remuneration policy, including relocation support to assist with Ant\u00f3nio's move from Spain, which will be provided for 12 months\n- \u00b7 a maximum bonus of 200% of salary and maximum PSP of 300% of salary. These are the maximum levels of remuneration we can offer under our remuneration policy and are also broadly in line with the median opportunities offered by other FTSE 100 financial services companies.\n\nThis resulted in a total remuneration package positioned between the median and upper quartile of other FTSE 100 financial services companies, which is appropriate in the context of Legal & General's size and complexity.\n\n## Replacement award\n\nAs is common practice in financial services, and particularly in banking, Ant\u00f3nio had numerous unvested awards which he would forfeit as a result of joining Legal & General. In line with our remuneration policy, the Committee has agreed to buy out these awards with equivalent Legal & General awards,\n\nensuring Ant\u00f3nio is immediately aligned to the Legal & General share price and shareholder interests.\n\nAll awards will be bought out on a 'like for like basis', meaning that:\n\n- \u00b7 deferred cash and share awards will be bought out in cash/shares respectively\n- \u00b7 all replacement awards will have identical vesting/deferral periods to the original awards\n- \u00b7 for all awards with performance conditions we calculated how performance was tracking against targets in order to determine a fair value for each award.\n\nThe total value of these buyout awards is significant, however the Committee is comfortable that these represent the genuine levels of awards being foregone and that the awards were critical to securing Ant\u00f3nio's appointment. The majority of these awards will be granted in shares with a grant date of 20 March 2024, creating immediate alignment to Legal & General's performance and share price. Additionally, all awards will be subject to relevant deferral, malus and clawback provisions. In line with our remuneration policy all awards will be subject to forfeiture and clawback if Ant\u00f3nio leaves the Company voluntarily within three years.\n\n## Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2024\n\n## Base pay\n\nHaving reviewed pay and conditions across the Group, and considered the broader market and overall business performance, the Committee have determined to increase base pay for Jeff Davies by 4.3% with effect from 1 March 2024. For 2024, the average base pay increase for UK employees is expected to be around 4.3% but with higher increases for lower paid employees. The first review of base pay for Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es will be in 2025 and so his base pay will remain unchanged during 2024.\n\n## Annual Bonus\n\nThe proportion of the annual bonus measures assessed against financial metrics will remain 70%, with 30% assessed against non-financial objectives. Financial metrics will cover a range of KPIs assessing profitability and growth, aligned to Ant\u00f3nio's strategic review.\n\n## PSP\n\nIn order to place further emphasis on the important influence the Company has on climate, the Committee have determined to include a strategic measure with a 20% weighting based on progress against our published climate commitments. The remaining 80% will be split equally between EPS growth and relative TSR performance. Further details, including the quantitative climate targets, are shown on page 108.\n\n## Consideration of the wider workforce\n\nThe Committee has regard for the remuneration of all employees across the Group. The policies and practices applying to executive directors are the same as for the wider workforce in most instances, although quantum and participation by location and grade may vary.\n\nThe Committee has continued to be mindful of both the immediate and longer term financial wellbeing of the wider workforce, particularly in these economically uncertain and challenging times. We made a one off payment of \u00a3750 in July 2023 to lower paid employees to mitigate inflation pressures, in addition to the \u00a31,500 payment made in 2022. The Committee also reviewed pension provisions for UK employees below senior management and approved an increase to the employer contribution to pension of 1% of base pay effective from 1 April 2024 with a view to aligning employer pension contributions with those for senior management over the next 5 years.\n\nIn addition, Legal & General continues to provide further financial support to all UK employees including SmartSaving (the employee discount scheme) and preferential borrow/save/advance finance facilities through our partner organisation, Salary Finance.\n\nFor 2024 a stratified approach to base pay increases has been adopted with higher percentage increases applied to employees in lower paid roles, reflecting their proportionally greater exposure to price inflation, with those in more junior roles receiving a base pay increase of 5%.\n\nMost employees are eligible to be considered for a bonus payment based on group, divisional, individual and/or other specific performance metrics, with bonuses for performance during 2023 paid shortly after the year end, at the same time as bonuses for executive directors.\n\nThe Committee continues to maintain an oversight of progress on continuing work on diversity and inclusion and achieving a further narrowing of the gender pay gap. Further details on this can be found on page 49 and in our Social impact report. I hope that you will find this report a clear account of the Committee's considerations and decisions, and the remuneration outcomes for the year.\n\nLesley Knox\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee",

Exceptionally, the Committee reserves the right  to accelerate vesting or payment due, for example, in the case of terminal illness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Other payments               | The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in connection with a director's cessation of office/  employment where the payments are made in good faith in the discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of  damages for breach of such obligation) or by way of settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of the  director's office/ employment, or for any fees for outplacement assistance and/ or director's legal and/ or professional advice  fees in connection with his/ her cessation of office/ employment.                                                                                                                                     |\n\n'Good leaver' circumstances are leaving due to death, disability, ill-health or injury, redundancy, retirement with company agreement, the individual's employing company/ business ceasing to be part of the Group, or other circumstances at the Committee's discretion. For all other leavers, unvested awards lapse.\n\nAwards will generally vest early upon a takeover of the Company, merger or other corporate reorganisation. Alternatively participants may be allowed or required to exchange their awards for new awards. If there is a demerger, delisting or special dividend or other transaction which may affect the share price, the Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a takeover.",

        "page_content": "## Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es Remuneration Disclosure\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es was formally appointed as Group CEO from 1 January 2024, following the announcement of his appointment in June 2023. As set out in the Chair's letter on page 62, when determining an appropriate remuneration package the Committee considered our current remuneration practices and shareholder approved Remuneration Policy, relevant market practice and Ant\u00f3nio's remuneration levels at his previous employer.\n\n## Ongoing remuneration package\n\nOn appointment, the key elements of Ant\u00f3nio's remuneration package will consist of:\n\n- \u00b7  a base pay of \u00a31,175k, which is between the median and upper quartile of FTSE 100 financial services companies\n- \u00b7  pension of 10% of salary, in line with the rate offered to the wider workforce during 2023\n- \u00b7  benefits in line with our remuneration policy, including relocation support to assist with Ant\u00f3nio's move from Spain. Relocation support is provided for 12 months only\n- \u00b7  a maximum AVP of 200% of base pay\n- \u00b7  a maximum PSP of 300% of base pay.\n\nThese are the maximum AVP and PSP levels of remuneration we can offer under our remuneration policy and are also broadly the median opportunities of other FTSE 100 financial services companies.\n\n## Replacement award\n\nAs is common practice in Financial Services, and in particular in banking, Ant\u00f3nio had numerous unvested awards which he forfeited as a result of joining Legal & General. Our policy on recruitment remuneration provides, that in these circumstance, the Committee may grant awards equivalent to the remuneration arrangements forfeited upon leaving the previous employer, taking into consideration relevant factors including but not limited to, the form of the award, any performance conditions attached to those awards, the vesting profile and likelihood of vesting and any relevant regulatory requirements and guidance in relation to awards.\n\nAll awards will be replaced on a 'like for like basis', meaning that:\n\n- \u00b7  deferred cash and share awards have been bought out in cash/ shares respectively\n- \u00b7  all buyout awards will have identical vesting/ deferral periods to the original awards\n- \u00b7  for all awards with performance conditions we have calculated how performance was tracking against targets in order to determine a fair value for each award.\n\nAccordingly, in accordance with our policy on recruitment remuneration, the following cash and share awards will be granted to Ant\u00f3nio, subject to malus and clawback, matching as close as possible both the expected value and timescale to vesting of his forfeited Santander awards.\n\nIn recognition of the forfeit of annual bonus for 2023 from Ant\u00f3nio's previous employer, a payment of \u00a33,079,242 will be awarded of which 50% will be paid in cash at the end of March 2024 and 50% will be granted as shares in April 2024, vesting 3 years from the date of grant.\n\nIn addition, in recognition of the forfeit of other unvested awards the following cash and share awards will be made:\n\n## Cash awards\n\n| Payment date   | Value    |\n|----------------|----------|\n| March 2024     | \u00a3342,352 |\n| March 2025     | \u00a3345,718 |\n| March 2026     | \u00a3345,718 |\n| March 2027     | \u00a3253,168 |\n| March 2028     | \u00a3132,612 |\n\n## Share awards\n\n| Grant date   | Vesting date   | Award Value   | No. of Shares   | Effective grant price 1   |\n|--------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|\n| March 2024   | March 2024     | \u00a3410,259      | 172,617         | \u00a32.377                    |\n| March 2024   | December 2024  | \u00a3405,256      | 170,512         | \u00a32.377                    |\n| March 2024   | March 2025     | \u00a3513,595      | 216,096         | \u00a32.377                    |\n| March 2024   | December 2025  | \u00a3202,628      | 85,256          | \u00a32.377                    |\n| March 2024   | March 2026     | \u00a3513,595      | 216,096         | \u00a32.377                    |\n| March 2024   | December 2026  | \u00a3202,628      | 85,256          | \u00a32.377                    |\n| March 2024   | March 2027     | \u00a3407,269      | 171,359         | \u00a32.377                    |\n| March 2024   | March 2028     | \u00a3267,260      | 112,450         | \u00a32.377                    |\n\n- 1.

A summary of the outcome per measure is below, with further detail provided on page 108.\n\n| Perfo rmance  measure           | Weighting   | Outcome (% of maximum)   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| TSR vs FTSE 100                 | 25%         | 11.1%                    |\n| TSR vs bespoke comparator group | 25%         | 0.0%                     |\n| EPS growth (% p.a.)             | 50%         | 50.0%                    |\n| Total (% of maximum)            | 100%        | 61.1%                    |\n\nThe bespoke comparator group comprises:\n\nAbrdn, Aegon, Ageas, Allianz, Assicurazioni Generali, Aviva, AXA, Gjensidige Forsikring, Hannover Rueck, Lincoln National, Mapfre, M&G, Metlife, Muenchener Ruck, NN Group, Phoenix Group, Principal Financial, Prudential, Prudential Financial, Sampo A, Swiss Re, Talanx, Zurich Insurance Group.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the company's overall performance taking into consideration an assessment of Solvency II performance and progress against long-term environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives. The Committee was satisfied that the PSP awards should vest in accordance with the TSR and EPS growth outcomes.\n\n## Approach to calculation of EPS growth\n\nEPS growth is determined based on measuring the change in EPS over the 3 year performance period. However, as previously indicated, the introduction of IFRS 17 prevents EPS from being measured on the same basis from the start of the performance period (where EPS was reported based on IFRS 4) to the end of the performance period (where EPS was reported based on IFRS 17). In order to fairly measure the EPS growth performance, the Committee has considered the annual change in each of the three years, as the EPS for 2022 has been reported on both an IFRS 4 and IFRS 17 basis. The basis for the calculation is illustrated in the table below:\n\n|        | Year on year EPS growth   | Year on year EPS growth   | Year on year EPS growth   | Year on year EPS growth   | EPS growth p.a. over  3-year performance   |\n|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|        | Accounting Standard       | 2020 to 2021              | 2021 to 2022              | period 2022 to 2023       | EPS growth p.a. over  3-year performance   |\n| IFRS 4 | 75.4%                     |                           | 12.0%                     | 15.1%                     | Adjusted EPS                               |\n| IFRS 4 | IFRS 17                   |                           |                           | (22.4)%                   | Adjusted EPS                               |",

Sim\u00f5es will be granted an award with a face value of 300% of base pay and Jeff Davies will be granted an award with a face value of 250% of base pay\n\nFor the 2024 award, the following performance measures will be used:\n\n- \u00b7 TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100 (20% of award)\n- \u00b7 TSR performance relative to a bespoke comparator group of companies (20% of award), noting that the bespoke comparator group will be unchanged from the 2023 PSP\n- \u00b7 EPS growth (40% of award)\n- \u00b7 progress against published commitments in our Climate transition plan, aligned to our three-pillar strategy of Invest, Influence, Operate (20% of award) as detailed in the table on the following page.\n\nVesting of the overall awards will also be subject to assessment against Solvency II objectives.\n\nIn setting targets for the 2024 PSP awards the Committee have considered:\n\n- \u00b7 the business plan over the next three years, market expectations of performance\n- \u00b7 the impact of the new IFRS 17 accounting standard on the timing of the reporting of profit\n- \u00b7 progress against our published commitments with the Climate transition plan and projected progress over the performance period.\n\nBased on these considerations the Committee considered it appropriate to for vesting to be based on performance as set out in the table on the

If such considerations mean that the formulaic outcome of the vesting is not considered to be justified, the Committee can amend the vesting downwards (but not increase the level of vesting).\n\n## Statement of directors' shareholding and share interests\n\nTotal shareholding of executive directors:\n\n|                  |         |                                |                                      | Total vested and  unvested shares  (excludes any   |                                       | Shares sold or acquired during the period  1 January 2024 and 5 March 2024   | Shares sold or acquired during the period  1 January 2024 and 5 March 2024   |\n|------------------|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                  | Type    | Owned outright/  vested shares | Subject to deferral/  holding period | shares with  performance  conditions)              | Subject to   performance   conditions | Owned outright/  vested shares                                               | Subject to deferral/ holding period                                          |\n| Sir Nigel Wilson | Shares  | 3,937,380                      | 611,669                              | 4,549,049                                          | -                                     | -                                                                            | -                                                                            |\n|                  | ESP     | 24,078                         | 6,712                                | 30,790                                             | -                                     | 150                                                                          | 85                                                                           |\n|                  | Options | -                              | 1,245,121                            | 1,245,121                                          | 2,909,143                             | -                                                                            | -                                                                            |\n| Jeff Davies      | Shares  | 583,235                        | 369,235                              | 952,470                                            | -                                     | -                                                                            | -                                                                            |\n|                  | ESP     | 5,678                          | 993                                  | 6,671                                              | -                                     | 150                                                                          | 85                                                                           |\n|                  | Options | -                              | 743,594                              | 743,594                                            | 1,777,473                             | -                                                                            | -                                                                            |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Closing share price as at 31 December 2023: 251.1p\n\n## Notes\n\nShares used for the above calculation exclude those with performance conditions, any unexercised options, those shares subject to a period of deferral and any shares held in a private trust where the executive director is not a trustee. They include vested shares where the executive director has beneficial ownership, shares independently acquired in the market and those held by a spouse or civil partner or dependant child under the age of 18 years.\n\nAlthough the shareholding requirement is not contractually binding, executive directors are expected to retain any after tax vested share awards until their shareholding requirements are met, and maintain that shareholding requirement (or their actual shareholding at the date of leaving, if lower) for at least two years after leaving employment. The Committee retains the discretion to withhold future grants under the PSP if executives are not making sufficient progress towards their shareholding requirement. Once shareholding requirements have been met, executive directors may sell shares in excess of the shareholding requirement if they wish. The Committee has discretion to allow executive directors to sell shares prior to the shareholding requirement being met in extenuating situations, for example, a change to personal circumstances or ill health, etc.\n\n## Share options exercised during 2023\n\nPSP awards may be granted in the form of nil-cost options with an exercise date no earlier than the normal vesting date. Executive directors may also participate in the company's ShareSave Plan. Where such share awards have been exercised during 2023 they are shown below:\n\n|                    |               |                  |               | Share price at   date of exercise   | Gain    |\n|--------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|---------|\n| Executive director | Date of grant | Shares exercised | Exercise date | \u00a3                                   | \u00a3       |\n| Sir Nigel Wilson   | 16/04/2018    | 240,105          | 19/04/2023    | 2.533                               | 608,186 |\n| Jeff Davies        | 16/04/2018    | 132,097          | 17/04/2023    | 2.490                               | 328,922 |\n| Jeff Davies        | 03/04/2020    | 4,522            | 01/06/2023    | 2.288                               | 1,348   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consistent with his service contract and the executive remuneration policy, Sir Nigel will continue to receive his current base pay, pension and benefits until his retirement. Sir Nigel will not receive an AVP award for performance in 2024 nor will he receive a PSP award in 2024.\n\nConsistent with the remuneration policy and the rules of the SBP and PSP, Sir Nigel will be a good leaver and as such his outstanding share awards will be treated in line with the good leaver provisions in the respective plan rules.\n\n## Unvested deferred share awards\n\nSir Nigel's deferred AVP, awarded as restricted shares, for 2021, 2022 and 2023 will vest in accordance with the ordinary timescale, three years from the date of grant, as set out in the table below.\n\n|   AVP award | Grant Date   | Vesting Date   | Value of award   | No. of shares granted   | Grant price   |\n|-------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------------|\n|        2020 | 13/04/2021   | 13/04/2024     | \u00a3172,850         | 58,520                  | \u00a32.954        |\n|        2021 | 19/04/2022   | 19/04/2025     | \u00a3694,200         | 255,220                 | \u00a32.720        |\n|        2022 | 06/04/2023   | 06/04/2026     | \u00a3705,000         | 297,929                 | \u00a32.366        |\n\nIn addition, as set out on page 107, 50% of Sir Nigel's FY23 AVP will be deferred and awarded as restricted shares vesting in April 2027.\n\n## Unvested PSP awards\n\nIn accordance with the rules of the PSP, upon retirement, a participant remains eligible to receive a proportion of their PSP awards already granted, pro-rated for the period through to leaving, and subject to the normal performance conditions over the full performance period, and released in accordance with the normal timescale.\n\nDetails of Sir Nigel's unvested PSP awards and the maximum number of shares which may vest after pro-rating are shown in the table below.\n\n| Start date   | End date   | Date exercisable   | No. of shares granted   | Pro-rating   | Maximum no. of shares vesting   |\n|--------------|------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------|\n| 01/01/2022   | 31/12/2024 | 19/04/2027         | 948,380                 | 94%          | 894,731                         |\n| 01/01/2023   | 31/12/2025 | 06/04/2028         | 1,128,422               | 61%          | 687,761                         |\n\nSir Nigel will retain a shareholding in Legal & General Group of at least 325% of base pay for two years post-retirement in line with the executive remuneration policy post-cessation shareholding requirements.\n\n## Non-executive directors' remuneration - 2023\n\n## Non-executive directors' fees\n\nThe fees for the Chair and non-executive directors were reviewed during 2023 and with effect from 1 August 2023 the fee for the Chair was increased from \u00a3577,500 to \u00a3603,500.

Remuneration is considered within the overall context of the Group's sector and the markets in which it operates. The policy for the majority of employees is to pay around the relevant mid-market range with a competitive package designed to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, and with an appropriate proportion of total remuneration dependent upon performance.\n\nWe define core remuneration as base pay, annual bonus and other benefits such as pension. Key employees are also eligible to participate in a long-term incentive plan, typically either the Share Bonus Plan (SBP) for the majority of employees or the Performance Share Plan (PSP) for the most senior management.\n\n## Summary of the remuneration structure for employees below the Board\n\n| Element               | Policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Base pay              | We aim to attract and retain key employees by paying base pay which delivers competitive total remuneration.

Part of the pay review process is an annual equal pay review that reviews pay and bonus decisions by gender, ethnicity, age and full-time versus part-time working. In addition, it considers the application of the pay policy more widely, in particular looking at decisions made in the annual pay review across grades, functions and divisions.\n\n## Gender pay reporting\n\nThe Group has published a new Social impact report, which contains the statutory disclosure of our gender pay gap for 2023.\n\n## Pay ratio in relation to the Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nSince 2016 we have voluntarily disclosed details of the pay ratio in relation to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the wider UK employee population. From 2018 we made some amendments to how we report the information in order to align with the reporting requirements set out by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), which came into effect for financial years starting 1 January 2019.\n\nThe tables below provide the ratio between the base pay and single figure total remuneration of the Group Chief Executive Officer and the base pay and total remuneration of UK employees at the upper quartile (75th percentile), median (50th percentile) and lower quartile (25th percentile).\n\n## Total remuneration\n\n|      |        | Pay ratio       | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio       | All UK employees \u00a3   | All UK employees \u00a3   | All UK employees \u00a3   |\n|------|--------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Year | Method | 75th percentile | Median      | 25th percentile | 75th percentile      | Median               | 25th percentile      |\n| 2023 | B      | 33              | 54          | 95              | 97,774               | 59,094               | 33,950               |\n| 2022 | A      | 46              | 77          | 135             | 87,152               | 51,834               | 29,804               |\n| 2021 | A      | 52              | 88          | 146             | 82,475               | 49,226               | 29,531               |\n| 2020 | A      | 26              | 48          | 81              | 78,989               | 43,726               | 25,839               |\n| 2019 | A      | 61              | 105         | 167             | 70,892               | 40,982               | 25,814               |\n| 2018 | A      | 49              | 83          | 132             | 69,923               | 40,814               | 25,730               |\n| 2017 | A      | 52              | 89          | 137             | 66,572               | 38,802               | 25,023               |\n\n## Base pay\n\n|      |        | Pay ratio       | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio       | All UK employees \u00a3   | All UK employees \u00a3   | All UK employees \u00a3   |\n|------|--------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Year | Method | 75th percentile | Median      | 25th percentile | 75th percentile      | Median               | 25th percentile      |\n| 2023 | B      | 13              | 22          | 36              | 79,125               | 48,069               | 30,000               |\n| 2022 | A      | 14              | 23          | 38              | 72,530               | 44,549               | 26,875               |\n| 2021 | A      | 14              | 23          | 38              | 68,675               | 42,444               | 26,000               |\n| 2020 | A      | 15              | 26          | 42              | 65,101               | 37,677               | 23,232               |\n| 2019 | A      | 16              | 27          | 42              | 60,000               | 35,000               | 22,550               |\n| 2018 | A      | 16              | 27          | 41              | 57,853               | 34,475               | 22,781               |\n| 2017 | A      | 16              | 27          | 42              | 58,020               | 33,649               | 22,148               |\n\n## Pay ratio commentary\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023 the ratio of total remuneration for the Group CEO compared to UK employees has decreased. The decrease is principally the result of the lower value of variable remuneration for the Group CEO in 2023, in particular the lower AVP award, which has contributed to around a 20% reduction in the single figure total remuneration when compared with 2022. Variable remuneration makes up a greater proportion of remuneration for Executive Directors and senior managers compared to the wider workforce and is more directly linked to financial performance.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 permit different options for calculating the pay ratio. We have chosen option B as our method for calculating the pay ratio for 2023, consistent with the methodology for gender pay reporting. The total remuneration figures for the UK employees are based on salaries at 1 December 2023. Bonus amounts for 2023 are not able to be determined for some eligible employees until after publication of this report, and therefore it is not possible to determine the exact 2023 total remuneration for all UK employees as is required for option A within this timescale. For completeness and transparency, we have included the pay ratios based on the option A method for previous years and we will also retrospectively disclose the pay ratio for 2023 based on the option A method in the 2024 report. We do not believe that this will result in pay ratio figures that are materially different to the 2023 figures disclosed above.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Social impact report\n\nOur 2023 Social impact report is available on our Group website.

The increase in fees for non-executive directors of the company reflects the increases in committee membership fees as well as changes in the membership of the committees.\n- 2. Tushar Morzaria and Carolyn Johnson were appointed to the Board on 22 May 2022 and 17 June 2022 respectively, and the percentage increases for these non-executive directors are based on the change in annualised fees for 2022 compared with 2023.\n- 3.   The increase in fees for Laura Wade-Gery reflects her increased committee memberships and the increase in fee for her role as the Chair of the Data and Technology Committee.\n\nAs with prior years, the whole UK employee population has been selected as the comparator group. This group was chosen because it includes a wider cross section of the Group's employees. The increase in benefits for the employee comparator group relates to the impact of base pay increases.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\nThe chart opposite shows the relative importance of expenditure on pay compared to share dividends, adjusted operating profit and tax for the year. Adjusted operating profit has been shown because it is a key performance indicator of the business. Further information on tax is on pages 233 to 237. No share buybacks were made in 2022 or 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The members of the RSC include the Group Chief Risk Officer, Non-financial Risk Director, Regulatory Risk Director, LGIM Chief Compliance Officer, the Director of Group Finance, the Group Reward Director and the Head of Executive Compensation.\n\nWhere a business unit tables a proposal for consideration, the relevant business manager is required to attend the RSC meeting to explain the background and to answer any questions from the RSC.\n\n## Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function\n\nThe Remuneration Committee also works closely with the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function with respect to remuneration proposals.\n\nIn particular, the function reports to the Committee on an annual basis on whether any risks have been taken outside of pre-agreed parameters, whether there have been regulatory breaches, or whether they are aware of any other considerations that may lead the Committee to consider whether it should impact payments to employees (including in particular the executive directors and Code staff).\n\nThe Group Chief Risk Officer also specifically looks at the overall risk profile of the Group and whether executive directors have achieved objectives within the Group's accepted risk appetite, and also reviews the executive directors' objectives for the forthcoming year to ensure they are in line with the risk parameters.\n\nSince the implementation of a new Solvency II remuneration policy in 2016, the scope of the Group Chief Risk Officer's report has been extended to consider whether there are any risk considerations which may warrant adjustments to the overall level of corporate annual variable pay awards.\n\n## Engagement with key stakeholders\n\nThe Committee seeks to maintain an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance and any changes to the Group's executive pay arrangements. During 2022, we reviewed our approach to remuneration in the context of future business strategy, updated investor guidelines and evolving best practice, and sought feedback from shareholders and representative bodies. The responses that we received helped shape our thinking with respect to the new remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM in May 2023.\n\nDuring 2024 the Committee will continue to closely examine our remuneration principles and policies to ensure they remain appropriate in the context of future business strategy, updated investor guidelines and evolving best practice and will consult with the Group's largest shareholders on any proposed changes.\n\nWe engaged regularly with our workforce throughout 2023, including via our workforce representative bodies Unite (the trade union) and our Management Consultative Forum on a number of topics, including pay, and propose to continue this dialogue in 2024, including in relation to our new remuneration policy.",

Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion and matters included in this report are consistent with those discussed and included in our reporting to the Audit Committee.\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\n## 2. Overview of our audit\n\n## Factors driving our view of risks\n\nFollowing our 2022 audit, and considering developments affecting the Group since then, we have updated our audit risk assessment for Key Audit Matters (KAMs) previously identified.\n\nThe risk associated with the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities KAM (4.1) is predominantly driven by the inherent subjectivity associated with the longevity, expense and credit risk assumptions for UK annuity policyholder liabilities. We continue to consider the impact of external factors such as the current uncertain economic conditions including high inflation and higher market interest rates affecting the credit risk of assets backing annuity liabilities and the result of excess deaths on longevity assumptions. The risk in the current year has been further elevated due to the first time adoption of IFRS 17 Insurance contracts requiring certain methodologies and assumptions to be determined for the first time and applied retrospectively.\n\nThe risk associated with the valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments KAM (4.2) is predominantly driven by the significant estimation uncertainty associated with valuing Level 3 investments, specifically UK lifetime mortgages, private credit portfolios, and investment property.\n\nWe have removed the pre-transition IFRS 17 insurance contract disclosure KAM from our 2022 report and included the relevant risks within the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities KAM (4.1).\n\nThe continuing financial significance of the parent company's investment in subsidiaries drives the identification of recoverability of the parent company's investment in subsidiaries as a key area of focus for the parent company's audit (4.3).\n\n## Audit Committee interaction\n\nDuring the year, the Audit Committee met 6 times. KPMG are invited to attend all Audit Committee meetings and are provided with an opportunity to meet with the Audit Committee in private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out communications with the Audit Committee in Section 4, including matters that required particular judgement.\n\nThe matters included in the Audit Committee report on page 86 are materially consistent with our observations of those meetings.\n\n## Our independence\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\nWe have not performed any non-audit services during 2023 or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditor by the directors for the year ended 31 December 2018. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 6 financial years ended 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Group engagement partner is required to rotate every 5 years. As these are the first set of the Group's financial statements signed by Philip Smart, he will be required to rotate off after the 2027 audit.\n\nThe average tenure of partners responsible for component audits as set out in Section 7 below is 3 years, with the shortest being 1 and the longest being 5.\n\n| Total audit fee                                            | \u00a319.6m      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Audit related fees (including interim review)              | \u00a32.6m       |\n| Other services                                             | \u00a30.9m       |\n| Non-audit fee as a % of total audit and audit related fees | 4.1%        |\n| Date first appointed                                       | 17 May 2018 |\n| Uninterrupted audit tenure                                 | 6 years     |\n| Next financial period which requires a tender              | 2028        |\n| Tenure of Group engagement partner                         | 1 year      |\n| Average tenure of component signing partners               | 3 years     |\n\n| Key audit matters                                                                    | vs 2022   |   Item |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|\n| Valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities                                     |           |    4.1 |\n| Valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments                                     |           |    4.2 |\n| Parent company risk: Recoverability of parent  company's investments in subsidiaries |           |    4.3 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Materiality (Item 6 below)\n\nThe scope of our work is influenced by our view of materiality and our assessed risk of material misstatement.\n\nWe have determined overall materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole at \u00a382.9m (2022: \u00a3113.0m) and for the parent company financial statements as a whole at \u00a333.0m (2022: \u00a345.0m).\n\nConsistent with 2022, we determined that profit before tax from continuing operations (PBTCO) normalised to exclude this year's investment and other variances and losses attributable to non-controlling interests remains the benchmark for the Group due to its importance to users of the financial statements because the share price is more sensitive to changes in the PBTCO than other metrics. As such, we based our Group materiality on the normalised PBTCO of which it represents 4.87% (2022: 4.71% with reference to a benchmark under IFRS 4).\n\nIn addition, we applied materiality of \u00a33.3bn (2022: \u00a33.3bn) to the unit linked assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Income Statement and related notes, of which it represents 0.9% (2022: 0.9%) of unit linked assets and liabilities, in accordance with FRC Practice Note 20 The Audit of Insurers in the United Kingdom.\n\nMateriality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a333.0m (2022: \u00a345.0m), which is the component materiality for the parent company determined by the Group audit engagement team. This is lower than the materiality we would otherwise have determined with reference to parent company net assets (2022: total assets), of which it represents 0.47% (2022: 0.36%). We selected net assets as the benchmark in the current period due to the users of the financial statements focus on the parent entity's capital and distributions.\n\n## Group scope (Item 7 below)\n\nWe have performed risk assessment and planning procedures to determine which of the Group's components are likely to include risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, the type of procedures to be performed at these components and the extent of involvement required from our component auditors around the world.\n\nWe have performed audit procedures centrally across the Group, set out in more detail in Section 7.\n\nOf the Group's 16 (2022: 12) in-scope reporting components, we subjected 7 (2022: 7) to full scope audits for Group purposes, 3 (2022: 1) to audit of account balance and 6 (2022: 4) to specified risk-focused audit procedures. The latter were not individually financially significant enough to require a full scope audit for Group purposes but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed. We have increased our in-scope reporting components in 2023 as a result of the reduction in insurance profits under IFRS 17 as a portion of the Group's profit before tax to ensure we have sufficient coverage over profit metrics. The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite.\n\nIn addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components, set out in more detail in Section 7. For the residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.\n\nThe Group team visited component locations in London, Edinburgh, and Baltimore, USA to assess the audit risk and strategy and the component team responses and findings to the identified risks. Video and telephone conference meetings were also held with those component auditors that were not physically visited. At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then performed by the component auditor. Further details are set out in Section 7.\n\nWe consider the scope of our audit, as communicated to the Audit Committee, to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Materiality levels used in our audit Materiality levels used in our audit Group   | 82.9                                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 113.0                                                                             | 113.0                                |\n| GPM 53.8                                                                          | GPM 53.8                             |\n| 53.0                                                                              | 53.0                                 |\n| 84.0                                                                              | 84.0                                 |\n| LCM                                                                               | LCM                                  |\n| 12.0                                                                              |                                      |\n| 16.0                                                                              | Group Materiality                    |\n| AMPT GPM                                                                          | Group Performance Materiality        |\n| 3.7                                                                               |                                      |\n| HCM                                                                               | Highest Component Materiality        |\n| 5.7 PCM                                                                           | Parent Company Materiality           |\n| 2023 LCM                                                                          | Lowest Component Materiality         |\n| 2022 AMPT                                                                         | Audit Misstatement Posting Threshold |\n\n## Coverage of Group financial statements Coverage of group financial statements\n\n## Total assets\n\n## Profit before tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull scope audits\n\n- Audits of one or more account balances\n\nSpecified risk-focused audit procedures\n\n- Remaining components\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's exposure to climate change is primarily through climate related transition risks which potentially impact the carrying amount of investments and potential reputational risk associated with the Group's delivery of its climate related commitments. The Group has set out its commitments under the Paris objective to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in its Strategic Report on page 45.\n\nAs a part of our audit we have made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate change risk on the Group's financial statements, including how climate is considered as part of the investment making and monitoring processes, and the Group's preparedness for this. We have performed a risk assessment of how the impact of climate change may affect the financial statements and our audit. This included evaluating the impact of management's stress test scenarios and holding discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment.\n\n## 3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties\n\nThe directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group's and the parent company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\n## Going concern\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group and parent company, its industry, and the general economic environment in which it operates to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group and parent company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that were considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and parent company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- \u00b7  Adverse impacts arising from fluctuations or negative trends in the economic environment including, but not limited to, wider credit spreads and defaults which affect regulatory capital solvency coverage ratios, liquidity ratios, the valuations of the Group's hard to value (Level 3) investments that require judgement and valuation of insurance contract liabilities; and\n- \u00b7  Severely adverse policyholder lapse or claims experience.\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as the failure of counterparties who have transactions with the Group (such as banks and reinsurers), which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by comparing severe, but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial resources by the Group's financial forecasts.\n\nWe considered whether the going concern disclosure in Note 1 (ii) to the financial statements gives an accurate description of the directors' assessment of going concern, including the identified risks and related sensitivities.\n\nAccordingly, based on those procedures, we found the directors' use of the going concern basis of preparation without any material uncertainty for the Group and parent company to be appropriate. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the parent company will continue in operation.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\n- \u00b7  We consider that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;\n- \u00b7  We have not identified, and concur with the directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- \u00b7  We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in Note 1 (ii) to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and parent company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in Note 1 (ii) to be acceptable; and\n- \u00b7  The related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 267 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOn the basis of the risk assessment procedures performed above and taking into account the nature of the Group's assets and basis of the related valuations, we concluded that, while climate change may pose a risk to the determination of asset values, the risk was not significant in the current year. As a result, there was no significant impact from climate change on our KAMs.\n\nWe have also read the disclosures of climate related information in the Strategic Report as set out on pages 41 to 45 and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge. We have not been engaged to provide assurance over the accuracy of these disclosures.",

Key audit matters\n\n## What we mean\n\nKAMs are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on:\n\n- \u00b7  the overall audit strategy;\n- \u00b7  the allocation of resources in the audit; and\n- \u00b7  directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nWe include below the Key Audit Matters in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Our reporting\n\nWe have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to these disclosures.\n\nWe have concluded that these disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.",

The insurance contract liabilities balance now primarily consists of the present value of future cash flows, risk adjustment for non-financial risk and contractual service margin (CSM) components.\n\n## Subjective valuation:\n\nThe valuation of insurance contract liabilities is an inherently subjective area, requiring management judgement in the setting of key assumptions. The longevity, credit risk, and expense assumptions involve the greatest level of subjectivity. A small change in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimates of future cash flows. We consider the risk to remain heightened in the current year due to the higher degree of estimation uncertainty resulting from changes in demographic trends, including those triggered by the Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) and ongoing economic uncertainties as a result of high inflation and higher market interest rates.\n\nThe risk in the current year has been further elevated due to the first-time adoption of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts requiring certain methodologies and assumptions to be determined for the first time.\n\n## Longevity assumptions\n\nLongevity assumptions have two main components: mortality base assumptions and the rate of mortality improvements. The changing trends in longevity and emerging medical trends mean there is a high level of uncertainty in the assumptions. This uncertainty continues to be heightened in the current year due to the potential medium and long-term impacts of a variety of factors that are driving excess deaths. There is also a high degree of reliance on Continuous Mortality Investigations (CMI) models. Hence, there is a risk that other mortality and health data sources are not appropriately considered under the assumption setting methodology.\n\n## Credit assumptions\n\nThe Group's current discount rates are derived by adjusting a reference asset portfolio for risks not present in the related insurance liabilities, in particular credit risk, such that the discount rate includes a yield above the risk-free rate that appropriately reflects the risks in the liabilities, in particular their illiquid nature. The credit risk deduction methodology is judgmental and small changes in this can have a significant impact on the present value of future cash flows.\n\nThe assumptions surrounding this deduction require significant judgement and there is a risk that current actual default experience and anticipated trends are not appropriately reflected. This is particularly significant during the current uncertain economic conditions of high inflation and higher market interest rates.\n\nIFRS 4 did not require entities to discount insurance liabilities in the same way that IFRS 17 does and therefore the Group has had to determine the discount rates to be applied both in the current and preceding years.\n\n## Expense assumptions\n\nJudgement is required in setting the maintenance expense assumption which is based on management's long-term view of the expected future costs of administering the underlying policies, and is also informed by the allocation between cost centres and determination of costs that are directly attributable to the maintenance of annuity insurance contracts.\n\nLike discount rates above, IFRS 4 did not require entities to identify and allocate expense assumptions in the same way that IFRS 17 does and therefore the Group has had to determine the expense assumptions to be applied both in the current and preceding years.\n\nWe used our own actuarial specialists in order to assist us in performing procedures over methodology choice and assumptions in this area. Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- \u00b7 Control design and re-performance: testing reconciliation controls designed to ensure completeness of data flows from policy administration systems to the actuarial models. With the assistance of our IT audit specialists, testing controls over the accuracy of data flows and data conversions from policy administration systems to the actuarial valuation models.\n- \u00b7 Test of detail: testing the completeness of data used in the valuation of annuity liabilities by reconciling the data from the policy administration system to the data used in the actuarial models.\n- \u00b7 Test of detail: by utilising data and analytics procedures, testing the accuracy of historical data input into the actuarial model by comparing the data used for reporting as at 31 December 2023 to the data used for reporting as at 31 December 2022 in relation to policies that were in force at that time.\n- \u00b7 Test of detail: tracing a sample of new business policyholder data inputs into the actuarial valuation model to the underlying policy documents.\n- \u00b7 Test of detail: reconciling the completeness and accuracy of the assets used in the calculation of the current discount rate to the assets in the reference portfolio.\n- \u00b7 Test of detail: for a sample of assets, validating the accuracy of the asset data used to project the cash flows used to derive the yield used in the calculation of the current discount rate and, with the assistance of our valuation specialists, re-projecting these cash flows.\n- \u00b7 Historical comparisons: evaluating whether the expense assumptions reflect the expected future costs of administering the underlying policies by considering the historical accuracy of management's forecast expenses and analysing the allocations of the forecast 2024 costs to directly attributable maintenance expenses with reference to the historical allocations.\n- \u00b7 Methodology choice: assessing the appropriateness of the methodology for selecting assumptions by applying our understanding of developments in the business and expectations derived from market experience, including consideration of the effects of uncertain economic conditions on policyholder mortality and credit risk. For longevity assumptions, this includes consideration of the cause of death modelling performed by management and other non-CMI sources alongside the CMI modelling used across the industry.\n- \u00b7 Accounting analysis: assessing whether the Group's proposed methodology for determining the discount rate credit deduction and reference portfolios is consistent with the requirements of IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 Benchmarking assumptions: assessing mortality improvement assumptions against industry data on expected future mortality rate improvements and industry historic mortality improvement rates and assessing the appropriateness of the credit risk assumptions by comparing to industry practice and our expectations derived from market experience.\n- \u00b7 Historical comparisons: evaluating the mortality base assumptions used in the valuation of the annuity liabilities by comparing to the Group's historic mortality experience.\n\n## UK deferred annuity coverage units\n\n- \u00b7 Accounting analysis: assessing whether management's proposed UK deferred annuity coverage unit methodology is consistent with IFRS 17 and related guidance.\n- \u00b7 Our sector experience: evaluating whether management's proposed UK deferred annuity coverage unit methodology is consistent with our understanding of the services delivered to the policyholder over the duration of the annuity contract.\n- \u00b7 Scenario analysis: assessing whether under management's methodology, the calculation of coverage units, and their associated weightings, produces impacts on the profile of profit recognition that were consistent with our expectations based on our understanding of the services delivered to the policyholder over the duration of the annuity contract considering the impact of possible scenarios.",

        "page_content": "## 4.1 Valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities (Group)\n\n## Description of the key audit matter\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\n## UK deferred annuity coverage units\n\nThe CSM recognised at the inception of an insurance contract should be released to profit over the duration of the contract to reflect the insurance services provided to the policyholder in each period. Under IFRS 17, 'coverage units' represent those insurance contract services. The amount of the CSM recognised as insurance revenue in a period is determined by allocating the CSM at the end of a period over the current and future periods by reference to the coverage units expected to be provided in those periods. The determination of coverage units for UK deferred annuities in the deferral phase, and in particular the relative weighting of different services, is highly subjective given the mix of services delivered in the different phases of the contract.\n\nThe concept of coverage units did not exist under IFRS 4 and therefore the Group has had to determine the coverage units to be applied both in the current and preceding years.\n\n## Transition fair value approach and expected internal rate of return\n\nThe Group has estimated the transition CSM as at 1 January 2022 for annuity liabilities written pre-2016 on the basis of the 'fair value approach'. The determination of the fair value of this portfolio of business is inherently subjective, particularly in the setting of key assumptions, and small changes in certain assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated transition CSM within insurance contract liabilities.\n\nThe fair value approach is determined by discounting the expected future capital releases emerging from the pre-2016 annuity business at the expected internal rate of return (IRR). Under IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement, this should be the return that another market participant would demand to assume the liabilities. In determining this IRR, the Group assumes that the primary constraint is the Solvency II capital requirement. Whilst the UK bulk annuity market is relatively active, there are no previous transactions of this size, and as such significant judgement is applied in setting the IRR assumption.\n\n## Data capture\n\nThere is a risk that incomplete and inaccurate data is used in the calculation of liabilities resulting from error in input of data into the policy administration systems or inaccurate transfer or conversion of aggregate data from the policy administration systems into model point files used to value the liabilities in the actuarial models. In addition, there is a risk that inaccurate asset data is used to calculate the discount rates.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty:\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of insurance contract liabilities has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements disclose the sensitivities (Note 19) estimated by the Group.\n\n## Communications with Legal & General Group Plc's Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:\n\n- \u00b7  Our approach to the audit of UK annuity policyholder liabilities included within insurance contract liabilities including fair value transition approach, the approach to determining the discount rate, the determination of coverage units, details of our planned substantive procedures and the extent of our control reliance.\n- \u00b7  Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the Group's methodology for setting assumptions and calculating policyholder liabilities and accounting policies.\n- \u00b7  Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the longevity, credit, and expense assumptions, including challenge of the assumptions using our sector experience and market knowledge.\n- \u00b7  The adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures, particularly as it relates to new required disclosures under IFRS 17 including the sensitivity of insurance contract liabilities to key assumptions.\n\n## Transition fair value approach and expected internal rate of return\n\n- \u00b7 Our sector experience: evaluating management's approach to the fair value calculation and in particular the assertion that the methodology the Group applies in pricing bulk annuity transactions, including the application of a pricing IRR, is appropriate to be used in the valuation of the pre-2016 UK annuity portfolio given the Group's participation in the bulk annuity market.\n- \u00b7 Benchmarking assumptions: evaluating and challenging the proposed IRR by comparing to the rate implied by recent bulk annuity transactions as at the transition balance sheet date.\n- \u00b7 Benchmarking assumptions: validating that the Group's assumption that the primary constraint is Solvency II capital requirements is consistent with the market through benchmarking against other annuity writers.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating external valuations: the Group engaged an external expert to report on the valuation of the pre-2016 annuity liabilities; we evaluated this report including assessing the expert's competence and objectivity, and comparing the Group's valuation, resulting from the application of the IRR, to the valuation range determined by an external expert.\n- \u00b7 Assessing transparency: considering whether the disclosures in relation to the assumptions used in the calculation of the valuation of insurance contract liabilities are compliant with the relevant accounting requirements and appropriately represent the sensitivities of these assumptions to alternative scenarios and inputs.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:\n\n- \u00b7  The appropriateness of the assumptions including longevity, credit, and expense assumptions.\n- \u00b7  The significance of the inputs into the actuarial models and the consequent impact on the valuation of policyholder liabilities.\n- \u00b7  The approach to determining the fair value of the pre-2016 UK annuity business. This is based on the premise that there is an active market for bulk annuities in the UK and although the recent transactions were not as large as the LGRI pre-2016 business, recent transactions are relevant inputs to the calibration of the IRR.\n- \u00b7  The approach and methods applied to determine the discount rates, including the credit default deduction.\n- \u00b7  The appropriate coverage units to apply in calculating the release of CSM on UK deferred annuities. This requires significant judgement in the absence of specific guidance from the accounting setters and a lack of consensus amongst other annuity writers at the time this approach was being developed.\n\n## Our results\n\nWe found the resulting estimate of the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities within insurance contract liabilities to be acceptable (2022 result: acceptable).\n\nFurther information in the Annual report and accounts: See the Audit Committee Report on page 90 for details on how the Audit Committee considered the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities within insurance contract liabilities as an area of significant attention, page 152 for the accounting policy on insurance contract liabilities and Notes 17, 18, 19 and 20 for the financial disclosures.",

The subjectivity of the asset valuations remains heightened due to the current economic conditions caused by the ongoing uncertainties as a result of high inflation and higher market interest rates.\n\nFor these positions a reliable third-party price from a recent market transaction is not readily available and therefore the application of expert judgement from management in the valuations adopted is required.\n\nThe key assumptions underlying the valuations are:\n\n- \u00b7 UK lifetime mortgages: property price at the valuation date, property price inflation, property price inflation volatility, voluntary redemption rate and the illiquidity premium added to the risk-free rate.\n- \u00b7 Private credit and US private placements: credit ratings derived from credit rating models.\n- \u00b7 Investment property: estimated rental value and yield of the property.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty:\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount.\n\n## Communications with Legal & General Group Plc's Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:\n\n- \u00b7  Our approach to the audit of the valuation of the UK lifetime mortgages, private credit portfolios, investment property hard to value (Level 3) investments, including details of our planned substantive procedures and the extent of our control reliance.\n- \u00b7  Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the methodology adopted by the Group to the valuation of UK lifetime mortgages, private credit portfolios, investment property hard to value (Level 3) investments.\n- \u00b7  The adequacy of the disclosures, particularly as they relate to the sensitivity of Level 3 investments to key assumptions.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- \u00b7 Control design and implementation: testing of the design and implementation of key controls over the valuation process for UK lifetime mortgages, private credit and investment property investments.\n- \u00b7 Our valuation expertise:\n- \u00b7 Using our own valuation specialists to assess the suitability of the valuation and credit rating methodologies used by the Group, to independently revalue a sample of the private credit investments;

Our ability to detect irregularities, and our response\n\nFraud - identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\n\n## Fraud risk assessment\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7  enquiring of directors, the Audit Committee, internal audit, Group Financial Crime Director as to whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group's high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the Group's channel for 'whistleblowing';\n- \u00b7  reading Board, Audit Committee and Risk Committee meeting minutes;\n- \u00b7  considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for management;\n- \u00b7  using our own professionals with forensic knowledge to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussion of the circumstances of the Group;\n- \u00b7  using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;\n- \u00b7  inspecting correspondence with regulators to identify instances or suspected instances of fraud;\n- \u00b7  reviewing the audit misstatements from prior period to identify fraud risk factors; and\n- \u00b7  reading broker reports and other public information to identify third-party expectations and concerns.\n\n## Risk communications\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group audit team to component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and request to full scope component audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.\n\n## Fraud risks\n\nAs required by auditing standards and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting estimates and judgements. Accordingly, we identified fraud risks related to the valuation of insurance contract liabilities and valuation of hard to value (Level 3 assets) that require management judgement (private credit and lifetime mortgages) given the impact on the Group's profit, the opportunity for management to manipulate assumptions due to the subjectivity involved and given the long-term nature of these assumptions which are more difficult to corroborate.\n\nWe have identified a fraud risk over revenue recognition for UK deferred annuities, as the release of profits requires management to exercise significant judgment with respect to the determination of coverage units, which ultimately determines how revenue is released and recorded each period.\n\nWe do not believe there is a fraud risk related to any other Group revenue because there is limited management judgement involved in the recognition of and measurement of the transaction price for all material revenue streams.\n\n## Link to KAMs\n\nWe identified fraud risks related to the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities, and valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments in response to possible pressures to meet profit targets.\n\nFurther detail in respect of the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities, and valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments is set out in the two KAM disclosures in Section 4 of this report.\n\n## Procedures to address fraud risks\n\nWe performed procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7  instructing full scope components and components completing audit of account balances to identify journal entries to test based on high-risk criteria sent to them and comparing the entries to supporting documentation. These included, but were not limited to, journals impacting cash balances that were identified as unusual or unexpected in our risk assessment procedures;\n- \u00b7  evaluating the business purpose of significant unusual transactions; and\n- \u00b7  assessing whether the judgements made making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias.",

        "page_content": "## Laws and regulations - identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement relating to compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Laws and regulations risk assessment\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group's regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. As the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the Group's procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.\n\n## Risk communications\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group audit team to full scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for full scope component auditors to report to the Group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.\n\n## Direct laws context and link to audit\n\nThe potential effect of laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\nThe Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies' legislation), distributable profits legislation, taxation legislation, and pension legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\n## Most significant indirect law/regulation areas\n\nThe Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the Group's license to operate.\n\nWe identified the following areas as those most likely to have such effect:\n\n- \u00b7  Specific aspects of regulatory capital and liquidity;\n- \u00b7  Market abuse regulations;\n- \u00b7  Financial crime and customer conduct regulations;\n- \u00b7  The Consumer Duty; and\n- \u00b7  Certain aspects of company legislation, recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group's activities and certain regulated subsidiaries.\n\nAuditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\n## Context\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.",

Our determination of materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.\n\nMateriality for the Group financial statements as a whole\n\n\u00a382.9m\n\n(2022: \u00a3113.0m)\n\nPerformance materiality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAudit misstatement posting threshold\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What we mean\n\nA quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit.\n\nBasis for determining materiality and judgements applied\n\nMateriality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a382.9m (2022: \u00a3113.0m). This was determined with reference to a benchmark of profit before tax from continuing operations (PBTCO) normalised to exclude this year's investment and other variances and losses attributable to non-controlling interests disclosed in Note 2 of the financial statements that do not represent normal continuing operations of the business.\n\nConsistent with 2022, normalised PBTCO remains the main benchmark for the Group because it is the metric in the primary statements which best reflects the focus of the financial statements' users.\n\nOur Group materiality of \u00a382.9m (2022: \u00a3113.0m) was determined by applying a percentage to the normalised PBTCO. When using a benchmark of normalised PBTCO to determine overall materiality, KPMG's approach for listed entities considers a guideline range 3% - 5% of the measure. In setting overall Group materiality, we applied a percentage of 4.87% (2022: 4.71% with reference to a benchmark under IFRS 4) to the final year end benchmark.\n\nIn addition, we applied materiality of \u00a33.3bn (2022: \u00a33.3bn) to the unit linked assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Income Statement and related notes, which represents 0.9% (2022: 0.9%) of the total unit linked asset balance. This materiality was applied in accordance with FRC Practice Note 20 The Audit of Insurers in the United Kingdom.\n\nMateriality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a333.0m (2022: \u00a345.0m), which is the component materiality for the parent company determined by the Group audit engagement team. This is lower than the materiality we would otherwise have determined with reference to parent company net assets (2022: total assets), of which it represents 0.47% (2022: 0.36%). We selected net assets as the benchmark in the current period due to the users of the financial statements focus on the parent entity's capital and distributions.\n\n## What we mean\n\nOur procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nBasis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied We have considered performance materiality at a level of 65% (2022: 75%) of materiality for both the Group financial statements and the parent company financial statements as a whole to be appropriate.\n\nWe applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality based on the additional risk associated with the first-year implementation of IFRS 17.\n\n## What we mean\n\nThis is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative point of view. We may become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud.\n\nThis is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to the Group's Audit Committee.\n\nBasis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and judgements applied We set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 4.5% (2022: 5.0%) of our materiality for both the Group financial statements and parent company. The decrease is a result of our assessment of increased aggregation risk, consistent with performance materiality above. We also report to the Audit Committee any other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nThe overall materiality for the Group financial statements of \u00a382.9m (2022: \u00a3113.0m) compares as follows to the main financial statement caption amounts:\n\n|                                   | Total Group revenue   | Total Group revenue   | Total Group profit before tax   | Total Group profit before tax   | Total Group assets   | Total Group assets   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                   | 2023                  | 2022*                 | 2023                            | 2022*                           | 2023                 | 2022*                |\n| Group materiality as % of caption | 0.68%                 | 0.13%                 | 4.87%                           | 4.14%                           | 0.02%                | 0.02%                |\n\n- * With reference to a benchmark under IFRS 4.",

The scope of our audit\n\n## Group scope\n\nWhat we mean\n\nHow the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group.\n\nThe Group has 16 (2022: 12 ) in-scope reporting components. In order to determine the work performed at the reporting component level, we identified those components which we considered to be of individual financial significance, those which were significant due to risk and those remaining components on which we required procedures to be performed to provide us with the evidence we required in order to conclude on the Group financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe determined individually financially significant components as those contributing at least 5% (2022: 5%) of total Group revenue and Group profit before tax, and 10% (2022: 10%) of total Group assets. We selected total Group revenue, total Group profit before tax and total Group assets because these are the most representative of the relative size of the components. We identified 5 (2022: 6) components as individually financially significant components and performed full scope audits on these components.\n\nIn addition to the individually financially significant components, we identified 3 (2022: 4) components as significant, owing to significant risks of material misstatement affecting the Group financial statements. Of the 3 (2022: 4) components identified as significant due to risk, we performed audits of account balances for investment property, cash and cash equivalents and receivables and other assets on 1 component (2022: 1) and performed specific risk-focused audit procedures over financial investments, investment property, cash and cash equivalents, receivables and other assets and investment in associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method on 2 components (2022: 3).\n\nIn addition, to enable us to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence for the Group financial statements as a whole, we selected 8 (2022: 2) components on which to perform procedures. Of these components, we performed full scope audits for 2 components (2022: 1), performed audits of account balances for financial investments, cash and cash equivalents, receivables and other assets, provisions, payables, core borrowings, and other financial liabilities on 2 components (2022: 0) and performed specific risk-focused procedures over provisions, cash and cash equivalents, investment return and other expenses on 4 components (2022: 1).\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group's results, with the prior year comparatives calculated with reference to amounts under IFRS 4 indicated in brackets:\n\nRange of\n\n| Scope                                  | Number  of components   | materiality  applied       | Group revenue   | Group PBT   | Group total  assets   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| Full scope audit                       | 7  (7)                  | \u00a320m - \u00a353m  (\u00a316m - \u00a385m) | 90%  (96%)      | 82%  (81%)  | 88%  (83%)            |\n| Audits of one or more account balances | 3  (1)                  | \u00a316m - \u00a320m  (\u00a339m)        | 0%  (1%)        | 1%  (9%)    | 6%  (2%)              |\n| Specific risk-focused audit procedures | 6  (4)                  | \u00a312m - \u00a349m  (\u00a322m - \u00a367m) | 0%  (1%)        | 6%  (1%)    | 1%  (12%)             |\n| Total                                  | 16  (12)                |                            | 90%  (98%)      | 89%  (91%)  | 95%  (97%)            |\n\nThe remaining 10% (2022: 2%) of total Group revenue, 12% (2022: 9%) of Group profit before tax and 7% (2022: 3%) of total Group assets is represented by 68 (2022: 78) reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 1% (2022: 1%) of any of total Group revenue, 3% of Group profit before tax (2022: 4%) or 1% of total Group assets (2022: 1%). For these components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.\n\nThe work on 12 of the 16 components (2022: 11 of the 12 components) was performed by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the parent company, was performed by the Group team. For those items excluded from normalised Group PBTCO, the component teams performed procedures on items relating to their components. The Group team performed procedures on the remaining excluded items.\n\nThe Group audit team has also performed audit procedures on the following areas on behalf of the components:\n\n- \u00b7  Entity level controls;\n- \u00b7  General expenses (including accounts payable, payroll, intangible capitalisation and year-end accruals);\n- \u00b7  Intercompany balances;\n- \u00b7  Directors' emoluments;\n- \u00b7  Foreign exchange rates; and\n- \u00b7  Related parties.\n\nThese items were audited by the Group team as they are all centralised processes across the Group. The Group team communicated the results of these procedures to the component teams.\n\nThe Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the component materialities, as detailed in the table above, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.\n\nThe scope of the audit work performed was predominately substantive as we placed limited reliance upon the Group's internal control over financial reporting.",

Respective responsibilities\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 267, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\nThe Group is required to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared under Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.17R and 4.1.18R. This auditor's report provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared in accordance with those requirements.\n\n## 10. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhilip Smart (Senior Statutory Auditor) for and on behalf of KPMG LLP, Statutory Auditor Chartered Accountants 15 Canada Square, London, E14 5GL\n\n5 March 2024",

        "page_content": "## Primary statements and performance\n\n## continued\n\n## 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies\n\nLegal & General Group Plc, a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, operates across four broad business areas of retirement, investment management, capital investment and insurance through its subsidiaries and associates in the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US) and other countries throughout the world.\n\n## (i) Basis of preparation\n\nThe Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, comprising International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and related interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee. Endorsement is granted by the UK Endorsement Board (UKEB). The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment property, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and certain assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe Group has selected accounting policies which state fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows for a reporting period. The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated.\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed gross in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a legally enforceable right of offset exists and there is an intention to settle recognised amounts on a net basis. Income and expenses are not offset in the Consolidated Income Statement unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretation, as detailed in the applicable accounting policies of the Group.\n\n## (ii) Going concern\n\nThe Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position in the current economic environment are set out in this Annual report & accounts. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in these consolidated financial statements. Principal risks and uncertainties are detailed on pages 56 to 59.\n\nThe directors have made an assessment of the Group's going concern, considering both the current performance and the outlook for a period of at least, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, using the information available up to the date of issue of this Annual report & accounts.\n\nThe Group manages and monitors its capital and liquidity, and applies various stresses, including adverse inflation and interest rate scenarios, to those positions to understand potential impacts from market downturns. Our key sensitivities and the impacts on our capital position from a range of stresses are disclosed in section 5.01 of the Full year results in the 2023 Preliminary Management Report 1 . These stresses do not give rise to any material uncertainties over the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. Based upon the available information, the directors consider that the Group has the plans and resources to manage its business risks successfully and that it remains financially strong and well diversified.\n\nHaving reassessed the principal risks and uncertainties (both financial and operational) in light of the current economic environment, as detailed on pages 56 to 59, the directors are confident that the Group and Company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and therefore have considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the financial statements.\n\n## (iii) New standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that have been adopted by the Group\n\nThe Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time in its annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2023.\n\n## IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts and IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments\n\nThe Group has applied IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts' and IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' for the first time from 1 January 2023. These standards have brought significant changes to the accounting for insurance and reinsurance contracts and financial instruments respectively, and have had a material impact on the Group's financial statements in the period of initial application.\n\nIFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts' was originally issued in May 2017 by the IASB, and subsequent amendments were issued in June 2020. Endorsement for use in the UK was granted in May 2022. The standard replaced IFRS 4, 'Insurance Contracts', and has been applied retrospectively, in line with the transitional options provided for in the standard. IFRS 17 provides a comprehensive approach for accounting for insurance contracts including their measurement, income statement presentation and disclosure.\n\nIFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' was issued in July 2014 by the IASB, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The IASB subsequently issued 'Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts' which allowed entities that met certain requirements to defer their implementation of IFRS 9 until adoption of IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts' or 1 January 2021, whichever is the earlier. In June 2020, the IASB agreed to extend the temporary exemption in IFRS 4 from applying IFRS 9 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The Group qualified for, and made use of this deferral option, and has therefore applied IFRS 9 for the first time on 1 January 2023. The standard replaced IAS 39, 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement'. It includes new principles around classification and measurement of financial instruments, introduces an impairment model based on expected credit losses (replacing the previous model based on incurred losses) and new requirements on hedge accounting. IFRS 9 has been applied retrospectively.\n\nSection (vii) includes the new accounting policies adopted by the Group for IFRS 17 and IFRS 9.\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively and prior period comparative information has been restated, with all restatements clearly labelled as such throughout this report.\n\nPrior period comparative information reflecting the implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 was initially provided in the Group's interim financial statements for the period ending 30 June 2023. This information was unaudited. Since that time, and in particular as a result of the detailed work and review undertaken to finalise the numbers included in this report, which has now been audited, certain adjustments have been identified which have now been reflected in the prior period comparatives. This includes a \u00a3154m reclassification between Change in investment contract liabilities and Other expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement, with no impact on profit. In total, the impact of these adjustments on equity attributable to owners of the parent was an increase of \u00a319m as at 1 January 2022, and a decrease of \u00a345m as at 31 December 2022.\n\nAs at the transition date of 1 January 2022, the impacts on the key line items in the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet are set out below.\n\n| Balance sheet item                          | 31 December 2021 (as reported) \u00a3m   | Reclassification  due to adoption of  IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 \u00a3m   | Impact of the  adoption of IFRS 9 \u00a3m   | Impact of the  adoption of IFRS 17 \u00a3m   | 1 January 2022 (restated) \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Financial investments                       | 538,374                             | (29)                                                          | (716)                                  | -                                       | 537,629                        |\n| Net insurance contract liabilities 1        | (82,645)                            | (199)                                                         | -                                      | (6,133)                                 | (88,977)                       |\n| Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets       | (249)                               | -                                                             | 178                                    | 1,178                                   | 1,107                          |\n| Other                                       | (444,994)                           | 228                                                           | -                                      | (33)                                    | (444,799)                      |\n| Equity attributable to owners of the parent | 10,486                              | -                                                             | (538)                                  | (4,988)                                 | 4,960                          |\n\nThe adoption of the new accounting standards does not change the total profit recognised over the life of the Group's insurance contracts, nor the underlying economics or cash generation of the Group's businesses. It does not change the Group's strategy, solvency position nor dividend paying capacity or appetite.\n\n## Transition to IFRS 17\n\nOn transition to IFRS 17, the Group has applied the full retrospective approach unless impracticable. The full retrospective approach requires the Group to:\n\n- \u00b7 identify, recognise and measure each group of insurance and reinsurance contracts as if IFRS 17 had always applied;\n- \u00b7 derecognise any existing balances that would not exist had IFRS 17 always applied; and\n- \u00b7 recognise any resulting net difference in equity.\n\nIf it was impracticable to apply a full retrospective approach to a group of contracts then the Group has chosen between the modified retrospective approach and the fair value approach. If the Group could not obtain reasonable and supportable information necessary to apply the modified retrospective approach, then the fair value approach has been chosen.\n\nThe Group has applied the following transition approaches to its material insurance contract portfolios on transition to IFRS 17, by year of issue:\n\n| Transition approach    | Annuities   | UK Protection   | US Protection   |\n|------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Full retrospective     | 2021        | 2021            | 2021            |\n| Modified retrospective | 2016-2020   | 2012-2020       | 2011-2020       |\n| Fair value             | Pre-2016    | Pre-2012        | Pre-2011        |\n\n## Full retrospective approach\n\nFor insurance and reinsurance contracts where the full retrospective approach has been adopted, the best estimate and risk adjustment components of fulfilment cash flows have been recognised and measured using the accounting policies set out in section (vii) from the inception date of the contracts to the date of transition.\n\nThe full retrospective approach has been determined to be impracticable where: the effects of retrospective application are not determinable because information required has not been collected (or not with sufficient granularity); application would require the application of hindsight; or information is unavailable because of system migrations, data retention requirements or other reasons. Specific examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 historic calibration of IFRS 17 specific judgements, such as the scale of the risk adjustment;\n- \u00b7 expectations about a contract's profitability and risks of becoming onerous required for identifying groups of contracts;\n- \u00b7 information about historical cash flows and discount rates required for determining the estimates of cash flows on initial recognition and their subsequent changes on a retrospective basis;\n- \u00b7 information required to allocate fixed and variable overheads to groups of contracts, because the Group's current accounting policies do not require such information; and\n- \u00b7 information about certain changes in assumptions and estimates because they were not documented on an ongoing basis.",

The expected release has been determined with reference to the release of risk of similar contracts that the Group issued in 2022. This modification has been used to avoid the application of hindsight to the calibration of the risk adjustment in prior periods.\n\n## Fair value approach\n\nFor insurance and reinsurance contracts where the fair value approach has been adopted, the best estimate and risk adjustment components of fulfilment cash flows have been determined as at 1 January 2022. The Group has determined the Contractual Service Margin (CSM) of the liability for remaining coverage at the transition date, as the difference between the fair value of the group of insurance contracts and the fulfilment cash flows measured at that date. In determining fair value, the Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 13, 'Fair Value Measurement', except for the demand deposit floor requirement. The fair value attributed to the in-scope business is calculated with reference to a price generated using the Group's pricing models and pricing assumptions at the transition date. The pricing models discount the future capital releases emerging at the internal rate of return (IRR). The assessment of the valuation includes consideration of:\n\n- \u00b7 the most appropriate assumptions for use by a third party market participant;\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms and expected cash flows of the contracts;\n- \u00b7 the capital requirements over the contract duration; and\n- \u00b7 the required internal rate of return.\n\nThe fair value calculations at 1 January 2022 used economic assumptions at that date. The most significant judgements for each portfolio were:\n\n- \u00b7 the most relevant market participants for the business being valued; and\n- \u00b7 the IRR and level of required regulatory capital applied in the calculations, which were together calibrated with reference to relevant market transactions where available.\n\nThe net of reinsurance CSM calculated using the fair value approach at transition was \u00a34.1bn, comprising \u00a33.9bn for annuities and \u00a30.2bn for protection. A reasonably possible alternative valuation for the net of reinsurance annuity fair value CSM derived by reducing the required IRR by 1% would reduce the transition CSM by \u00a30.3bn.\n\nThe Group has aggregated contracts issued more than one year apart in determining groups of insurance contracts under the fair value approach at transition, applying the permitted transition simplification. The Group did not have reasonable and supportable information to disaggregate groups into those including only contracts issued within one year.\n\nFor portfolios of protection contracts, the Group has elected to disaggregate insurance finance income or expenses between amounts included in profit or loss and amounts included in other comprehensive income. For these portfolios, transitioned under the fair value approach, the cumulative amount of insurance finance income or expense recognised in other comprehensive income at the transition date has been reset to zero in line with the transitional provisions of the standard.\n\n## Transition assumptions\n\nThe Group's material insurance and reinsurance contract fulfilment cash flow assumptions at the date of transition are set out below.\n\n## (i) Mortality and morbidity\n\nMortality and morbidity assumptions for the UK businesses are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau (CMI), a subsidiary of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, and/or UK death registrations. US assumptions are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the American Academy of Actuaries. Tables are based on industry-wide mortality and morbidity experience for insured lives.\n\n## continued",

Adjustments are made for gender, select period, smoker status, policy size, policy duration and year, issue year and age.\n- 4. Mortality rates are assumed to reduce based on CMI 2020 model with a long-term annual improvement rate of 1.5% for males and 1.0% for females.\n- 5. Table created by blending PCXA00 with PNXA00 tables. The base table to be used for bulk purchase annuity policies in deferment is PNMA00 up to and including age 55 and PCMA00 for age 65 and above for males. The identical method is applied to females using PNFA00 and PCFA00.\n- 6. Mortality rates are assumed to reduce according to an adjusted version of the mortality improvement model CMI 2019 with the following parameters: Males: Long-term Rate of 1.5% p.a. up to age 85 tapering to 0% at 110. Females: Long-term Rate of 1.0% p.a. up to age 85 tapering to 0% at 110. Smoothing is applied to derive initial rates using a smoothing parameter (Sk) value of 7.5 applied to Legal & General bespoke population data up to 2019. The resulting initial rates are then adjusted to reflect socio economic class. For individual annuities distributed through retail channels, a further allowance is made for the effect of initial selection.\n- The basis above is applicable up to age 90. After age 90 the basis is blended towards a bespoke table from age 105 onwards.\n- 7. Improvement table is MP2018 for Females and MP2019 for Males.\n\n## (ii) Valuation rates of interest and discount rates\n\nThe interest rates used to discount the cash flows for the purpose of valuing insurance contract liabilities should reflect the timing and liquidity characteristics of those insurance liability cash flows and current market conditions. The valuation interest rate assumptions are derived as interest rate curves with full term structure.\n\nIn deriving the discount rate assumptions for annuity business, an explicit allowance for risk is deducted from the yield on the assets backing annuity liabilities. The allowance for risk comprises long-term assumptions about defaults and the market risk premiums for taking credit risk. In the case of lifetime mortgage assets a best estimate expectation of losses arising from the no negative equity guarantee, and the market risk premiums for this risk, are deducted from the yield. For the UK annuity business, the deduction for risk of default for corporate bonds and direct investments equated to 43bps. For lifetime mortgages the deductions equated to \u00a30.6bn.\n\nFor US and UK protection business, the yield is calculated based on notional asset portfolios of AA rated corporate bonds and cash, which reflect the characteristics of the liability cash flows. An explicit allowance for risk is deducted from the yield, to reflect the default risk associated with the notional portfolio assets.\n\nThe discount rate curves used for the material product lines are shown below. The discount rate curves are used to discount the cash flows on the underlying contracts and the reinsurance cash flows on those contracts.\n\n## 1 January 2022 Discount Rates\n\n<!-- image -->",

These adjustments (which vary by risk) are calibrated such that the total Group risk adjustment calculated aligns to the Group's view of compensation for non-financial risks and the risk adjustment at contract level is representative of the compensation required for that contract. For the majority of risks, the Group's view on the compensation required for non-financial risks is determined with reference to an 85th percentile confidence level, calculated using a one-year Value-at-Risk (VaR) measure. This VaR measure reflects the Group's view on how non-financial risks behave (risk distributions), diversification of risks across the Group (risk correlations), and the costs and benefits from reinsurance in place (risk mitigation). This is consistent with how risks are priced for and managed across the Group. We have estimated the equivalent confidence level for the entire Group on a multi-year basis, using a weighted average of the key risks. Overall, the Group risk adjustment as at 1 January 2022 is aligned to a c75th percentile multi-year confidence level over the full runoff of the portfolio.\n\n## Financial impact of transition\n\nThe increase in insurance liabilities on adoption of IFRS 17 at 1 January 2022 can be attributed to the following:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Impact on net insurance contract liabilities on transition to IFRS 17 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Remeasurement of liabilities: the IFRS 17 cash flows are best estimate and exclude all prudent margins included in the IFRS 4  liabilities.

While the standard does not apply to financial assets already derecognised by 1 January 2023, the Group has applied a 'classification overlay' as allowed by the standard. When applying IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 at the same time, the classification overlay permits presentation of comparative information as if the classification, measurement and impairment requirements of IFRS 9 had been applied to such assets, irrespective of derecognition date.\n\nFor the purpose of classification and measurement, financial assets' business models have been assessed as at the date of initial application and have been applied consistently in all periods presented. If an asset was in scope of the classification overlay described above, the Group aligned the classification and measurement of each financial asset in the comparative periods with what it expected it would have been on 1 January 2023. Such assessment was performed based on reasonable and supportable information available at 1 January 2022, the transition date. Any difference between the IAS 39 carrying amount of a financial asset and the carrying amount at the transition date that results from applying IFRS 9 or the classification overlay was recognised in opening retained earnings.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment, the Group assessed whether as at 1 January 2023 there had been a significant increase in credit risk as compared to the date that a financial instrument was initially recognised, and applied a 12-month or lifetime ECL accordingly. The Group chose to apply the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 consistently to all of the applicable financial instruments on its books during the comparative periods. To the extent the classification overlay applied and therefore an asset was derecognised by 1 January 2023, any expected credit losses recognised in the comparative periods were reversed upon disposal. On transition, the Group made use of a practical expedient available in IFRS 9 whereby it can be assumed that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date (e.g. investment grade as determined by the Group's asset managers).",

However, if this related to a financial asset at FVOCI, an equal and opposite movement was reflected in the OCI reserve.\n\nChanges to hedge accounting policies have been applied prospectively from 1 January 2023. All hedging relationships designated under IAS 39 at 31 December 2022 met the criteria for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 at 1 January 2023 and were therefore regarded as continuing hedging relationships.\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nThe following table explains the original measurement categories under IAS 39 and the new measurement categories under IFRS 9 for each class of the Group's financial assets as at 1 January 2023, including the reasons for any reclassifications out of the FVTPL category. No changes to classification and measurement of financial liabilities have resulted from the implementation of IFRS 9.\n\n|                                               | 31 December 2022 IAS 39 measurement   | 31 December 2022 IAS 39 measurement   | Reclassification  (before  remeasurement)   | Remeasurement ECL Other   | Remeasurement ECL Other   | 1 January 2023 IFRS 9 measurement   | 1 January 2023 IFRS 9 measurement   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                               | Category                              | Amount \u00a3m                             | \u00a3m                                          | \u00a3m                        | \u00a3m                        | Category                            | Amount \u00a3m                           |\n| Financial investments at FVTPL                |                                       |                                       |                                             |                           |                           |                                     |                                     |\n| Equity securities                             | FVTPL 1                               | 167,335                               |                                             |                           |                           | FVTPL 2                             | 167,335                             |\n| Debt securities                               | FVTPL 1                               | 217,613                               | (6,425)                                     |                           |                           | FVTPL 2                             | 211,188                             |\n| -

This is because, while the best estimate liability and risk adjustment under IFRS 17 for annuities are measured with current financial assumptions, the CSM is measured with locked-in discount rates. Therefore, a sub-portfolio of long dated debt instruments amounting to \u00a35,603m (including accrued interest, as at 1 January 2023) backing annuity contracts but in surplus to the IFRS 17 best estimate liability and risk adjustment, and passing the SPPI test, was separately identified. Starting 1 January 2023 these assets have been used to manage interest and inflation rate exposure. They are held to maturity in a 'held to collect' business model and accounted for at amortised cost. Other assets reclassified in the Group's Insurance business, notably private placements and commercial mortgage loans in the US business, were previously accounted for at FVTPL in order to eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch. Following the implementation of IFRS 17 this is no longer required as finance income and expense on the insurance liabilities that these assets are held to back are presented in OCI. The assets pass the SPPI test and are held in a 'held to collect' business model, and are therefore accounted for at amortised cost.\n\nHad such assets remained at FVTPL after 1 January 2023, the Group would have recorded fair value losses in the Consolidated Income Statement of \u00a3322m during the year. Interest income recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the year was \u00a3209m, and the effective interest rate as at 1 January 2023 was 3.59%. The fair value of these assets as at 31 December 2023 is \u00a36,839m.\n\n## Remeasurement from FVTPL to FVOCI\n\nUnder IAS 39, bonds (including US Treasury bonds) backing certain protection liabilities were held at FVTPL in order to eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch. Following the implementation of IFRS 17 this is no longer required, as finance income and expense on the insurance liabilities that these assets are held to back, are presented in OCI. The assets pass the SPPI test and are held in a 'held to collect and sell' business model, and are therefore accounted for at FVOCI.\n\nHad such assets remained at FVTPL after 1 January 2023, the Group would have recorded fair value gains in the Consolidated Income Statement of \u00a315m during the year. Interest income recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the year was \u00a38m, and the effective interest rate as at 1 January 2023 was 2.75%. The fair value of these assets as at 31 December 2023 is \u00a3356m.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe following table reconciles the closing impairment allowance under IAS 39 as at 31 December 2022 with the opening loss allowance under IFRS 9 as at 1 January 2023 for financial assets subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9.\n\n|                                   | 31 December 2022  IAS 39  \u00a3m   | Remeasurement \u00a3m   | 1 January 2023  IFRS 9 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Debt securities at FVOCI          |                                |                    |                             |\n| From debt securities at FVTPL     | -                              | 3                  | 3                           |\n| Debt securities at amortised cost |                                |                    |                             |\n| From debt securities at FVTPL     | -                              | 34                 | 34                          |\n| From debt securities AFS          | -                              | 1                  | 1                           |\n| Other receivables                 | 4                              | -                  | 4                           |\n| Total                             | 4                              | 38                 | 42                          |\n\nTax impacts from adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9\n\nThe implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 has resulted in a reduction of the Group's equity of \u00a36,882m before tax as at 1 January 2022. A deferred tax credit of \u00a31,356m was recognised in respect of this, resulting in a net impact on adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 of \u00a35,526m.\n\nOf the deferred tax credit of \u00a31,356m, \u00a31,302m relates to the UK and \u00a354m relates to the US.\n\nThe introduction of this new accounting standard impacts the tax the Group pays in the UK, as the UK tax regime is based on the IFRS results of the Group's UK businesses. HMRC consulted widely on how the introduction of IFRS 17 should be treated for tax purposes. The UK tax regime requires the reduction in equity on transition to IFRS 17 for UK companies to be treated as a tax loss, which is spread over 10 years and will reduce the cash tax payments over this period. This tax loss has been recognised as a deferred tax asset on the Group's balance sheet, valued at \u00a31.2bn at 1 January 2022.\n\nThe Group's US businesses' tax position is based on their regulatory filings rather than on the IFRS result, and therefore the implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 does not impact their local tax position. The Group recognises deferred tax on the difference between the profits and losses on which the local tax position is based on, and the IFRS results.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 - Income Taxes: 'International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules'\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2023, were introduced in response to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Pillar Two model rules, and include:\n\n- \u00b7 A mandatory temporary exception to the recognition and disclosure of deferred taxes arising from the jurisdictional implementation of the Pillar Two model rules; and\n- \u00b7 Disclosure requirements for affected entities to help users of the financial statements better understand an entity's exposure to Pillar Two income taxes arising from that legislation, particularly before its effective date.",

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements: 'Non-current Liabilities with Covenants'\n\nThese amendments, issued in October 2022, clarify that only covenants with which an entity must comply on or before the reporting date will affect a liability's classification as current or non-current. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 16 - Leases: 'Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback'\n\nThese amendments, issued in September 2022, specify requirements for seller-lessees to measure the lease liability in a sale and leaseback transaction. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 7 - Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures: 'Supplier Finance Arrangements'\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2023, address the disclosure requirements to enhance the transparency of supplier finance arrangements and their effects on a company's liabilities, cash flows and exposure to liquidity risk. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024.\n\n## (v) Critical accounting judgements and the use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Income Statement and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, material adjustments could be made to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. The Audit Committee reviews the reasonableness of judgements associated with and the application of material accounting policies. The significant accounting matters considered by the Audit Committee in respect of the year ended 31 December 2023 are included within the Audit Committee Report on page 86.\n\nThe major areas of critical accounting judgement on policy application are considered below:\n\nInsurance and investment contract liabilities (Notes 20 and 21): Product classification and the assessment of the significance of insurance risk transferred to the Group in determining whether a contract should be accounted for as an insurance or investment contract\n\nContracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the Group are classified as insurance contracts. Contracts that transfer financial risk (e.g. change in interest rate or security price) to the Group but not significant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts.\n\nJudgement is required in order to assess the significance of the transfer of insurance risk within a contract. This assessment is based on whether the occurrence of an insured event could cause the Group to make significant additional payments, i.e. if the occurrence of the event causes significantly higher cash out flows for the Group than its non-occurrence.\n\nCertain contracts, which are both insurance and investment, can contain discretionary features representing the contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits under certain conditions, being:\n\n- \u00b7 that the additional benefits are a significant portion of the total contractual benefits;\n- \u00b7 the timing and amount of the additional benefits is at the discretion of the Group; and\n- \u00b7 that the additional benefits are contractually dependent upon the performance of an entity, fund or specified pool of assets.\n\nInsurance contracts and investment contracts with such discretionary participation features are accounted for under IFRS 17, while investment contracts without discretionary participation features are accounted for as financial instruments under IFRS 9.\n\nJudgement is therefore required in order to establish whether any additional benefits in an insurance or investment contract meet the above requirements for being considered discretionary participation features.\n\nConsolidation (Notes 39 to 41): Assessment of whether the Group controls underlying entities and should therefore consolidate them The assessment takes account of various criteria, including decision making ability, equity holding and the rights to a variable return from the entity.\n\nControl arises when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.",

Subsidiaries that are consolidated where the Group owns less than 50% of the ordinary share capital (structured entities), are consolidated based on an assessment of control normally arising from special rights attaching to the class of share owned, other contractual arrangements and factors such as the purpose of the investee, the nature of its relevant activities, voting rights (including potential voting rights) and substantive and protective rights.\n\nThe Group invests in various fund and unit trust entities where it also acts as the asset manager to those entities. In these instances, in determining whether the Group controls the entities, the assessment focuses on the aggregate economic interests of the Group (direct interest and expected management fees) and on whether the Group acts as a principal or agent. This includes an assessment of the removal rights of other investors (their practical ability to allow the Group not to control the fund). Additionally, holdings in such investments can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the participation of the Group and other investors in them. As a result, in determining control, we look at an assessment of these factors over a longer period to mitigate the impact of daily fluctuations which do not reflect the wider facts and circumstances of the Group's involvement. This is performed in line with the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity exceeds 50%, the Group is judged to have control over the entity;\n- \u00b7 where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity is between 30% and 50%, the facts and circumstances of the Group's involvement in the entity are considered, including the rights to any fees earned by the asset manager from the entity, in forming a judgement as to whether the Group has control over the entity; and\n- \u00b7 where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity is less than 30%, the Group is judged to not have control over the entity, but again the facts and circumstances of the Group's involvement in the entity are considered.\n\nThe following sets out information about the critical accounting assumptions made by the Group about the future, and other major sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:\n\n## Valuation of insurance contract liabilities (Notes 18-20)\n\nThe key judgements around the valuation of insurance contract liabilities relate to the following assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Determination of the longevity, mortality and morbidity assumptions used in the calculation of the insurance contract liabilities; the assumptions for the rate of future longevity, mortality and morbidity are based on the Group's internal experience and judgements about how experience may vary in the future. This assessment takes into account market benchmarking, internal experience studies and independent industry data. The long-term assumptions are adjusted to reflect the Group's view on the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on claims experience in the medium to long-term, informed by emerging experience and industry studies.\n- \u00b7 Determination of the directly attributable expense assumptions used in the calculation of the insurance liabilities. These represent the expected future costs that relate directly to the fulfilment of the underlying insurance policies, and are based on management's best estimate of these future costs, and on an appropriate allocation between servicing new and existing business.\n- \u00b7 Determination of valuation interest rates used to discount the liabilities, which are sensitive to the assumptions made, for example, on credit default of the backing assets. These assumptions take into account consideration of market experience and historic internal data. The valuation interest rate is also sensitive to the selection of the reference portfolio of assets chosen to back the liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Determination of the compensation required for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows arising from non-financial risks as insurance contracts are fulfilled, in the calculation of the risk adjustment.\n- \u00b7 Determination of the weighting of the coverage units, used to calculate the CSM amortisation in the year, between the payment phase and the deferral phase for deferred annuities. Judgement is required to combine the different coverage units so that they fairly reflect the services provided.\n- \u00b7 Determination of the transition date contractual service margin under IFRS 17 incorporated judgement. In particular, the transition date CSM for business transitioned using the fair value methodology persists into the closing valuation of the CSM until those portfolios expire. These judgements are discussed in detail in the Basis of Preparation.\n\nNote 19 includes a sensitivity analysis on post-tax Group profit and Group equity to reasonable alternative assumptions.\n\n## Valuation of unquoted illiquid assets and investment property (Note 11)\n\nDetermination of fair value of unquoted and illiquid assets, and investment property involves judgements in model valuations, through the incorporation of both observable and unobservable market inputs, which include assumptions that lead to the existence of a range of plausible valuations for financial assets.\n\nIn assessing asset valuation, in line with applicable standards and guidance, the Group has both projected the short-term impact on earnings and cash flows of the current market volatility, while continuing to review the assets' ability to deliver longer term returns aligned to their investment cases.\n\nNote 11 includes a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of unquoted illiquid assets and investment property to reasonable alternative assumptions.\n\n## (vi) Consideration of climate change\n\nThe Group recognises emerging risks from both climate change and the crisis with nature, and the interrelationship between our climate and the natural world. Climate change is the Group's most material sustainability issue, but the Group continues to develop its understanding of its impacts and dependencies on nature, concurrently with its consideration of the impacts from climate change.",

        "page_content": "The Group is exposed to climate change through two broad categories: transition risks from the move to a low-carbon economy and the impact this has on asset valuation and the economy; and physical risks from the impact on asset holdings as a result of severe weather events and longer-term shifts in climate.\n\nThe Group has integrated climate risk management into its governance framework and has carried out a detailed assessment of how we could expect climate risk to emerge across our business model. The Group risk mitigation strategy includes setting portfolio carbon intensity targets, integrating carbon controls into the investment processes through stock exclusions and high carbon escalation, corporate engagement and implementing high energy efficiency standards into the Group's directly owned commercial property and housing businesses.\n\nThe Group is committed to net zero, targeting a 1.5\u00b0C 'Paris' outcome. In order to meet its environmental goals, the Group has set for itself a number of metrics and targets, clearly linked with its business strategy and risk management controls. These are based on a three-pillar climate strategy encompassing 'Invest, Influence and Operate'. Metrics and targets have been defined around the Group's operational carbon footprint, investment portfolio economic carbon intensity, and implied portfolio temperature alignment. These are being targeted through the decarbonisation of the Group's balance sheet, investments in clean energy and start-ups, development of climate friendly investment products, and focus on own operations. The Group also continues to use its influence as a large investor to promote the transition.\n\nScenario analysis is performed to help understand the strategic implications of possible climate pathways, including the key features of a transition to a net zero economy. Plausible scenarios have been developed based on estimations of how the energy system may evolve over the next 30 years, using the most recent carbon budgets from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) and incorporated latest data on technology costs. These include two different pathways to 'below 2\u00b0C', and a scenario assuming achievement of net zero. Given the Group's long-term climate risk relates to transition risk, a fourth scenario assuming global failure to act on climate change and emissions growth at historical rates has been modelled, but the impacts have not been applied to our portfolio. Such impacts are driven by physical risks which tend to be highly localised and manifest further into the future and are therefore more uncertain.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group has considered the impact of climate change, and in particular the transition to a lower carbon economy, on the valuation of the Group's assets and liabilities. In the Strategic report, with additional information in the Group's Climate and nature report, we have set out in detail the various risks and opportunities that are created by this transition, and how they may impact the Group across various time horizons. In line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, we have further described the resilience of the Group's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, as described above. There is no one single scenario that underpins the financial statements. The scenarios help challenge the Group's perspectives on the future business and economic environment as a result of the transition to a lower carbon economy, including consideration of events that may be only remotely possible. As a result, the scenarios covered are not intended to be predictions of likely future events or outcomes and are not the basis on which the Group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared.\n\nAt the current time, the Group does not consider climate risk to represent a significant area of judgement or of estimation uncertainty. As at 31 December 2023, no material impacts on the Group's financial position, nor on the valuation of assets or liabilities on the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet as a result of climate change risk have been identified. In arriving at this determination, the Group has in particular taken into account the following areas of judgement, which we consider to be those most exposed to the potential impact of climate change in the preparation of the financial statements:\n\n## Going concern and viability\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are required to assess the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, by taking into account all available information related to at least 12 months from the date of their approval. Additionally, the preparation of the viability statement takes into consideration the Group's overall business model and strategy, forecast financial strength and resilience, and the liquidity profile over the planning horizon. Climate-related matters have been considered as part of these assessments and have not been deemed to create material uncertainties as to their conclusions or to require specific disclosure.\n\n## Valuation of Level 3 financial investments and investment property\n\nThe valuation of unquoted illiquid assets and investment property has been separately identified as an area of significant estimation uncertainty. The assumptions used in the models underpinning these assets' valuations, such as cash flows forecasts, discount rates, and multiples, are often unobservable. Due to the need to apply significant judgements, these assumptions can be impacted by transition risk, with climate-related inputs gaining more traction (e.g. construction methods and materials, EPC ratings, ESG credentials and climate resilience). This is particularly relevant for the Group's direct investments portfolio, including alternative assets. Where possible, the Group's assets are valued using standard market pricing sources or appropriately qualified external valuers, and therefore reflect current market sentiments around climate risk. In this respect, market and investor expectations have also been evolving, with greater demand towards net zero-aligned assets, and away from traditional carbon-intensive methods, impacting expected investor returns and therefore discount rates and multiples. Exposure to the risks of climate change is minimised through rigorous assessment of potential investments and active monitoring of the carbon intensity of the current portfolio. Additionally, investment properties are being reviewed by independent third parties, where applicable, with regards to potential retrofitting, to help reduce carbon emissions and make them more efficient and sustainable for the future.\n\n## Asset impairment and residual economic life\n\nThe carrying value of goodwill, intangible and certain tangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet which are subject to impairment testing could be affected by climate change risk. For example, inventory may become obsolete or restricted, causing selling prices to decline or their costs of completion to increase. If, as a result, the cost of inventories is not recoverable, they would need to be written down to their net realisable value.",

        "page_content": "## Primary statements and performance\n\n## continued\n\n## 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued\n\n## (vi) Consideration of climate change continued\n\nAsset impairment and residual economic life continued\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill and intangible assets may see their recoverable amount decrease in light of climate change, and significant changes in the environment (including for example changes in regulation) in which the Group operates, where adverse effects can represent an indication of impairment. The estimation of recoverable amount as 'value in use' requires an assessment of future expected cash flows based on assumptions potentially affected by climate-related matters, particularly for goodwill and intangible assets, which are subject to a higher degree of judgement. Where assets are subject to amortisation or depreciation, consideration needs to be given to whether climate risk suggests that the residual economic life is shorter than anticipated, which would give rise to increased charges in the income statement. Due to the nature of the Group's assets, we do not anticipate any material additional impairments or increased amortisation and depreciation charges to arise from climate change. Risks will continue to be monitored against judgements and estimates used in the assessment of impairment.\n\n## Insurance contract liabilities\n\nThe Group's insurance contracts are valued using discount rates derived from the backing asset portfolios with deductions made to remove risks that are present in the assets but are not relevant to the insurance liability. Climate-related risks could impact on the Group's exposure to future credit losses which would impact on the appropriate yield deductions in the discount rate calculation and therefore the insurance contract valuations.\n\n## Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nThe recognition, measurement and disclosure of provisions and contingent liabilities is subject to setting assumptions around future events and the probability of their occurrence. Climate-related matters could affect these elements, for example by requiring recognition or disclosure of a legal obligation (e.g. levies imposed for failing climate-related targets) or of a constructive obligation (e.g. requirements to remediate environmental damage caused by the Group's operations and investment portfolios).\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses and credits, to the extent it is probable that future taxable profit will be available, against which those amounts can be utilised. Climate-related matters could affect the Group's estimate of future taxable profits, and therefore it may be required to derecognise deferred tax assets previously on the balance sheet.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group's performance share plans provide a direct and transparent link between executive pay and the delivery of shareholder returns over the longer-term. They are a conditional award of shares subject to a performance period of at least three years. Performance metrics for the Group's share plans are now clearly linked to ESG metrics. As such, the effects of climate change could have an impact on amount and timing, recognition and measurement of amounts in the Group's income statement and statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nExpected credit losses are required to be recognised on receivables and certain financial investments, representing the counterparty's probability of default over a certain time horizon. Climate-related matters may affect the Group's exposure to these losses, for example by negatively affecting the borrower's ability to meet their obligations, or by affecting assumptions used in the models adopted to estimate expected credit losses.\n\n## (vii) Material accounting policies\n\nConsolidation principles\n\nSubsidiary undertakings\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full.\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities (including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts) over which the Group directly or indirectly has control (i.e. when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee) (Note 40).\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the Group to record the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at fair value on the date of acquisition. The excess of the fair value of acquisition consideration over the recorded value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as goodwill. Profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the year are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control.\n\nPuttable instruments held by external parties in consolidated investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as 'Net asset value attributable to unit holders' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but which it does not control. It is presumed that the Group has significant influence where it has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights in the investee unless indicated otherwise. Joint ventures are entities where the Group and other parties have joint control over their activities.\n\nThe Group has interests in associates and joint ventures (Note 40) which form part of an investment portfolio held through private equity vehicles, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities. In accordance with the choice permitted by IAS 28, 'Investments in associates', these interests have been classified as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value within financial investments, with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.",

        "page_content": "Associates and joint ventures which do not form part of an investment portfolio are initially recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of these associates or joint ventures is included within the carrying value of those investments. Their carrying amount is increased or decreased to reflect the Group's share of total comprehensive income after the date of the acquisition. Where the carrying amount of an associate or joint venture is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, which is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount, with an impairment loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## Insurance contracts\n\nLong term insurance contracts - initial measurement\n\nInsurance contracts are contracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the insurer at the inception of the contract. This is the case if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to make significant additional payments in any scenario, other than a scenario which lacks commercial substance. Such contracts remain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.\n\nAt inception, the Group separates the following components from an insurance or reinsurance contract and accounts for them as if they were stand-alone financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 derivatives embedded in the contract whose economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract, and whose terms would not meet the definition of an insurance or reinsurance contract as a stand-alone instrument; and\n- \u00b7 distinct investment components, i.e. investment components that are not highly inter-related with the insurance components and for which contracts with equivalent terms are sold, or could be sold, separately in the same market or the same jurisdiction.\n\nAfter separating any financial instrument components, the Group separates any promises to transfer to policyholders distinct goods or services other than insurance coverage and investment services and accounts for them as separate contracts with customers (i.e. not as insurance contracts). A good or service is distinct if the policyholder can benefit from it either on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the policyholder. A good or service is not distinct and is accounted for together with the insurance component if the cash flows and risks associated with the good or service are highly inter-related with the cash flows and risks associated with the insurance component, and the Group provides a significant service of integrating the good or service with the insurance component.\n\n## Recognition and level of aggregation\n\nAn insurance contract is recognised at the earliest of the following:\n\n- (a)  the beginning of the coverage period;\n- (b)  the date when the first payment from a policyholder becomes due; and\n- (c)  for onerous contracts, when the contract becomes onerous.\n\nThe level of aggregation determines the unit of account at which IFRS 17 calculations are performed. This is determined firstly by dividing the business written into portfolios. Portfolios comprise groups of contracts with similar risks which are managed together. Portfolios are further divided based on expected profitability at inception into three categories: onerous contracts, contracts with no significant risk of subsequently becoming onerous, and the remainder. IFRS 17 also requires that no group for level of aggregation purposes may contain contracts issued more than one year apart.\n\nAll of the Group's in scope insurance contracts are accounted for under the general measurement model which measures a group of insurance contracts as the total of:\n\n- \u00b7 fulfilment cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 a contractual service margin (CSM) representing the unearned profit the Group will recognise as it provides services under the insurance contract.\n\n## Fulfilment cash flows\n\nFulfilment cash flows comprise unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of future cash flows, discounted to present value to reflect the time value of money and financial risks, plus a risk adjustment for non-financial risk. The Group's objective in estimating future cash flows is to determine the expected value, or the probability weighted mean, of the full range of possible outcomes, considering all reasonable and supportable information available at the reporting date without undue cost or effort. The Group estimates future cash flows considering a range of scenarios which have commercial substance and give a good representation of possible outcomes. The cash flows from each scenario are probability-weighted and discounted using current assumptions.",

The cash flows include:\n\n- \u00b7 premiums and related cash flows;\n- \u00b7 claims and benefits, including reported claims not yet paid, incurred claims not yet reported and expected future claims;\n- \u00b7 investment management costs incurred in the provision of an investment return service or to enhance the benefits of an insurance contract;\n- \u00b7 payments to policyholders resulting from embedded surrender value options;\n- \u00b7 an allocation of insurance acquisition cash flows attributable to the portfolio to which the contract belongs;\n- \u00b7 claims handling costs;\n- \u00b7 policy administration and maintenance costs, including recurring commissions that are expected to be paid to intermediaries for future services;\n- \u00b7 an allocation of fixed and variable overheads directly attributable to fulfilling insurance contracts; and\n- \u00b7 transaction-based taxes.\n\nThe Group incorporates, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort about the amount, timing and uncertainty of those future cash flows. The Group estimates the probabilities and amounts of future payments under existing contracts based on information obtained, including:\n\n- \u00b7 information about claims already reported by policyholders;\n- \u00b7 other information about the known or estimated characteristics of the insurance contracts;\n- \u00b7 historical data about the Group's own experience, supplemented when necessary, with data from other sources (historical data is adjusted to reflect current conditions); and\n- \u00b7 current pricing information, when available.\n\nThe measurement of fulfilment cash flows includes insurance acquisition cash flows which are allocated as a portion of premium to profit or loss (through insurance revenue) over the period of the contract.\n\nPre-recognition, insurance acquisition cash flow assets are recognised on the balance sheet prior to allocation to new insurance contracts and are considered for impairment at each reporting date.\n\n## Risk adjustment\n\nThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk for a group of insurance contracts reflects the compensation that the Group would require for bearing uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arise from non-financial risk after diversification. The Group's risk adjustment is calibrated using a Value at Risk (VAR) methodology. In some cases, the compensation for risk on reinsured business is linked directly to the price paid for reinsurance.\n\n## Discounting\n\nThe insurance contract fulfilment cash flows are discounted at rates that reflect the characteristics of the insurance contract liabilities. These are determined by starting from an appropriate asset portfolio with deductions to remove risks in the assets that are not present in the insurance liabilities.\n\n## Contractual service margin (CSM)\n\nThe Group's CSM is a component of the asset or liability for the group of insurance contracts that represents the unearned profit the Group will recognise as it provides services in the future. The Group measures the CSM on initial recognition at an amount that, unless the group of contracts is onerous, results in no income or expenses arising from:\n\n- \u00b7 initial recognition of the fulfilment cash flows;\n- \u00b7 any cash flows arising from the contracts in the Group at that date;\n- \u00b7 the derecognition at the date of initial recognition of:\n- - any asset for insurance acquisition cash flows; and\n- - any other asset or liability previously recognised related to the group of insurance contracts.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nFor groups of contracts assessed as onerous, the Group recognises a loss in profit or loss for the net outflow, resulting in the carrying amount of the liability for the Group being equal to the fulfilment cash flows and the CSM of the Group being zero. A loss component is established by the Group for the liability for remaining coverage for an onerous group, which represents the losses recognised.",

        "page_content": "Reinsurance contracts - initial measurement\n\nThe initial measurement of reinsurance contracts held follows the same principles as those for insurance contracts issued, with the exception of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 reinsurance contracts are recognised from the earlier of the following:\n- - the beginning of the coverage period; and\n- - the date the entity recognises an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts, if the entity entered into the related reinsurance contract held in the group of reinsurance contracts held at or before that date.\n- \u00b7 measurement of the cash flows includes an allowance on a probability-weighted basis for the effect of any non-performance by the reinsurers, including the effects of collateral and losses from disputes;\n- \u00b7 the Group determines the risk adjustment for non-financial risk so that it represents the amount of risk being transferred to the reinsurer;\n- \u00b7 both day one gains and day one losses are not recognised at initial recognition in the Consolidated Balance Sheet but are deferred into the CSM and released to profit or loss as the reinsurer renders services, except for any portion of a day one loss that relates to events before initial recognition; and\n- \u00b7 if the reinsurance contract is recognised prior to a loss-making underlying contract, the reinsurance CSM can be adjusted to offset a portion of the inception loss (the loss recovery component). This offsets a portion of the loss recognised on inception of the underlying onerous contract.\n\nLong term insurance contracts - subsequent measurement\n\nThe Group measures the carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts at the end of each reporting period as the sum of:\n\n- (i) the liability for remaining coverage comprising fulfilment cash flows related to future service allocated to the Group at that date and the CSM of the Group at that date; and\n- (ii)  the liability for incurred claims for the Group reflecting the fulfilment cash flows related to past service allocated to the Group at that date.\n\nContractual service margin - measurement\n\nThe CSM at the end of the reporting period represents the profit in the group of insurance contracts that has not yet been recognised in profit or loss, because it relates to future service to be provided.\n\nFor a group of insurance contracts the carrying amount of the CSM of that group at the end of the reporting period equals the carrying amount at the beginning of the reporting period adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 the effect of any new contracts added;\n- \u00b7 interest accreted on the carrying amount of the CSM during the reporting period, measured at the discount rates at initial recognition;\n- \u00b7 changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service, except to the extent that:\n- - such increases in the fulfilment cash flows exceed the current carrying amount of the CSM, giving rise to a loss; or\n- - such decreases in the fulfilment cash flows are allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage;\n- \u00b7 the amount recognised as insurance revenue because of the transfer of services in the period, determined by allocation of the contractual service margin at the end of the period over the current and remaining coverage period; and\n- \u00b7 the effect of any currency exchange differences on the CSM.\n\nThe changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service that adjust the CSM comprise of:\n\n- \u00b7 experience adjustments that arise from the difference between the premium receipts (net of refunds) and any related cash flows such as insurance acquisition cash flows and insurance premium taxes and the estimate, at the beginning of the period, of the amounts expected. Differences related to premiums received (or due) in respect of current or past services are recognised immediately in profit or loss while differences related to premiums received (or due) for future services are adjusted in the CSM;\n- \u00b7 changes in estimates of the present value of future cash flows in the liability for remaining coverage, except those relating to the time value of money and changes in financial risk (which are instead recognised in the profit or loss or in other comprehensive income);\n- \u00b7 differences between any investment component expected to become payable in the period and the actual investment component that becomes payable in the period; and\n- \u00b7 changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk that relate to future service.\n\nAdjustments to the CSM noted above are measured at discount rates that reflect the characteristics of the cash flows of the group of insurance contracts at initial recognition (i.e. the weighted average of the rates applicable at the date of initial recognition of contracts that joined a group over a 12-month period).\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nGroups of contracts that were not onerous at initial recognition can subsequently become onerous if assumptions and experience extinguish the CSM. In this case, the Group establishes a loss component for the future losses recognised. The loss component is released based on a systematic allocation of the subsequent changes in the fulfilment cash flows to: (i) the loss component; and (ii) the liability for remaining coverage excluding the loss component. The loss component is also updated for subsequent changes in estimates of the fulfilment cash flows related to future service. The systematic allocation of subsequent changes to the loss component results in the total amounts allocated to the loss component being equal to zero by the end of the coverage period of a group of contracts (since the loss component will have materialised in the form of incurred claims). The loss component ensures that over the duration of the contract, the correct amounts are recognised as insurance revenue and insurance service expenses.",

The proportion of the CSM earned is calculated as the amount of coverage units provided in the period divided by the sum of all the future and current period coverage units.

This is particularly pertinent to units of account incorporating a combination of immediate and deferred annuities. Under IFRS 17, deferred annuities usually provide multiple services, split between the two phases of benefit provision (the deferral phase and the payment phase). Judgement is therefore required to combine the different coverage units so that they fairly reflect the services provided. The weighting between the deferral phase and the payment phase coverage units is calculated so that the services provided in the deferral phase reflect the investment return provided and the probability weighted delivery of any lump sum death benefits, both adjusted so that all of the CSM is earned in the deferral phase for all contracts which do not enter the payment phase either through transfer out, withdrawal of funds or death.\n\n## Investment components\n\nThe Group identifies the investment component of a contract by determining the amount that it would be required to repay to the policyholder in all scenarios with commercial substance. Investment components are not included in insurance revenue and insurance service expenses.\n\n## Insurance finance income and expenses\n\nInsurance finance income and expenses comprise changes in the carrying amounts of groups of insurance contracts arising from the effects of the time value of money, financial risk and changes therein. IFRS 17 requires an accounting policy decision as to whether to recognise all finance income or expense in profit or loss, or whether to disaggregate the income or expense that relates to changes in financial assumptions into other comprehensive income. Finance income and expense has been included in profit or loss for all insurance products except for the Group's protection business where it has been disaggregated between profit and loss and other comprehensive income. Where insurance finance income and expense has been disaggregated the amount included in profit or loss is determined by a systematic allocation of the expected total insurance finance income or expenses over the duration of the group of contracts, using the discount rates determined on initial recognition.\n\nChanges in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk have been disaggregated between insurance service result and insurance finance income and expenses.\n\n## Reinsurance contracts held - subsequent measurement\n\nThe subsequent measurement of reinsurance contracts held follows the same principles as those for insurance contracts issued except that changes in the fulfilment cash flows are recognised in profit or loss if the related changes arising from the underlying ceded contracts are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nDerecognition and contract modification of insurance contracts\n\nThe Group derecognises a contract when it is extinguished, i.e. when the specified obligations in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.\n\nThe Group also derecognises a contract if its terms are modified in a way that would have changed the accounting for the contract significantly had the new terms always existed, in which case a new contract based on the modified terms is recognised. If a contract modification does not result in derecognition, then the Group treats the changes in cash flows caused by the modification as changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Recognition and derecognition\n\nInitial recognition of financial assets and liabilities is on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for a financial asset or financial liability not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. When the fair value of financial assets and liabilities differs from the transaction price on initial recognition, the Group recognises the difference as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 when the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability (i.e. a Level 1 input) or based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, the difference is recognised as a gain or loss; and\n- \u00b7 in all other cases, the difference is deferred and the timing of recognition of deferred day one profit or loss is determined individually. It is either amortised over the life of the instrument, deferred until the instrument's fair value can be determined using market observable inputs or realised through settlement.",

        "page_content": "Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity. This is the case for cash collateral pledged, where the counterparty has contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated, and which is derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a corresponding receivable recognised for its return.\n\nThe Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its Consolidated Balance Sheet, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Examples of such transactions are repurchase agreements and non-cash collateral pledged, unless the Group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.\n\nIn transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations expire or are discharged or cancelled. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset or financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount at the date of derecognition and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Modification\n\nIf the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs.\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets on initial recognition as measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).\n\nThe classification and measurement of financial assets depends on their contractual cash flow characteristics and how they are managed (the entity's business model). The contractual cash flow characteristics test aims to identify those assets with cash flows consistent with a basic lending arrangement, i.e. which are 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI). The business model test refers to how an entity manages its financial assets with the objectives of generating cash flows. These factors determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL. Assets are therefore typically characterised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 amortised cost: financial assets with contractual terms that give rise solely to interest and principal cash flows, and which are held in a business model whose objective is to hold the assets to collect their cash flows. They are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 FVOCI: financial assets with contractual terms that give rise solely to interest and principal cash flows, and which are held in a business model whose objective is achieved by holding the assets to collect their cash flows and selling them. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 FVTPL: all other financial assets. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income and foreign exchange gains and losses, are recognised in profit or loss, unless they arise from derivatives designated as hedging instruments in cash flow or net investment hedges.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, on initial recognition the Group may irrevocably designate to FVTPL a financial asset that would otherwise be measured at amortised cost or FVOCI if doing so eliminates or greatly reduces an accounting mismatch.\n\nIn making the SPPI assessment, the Group considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement (that is, interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement). This includes evaluating whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. Examples of such contractual terms to be considered are contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows, leverage features, prepayment and extension features, non-recourse asset arrangements and features that modify consideration for the time value of money (e.g. periodic reset of interest rates).\n\nThe business model reflects how the Group manages assets in order to generate cash flows, i.e. it reflects whether the Group's objective is solely to collect the contractual cash flows from assets or to collect both the contractual cash flows and cash flows arising from the sale of assets. If neither of these is applicable (for example, financial assets are held for trading purposes), the business model is 'other' and the financial asset is measured at FVTPL. Factors considered by the Group in determining the business model for a group of assets include past experience on how the cash flows for these assets were collected, how the asset's performance is evaluated and reported to key management personnel, how risks are assessed and managed, and how managers are compensated.",

Consistent with the Group's investment strategy their performance is evaluated on a total return basis, as significant buying and selling activity is undertaken on a regular basis to rebalance its portfolio and to ensure that contractual cash flows from those assets are sufficient to settle the underlying liabilities. These investments do not follow a 'held to collect' or 'held to collect and sell' business model, and are therefore accounted for at FVTPL. This business model is also applicable to reverse repurchase agreements and to derivatives. Equity instruments are accounted for at FVTPL.\n\nCertain debt securities are held in separate portfolios for longer-term yield. These include long dated debt instruments backing annuities liabilities, but in surplus to the IFRS 17 best estimate liability and risk adjustment, used to manage interest and inflation rate exposure, as well as assets backing protection liabilities. These assets represent instruments consistent with the SPPI principles, and are accounted for at amortised cost or FVOCI depending on the expected level of trading.\n\nReceivables are accounted for at amortised cost.\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial liabilities\n\nThe Group classifies and subsequently measures financial liabilities at amortised cost or FVTPL.\n\n## Investment contract liabilities\n\nInvestment contract liabilities are measured at FVTPL. This is because these liabilities, as well as the related assets, are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis. For unit linked liabilities, fair value is determined by reference to the value of the underlying net asset values of the Group's unitised investment funds at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Core and operational borrowings\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost. The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.\n\n## Other financial liabilities\n\nOther financial liabilities include derivative liabilities, repurchase agreements and trail commission, which are measured at FVTPL, while other payable balances are measured at amortised cost.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into. The Group's derivatives, other than those designated as hedging instruments in cash flow or net investment hedges, are instruments held for trading and, are therefore accounted for at FVTPL.\n\nDerivatives may be embedded in another contractual arrangement. If such a hybrid contract contains a host that is a financial asset, the Group assesses the entire contract for classification and measurement purposes. Otherwise, the Group accounts for an embedded derivative separately from the host contract when:\n\n- \u00b7 its economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract;\n- \u00b7 the terms of the embedded derivative would have met the definition of a derivative if they were contained in a separate contract; and\n- \u00b7 the hybrid contract is not measured at FVTPL.\n\nThese embedded derivatives are separately accounted for at FVTPL, unless the Group chooses to designate the entire hybrid contract at FVTPL.\n\nA derivative embedded in a host insurance or reinsurance contract is not accounted for separately from the host contract if the embedded derivative itself meets the definition of an insurance or reinsurance contract.\n\n## Collateral\n\nCollateral received in the form of cash, which is not legally segregated from the Group, is recognised as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding liability for the repayment in Payables and other financial liabilities. However, where the Group has a currently enforceable legal right of set-off and the ability and intent to net settle, the collateral liability and associated derivative balances are shown net.\n\nNon-cash collateral received is not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless the transfer of the collateral meets the derecognition criteria from the perspective of the transferor. Such collateral is typically recognised when the Group either: (a) sells or repledges these assets in the absence of default, at which point the obligation to return this collateral is recognised as a liability; or (b) the counterparty to the arrangement defaults, at which point the collateral is seized and recognised as an asset.\n\nCollateral pledged in the form of cash, which is legally segregated from the Group, is derecognised from the statement of financial position with a corresponding receivable recognised for its return. Non-cash collateral pledged is not derecognised from the statement of financial position unless the Group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement, and therefore continues to be recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet within Financial investments.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss (ECL) associated with its financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI, and recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. Expected credit losses are defined as the present value of the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due and all cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. the cash shortfall), weighted based on their probability of occurrence. The loss allowance recognised under the new standard can be equal to an amount corresponding to a 12-month ECL or a lifetime ECL. A lifetime ECL is the ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial asset; a 12-month ECL is the portion of lifetime ECL resulting from default events on a financial asset that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. For a financial asset that is credit-impaired at the reporting date, but that is not a purchased or originated credit-impaired financial asset, expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the asset's gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as an impairment gain or loss.\n\nThe Group defines default on a financial asset as the inability to meet in full and on time an original promise of expected cash flows, the amount and timing of which are defined with certainty. Any breach of this promise, by any amount or time (in excess of any potential planned grace period), constitutes a default. This is consistent with the definition of default used for internal credit risk management purposes.\n\nThe ECL model is run from the date of initial recognition of a financial asset, and its output updated at every reporting period, even if no actual loss events have taken place. The impact of updating the inputs of the ECL model in the reporting period is recognised in profit or loss directly where it affects the carrying value of financial assets at amortised cost, while for assets at FVOCI an equal and opposite movement is recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\nIn order to determine whether the Group measures ECLs at an amount equal to 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL, at each reporting period the Group is required to assess which 'stage' a financial asset falls into. Stages reflect the general pattern of deterioration in credit risk of a financial instrument that ultimately defaults, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1 includes financially healthy financial assets that are expected to perform in line with their contractual terms, and which have no signs of increased credit risk;\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 includes financial assets for which a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition, but which are not creditimpaired; and\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 applies to credit-impaired financial instruments.\n\nWhen financial assets are under Stage 1, 12-month ECLs are recognised. When financial assets are under Stage 2 or 3, lifetime ECLs are recognised. An instrument moves down (or up) the stages when a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) has happened (or has reversed).\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information, both qualitative and quantitative, that is relevant and is available without undue cost or effort, including forward-looking information at its disposal. Key indicators used in order to determine whether a SICR has occurred (either in isolation or in combination) are:\n\n- \u00b7 deterioration in rating grade between origination date and reporting date. The level of deterioration required by an individual asset is determined using a relative rating matrix;\n- \u00b7 exposure is identified on the investment managers' 'watchlist';\n- \u00b7 exposure is identified on internal 'credit watchlists'; and\n- \u00b7 a manual shift of an exposure to Stage 2 on an exceptional basis (where required, using management judgement).\n\nThe provisions of IFRS 9 include a rebuttable presumption that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, which is taken into account for this assessment.\n\nThe Group makes use of a practical expedient available in IFRS 9 whereby it can be assumed that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date (e.g. investment grade as determined by the Group's asset managers). This allows recognition of 12-month ECLs as opposed to, potentially, lifetime ECLs. This is deemed to be the case where assets that have been downgraded remain of good credit quality (i.e. investment grade as determined by the Group's asset managers) as at the reporting date, to the extent that, where relevant, the Group's internal credit risk ratings are considered to be consistent with a globally understood definition of 'low credit risk'.\n\nThe Group estimates ECLs on its financial investments at amortised cost and debt instruments at FVOCI which are not credit impaired by using the probability of default approach. Based on this method, the ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of the present value of estimated cash shortfalls, i.e. the weighted average of credit losses, with the respective risks of a default occurring used as the weightings. For this purpose, the key elements to be calculated are the Probability of Default (PD), i.e. the estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon (either 12 months or lifetime); the respective Loss Given Default (LGD); and the Exposure at Default (EAD).\n\nIn order to determine 12-month or lifetime PDs the Group's models utilise historical data obtained from S&P and Moody's in order to evaluate transitions (i.e. the probability that a security changes rating in a given year) and defaults, plus scenario-specific annual scaling factors which adjust the PDs for forward-looking information. The final PDs produced by the model are unconditional, i.e. they incorporate both the probability of not defaulting until the start of the period, and the subsequent probability of default in that period, conditional on the position not having defaulted to that point. This allows them to be summed over 12 months to provide 12-month PD estimates, or over all remaining months to produce lifetime PD estimates.",

The Group estimates LGD based on the history of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. Appropriate haircuts are applied to baseline unsecured LGDs and used in conjunction with forecast collateral values to estimate LGD for assets secured by collateral.\n\nThe Group has adopted a simplified approach for trade receivables, contract assets and finance and operating lease receivables. This allows measurement of lifetime ECLs only, thereby removing the need to identify SICRs. For these balances, the Group makes use of provision matrices in order to calculate such lifetime ECLs. This is a practical expedient allowed by IFRS 9 whereby historical credit loss experience and fixed loss rates are applied to the balances outstanding. Historical loss rates are adjusted to allow for forward looking information.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses hedge accounting, provided the prescribed criteria are met, to recognise the offsetting effects of changes in the fair value or cash flow of the derivative instrument and the hedged item. Hedge accounting can be applied in order to:\n\n- \u00b7 hedge the exposure to fair value movements of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or a component of any such item, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect the Consolidated Income Statement;\n- \u00b7 hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with all, or a component of, a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, that could affect the Consolidated Income Statement; and\n- \u00b7 hedge the exposure to the currency risk associated with a net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nThe relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, are documented formally at the inception of the transaction. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;\n- \u00b7 the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and\n- \u00b7 the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\n\nCurrently, the Group hedges foreign exchange translation and interest rate risks on its fixed rate USD denominated borrowings (the hedged items), using cross currency interest rate swaps (the hedging items). It recognises the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging items in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and in a separate reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nFair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Group's view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. The Group utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nThe best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price. In certain circumstances, the fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price. If the fair value is evidenced by comparison to a quoted price in an active market for an identical instrument, or is based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is recognised as a gain or loss in the Consolidated Income Statement. In all other cases, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is deferred and recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the instrument to the extent that it arises from a change in a factor (including time) that market participants would take into account when pricing the instrument.\n\n## Revenue\n\nInsurance revenue\n\nThe Group's insurance revenue depicts the provision of services arising from a group of insurance contracts, reflecting the consideration the Group expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Insurance revenue from a group of insurance contracts is therefore the relevant portion for the period of the total consideration for the contracts (i.e. the amount of premiums paid to the Group adjusted for financing effect (the time value of money) and excluding any investment components).",

        "page_content": "The total consideration for a group of contracts covers amounts related to the provision of services and is comprised of:\n\n- \u00b7 the release of the CSM;\n- \u00b7 changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk relating to current service;\n- \u00b7 claims and other insurance service expenses expected at the beginning of the period;\n- \u00b7 experience adjustments arising from premiums received in the period other than those that relate to future service;\n- \u00b7 insurance acquisition cost recovery determined by allocating the portion of premiums related to the recovery of those costs on the basis of insurance coverage provided; and\n- \u00b7 other amounts, including any other pre-recognition cash flow assets derecognised at the date of initial recognition.\n\nFees from fund management and investment contracts\n\nThe Group generates revenue from acting as the investment manager for clients. Fees charged on investment management services are based on the contractual fee arrangements applied to assets under management and recognised as revenue as the services are provided.\n\nThe Group's income from investment contracts is primarily derived from fees for administration and managing of funds in pension plans. Revenue generated on investment contracts is recognised as services are provided. No significant judgements are applied on the timing or transaction price. In the instances of performance fees where revenue is subject to meeting a certain performance threshold, such revenue is not recognised until the condition has been met, and it is highly probable that no significant reversal of amounts would occur. Variable costs directly related to securing new contracts are capitalised and amortised over the estimated period over which the revenue is earned.\n\nTransaction fees are charged to implement trades for clients. Such fees are charged at the time the transaction takes place and are based on the size of the underlying contract.\n\n## Other operational income from contracts with customers\n\n## House building\n\nHouse building revenue arises from the sale of residential properties and land and is recognised net of discounts and sales incentives. It also includes sale proceeds of part exchange properties. Sales of private houses are recognised on legal completion. Sales of social housing, where multiple units are developed and sold under a contractual agreement with a single customer, typically a housing association, are recognised over time in accordance with construction progress. Sales of land and commercial property are recognised on unconditional exchange, namely when contracts are exchanged or missives concluded and, where appropriate, construction is complete. The transaction price is determined using extensive research and expert judgement, current market values and regional variations.\n\nWarranties are provided on all properties and range from 2-10 years. Due to their features, these do not represent separate performance obligations.\n\n## Professional services fees\n\nThe Group's professional services fees revenue arises from professional services provided by employed surveyors and third-party providers, panel management fees and administration fees. These fees are based on fee scales or contracts. Revenue is recognised when the service has been rendered.\n\nIn addition, the Group derives professional fees from facilitation of mortgage arrangements and related products such as conveyancing. These are based on an agreement/contract and could be tiered based on volume. The obligation in such instances is satisfied on completion of the mortgage/ service, at which point the revenue is recognised. There is no significant judgement applied on the timing or amount of fee recognised.\n\n## Insurance broker fees\n\nFees are charged on each performance obligation offered to the customer as per the agreed structure. Revenue for placement services is recognised at the point in time when the intermediary has satisfied its performance obligation, that is when the terms of the insurance policy have been agreed contractually by the insurer and policyholder, and the insurer has a present right to payment from the policyholder. No significant judgements are applied on the timing or transaction price.\n\n## Investment return\n\nInvestment return includes unrealised fair value gains and losses on financial investments at fair value through profit or loss, realised gains and losses, dividends, rent and interest. Dividends are accrued on an ex-dividend basis. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the investment. Rental income is recognised on an accruals basis, and is generally recognised on a straight line basis unless there is compelling evidence that benefits do not accrue evenly over the period of the lease. Interest income for financial assets which are not classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) is recognised using the effective interest method.\n\nA gain or loss on a financial investment is only realised on disposal or transfer, and is the difference between the proceeds received, net of transaction costs and its original cost or amortised cost, as appropriate. Realised gains or losses on investment property represent the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the property.\n\nUnrealised gains and losses represent the difference between the carrying value at the end of the year and the carrying value at the previous year end or purchase value during the year, less the reversal of previously unrealised gains and losses in respect of disposals made during the year.",

        "page_content": "## Primary statements and performance\n\n## continued\n\n## 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued\n\n## (vii) Material accounting policies continued\n\n## Insurance service expenses\n\nInsurance service expenses arising from insurance contracts are recognised in profit or loss as they are incurred. They exclude repayments of investment components and comprise the following items:\n\n- \u00b7 incurred claims and benefits, excluding investment components reduced by loss component allocations;\n- \u00b7 incurred directly attributable expenses;\n- \u00b7 insurance acquisition cost amortisation; and\n- \u00b7 insurance acquisition cost asset impairment.\n\n## Dividends\n\nInterim dividends on ordinary shares are deducted from retained earnings in the period in which they are paid. Final dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as a liability in the period in which they have been approved by shareholders of the Company.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share is a measure of the portion of the Group's profit allocated to each outstanding share. It is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding employee scheme treasury shares. For this purpose, net income is defined as the profit after tax, attributable to equity holders of the Company, derived from continuing operations.\n\nFor diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding employee scheme treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees. Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets mainly consist of capitalised software costs and intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination (customer relationships and brand).\n\nWhere software costs are separately identifiable and measurable, they are capitalised at cost and amortised over their expected useful life on a straight-line basis. Costs incurred to internally develop software are only capitalised if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete such development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, such costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nIntangible assets acquired via business combinations are recognised at fair value and are subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.\n\nThe estimated amortisation periods for intangible assets with finite useful lives are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 IT development and software: 3 - 10 years\n- \u00b7 Customer relationship: 3 years\n\nAmortisation methods, useful lives and any expected residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.\n\nThe brand balance acquired by the Group is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and is therefore not amortised.\n\nIntangible assets are tested for impairment either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested when there are indications of impairment. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.\n\n## Investment property\n\nInvestment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long-term rental yields and capital growth, as well as right-of-use assets of the same nature, and are not occupied by the Group. Completed investment property is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within investment return. Investment properties under construction are included within Property, plant and equipment, and are stated at cost less any impairment until construction is completed or fair value becomes reliably measurable.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, treasury bills and other short-term highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment includes tangible assets owned by the Group (such as land and office and other buildings) or held under lease arrangements (such as office buildings, IT equipment and vehicles). Property, plant and equipment includes owner occupied property held by a fund, the units of which determine benefits for its investors. In accordance with IAS 16, 'Property, Plant and Equipment' the Group has elected to measure this asset at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within investment return.",

        "page_content": "All other assets within Property, plant and equipment are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation, calculated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Amortisation methods, useful lives and any expected residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.\n\nAn impairment review of Property, plant and equipment not carried at fair value is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, which is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount, with an impairment loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## Leases\n\n## Lessee\n\nWhere the Group is a lessee, it recognises leases on the balance sheet as 'right-of-use' assets and lease liabilities.\n\nThe right-of-use assets' value is initially recognised as the calculated value of the lease liabilities, initial direct costs and incentives received. The right-of-use assets are subsequently accounted for in accordance with the cost model in IAS 16, 'Property, Plant and Equipment' or as investment property under IAS 40, 'Investment Property'. The Group also assesses right-of-use assets classified as Property, plant and equipment for impairment when such indicators exist.\n\nThe initial measurement of the lease liabilities is made up of the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, including fixed lease payments and excluding lease incentive receivables. The Group uses the incremental borrowing rate as a discount rate for calculating the lease liabilities. The lease liabilities are unwound over the term of the lease giving rise to an interest expense. Additionally, the liabilities are reduced when lease payments are made. The Group reassesses the carrying amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets if certain events occur that modify the original assumptions used to calculate the lease balances upon initial recognition.\n\nThe Group leases offices, vehicles, IT equipment and investment properties under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The Group has elected to make use of the recognition exemptions as permitted in respect of short-term leases (lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less), and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value. Such leases are not recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but the Group recognises the associated lease payments as an expense over the lease term.\n\n## Lessor\n\nWhere the Group is the lessor, leases are classified as finance leases if the risks and rewards of ownership are substantially transferred to the lessee, and operating leases if they are not substantially transferred.\n\nThe Group leases certain investment properties to third parties. Under these agreements, substantially all the risks and reward incidental to ownership are transferred to the lessee, and therefore the contracts have been classified as finance leases. At the lease commencement date, the Group derecognises the investment property asset and recognises a receivable asset on its balance sheet to reflect the net investment in the lease, equal to the present value of the lease payments. The Group recognises finance income over the lease term to reflect the rate of return on the net investment in the lease.\n\nUnder other lease agreements the Group is considered to substantially retain all the risks and reward of ownership of the underlying asset, therefore these contracts have been classified as operating leases. Lease income from operating leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The Group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.\n\n## Defined benefit and defined contribution schemes\n\nThe liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, provided any surplus in the Fund and Scheme is not restricted. Plan assets exclude insurance contracts issued by the Group. The defined benefit obligation is calculated actuarially each year using the projected unit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows. The discount rate is based on market yields of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to those of the related pension liability.\n\nThe Group pays contractual contributions in respect of defined contribution schemes. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.\n\n## Tax\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax comprises tax payable on current year profits, adjusted for non-tax deductible or non-taxable items, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous periods. Current tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement unless it relates to items which are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly in equity.",

        "page_content": "## Primary statements and performance continued\n\n## 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued\n\n## (vii) Material accounting policies continued\n\nTax continued\n\nDeferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is calculated on differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax values. Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of unused tax losses to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the losses can be utilised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or charged or credited directly in equity.\n\n## Tax attributable to policyholders and equity holders\n\nThe total tax expense shown in the Group's Consolidated Income Statement includes income tax borne by both policyholders and equity holders. This has been split between tax attributable to policyholders' returns and equity holders' profits. Policyholder tax comprises the tax suffered on policyholder investment returns, while equity holder tax is corporation tax charged on equity holder profit. The separate presentation is intended to provide more relevant information about the tax that the Group pays on the profits that it makes.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nTax balances include the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\nFor tax this includes the determination of assets and liabilities recognised in respect of uncertain tax positions and the estimation of future taxable income supporting deferred tax asset recognition.\n\nAs the Group operates internationally, it is exposed to uncertain tax positions and changes in legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The assessment of uncertain tax positions is subjective and significant management judgement is required. This judgement is based on interpretation of legislation, management experience and professional advice. The directors have assessed the Group's uncertain tax positions and are comfortable that the provisions in place are not material individually or in aggregate, and that a reasonable possible alternative outcome in the next financial year would not have a material impact to the results of the Group.\n\n## Foreign exchange and exchange rates\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. The functional currency of the Group's foreign operations is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The assets and liabilities of all of the Group's foreign operations are translated into sterling, the Group's presentation currency, at the closing rate at the date of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to a separate component of shareholders' equity.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group accounts for options and awards under equity compensation plans, until such time as they are fully vested, using the fair value based method of accounting. The fair value at the date of grant of the equity instrument is recognised as an expense, spread over the vesting period of the instrument. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity. On vesting or exercise, the difference between the expense charged to the income statement and the actual cost to the Group is transferred to retained earnings. Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.\n\n## Share capital, share premium and employee scheme treasury shares\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the net assets of an entity. It follows that a financial instrument is treated as equity if:\n\n- \u00b7 there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on unfavourable terms; and\n- \u00b7 the instrument is either a non-derivative which contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of own equity instruments, or is a derivative which will be settled only by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash, or other financial assets, for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.\n\nWhere any Group entity purchases the Company's equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders. Where such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to shareholders, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects. Shares held on behalf of employee share schemes are disclosed as such on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Fiduciary activities\n\nAssets associated with fiduciary activities and the income arising from those assets, together with associated commitments to return such assets to customers, are not included in these financial statements. Where the Group acts in a fiduciary capacity, for instance as a trustee or agent, it has no contractual rights over the assets concerned.",

While the calculation of adjusted operating profit has been updated to reflect the accounting and presentational impacts of IFRS 17, the key principles of what is measured by adjusted operating profit, as set out below and except as noted, remain unchanged from the prior year.\n\nAdjusted operating profit measures the pre-tax result excluding the impact of investment volatility, economic assumption changes caused by changes in market conditions or expectations and exceptional items. Key considerations in relation to the calculation of adjusted operating profit for the Group's long-term insurance businesses and shareholder funds are set out below.\n\nExceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the year, such as merger and acquisition and start-up costs, are excluded from adjusted operating profit.\n\n## Long-term insurance\n\nAdjusted operating profit reflects longer-term economic assumptions for the Group's retirement and insurance businesses. Variances between actual and long-term expected investment return on traded and real assets are excluded from adjusted operating profit, as well as economic assumption changes caused by changes in market conditions or expectations (e.g. credit default and inflation) and any difference between the actual allocated asset mix and the target long-term asset mix on new pension risk transfer business. Assets held for future new pension risk transfer business are excluded from the asset portfolio used to determine the discount rate for annuities on insurance contract liabilities. The impact of investment management actions that optimise the yield of the assets backing the back book of annuity contracts is now included within adjusted operating profit; prior to the implementation of IFRS 17 the impact of such actions was not included in operating profit.",

Reinsurance mismatches arise where the reinsurance offset rules in IFRS 17 do not reflect management's view of the net of reinsurance transaction. In particular, during a year of reinsurance renegotiation, reinsurance gains cannot be recognised to offset any inception losses on the underlying contracts where they are recognised before the new reinsurance agreement is signed. In these circumstances, the onerous contract losses are reduced to reflect the net loss (if any) after reinsurance, and future contractual service margin (CSM) amortisation is reduced over the duration of the contracts.\n\n## Shareholder funds\n\nShareholder funds include both the Group's traded investments portfolio and certain direct investments for which adjusted operating profit is based on the long-term economic return expected to be generated. For these direct investments, as well as for the Group's traded investments portfolio, deviations from such long-term economic return are excluded from adjusted operating profit. Direct investments for which adjusted operating profit is reflected in this way include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Development assets, predominantly in the specialist commercial real estate and housing sectors within the LGC alternative asset portfolio: these are assets under construction and contracted to either be sold to other parts of the Group or for other commercial usage, and on which LGC accepts development risks and expects to realise profits once construction is complete.\n- \u00b7 'Scale-up' investments, predominantly in the alternative finance sector within the LGC alternative asset portfolio as well as the fintech business within Retail: these are investments in early-stage ventures in a fast-growing phase of their life cycle, but which have not yet reached a steady-state level of earnings.\n\nShareholder funds also includes other direct investments for which adjusted operating profit reflects the IFRS profit before tax. Direct investments for which adjusted operating profit is reflected in this way include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 'Start-up' investments: these are companies in the beginning stages of their business lifecycle (i.e. typically less than 24 months) and which therefore have limited operating history available and typically are in a pre-revenue stage.\n- \u00b7 Mature assets: these are companies in their final stages of business lifecycle. They are stable businesses and have sustainable streams of income, but the growth rate in their earnings is expected to remain less pronounced in the future.\n\n## Business segments\n\nThe Group reports its results across the following business segments:\n\n- \u00b7 LGRI represents worldwide pension risk transfer business including longevity insurance.\n- \u00b7 LGC represents shareholder assets invested in direct investments primarily in the areas of specialist commercial real estate, clean energy, housing and alternative finance, as well as traded and treasury assets.\n- \u00b7 LGIM represents institutional and retail investment management.\n- \u00b7 Insurance primarily represents UK protection (both Group and retail) and fintech business, as well as US retail protection business.\n- \u00b7 Retail Retirement primarily represents retail annuity and drawdown products, workplace savings and lifetime mortgage loans.\n\n## (ii) Analysis of LGRI and Retail adjusted operating profit\n\n|                                                         | LGRI 2023 \u00a3m   | Retail 2023 \u00a3m   | LGRI 2022 \u00a3m   | Retail 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Amortisation of the CSM in the year 1                   | 591            | 446              | 497            | 424              |\n| Release of risk adjustment in the year                  | 119            | 74               | 136            | 85               |\n| Experience variances                                    | (14)           | (17)             | 15             | (92)             |\n| Development of losses on onerous contracts              | 1              | (27)             | 1              | (7)              |\n| Other expenses 2                                        | (160)          | (121)            | (130)          | (113)            |\n| Insurance investment margin 3                           | 344            | 81               | 280            | 60               |\n| Investment contracts and non-insurance operating profit | 5              | (28)             | 8              | 58               |\n| Total LGRI and Retail adjusted operating profit         | 886            | 408              | 807            | 415              |\n\n- 1.

Changes in non-financial assumptions, including longevity, recalibrate the CSM at locked-in point-of-sale discount rates whilst the fulfilment cash flows are measured at current discount rates, thereby creating a component of investment variance between these different bases.\n\nThe long-term expected investment return is based on opening economic assumptions applied to the assets at the start of the reporting year. The assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected returns for traded equity, commercial property and residential property are based on market consensus forecasts and long-term historic average returns expected to apply through the cycle.\n\nThe long-term expected investment returns are:\n\n|                      | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equities             | 7%     | 7%     |\n| Commercial property  | 5%     | 5%     |\n| Residential property | 3.5%   | 3.5%   |\n\nFor fixed interest securities measured at FVTPL, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held less an adjustment for credit risk (assessed on a best estimate basis). Where securities are measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, the expected investment return comprises interest income on an effective interest rate basis.\n\nFor equity direct investments, the LGC alternative asset portfolio and Retail's Insurance business comprise investments in housing, specialist commercial real estate, clean energy, alternative finance and fintech. Where used for the determination of adjusted operating profit, the long-term expected investment return is on average between 10% and 12%, in line with our stated investment objectives. Rates of return specific to each asset are determined at the point of underwriting and reviewed and updated annually. The expected investment return includes assumptions on appropriate discount rates and inflation as well as sector specific assumptions including retail and commercial property yields and power prices.",

The Group's asset and liabilities are managed on a legal entity rather than reportable segment basis, in line with regulatory requirements.\n\nFinancial information on the reportable segments is further broken down where relevant in order to better explain the drivers of the Group's results.\n\n## (a) Profit/(loss) for the year\n\n| For the year ended 31 December 2023                     | LGRI \u00a3m   | LGC \u00a3m   | LGIM \u00a3m   | Insurance \u00a3m   | Retail Retirement \u00a3m   | Group expenses and debt costs \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------|\n| Adjusted operating profit/(loss)                        | 886       | 510      | 274       | 138            | 270                    | (411)                              | 1,667      |\n| Investment and other variances                          | (449)     | (487)    | (76)      | (81)           | (119)                  | (365)                              | (1,577)    |\n| Losses attributable to non-controlling interests        | -         | -        | -         | -              | -                      | (14)                               | (14)       |\n| Profit/(loss) before tax attributable to equity holders | 437       | 23       | 198       | 57             | 151                    | (790)                              | 76         |\n| Tax credit/(expense) attributable to equity holders     | 244       | 18       | (49)      | (40)           | 63                     | 131                                | 367        |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year                              | 681       | 41       | 149       | 17             | 214                    | (659)                              | 443        |\n\n| For the year ended 31 December 2022 (Restated)          | LGRI \u00a3m   | LGC \u00a3m   | LGIM \u00a3m   | Insurance \u00a3m   | Retail Retirement \u00a3m   | Group expenses and debt costs \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------|\n| Adjusted operating profit/(loss)                        | 807       | 509      | 340       | 165            | 250                    | (408)                              | 1,663      |\n| Investment and other variances                          | (137)     | (428)    | (81)      | 69             | (47)                   | (170)                              | (794)      |\n| Losses attributable to non-controlling interests        | -         | -        | -         | -              | -                      | (1)                                | (1)        |\n| Profit/(loss) before tax attributable to equity holders | 670       | 81       | 259       | 234            | 203                    | (579)                              | 868        |\n| Tax (expense)/credit attributable to equity holders     | (121)     | (26)     | (30)      | (11)           | (32)                   | 134                                | (86)       |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year                              | 549       | 55       | 229       | 223            | 171                    | (445)                              | 782        |\n\n## (b) Total revenue - summary\n\nTotal revenue includes insurance revenue, fees from fund management and investment contracts and other operational income from contracts with customers.

The Group seeks to manage its exposure to risk through controls which ensure that the residual exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the Board. The Group's risk appetite framework and the methods used to monitor risk exposures can be found on pages 52 to 59.\n\nDetails of the risks associated with the Group's principal products and the controls used to manage these risks can be found in Notes 7 and 15 to 17.\n\n## Legal & General Retirement Institutional (LGRI)\n\n## Annuity contracts\n\nPension risk transfer (PRT) represents bulk annuities, whereby the Group accepts the assets and liabilities of a company pension scheme or a life fund. Annuities provide guaranteed income for a specified time, usually the life of the policyholder and may include a guaranteed payment period. PRT business consists of both immediate and deferred annuities.\n\nImmediate annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder and are in payment at the date of the transaction.\n\nDeferred annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder where the income stream starts at a future date after the transaction. Some deferred contracts accepted by the Group contain guaranteed cash options, predominantly minimum factors for commuting part of the annuity income into cash at the date of vesting.\n\nThere is a block of immediate and deferred annuities within the UK business with benefits linked to changes in the RPI or for a minority the CPI, but with contractual maximum or minimum increases. Impact on profit due to changes in inflation can be found within the IFRS sensitivity analysis note.",

        "page_content": "## Investment contracts\n\nThe Group writes Assured Payment Policies (APP). An APP is a long-term contract under which the policyholder (a registered UK pension scheme) pays a day-one premium and in return receives a contractually fixed and/or inflation-linked set of payments over a fixed period of time from the insurer.\n\n## Longevity insurance contracts\n\nThe Group also provides longevity insurance products for company pension schemes, under which regular payments are made to the scheme reflecting their actual longevity experience, while the scheme makes an agreed set of regular payments in return. Some policies contain a guaranteed surrender value which is currently immaterial.\n\n## Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM)\n\nLGIM offers both active and passive management on either a pooled or segregated basis to clients domiciled globally. Assets are managed in London and Chicago on behalf of pension funds, institutional clients, sovereign wealth clients, retail clients and subsidiary companies within the Group.\n\nThe key products provided by LGIM are unit linked institutional pensions, segregated investment management mandates and collective investment schemes.\n\nThe core strategies applied for managing the products are set out below.\n\n## Index fund management\n\nLGIM provides a diversified range of pooled index funds, providing a wide choice and the ability to pursue specific benchmarks efficiently. In addition, segregated solutions are offered to institutional clients providing large scale customisation against established market capitalisation weighted and alternative indices.\n\nThe LGIM Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) business provides clients access to LGIM's index fund management capabilities via our ETF platform. ETF products cover a broad range of traditional and thematic asset classes.\n\n## Active strategies\n\nLGIM offers a range of pooled and segregated active fixed income funds. The LGIM liquidity funds offer institutional investors a solution for their cash management requirements across a range of core currencies. The liquidity funds aim to deliver competitive returns with a high level of diversification, whilst focusing on capital preservation through portfolios of high quality, liquid assets.\n\nActive strategies also includes an active equity management business comprising focused teams managing stock selection across different regions.\n\n## Solutions and Liability Driven Investment (LDI)\n\nLGIM provides a range of pooled and bespoke solutions to help de-risk defined benefit pension schemes. These solutions will usually combine active or passive underlying portfolios with derivative overlays designed to meet clients' specific requirements. An allocation strategy service is also offered to institutional clients, which may also allocate some of the portfolio to managers other than LGIM.\n\n## Multi-asset funds\n\nMulti-asset funds for retail and institutional clients, built using LGIM's expertise in asset allocation which is informed by an in-house research capability. The underlying asset classes may be managed on an active or passive basis within LGIM.\n\n## Real assets\n\nLGIM offers a range of pooled funds, segregated accounts and joint ventures investing on behalf of UK and overseas investors across physical real estate, private corporate debt, infrastructure debt and real estate loans. The business has specialist teams of fund and asset managers and an in-house research team.\n\n## Legal & General Capital (LGC)\n\n## Investment strategy and implementation\n\nLegal & General Capital manages shareholder assets which are not directly required to meet contractual obligations to policyholders. LGC's investments fall into two distinct categories; direct investments and traded assets. The value of, and income from, both categories is sensitive to conditions within investment markets and the broader economy. Potential volatility in returns is managed using a range of techniques, including foreign exchange and interest rate hedging, and exposure concentration limits by asset type, sector and geographic region.\n\n## Direct investments and structuring\n\nDirect investments are an integral part of the wider Group strategy. LGC's direct investments are typically illiquid investments entered into through acquisition, joint venture with strategic partners or by the creation of new companies. LGC seeks to make direct investments in sectors where there are structural funding shortfalls, and is organised into four sectors: specialist commercial real estate, clean energy, housing and alternative finance. LGC deploys capital and sector expertise to such investments to target attractive risk-adjusted returns which can deliver higher returns and/or lower volatility for our shareholder capital than listed equity.",

        "page_content": "## Balance sheet management\n\n## continued\n\n## 6 Principal products continued\n\n## Retail\n\nThe Retail division comprises Insurance and Retail Retirement businesses.\n\n## UK protection business (Retail and Group)\n\nThe Group offers protection products which provide mortality or morbidity benefits. They may include health, disability, critical illness and accident benefits; these additional benefits are commonly provided as supplements to main life policies but can also be sold separately. The benefit amounts would usually be specified in the policy terms. Some sickness benefits cover the policyholder's mortgage repayments and are linked to the prevailing mortgage interest rates. In addition to these benefits, some contracts may guarantee premium rates, provide guaranteed insurability benefits and offer policyholders conversion options.\n\n## US protection business\n\nUS protection represents individual term assurance, which provides death benefits over the medium to long-term. The contracts have level premiums for an initial period with premiums set annually thereafter. During the initial period, there is generally an option to convert the contract to a universal life contract. After the initial period, the premium rates are not guaranteed, but cannot exceed the age-related guaranteed premium.\n\n## US universal life\n\nUniversal life contracts written by Legal & General America (LGA) provide savings and death benefits over the medium to long-term. The savings element has a guaranteed minimum growth rate. LGA has exposure to loss in the event that interest rates decrease and it is unable to earn enough on the underlying assets to cover the guaranteed rate. LGA is also exposed to loss should interest rates increase, as the underlying market value of assets will generally fall without a change in the surrender value.\n\nReinsurance is used within the protection businesses to manage exposure to large claims for individual term business and virtually all universal life business. These practices lead to the establishment of reinsurance assets on the Group's balance sheet. Within our US business, reinsurance and securitisation are also used to provide regulatory solvency relief (including relief from regulation governing term insurance).\n\n## Annuities\n\nImmediate annuities have similar characteristics as products sold by LGRI. The Group also offers products for individuals that provide a guaranteed level of income over a chosen fixed period of time, in exchange for an initial lump sum payment from the policyholder. The products can provide a fixed lump sum at maturity and/or options to surrender on non-guaranteed terms.\n\nDeferred annuity contracts written by LGA contain a provision that, at maturity, a policyholder may move the account value into an immediate annuity, at rates which are either those currently in effect, or rates guaranteed in the contract.\n\n## Lifetime care plan\n\nThe lifetime care plan provides a monthly payment to a UK registered care provider that helps meet the cost of care for the policyholder's life. A policyholder can choose to receive a fixed monthly payment or opt to have escalation built in. A death benefit exists within the product so that if a policyholder dies within the first 6 months of the start date a percentage of the original premium less any payments already made is payable to the estate.\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nLifetime mortgages are a form of equity release mortgage that provide non-commercial borrowers with a loan secured against their main residence, without the need for regular repayments. They are regulated retail mortgages offered only to borrowers over the age of 55 through specialist intermediaries. Interest accrues over the term of the loan and is repayable at the time the principal becomes due. Loans can be advanced in a single lump sum amount or in several subsequent drawdowns of an agreed facility. All lifetime mortgages provide a 'no negative equity' guarantee, which means that if the loan is repaid from the sale of the property and if the net sale proceeds are lower than the balance of the loan, the Group will accept the net sale proceeds as full settlement.\n\n## Retirement interest-only mortgages\n\nA retirement interest-only (RIO) mortgage is a standard residential mortgage available for non-commercial borrowers above 55 years old. A RIO mortgage is very similar to a standard interest-only mortgage, with two key differences:\n\n- \u00b7 the loan is usually only paid off on death, move into long-term care or sale of the house\n- \u00b7 the borrowers only have to prove they can afford the monthly interest repayments and not the capital remaining at the end of the mortgage term.\n\nNo repayment solution is required as repayment defaults to sale of property.\n\n## Workplace savings\n\nWorkplace savings provides corporate pension scheme solutions to enable companies to meet their auto-enrolment obligations. Workplace savings acts as scheme operator and administrator for these products while the customers hold the individual or scheme level pension policies issued by Legal and General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS).",

However, LGIM's income is related to the value of funds under management, and so they are indirectly exposed to market risks that impact the value of assets underlying those funds.\n\nThe Group seeks to manage its exposures to risk through controls which ensure that the residual risk exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the Board.

If appropriate, actions are taken to trade out  investments at risk of default.                                                               |\n| Reinsurance counterparty risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Exposure to insurance risk is mitigated by ceding part of  the risks assumed to the reinsurance market. Default of a  reinsurer would require the business to be re-brokered  potentially on less advantageous terms, or for the risks to  be borne directly resulting in possible financial loss. The  Group is required to carry an element of associated  credit risk capital on its balance sheet should the  business not be re-brokered on the same terms. | LGRI and Retail | When selecting new reinsurance partners for its protection business, the  Group considers only companies which have a minimum credit rating  equivalent to A- unless collateralised. For each reinsurer, exposure limits are  determined based on credit ratings and projected exposure over the term of  the treaty. Actual exposures are regularly monitored relative to these limits.  Similarly, for longevity and credit risk syndication transactions, the Group  targets the use of strongly rated counterparties and seeks to ensure that  positions are fully collateralised. The adequacy and quality of collateral is  subject to ongoing monitoring. |\n| Property lending counterparty risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| As part of our asset diversification strategy, we hold  property lending and sale and leaseback investments.

A limited level of contingent liquidity risk is, however, an accepted  element of writing insurance contracts. It is furthermore a consequence of  the markets in which the Group operates and the execution of investment  management strategies. However, the Group's insurance businesses seek  to maintain sufficient liquid assets and standby facilities to meet a prudent  estimate of the cash outflows that may arise from contingent events.

Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included\n\nwithin Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n\nLevel 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).",

Each uses mathematical modelling and multiple source validation in order to determine consensus prices, with the exception of OTC Derivative holdings; OTCs are marked to market using an in-house system (Lombard Oberon), external vendor (IHS Markit), internal model or Counterparty Broker marks. In normal market conditions, we would consider these market prices to be observable market prices. Following consultation with our pricing providers and a number of their contributing brokers, we have considered that these prices are not from a suitably active market and have therefore classified them as Level 2.\n\nThe Group's policy is to re-assess categorisation of financial assets at the end of each reporting period and to recognise transfers between levels at that point in time. At 31 December 2023 debt securities totalling net \u00a30.7bn (2022: \u00a36.0bn) transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## (b) Level 3 assets measured at fair value\n\nLevel 3 assets, where modelling techniques are used, comprise property, unquoted securities, untraded debt securities and securities where unquoted prices are provided by a single broker. Unquoted securities include suspended securities, investments in private equity and property vehicles. Untraded debt securities include private placements, commercial real estate loans, income strips, retirement interest only and other lifetime mortgages.\n\nIn many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these situations, the Group determines the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. As a result, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used in the determination of fair values that the Group has classified within Level 3.\n\nThe Group determines the fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available. The Group also determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate. As appropriate, fair values reflect adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the Group's credit standing, liquidity and risk margins on unobservable inputs.\n\nFair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that input variables and outputs are assessed independent of the risk taker. These inputs and outputs are reviewed and approved by a valuation committee and validated independently as appropriate.\n\n|                                   | Equity securities 2023 \u00a3m   | Other financial investments 2023 \u00a3m   | Investment property 2023 \u00a3m   | Total 2023 \u00a3m   | Equity securities 2022 \u00a3m   | Restated Other financial investments 2022 \u00a3m   | Investment property 2022 \u00a3m   | Restated Total 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| As at 1 January                   | 2,307                       | 16,421                                | 9,372                         | 28,100          | 1,988                       | 16,599                                         | 10,150                        | 28,737                   |\n| Total gains/(losses) for the year |                             |                                       |                               |                 |                             |                                                |                               |                          |\n| - realised gains or (losses) 1    | 24                          | (432)                                 | 3                             | (405)           | 28                          | (78)                                           | 81                            | 31                       |\n| - unrealised gains or (losses) 1  | (34)                        | 357                                   | (923)                         | (600)           | 83                          | (4,381)                                        | (1,796)                       | (6,094)                  |\n| Purchases/Additions               | 278                         | 6,009                                 | 1,264                         | 7,551           | 504                         | 10,922                                         | 1,307                         | 12,733                   |\n| Disposals/Derecognitions          | (149)                       | (2,018)                               | (854)                         | (3,021)         | (381)                       | (6,908)                                        | (377)                         | (7,666)                  |\n| Transfers into Level 3            | 2                           | 241                                   | -                             | 243             | 84                          | 72                                             | -                             | 156                      |\n| Transfers out of Level 3          | (3)                         | -                                     | -                             | (3)             | (41)                        | -                                              | -                             | (41)                     |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements   | (33)                        | (115)                                 | 31                            | (117)           | 42                          | 195                                            | 7                             | 244                      |\n| As at 31 December                 | 2,392                       | 20,463                                | 8,893                         | 31,748          | 2,307                       | 16,421                                         | 9,372                         | 28,100                   |\n\n## Equity securities\n\nLevel 3 equity securities amount to \u00a32,392m (2022: \u00a32,307m), of which the majority is made up of holdings in investment property vehicles and private investment funds. They are valued at the proportion of the Group's holding of the Net Asset Value reported by the investment vehicles. Other equity securities are valued by a number of third party specialists using a range of techniques which are often dependent on the maturity of the underlying investment but can also depend on the characteristics of individual assets. Such techniques include transaction values underpinned by analysis of milestone achievement and cash runway for early/start-up stage investments, discounted cash flow models for investments at the next stage of development and earnings multiples for more mature investments.",

        "page_content": "## Other financial investments\n\nLifetime mortgage (LTM) loans and retirement interest only mortgages amount to \u00a35,766m (2022: \u00a34,844m). Lifetime mortgages are valued using a discounted cash flow model by projecting best-estimate net asset proceeds and discounted using rates inferred from current LTM loan pricing. The inferred illiquidity premiums for the majority of the portfolio range between 150 and 300bps. This ensures the value of loans at outset is consistent with the purchase price of the loan and achieves consistency between new and in-force loans. Lifetime mortgages include a no negative equity guarantee (NNEG) to borrowers. This ensures that if there is a shortfall between the sale proceeds of the property and the outstanding loan balance on redemption of the loan, the value of the loan will be reduced by this amount. The NNEG on loan redemption is valued as a series of put options, which we calculate using a variant of the Black-Scholes formula. Key assumptions in the valuation of lifetime mortgages include short-term and long-term property growth rates, property index volatility, voluntary early repayments and longevity assumptions. The valuation as at 31 December 2023 reflects a combination of short-term and long-term property growth rate assumptions equivalent to a flat rate of 2.8% annually, after allowing for the effects of dilapidation. The values of the properties collateralising the LTM loans are updated from the date of the last property valuation to the valuation date by indexing using UK regional house price indices.\n\nPrivate credit loans (including commercial real estate loans) amount to \u00a310,574m (2022: \u00a37,858m). Their valuation is determined by discounted future cash flows which are based on the yield curve of the LGIM approved comparable bonds and the initial spread, both of which are agreed by IHS Markit who also provide an independent valuation of comparable bonds. Unobservable inputs that go into the determination of comparators include rating, sector, sub-sector, performance dynamics, financing structure and duration of investment. Existing private credit investments, which were executed as far back as 2011, are subject to a range of interest rate formats, although the majority are fixed rate. The weighted average duration of the portfolio is 7.8 years, with a weighted average life of 11.1 years. Maturities in the portfolio currently extend out to 2063. The private credit portfolio of assets has internal ratings assigned by an independent credit team in line with internally developed methodologies. These credit ratings range from AAA to BB-.\n\nPrivate placements held by the US business amount to \u00a31,684m (2022: \u00a31,320m). They are valued using a pricing matrix comprised of a public spread matrix, internal ratings assigned to each holding, average life of each holding, and a premium spread matrix. These are added to the risk-free rate to calculate the discounted cash flows and establish a market value for each investment grade private placement. The valuation as at 31 December 2023 reflects illiquidity premiums between 20 and 70bps.\n\nIncome strip assets amount to \u00a31,306m (2022: \u00a31,414m). Their valuation is outsourced to Knight Frank and CBRE who apply a yield to maturity to discounted future cash flows to derive valuations. The overall valuation takes into account the property location, tenant details, tenure, rent, rental break terms, lease expiries and underlying residual value of the property. The valuation as at 31 December 2023 reflects equivalent yield ranges between 4% and 7% and estimated rental values (ERV) between \u00a318 and \u00a3310 per sq.ft.\n\nCommercial mortgage loans amount to \u00a3784m (2022: \u00a3768m) and are determined by incorporating credit risk for performing loans at the portfolio level and adjusted for loans identified to be distressed at the loan level. The projected cash flows of each loan are discounted along stochastic risk-free rate paths and are inclusive of an Option Adjusted Spread (OAS), derived from current internal pricing on new loans, along with the best observable inputs. The valuation as at 31 December 2023 reflects illiquidity premiums between 20 and 30bps.\n\nOther debt securities which are not traded in an active market amount to \u00a3349m (2022: \u00a3217m). They have been valued using third party or counterparty valuations, and these prices are considered to be unobservable due to infrequent market transactions.\n\n## Investment property\n\nLevel 3 investment property amounting to \u00a38,893m (2022: \u00a39,372m) is valued with the involvement of external valuers. All property valuations in the UK are carried out in accordance with the latest edition of the Valuation Standards published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, and are undertaken by appropriately qualified valuers as defined therein. Outside the UK, valuations are produced in conjunction with external qualified professional valuers in the countries concerned. Whilst transaction evidence underpins the valuation process, the definition of market value, including the commentary, in practice requires the valuer to reflect the realities of the current market. In this context valuers must use their market knowledge and professional judgement and not rely only upon market sentiment based on historic transactional comparables.\n\nThe valuation of investment properties also includes an income approach that is based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts, where the uplift and discount rates are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions. These inputs are deemed unobservable. The valuation as at 31 December 2023 reflects equivalent yield ranges between 3% and 13% and ERV between \u00a35 and \u00a3310 per sq.ft.\n\nThe table below shows the valuation of investment property by sector:\n\n|                                 | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Retail                          | 1,169     | 780       |\n| Leisure                         | 451       | 461       |\n| Distribution                    | 1,076     | 1,104     |\n| Office space                    | 2,768     | 4,069     |\n| Industrial and other commercial | 1,714     | 1,624     |\n| Accommodation                   | 1,715     | 1,334     |\n| Total                           | 8,893     | 9,372     |",

The table below shows the impact of applying these sensitivities to the fair value of Level 3 assets as at 31 December 2023. Further disclosure on how these sensitivities have been applied can be found in the descriptions following the table.\n\n|                           |                    | Sensitivities        | Sensitivities        |\n|---------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                           | Fair value 2023 \u00a3m | Positive  impact  \u00a3m | Negative  impact  \u00a3m |\n| Lifetime mortgages        | 5,766              | 262                  | (322)                |\n| Private credit portfolios | 13,042             | 580                  | (580)                |\n| Investment property       | 8,893              | 731                  | (717)                |\n| Other investments 1       | 4,047              | 297                  | (393)                |\n| Total Level 3 assets      | 31,748             | 1,870                | (2,012)              |\n\nThe sensitivities are not a function of sensitising a single variable relating to the valuation of the asset, but rather a function of flexing multiple factors often at individual asset level. The following sets out a number of key factors by asset type, and how they have been flexed to derive reasonable alternative valuations.\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nKey assumptions used in the valuation of lifetime mortgage assets are listed in Note 11(ii)(b) and sensitivities are applied to derive the values in the above table. The most significant sensitivity by value is -20bps of market spread and overvaluation of property valuations by 10% across the portfolio which, applied in isolation produces sensitised values of \u00a3152m and \u00a3(191)m.\n\n## Private credit portfolios\n\nThe sensitivity in the private credit portfolio has been determined through a method which estimates investment spread value premium differences as compared to the institutional investment market. Individual investment characteristics of each holding, such as credit rating and duration are used to determine spread differentials for the purposes of determining alternate values. Spread differentials are determined to be lower for highly rated and/or shorter duration assets as compared to lower rated and/or longer duration assets. A significant component of the spread differential is in relation to the selection of comparator bonds, which is the potential difference in spread of the basket of relevant comparators determined by respective investors. If we were to take an AA rated asset it may attract a spread differential of 20bps on the selection of comparator bonds as opposed to 40bps for a similar duration BBB rated asset. Applied in isolation the sensitivity used to reflect the spread in comparator bond selection results in sensitised values of \u00a3220m and \u00a3(220)m.\n\n## Investment property\n\nInvestment property holdings are valued by independent valuers on the basis of open market value as defined in the appraisal and valuation manual of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. As such, sensitivities are calculated through a mixture of asset level and portfolio level methodologies which make reference to individual investment characteristics of the holding but do not flex individual assumptions used by the independent expert in valuing the holdings. Each method is applied individually and aggregated with equal weighting to determine the overall sensitivity determined for the portfolio. One method is similar to that used in the private credit portfolio as it determines the impact of an alternate property yield determined in reference to credit ratings, remaining term and other characteristics of each holding. In this methodology we would apply a lower yield sensitivity to a highly rated and/or shorter remaining term asset compared with a lower rated and/or longer remaining term asset. If we were to take an AA rated asset with remaining term of 25 years in normal market conditions this would lead to a 15bps yield flex (as opposed to a 35bps yield flex for a BBB rated asset with 30 year remaining term). The methodology which leads to the most significant sensitivity at the balance sheet date is related to an example in case law where it was found that an acceptable margin of error in a valuation dispute is 10% either way, subject to the valuation being undertaken with due care. If this sensitivity were to be taken without a weighting it would produce sensitised values of \u00a3594m and \u00a3(594)m.\n\nIt should be noted that some sensitivities described above are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.\n\n## (iii) Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nGBP LIBOR was replaced by SONIA from the end of 2021, and USD LIBOR was replaced by SOFR at the end of June 2023. Euribor will remain but will be administered by the Euro Money Markets Institute (EMMI).\n\nThe Group transitioned away from GBP LIBOR by 31 December 2021, with only a few remaining cross currency positions which matured and rolled off in March 2022. As at 31 December 2023, a residual amount of fixed to floating-rate notes remain. The issuers are either planning to call these before they convert to floating or the floating rate will be amended via the consent solicitation process. The transition away from USD LIBOR completed ahead of June 2023.",

        "page_content": "## 12 Derivative assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group uses derivatives as a component of efficient portfolio management. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging economic exposure to foreign currencies, interest rates, inflation and credit risks. The Group uses hedge accounting, provided the prescribed criteria in IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' are met, to recognise the offsetting effects of changes in the fair value or cash flow of the derivative instrument and the hedged item.\n\n## Cross currency swap contracts - cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group has entered into fixed rate borrowings denominated in USD and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. In order to hedge these risks the Group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps, enabling the exposure to be swapped into a fixed rate in its functional currency. These had a net asset fair value totalling \u00a321m (2022: \u00a3115m) and a notional amount of \u00a31,099m at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u00a31,099m). There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement in respect of these hedges during 2023.\n\n## Other derivative contracts - held for trading\n\nThe Group uses certain derivative contracts which are effective hedges of economic exposures in accordance with the Group's risk management policy, but for various reasons are not designated within a formal hedge accounting relationship. Therefore, these contracts must be designated as held for trading, and gains and losses on these contracts are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n|                                                       | Fair values      | Fair values           | Fair values      | Fair values           |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                       | Assets 1 2023 \u00a3m | Liabilities 2 2023 \u00a3m | Assets 1 2022 \u00a3m | Liabilities 2 2022 \u00a3m |\n| Shareholder derivatives                               |                  |                       |                  |                       |\n| Interest rate contracts - held for trading            | 31,411           | 33,580                | 35,630           | 37,684                |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts - held for trading | 26               | 7                     | 49               | 44                    |\n| Currency swap contracts - held for trading            | 1,624            | 1,750                 | 1,103            | 3,004                 |\n| Currency swap contracts - cash flow hedges            | 24               | 3                     | 115              | -                     |\n| Inflation swap contracts - held for trading           | 4,704            | 4,827                 | 4,964            | 5,092                 |\n| Inflation rate contracts - held for trading           | 96               | 30                    | -                | -                     |\n| Credit derivatives - held for trading                 | -                | 21                    | -                | 3                     |\n| Equity/index derivatives - held for trading           | 1                | 3                     | 6                | 8                     |\n| Other derivatives - held for trading                  | 133              | 278                   | 111              | 270                   |\n| Total shareholder derivatives                         | 38,019           | 40,499                | 41,978           | 46,105                |\n| Unit linked derivatives                               |                  |                       |                  |                       |\n| Interest rate contracts - held for trading            | 1,133            | 335                   | 48               | 255                   |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts - held for trading | 815              | 420                   | 798              | 1,344                 |\n| Credit derivatives - held for trading                 | 7                | 16                    | 6                | 12                    |\n| Inflation swap contracts - held for trading           | 170              | 143                   | 2,423            | 3,271                 |\n| Inflation rate contracts - held for trading           | -                | 2                     | -                | -                     |\n| Equity/index derivatives - held for trading           | 969              | 2,221                 | 144              | 174                   |\n| Other derivatives - held for trading                  | 27               | 185                   | 30               | 29                    |\n| Total unit linked derivatives                         | 3,121            | 3,322                 | 3,449            | 5,085                 |\n| Total derivative assets and liabilities               | 41,140           | 43,821                | 45,427           | 51,190                |\n\n- 1.

The largest United States dollar currency exposures relate to the Group's US business, Legal & General America. The majority of currency exposures relating to euros are held by Legal & General Investment Management (Europe) Limited, a subsidiary of Legal & General Investment Management (Holdings) Limited. The Group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the Group's business and meet local regulatory and market requirements.\n\nBusinesses aim to maintain sufficient assets in local currency to meet local currency liabilities, however movements may impact the value of the Group's consolidated shareholders' equity which is expressed in sterling. This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits. These exposures are managed by aligning the deployment of regulatory capital by currency with the Group's regulatory capital requirements by currency. Currency borrowings and derivatives may be used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group held net liabilities of \u00a30.5bn (2022: net liabilities of \u00a34.4bn) of its total equity attributable to shareholders in currencies, mainly United States dollar and euro, other than the functional currency of the relevant business unit. The exchange risks inherent in these exposures may be mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts.\n\nConsistent with the Group's accounting policies, the profits of overseas business units (reported as functional currencies) are translated at average exchange rates and the net assets (reported as functional currencies) at the closing rate for the reporting period. A 10% increase (weakening of foreign currencies) or decrease (strengthening of foreign currencies) in these rates would increase or reduce the profit for the year and net assets as follows:\n\n|                                            | A 10% increase in USD:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% increase in USD:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in USD:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in USD:GBP exchange rate   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | 2023 \u00a3m                                   | Restated 2022 \u00a3m                          | 2023 \u00a3m                                   | Restated 2022 \u00a3m                          |\n| Profit for the year 1                      | 4                                         | -                                         | (6)                                       | (1)                                       |\n| Net assets attributable to USD exposures 1 | 20                                        | 377                                       | (24)                                      | (460)                                     |\n\n|                                            | A 10% increase in EUR:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% increase in EUR:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in EUR:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in EUR:GBP exchange rate   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | 2023 \u00a3m                                   | Restated 2022 \u00a3m                          | 2023 \u00a3m                                   | Restated 2022 \u00a3m                          |\n| Profit for the year 1                      | -                                         | -                                         | -                                         | -                                         |\n| Net assets attributable to EUR exposures 1 | 1                                         | 91                                        | (2)                                       | (111)                                     |",

        "page_content": "## 16 Credit risk\n\nThe Group's exposure to credit risk arises from its offering of insurance and investment products. The investments of shareholders', policyholders' and segregated clients' monies require credit risks to be taken, as well as the hedging of insurance (including reinsurance) and other financial risks.\n\nOversight of credit risk management has been delegated by the Board to the Group Risk Financial Risk Committee (GRFRC), the remit of which includes proposing the Group's appetite for credit risk in aggregate, and by issuers, sectors, and geography, and monitoring actual exposures relative to appetite. The GRFRC also considers credit risk implicit in new asset classes and corporate transactions, and advises on appropriate counterparty risk tolerances. The Group controls its exposure to counterparty credit risk through defining the minimum financial strength of the counterparties with which it will deal and setting exposure tolerances for these counterparties, which are monitored and reviewed by operational management on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis.\n\nThe credit profile of the Group's assets exposed to credit risk is shown below. This includes both externally and internally rated positions. Unit linked assets have not been included as shareholders are not directly exposed to the associated credit risk. Additionally, assets such as equity securities, deferred acquisition costs and tax have no exposure to the associated credit risk and therefore have also been excluded.\n\nFor externally rated assets, the credit rating bands are provided by independent rating agencies. Unrated traded instruments are assigned a rating through a portfolio review process or through a committee, depending on complexity. Certain assets require an internal rating even when an external rating is already available, if these constitute material traded exposures or are complex securitisations or direct investments. In these cases, internal ratings are assigned by either the LGIM Direct Investment rating team or the asset management firm that originated the transaction.\n\nThe carrying amount of the financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the maximum exposure to credit risk before taking account of collateral held. Collateral is held to mitigate credit risk exposures, by virtue of transactions in long-dated derivatives and stock lending activities.\n\n## Shareholder\n\nBB and\n\n| As at 31 December 2023      | Notes   | AAA \u00a3m   | AA \u00a3m   | A \u00a3m   | BBB \u00a3m   | below \u00a3m   | Other \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------|---------|----------|---------|--------|----------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Government securities       |         | 242      | 8,141   | 253    | 98       | 1          | 1          | 8,736      |\n| Other fixed rate securities |         | 2,083    | 7,080   | 24,206 | 21,646   | 299        | 141        | 55,455     |\n| Variable rate securities    |         | 471      | 2,734   | 4,039  | 3,328    | 133        | 2          | 10,707     |\n| Lifetime mortgages          |         | -        | 4,835   | 504    | 402      | -          | 25         | 5,766      |\n| Accrued interest            |         | 24       | 113     | 240    | 283      | 4          | 2          | 666        |\n| Total debt securities       |         | 2,820    | 22,903  | 29,242 | 25,757   | 437        | 171        | 81,330     |\n| Loans                       |         | -        | 183     | 893    | -        | -          | 536        | 1,612      |\n| Derivative assets           | 12      | -        | 35      | 37,332 | -        | 1          | 651        | 38,019     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents   | 14      | 985      | 805     | 1,886  | 115      | -          | 444        | 4,235      |\n| Reinsurance contract assets |         | -        | 4,163   | 2,551  | 256      | -          | 336        | 7,306      |\n| Other assets                |         | 15       | 253     | 237    | 116      | 2          | 6,050      | 6,673      |\n| Total                       |         | 3,820    | 28,342  | 72,141 | 26,244   | 440        | 8,188      | 139,175    |\n\n| As at 31 December 2022 (Restated)   | Notes   | AAA \u00a3m   | AA \u00a3m   | A \u00a3m   | BBB \u00a3m   | BB and below \u00a3m   | Other \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|--------|----------|-------------------|------------|------------|\n| Government securities               |         | 1,460    | 3,723   | 207    | 105      | 8                 | 2          | 5,505      |\n| Other fixed rate securities         |         | 2,104    | 6,072   | 19,855 | 21,968   | 706               | 79         | 50,784     |\n| Lifetime mortgages                  |         | 3,246    | 824     | 428    | 336      | -                 | 10         | 4,844      |\n| Variable rate securities            |         | 491      | 2,375   | 3,648  | 3,276    | 186               | 12         | 9,988      |\n| Accrued interest                    |         | 33       | 85      | 220    | 306      | 7                 | 1          | 652        |\n| Total debt securities               |         | 7, 334   | 13,079  | 24,358 | 25,991   | 907               | 104        | 71,773     |\n| Loans                               |         | -        | 303     | 318    | 47       | 9                 | 396        | 1,073      |\n| Derivative assets                   | 12      | 1        | 29      | 38,829 | 2,938    | 1                 | 180        | 41,978     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents           | 14      | 412      | 2,214   | 1,583  | 77       | -                 | 548        | 4,834      |\n| Reinsurance contract assets         |         | -        | 3,829   | 648    | 1        | -                 | 235        | 4,713      |\n| Other assets                        |         | 144      | 355     | 666    | 67       | 1                 | 6,159      | 7, 392     |\n| Total                               |         | 7, 891   | 19,809  | 66,402 | 29,121   | 918               | 7,622      | 131,763    |",

However, there are potentially material correlations of insurance risk with other types of risk exposure. The Group's capital model seeks to measure risk correlations particularly those that would tend to be more acute as the underlying risk scenarios become more extreme. An example of the accumulation of risk is the correlation between reinsurer credit risk with mortality and morbidity exposures.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is defined as loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events. Potential for exposure to such risk extends to all of the Group's businesses. The Group has constructed a framework of internal controls to minimise material loss from operational risk events recognising that no system of internal control can completely eliminate the risk of error, financial loss, fraudulent action or reputational damage.",

Other non-UK businesses do not constitute a material component of the Group's operations and consideration of geographically determined assumptions is therefore not included.\n\nFor the purpose of producing IFRS 17 best estimate liabilities, the Group seeks to make best estimate assumptions about future experience based on current market conditions and recent experience.\n\n31 December 2022 assumptions have been rebased to those used for the preparation of IFRS 17 comparatives and hence differ from the IFRS 4 assumptions published in the 2022 Annual report and accounts.\n\n## (i) Mortality and morbidity\n\nMortality and morbidity assumptions for the UK business are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau (CMI), a subsidiary of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, and/or UK death registrations. US assumptions are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the American Academy of Actuaries. Tables are based on industry-wide mortality and morbidity experience for insured lives.\n\nThe Group conducts statistical investigations of its mortality and morbidity experience, the majority of which are carried out at least annually. Investigations determine the extent to which the Group's experience differs from that underpinning the standard tables, and suggest appropriate adjustments which need to be made to the valuation assumptions. In particular, the recent mortality experience observed as a result of Covid-19 and industry studies on its potential endemic effects have been used to derive appropriate adjustments to the assumptions.\n\nIn most cases, mortality rates are set separately for gender and smoker status, and the percentage of mortality table will vary for the first 2 - 5 years of the policy's duration to allow for underwriting selection.\n\n| Mortality tables                           | 2023                                                                         | Restated 2022                                                                |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Non-linked individual assurance business   |                                                                              |                                                                              |\n| UK term assurances 1                       | 90% TM08/TF08                                                                | 90% - 92% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                    |\n| UK term assurances with terminal illness 1 | 74% - 86% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                    | 58% - 86% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                    |\n| UK term assurances with critical illness 2 | 91% - 135% ACL08 Sel 2                                                       | 89% - 132% ACL08 Sel 2                                                       |\n| US term assurances 3                       | Adjusted SOA 2014 VBT                                                        | Adjusted SOA 2014 VBT                                                        |\n| Whole of Life Protection Plan 4            | Bespoke Tables based on TM08/TF08 and UK  death registrations                | Bespoke Tables based on TM08/TF08 and UK  death registrations                |\n| Whole of Life over 50 4                    | Bespoke Tables based on ELT15 and  Whole of Life Protection Plan assumptions | Bespoke Tables based on ELT15 and  Whole of Life Protection Plan assumptions |\n| Annuity business                           |                                                                              |                                                                              |\n| UK Annuities in deferment 5                | 95.6% - 95.3% PMA16\\_PBO/PFA16\\_PBO                                            | 75.7% - 85.6% PNMA00/PNFA00                                                  |\n| UK Vested annuities 6                      |                                                                              |                                                                              |\n| Pension risk transfer                      | 95.6% - 95.3% PMA16\\_PBO/PFA16\\_PBO                                            | 75.7% - 85.6% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                  |\n| Other annuities                            | 79.0% - 131.6% PMA16\\_PBO/PFA16\\_PBO                                           | 66.4% - 105.5% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                 |\n| US annuities 7                             | RP-2014 Healthy Annuitant Total table                                        | RP-2014 Healthy Annuitant Total table                                        |\n\n- 1.

The valuation interest rate assumptions are derived as interest rate curves with full term structure.\n\nIn deriving the liquidity premium assumptions for annuity business, an explicit allowance for risk is deducted from the yield on the assets backing annuity liabilities. The allowance for risk comprises long-term assumptions about defaults and the market risk premiums for taking credit risk. In the case of lifetime mortgage assets a best estimate expectation of losses arising from the No Negative Equity Guarantee, and the market risk premiums for this risk are deducted from the yield. For the UK annuity business, the deduction for risk of default for corporate bonds and direct investments equated to 40bps (2022: 42bps). For lifetime mortgages the deductions equated to \u00a30.4bn (2022: \u00a30.3bn).\n\nFor US and UK protection business, the yield is calculated based on notional asset portfolios of AA rated corporate bonds and cash, which reflect the characteristics of the liability cash flows. An explicit allowance is deducted from the yield to reflect the default risk associated with the notional portfolio assets.\n\nThe discount rate curves used for material product lines are shown below. The discount rate curves are used to discount the cash flows on the underlying contracts and any associated reinsurance cash flows.

Persistency experience can be volatile and past experience may not be an appropriate future indicator. The Group tries to balance past experience and potential future conditions in setting assumptions about expected long-term average persistency levels.\n\n| Lapse Rates                             | 2023         | Restated 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| UK Level term                           | 2.0% - 30.0% | 2.0% - 29.1%    |\n| UK Decreasing term                      | 4.1% - 14.7% | 4.4% - 15.0%    |\n| UK Accelerated critical illness cover   | 3.2% - 31.3% | 3.2% - 31.5%    |\n| Whole of Life (conventional non profit) | 0.6% - 10.0% | 0.6% - 8.5%     |\n| US term - 10 year guarantee period      | 7.1% - 8.1%  | 7.1% - 8.1%     |\n| US term - 15 year guarantee period      | 4.2% - 5.8%  | 4.2% - 5.8%     |\n| US term - 20 year guarantee period      | 3.0% - 6.1%  | 3.0% - 6.1%     |\n| US term - 30 year guarantee period      | 2.1% - 6.5%  | 2.1% - 6.5%     |\n| US Universal Life                       | 2.7%         | 2.7%            |\n\n## (iv) Expenses\n\nThe Group monitors its expense experience and carries out detailed investigations regularly to determine the expenses incurred in writing and administering the different products and classes of business. Adjustments may be made for known future changes in the administration processes, in line with the Group's business plan, as well as for changes in allocations. An allowance for expense inflation in the future is also made in line with RPI, taking account of both salary and price information.\n\n## (v) Risk Adjustment\n\nThe risk adjustment is the compensation that the Group requires for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk. For the majority of risks, the Group's view on the compensation required for non-financial risks is determined with reference to an 85th percentile confidence level (2022: 85th percentile), calculated using a one-year Value-at-Risk (VaR) measure. This VaR measure reflects the Group's view on how non-financial risks behave (risk distributions), diversification of risks across the Group (risk correlations), and the costs and benefits from reinsurance in place (risk mitigation). This is consistent with how risks are priced for and managed across the Group. Where the Group has less appetite for a risk (and requires proportionally higher compensation) a higher confidence level is used. The calculation uses a capital basis appropriate for the territory, the type of business, and how it is priced. A one percentile increase in the one-year confidence level would increase the compensation targeted by c\u00a350m.\n\nWe have estimated the equivalent confidence level for the entire Group on a multi-year basis, using a weighted average of the key risks. Overall the Group risk adjustment as at 31 December 2023 is aligned to a c.75th percentile multi-year confidence level (2022: 75th percentile) over the full runoff of the portfolio.\n\nThe Group calculates its Risk Adjustment at contract level using a Provision for Adverse Deviations (PADs) approach, where adjustments are applied to best estimate non-financial risk assumptions to calculate the risk adjustment required over and above the best estimate liability for each contract. These adjustments (that vary by risk) are calibrated such that the total Group Risk Adjustment calculated aligns to the Group's view of compensation for non-financial risks determined with reference to the 85th percentile (as described above) and the Risk Adjustment at contract level is representative of the compensation required by the Group for that contract.",

The non-economic sensitivity impacts cover long-term insurance business only.\n\nThe Group impacts may arise from asset and/or liability movements under the sensitivities. The current disclosure reflects management's view of key risks in current economic conditions.\n\nThe stresses are assumed to occur on the balance sheet date. Both CSM and current year CSM release into profit are assumed to be affected when non-financial assumptions are stressed.\n\nIn calculating the alternative values, all other assumptions are left unchanged. In practice, impacts of the Group's experience may be correlated.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses do not take into account management actions that could be taken to reduce the impacts. The Group seeks to actively manage its asset and liability position. A change in market conditions may lead to changes in the asset allocation or charging structure which may have a more, or less, significant impact on the value of the liabilities. The analysis also ignores any second order effects of the assumption change, including the potential impact on the Group asset and liability position and any second order tax effects.\n\nThe sensitivity of profit and equity to changes in assumptions may not be linear. They should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order.\n\nThe change in interest rate stresses assume a 100 basis point increase/decrease in the gross redemption yield on fixed interest securities together with the same change in the real yields on variable securities. Interest rates used to discount liabilities are assumed to move in line with market yields, adjusted to remove risks in the asset reference portfolios that are not present in the liabilities calculated in a manner consistent with the base results.\n\nThe inflation stresses adopted are a 0.5% per annum (p.a.) increase/decrease in inflation, resulting in a 0.5% p.a. reduction/rise in real yield and no change to the nominal yield. In addition, the expense inflation rate is increased/decreased by 0.5% p.a. The expense inflation assumptions are non-financial and therefore recalibrate the CSM under the stresses. These recalibrations are reflected in the impacts shown.\n\nIn the sensitivity for credit spreads, corporate bond yields have increased by 100bps, government bond yields are unchanged, and there has been no adjustment to the default assumptions. All lifetime mortgages are excluded, as their primary exposure is to property risk, and therefore captured under the property stress.",

Where property is being used to back liabilities, interest rates used to discount liabilities move with property yields, and so the value of the liabilities will also move.\n\nThe credit default assumption is set based on the credit rating of individual bonds and Moody's historical transition matrices. The credit default stress assumes a +/-10bps stress to the current credit default assumptions, which will have an impact on the interest rates used to discount liabilities. Default allowances for assets deemed credit risk free are unchanged. All lifetime mortgages are excluded, as their primary exposure is to property risk, and therefore captured under the property stress.\n\nThe annuitant mortality stresses are a 1% increase and 1% decrease in the mortality rates for immediate and deferred annuitants with no change to the mortality improvement rates.\n\nThe assurance mortality stress is a 5% increase in the mortality and morbidity rates with no change to the mortality and morbidity improvement rates.\n\nThe maintenance expense stress is a 10% increase in all types of maintenance expenses in future years.\n\n## 20 Insurance contract liabilities (i) Insurance contract revenue and expenses\n\n| For the year ended 31 December 2023                                         | Annuities \u00a3m   | Protection \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|\n| Insurance revenue                                                           |                |                 |            |\n| Amounts relating to changes in liabilities for remaining coverage:          |                |                 |            |\n| - CSM recognised for services provided                                      | 943            | 225             | 1,168      |\n| - Expected incurred claims and other insurance service expenses             | 5,278          | 2,597           | 7,875      |\n| - Change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk for the risk expired | 371            | 16              | 387        |\n| Recovery of insurance acquisition cash flows                                | 19             | 132             | 151        |\n| Premium experience variance relating to past and current service            | 1              | 42              | 43         |\n| Total insurance revenue                                                     | 6,612          | 3,012           | 9,624      |\n| Total insurance service expenses                                            | (5,244)        | (3,129)         | (8,373)    |\n| Allocation of reinsurance premiums                                          | (2,847)        | (1,044)         | (3,891)    |\n| Amounts recoverable from reinsurers for incurred claims                     | 2,415          | 1,339           | 3,754      |\n| Net (expense)/income from reinsurance contracts held                        | (432)          | 295             | (137)      |\n| Total insurance service result                                              | 936            | 178             | 1,114      |\n\n| For the year ended 31 December 2022                                         | Annuities \u00a3m   | Protection \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|\n| Insurance revenue                                                           |                |                 |            |\n| Amounts relating to changes in liabilities for remaining coverage:          |                |                 |            |\n| - CSM recognised for services provided                                      | 762            | 251             | 1,013      |\n| - Expected incurred claims and other insurance service expenses             | 4,585          | 2,558           | 7,143      |\n| - Change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk for the risk expired | 359            | 31              | 390        |\n| Recovery of insurance acquisition cash flows                                | 14             | 123             | 137        |\n| Premium experience variance relating to past and current service            | 2              | (2)             | -          |\n| Total insurance revenue                                                     | 5,722          | 2,961           | 8,683      |\n| Total insurance service expenses                                            | (4,576)        | (2,921)         | (7,497)    |\n| Allocation of reinsurance premiums                                          | (2,323)        | (803)           | (3,126)    |\n| Amounts recoverable from reinsurers for incurred claims                     | 2,052          | 929             | 2,981      |\n| Net (expense)/income from reinsurance contracts held                        | (271)          | 126             | (145)      |\n| Total insurance service result                                              | 875            | 166             | 1,041      |",

Where portfolios contain amounts which would be payable on demand the cashflows are determined in line with the best estimates of policyholder behaviour. Products which have amounts considered payable on demand are deferred annuities in the UK and universal life in the US.\n\nDuring the deferral period a policyholder often has the ability to elect to surrender the policy or retire early, at which time the deferred annuity policy terminates. The cash value of the surrender is calculated in line with the terms of the agreement and in reference to the duration of deferral. The total value considered payable on demand as at 31 December 2023 is \u00a310,210m (2022: \u00a35,921m).\n\nUniversal life contracts written in the US provide savings and death benefits over the medium to long-term. The savings element is considered to be payable on demand by the policyholder. The total value considered payable on demand as at 31 December 2023 is \u00a3436m (2022: \u00a3481m).",

However, the terms of funds investing in less liquid assets permit the deferral of redemptions for predefined periods in circumstances where there are not sufficient liquid assets within the fund to meet the level of requested redemptions.\n\nInvestment contract liabilities include \u00a387m (2022: \u00a3901m) of Assured Payment Policies (APP) products, which are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The valuation of APP products is determined through a discounted cash flows model, where the discount rate is derived from a risk-free rate, a credit benchmark spread and a zero-volatility spread (Z-spread). The credit benchmark rate used is the A-rated credit spread curve which reflects the strategic portfolio mix. The Z-spread ensures that the fair value at inception is equal to the transaction price, therefore it is based on the premium on origination and remains constant over the life of the policy.\n\nThe presented fair values of the remaining investment contract liabilities reflect quoted prices in active markets and they have been classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nDuring the year there have been no transfers of investment contract liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy (2022: no significant transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy).",

Unit linked borrowings are excluded from the analysis above as the risk is retained by policyholders.\n\nThe maturity profile above is calculated on the basis that a facility to refinance a maturing loan is not recognised unless the facility and loan are related. If refinancing under the Group's credit facilities was recognised, then all amounts shown as repayable within one year would be reclassified as repayable between one and five years.\n\nUndiscounted interest payments are estimated based on the year end applicable interest rate and spot exchange rates.\n\n## Syndicated credit facility\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group had in place a \u00a31.5bn syndicated committed revolving credit facility provided by a number of its key relationship banks, maturing in August 2028. No amounts were outstanding at 31 December 2023.",

Costs include the transfer of data and operations to State Street, as well as the implementation of the new operating model. The amounts included in the provision have been determined on a best estimate basis by reference to a range of plausible scenarios, taking into account the multi-year implementation period for the project. As at 31 December 2023, the outstanding provision was \u00a3108m (31 December 2022: \u00a3111m).\n\n## (iii) Retirement benefit obligations\n\n## Defined contribution schemes\n\nThe Group operates the following principal defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas:\n\n- \u00b7 Legal & General Group Personal Pension Plan (UK);\n- \u00b7 Legal & General Staff Stakeholder Pension Scheme (UK);\n- \u00b7 Legal & General America Inc. Savings Plan (US); and\n- \u00b7 CALA defined contribution pension scheme.\n\nContributions of \u00a3102m (2022: \u00a393m) were made during the year in respect of defined contribution schemes.\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\nThe Group operates the following defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas:\n\n- \u00b7 Legal & General America Inc. Cash Balance Plan (US). The last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2023; and\n- \u00b7 CALA Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme (UK). This scheme closed to new members from 31 December 2007 and closed to future accrual on 31 December 2018; the last triennial actuarial valuation was as at 6 April 2021.\n\nThe Group also previously operated the following defined benefit pension schemes in the UK:\n\n- \u00b7 Legal & General Group UK Pension and Assurance Fund (the Fund). The Fund was closed to new members from January 1995; and\n- \u00b7 Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme (the Scheme). The Scheme was, with a few exceptions (principally transfers from the Fund), closed to new members from August 2000 and finally closed to new members from April 2007.",

In April 2023, Assured Payment Policies (APPs), previously transacted between the Group's UK defined benefit pension schemes and Legal and General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS), were surrendered at their carrying value of \u00a3839m (31 December 2022: \u00a3718m) and converted into annuity contracts. An additional top-up consideration of \u00a3183m, priced on an arm's length basis, was paid to LGAS by the defined benefit pension schemes as part of the transaction, making a total contribution for new annuities of \u00a31,022m (31 December 2022: \u00a361m). This resulted in both pension schemes being fully covered by annuity contracts.\n\nThe Trustees completed a buy-out of the Fund and the Scheme in November 2023, and the existing annuity policies were exchanged for individual policies between LGAS and members. As a result, all the Group's obligations under the pension schemes have now been fully extinguished, and the defined benefit obligation as at the settlement date of \u00a31,470m was therefore derecognised. On the same date, the Group recognised the direct liability to the pensioners within insurance contract liabilities. The difference between the defined benefit obligation at this date and the fair value of the insurance contract liabilities recognised under IFRS 17 resulted in \u00a3167m being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as settlement costs. This reflects measurement differences between IFRS 17 and IAS 19, principally comprising of the associated CSM and risk adjustment.\n\nThe Fund and the Scheme still hold minimal residual assets which are expected to meet the cost of wind-up expenses.

The inputs for these models include a range of factors which are deemed to be observable, including current market and contractual prices for underlying instruments, period to maturity, correlations, yield curves and volatility of the underlying instruments.\n\nRepurchase agreements are valued based on the discounted cash flows expected to be paid, using an observable market interest rate, in line with the value of the underlying security.\n\nWithin other financial liabilities, trail commission is measured at fair value through profit or loss. The balance represents a liability for the present value of future commission costs on distribution agreements with intermediaries, recognised in the balance sheet on inception of the contract and remeasured at subsequent reporting dates.\n\nCollateral repayable on short position reverse repurchase agreements and other financial liabilities balances, including FX spots, broker and other payables, are measured at amortised cost.

Extension and termination options are included in various leases across the Group and are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group's operations. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the Group had committed to no additional leases which had not yet commenced (2022: committed to no additional leases).\n\nIncome from sub-leasing right-of-use assets is reflected in Rental income within Investment return (see Note 27).\n\nWhere the Group is a lessor, the future undiscounted minimum lease receivables under operating lease arrangements are disclosed in Note 38(ii). The future minimum lease payments under finance lease arrangement, together with the present value, are disclosed in Note 13(i).\n\n## 26 Management of capital resources Solvency II\n\nThe Solvency II financial information in this note is estimated and unaudited.\n\nThe Group calculates its Solvency II capital requirements using a Partial Internal Model. The majority of the risk to which the Group is exposed is assessed on the Partial Internal Model basis approved by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Capital requirements for a few smaller entities are assessed using the Standard Formula basis on materiality grounds. The Group's US insurance businesses and Legal & General Reinsurance Company No. 2 are valued on a local statutory basis, following the PRA's approval to use the Deduction and Aggregation method of including these businesses in the Group solvency calculation.\n\nThe table below shows the Group Own Funds, Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) and Surplus Own Funds, based on the Partial Internal Model, Matching Adjustment and Transitional Measures on Technical Provisions (TMTP) as at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on a regulatory basis and to comply with the minimum capital requirements of regulators in each territory in which it operates. The Group complies with the requirements established by the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in the UK and measures and monitors its capital resources on this basis. The Solvency II regulations were amended in the UK in December 2023 to introduce a change to the calculation of Risk Margin. All other Solvency II regulations remain unchanged.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, and on the above basis, the Group had a surplus of \u00a39,167m (31 December 2022: \u00a39,915m) over its Solvency Capital Requirement, corresponding to a Solvency II Capital Coverage Ratio of 224% (31 December 2022: 236%).

These are all independent stresses to a single risk. In practice, the balance sheet is impacted by combinations of stresses and the combined impact can be larger than adding together the impacts of the same stresses in isolation. It is expected that, particularly for market risks, adverse stresses will happen together.\n\n|                                                                                                        | Impact on net of tax Solvency II capital surplus 2023 \u00a3bn   | Impact on net of tax Solvency II coverage ratio 2023 %   | Impact on net of tax Solvency II capital surplus 2022 \u00a3bn   | Impact on net of tax Solvency II coverage ratio 2022 %   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 100bps increase in risk-free rates 1                                                                   | 0.1                                                         | 10                                                       | 0.5                                                         | 18                                                       |\n| 100bps decrease in risk-free rates 1,2                                                                 | (0.2)                                                       | (11)                                                     | (0.6)                                                       | (19)                                                     |\n| Credit spreads widen by 100bps assuming an escalating addition to ratings 3,4                          | 0.4                                                         | 14                                                       | 0.3                                                         | 13                                                       |\n| Credit spreads narrow by 100bps assuming an escalating deduction from ratings 3,4                      | (0.6)                                                       | (18)                                                     | (0.4)                                                       | (16)                                                     |\n| Credit spreads widen by 100bps assuming a flat addition to ratings 3                                   | 0.5                                                         | 15                                                       | 0.3                                                         | 14                                                       |\n| Credit spreads of sub investment grade assets widen by 100bps assuming a level addition to ratings 3,5 | (0.2)                                                       | (7)                                                      | (0.3)                                                       | (7)                                                      |\n| Credit migration 6                                                                                     | (0.7)                                                       | (10)                                                     | (0.8)                                                       | (10)                                                     |\n| 25% fall in equity markets 7                                                                           | (0.4)                                                       | (3)                                                      | (0.4)                                                       | (3)                                                      |\n| 15% fall in property markets 8                                                                         | (0.9)                                                       | (10)                                                     | (0.9)                                                       | (11)                                                     |\n| 50bps increase in future inflation expectations 1                                                      | (0.1)                                                       | (3)                                                      | (0.1)                                                       | (3)                                                      |\n| 10% increase in maintenance expenses 9                                                                 | (0.3)                                                       | (4)                                                      | (0.3)                                                       | (4)                                                      |\n\n- 1. Assuming a recalculation of the Transitional Measure on Technical Provisions that partially offsets the impact on Risk Margin.\n- 2. In the interest rate down stress negative rates are allowed, i.e. there is no floor at zero rates.\n- 3. The spread sensitivity applies to the Group's corporate bond (and similar) holdings, with no change in long-term default expectations. Restructured lifetime mortgages are excluded as the underlying exposure is mostly to property.\n- 4. The stress for AA bonds is twice that for AAA bonds, for A bonds it is three times, for BBB four times and so on, such that the weighted average spread stress for the portfolio is 100 basis points. To give a 100bps increase on the total portfolio, the spread stress increases in steps of 32bps, i.e. 32bps for AAA, 64bps for AA etc.\n- 5. No stress for bonds rated BBB and above. For bonds rated BB and below the stress is 100bps. The spread widening on the total portfolio is smaller than 1bps as the Group holds less than 1% in bonds rated BB and below. The impact is primarily an increase in SCR arising from the modelled cost of trading downgraded bonds back to a higher rating in the stress scenarios in the SCR calculation.\n- 6. Credit migration stress covers the cost of an immediate big letter downgrade on 20% of all assets where the capital treatment depends on a credit rating (including corporate bonds, and sale and leaseback rental strips; lifetime mortgage senior notes are excluded). Downgraded assets in our annuities portfolio are assumed to be traded to their original credit rating, so the impact is primarily a reduction in Own Funds from the loss of value on downgrade. The impact of the sensitivity will depend upon the market levels of spreads at the balance sheet date.\n- 7. This relates primarily to equity exposure in LGC but will also include equity-based mutual funds and other investments that receive an equity stress (for example, certain investments in subsidiaries). Some assets have factors that increase or decrease the stress relative to general equity levels via a beta factor.\n- 8. Assets stressed include residual values from sale and leaseback, the full amount of lifetime mortgages and direct investments treated as property.\n- 9. A 10% increase in the assumed unit costs and future costs of investment management across all long-term insurance business lines.\n\nThe above sensitivity analysis does not reflect all management actions which could be taken to reduce the impacts. In practice, the Group actively manages its asset and liability positions to respond to market movements. Other than in the interest rate and inflation stresses, we have not allowed for the recalculation of TMTP.",

        "page_content": "The impacts of these stresses are not linear therefore these results should not be used to interpolate or extrapolate the impact of a smaller or larger stress. The results of these tests are indicative of the market conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date. The results would be different if performed at an alternative reporting date.\n\n## Capital management policies and objectives\n\nThe Group aims to manage its capital resources to maintain financial strength, policyholder security and relative external ratings advantage. The Group also seeks to maximise its financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and by utilising a range of alternative sources of capital including equity, senior debt, subordinated debt and reinsurance.\n\n## Capital measures\n\nThe Group measures its capital on a number of different bases, including those which comply with the regulatory frameworks within which the Group operates and those which the directors consider most appropriate for managing the business. The measures used by the Group include:\n\n## Accounting and Economic bases\n\nManagement use financial information prepared on both an IFRS and risk-based capital basis to manage capital and cash flow usage and to determine dividend paying capacity.\n\nThe Group maintains a risk-based capital model that is used to support the management of risk within the Group. This modelling framework, suitably adjusted for regulatory constraints, also meets the needs of the Solvency II regime.\n\n## Regulatory bases\n\nThe financial strength of the Group's insurance subsidiaries is measured under various local regulatory requirements (see below).\n\n## Basis of regulatory capital and corresponding regulatory capital requirements\n\nIn each country in which the Group operates, the local insurance regulator specifies rules and guidance for the minimum amount and type of capital which must be held by insurance subsidiaries in excess of their insurance liabilities. The minimum capital requirements have been maintained at all times throughout the year. This helps to ensure that payments to policyholders can be made as they fall due.\n\nThe required capital is calculated by either assessing the additional assets which would be required to meet the insurance company's liabilities in specified, stressed financial conditions, or by applying fixed percentages to the insurance company's liabilities and risk exposures. The requirements in the different jurisdictions in which the Group operates are detailed below:\n\n## Group regulatory basis\n\nThe Group is required to comply with the Solvency II capital requirements calculated using the Group's Partial Internal Model. The vast majority of the risk to which the Group is exposed is assessed on the Internal Model basis approved by the PRA. The Group capital requirements for a handful of smaller entities are assessed using the Standard Formula basis on materiality grounds. The Group's capital requirements in respect of its US insurance businesses and Legal & General Reinsurance Company No. 2 (L&G Re 2) are valued on a local statutory basis, following PRA approval of the Group's application to use the Deduction and Aggregation method of including these businesses in the Group solvency calculation.\n\n## UK regulatory basis\n\nAt the balance sheet date, required capital for the life business was based on the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the PRA. All material EEA insurance firms, including Legal and General Assurance Society Limited and Legal and General Assurance (Pensions Management) Limited (LGIM's insurance subsidiary) are required to hold Eligible Own Funds in excess of their Solvency Capital Requirement, calculated on a Partial Internal Model basis. These firms, as well as the non-EEA insurance firm (Legal & General Reinsurance Company Limited based in Bermuda) contribute over 90% of the Group's SCR.\n\n## US regulatory basis\n\nRequired capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital (RBC) based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners RBC model. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account its size and risk profile. The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claims, expense and reserve items, with higher factors used for those items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.\n\n## Bermudan regulatory basis\n\nBermudan regulated insurers are required to hold sufficient capital to meet the Bermudan Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR). The BSCR model follows a standard formula framework, capital attributed to each risk is calculated by applying specified stresses to the assets and liabilities.\n\nThe individual risk elements (excluding operational risk) are combined using a covariance matrix and then added to an operational risk charge.",

Other investment (expense)/income primarily comprises interest, gains and losses from derivative and other financial instruments.\n- 2. Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n- 3. The analysis of investment return and finance income/expense has been split between insurance contract portfolios. For annuity insurance liabilities, changes in the discount rate are reflected in profit or loss. The backing portfolio of assets is selected to match the liabilities and is predominantly accounted for as FVTPL. A sub-portfolio of assets backing annuity liabilities are accounted for at amortised cost as they are in surplus to the IFRS 17 best estimate liability and risk adjustment. Protection insurance liabilities have applied the IFRS 17 OCI option. Changes in discount rate are therefore reported in OCI, whilst backing assets are classified as either FVOCI or amortised cost.",

These rules apply from 1 January 2024, and will apply to all of the Group's businesses globally.\n\nThe Group has applied the temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the UK top-up tax and will account for it as a current tax when it is incurred.\n\nThe Group is expected to be liable to UK top-up tax in 2024 in respect of profits arising in our global reinsurance hub in Bermuda. Our Bermudan businesses act as an internal hub for the Group and also support the growth of our international pension risk transfer business.",

        "page_content": "## Additional /financial information\n\n## continued\n\n## 28 Tax continued\n\n## (i) Implementation of the global minimum tax regime continued\n\nIf the global minimum tax rules had applied in 2023, then additional tax of 15% would apply to profits arising in territories at lower tax rates. The reconciliation of the tax expense attributable to equity holders in Note 28 (iii) discloses the impact of overseas profits which are subject to a lower or higher rate of tax than the standard UK rate in 2023, which primarily relates to the Group's Bermudan businesses.\n\nFrom 2025, we anticipate that the Group will be liable for local Bermudan corporate income tax at 15%, instead of top-up tax under the global minimum tax rules, on Bermudan profits.\n\nWe do not anticipate any other significant liabilities under the global minimum tax rules based on the Group's current profile. Further guidance on the implementation of these new rules is expected in due course and will be kept under review.\n\n## (ii) Implementation of the Bermuda corporate income tax regime\n\nDuring 2023 the Bermudan Government consulted on introducing a local corporate income tax with effect from 1 January 2025, which would apply to our Bermudan reinsurance businesses. This has been substantively enacted as at 31 December 2023 and deferred tax on temporary differences and unused tax losses relating to our Bermudan businesses have been re-valued from 0% to 15%.\n\nThis has resulted in a deferred tax asset of \u00a3340m as at 31 December 2023. The deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of tax reliefs permitted under the Bermuda corporate income tax regime which give rise to deductible temporary differences. The majority of these reliefs are expected to unwind from 2025 over 10 years on a straight line basis. The Group expects to have sufficient future taxable profits to offset the unwind of these deductible temporary differences.\n\nThe deferred tax asset of \u00a3340m is included within the deferred tax disclosure in Note 28 (iv) and is within the line item for the difference between tax and accounting value of insurance contracts.\n\nFurther guidance on the implementation of these new rules is expected in due course. This and the interaction with the UK rules will be kept under review as guidance emerges for any impact.\n\n## (iii) Tax (credit)/expense in the Consolidated Income Statement\n\n|                                                                | 2023 \u00a3m   | Restated 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Current tax                                                    | 120       | 446                |\n| Deferred tax                                                   |           |                    |\n| - Origination or reversal of temporary differences in the year | (356)     | (209)              |\n| - Impact of revaluation of deferred tax balances               | (1)       | (59)               |\n| Total deferred tax                                             | (357)     | (268)              |\n| Adjustment to equity holders' tax in respect of prior years    | (11)      | (21)               |\n| Total tax (credit)/expense                                     | (248)     | 157                |\n| Less: tax attributable to policyholder returns                 | (119)     | (71)               |\n| Total tax (credit)/expense attributable to equity holders      | (367)     | 86                 |",

The lower rate of tax on overseas profits and losses is principally driven by the 0% rate of taxation arising in our Bermudan reinsurance company, which provides the Group with regulatory capital flexibility for both our PRT business and our US term insurance business. This also includes the impact of our US operations which are taxed at 21%.\n- 3. Double tax relief represents a UK tax credit available for overseas withholding tax suffered on dividend income.\n\n- 5. The tax credit relates to the introduction of a new corporate income tax regime in Bermuda, which was enacted in December 2023.\n- 6. The tax credit for the year includes a material one-off tax credit arising from the recognition of a deferred tax asset relating to the introduction of a new Bermuda corporate income tax regime. The net tax credit for the year excluding this one-off credit is \u00a327m and reflects the varying rates of tax that we pay on our businesses in different territories and the mixture of profits and losses across those territories.\n- 7. The equity holders' effective tax rate excluding the impact of expenses arising from rate differences on longevity assumption changes, the one-off settlement cost associated with the buy-out of the Group's UK defined benefit pension schemes and the one-off Bermuda tax credit is 11.9%.",

Deferred tax assets arising on deferred acquisition expenses relate solely to US balances.\n- 2. The UK deferred tax asset reflects the impact of transition to IFRS 17 (see Note 1 for further details).\n- 3. The Bermuda deferred tax asset relates to the introduction of a new corporate income tax regime in Bermuda, which was enacted in December 2023 (see Note 28 (ii)).\n- 4. This deferred tax asset relates to US operating losses. The losses are not time restricted, and we expect to recover them over a period of 15 to 20 years, commensurate with the lifecycle of the underlying insurance contracts. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered past results, the different basis under which US companies are taxed, temporary differences that are expected to generate future profits against which the deferred tax can be offset, management actions, and future profit forecasts. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is routinely reviewed by management.\n- 5. The deferred tax liability is comprised of balances of \u00a3107m relating to the US (2022: \u00a3206m) that are not capable of being offset against other deferred tax assets.",

These tax assets will only be recognised if it becomes probable that suitable taxable profits will arise in future periods.\n\n|                                                  |   Gross 2023 \u00a3m |   Tax 2023 \u00a3m | Restated Gross 2022 \u00a3m   | Restated Tax 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| Trading losses 1                                 |             330 |            67 | 272                      | 61                     |\n| Capital losses                                   |             157 |            34 | 67                       | 14                     |\n| Excess management expense                        |               9 |             2 | 9                        | 2                      |\n| Unrelieved interest payments on debt instruments |              14 |             4 | 14                       | 4                      |\n| Other unrecognised deferred tax                  |               3 |             1 | -                        | -                      |\n| Unrecognised deferred tax assets                 |             513 |           108 | 362                      | 81                     |\n\n## (v) Current tax - Consolidated Balance Sheet\n\n|                                  |   2023 \u00a3m |   2022 \u00a3m |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Tax recoverable within 12 months |        75 |        52 |\n| Tax recoverable after 12 months  |       810 |       750 |\n| Current tax assets 1             |       885 |       802 |\n\n|                          |   2023 \u00a3m |   2022 \u00a3m |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Tax due within 12 months |         2 |         1 |\n| Tax due after 12 months  |        75 |        68 |\n| Current tax liabilities  |        77 |        69 |\n\n## (vi) Tax charged directly in equity\n\n|                                                   | 2023 \u00a3m   | Restated 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Current tax                                       | (7)       | (6)                |\n| Deferred tax                                      | (1)       | 1                  |\n| Tax (credit)/charge recognised directly in equity | (8)       | (5)                |\n\n## 29 Auditors' remuneration\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Remuneration receivable by the Company's auditors for the audit of the consolidated and Company financial statements                                                                                                                      | 3.5       | 3.0       |\n| Remuneration receivable by the Company's auditors and its associates for the supply of other services to the Company and its  associates, including remuneration for the audit of the financial statements of the Company's subsidiaries: |           |           |\n| The audit of the Company's subsidiaries                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 16.1      | 11.2      |\n| Audit related assurance services - required by national or EU legislation                                                                                                                                                                 | 1.6       | 1.6       |\n| Audit related assurance services - other                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1.0       | 0.9       |\n| Other assurance services                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 0.9       | 0.8       |\n| Total remuneration                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 23.1      | 17.5      |",

The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the Group shares on the invitation date.\n\nNil-cost options can be granted to senior managers under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), based upon individual and Company performance. Performance conditions attached to awards before 2018 result in the number of options that vest being equally dependent on the Group's relative total shareholder return (TSR) and Earnings per Share (EPS)/Dividend per Share (DPS) growth. In addition, the awards vest after the end of the three year performance period and become exercisable in thirds over three, four and five years. Starting from awards granted in 2018, the number of options that vest is equally dependent on the Group's relative TSR and EPS growth (subject to Solvency II objectives). The majority of awards vest after the end of the three year performance period and become exercisable in thirds in year three, four and five. Awards granted to Executive Directors and Persons Delivering Managerial Responsibilities vest after three years but any options that vest will not become exercisable until year five.\n\nThe Share Bonus Plan (SBP) awards conditional shares, restricted shares, combined awards of CSOP options and restricted shares and combined awards of CSOP options and nil-cost options. Recipients of restricted shares are entitled to both vote and receive dividends. Fair value is calculated as the market value on the grant date, adjusted to reflect the eligibility for dividend payments. Conditional Share awards, which include awards to Executive Directors, do not have voting or dividend rights.\n\nUnder the HMRC tax-advantaged Employee share plan (ESP), UK employees may elect to purchase Group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis. The Group supplements the number of shares purchased by giving employees one free matching share for every one share purchased up to the first \u00a320 of the employees' contributions and one free matching share for every two shares purchased with contributions between \u00a320 and \u00a3125. There is currently no match on contributions between \u00a3125 and \u00a3150. From time to time, the Group may make an award of free shares. Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years. The fair value of awarded shares is equal to the market value on award date.\n\nThe weighted average fair value of ShareSave options calculated by using the Black-Scholes model were 44.9p and PSP awards estimated by using Monte Carlo simulations were 162.8p.\n\nThe fair values of the share awards made during the year have been calculated using the following assumptions:\n\n| Award date                              | ShareSave 6 April 2023   | PSP 6 April 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| Weighted average share price (pence)    | 242.0                    | 238.1              |\n| Weighted average exercise price (pence) | 211.0                    | N/A                |\n| Expected volatility                     | 33%                      | 31%                |\n| Expected life                           | 3 - 5 years              | 3 - 5 years        |\n| Risk free investment rate               | 3.29% - 3.44%            | 3.49%              |\n| Dividend yield                          | 7.5%                     | N/A                |",

All shares issued carry equal voting rights.\n\nThe holders of the Company's ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared and are entitled to one vote per share at shareholder meetings of the Company.\n\n## (ii) Employee share plans\n\nThe Group uses the Employees' Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) and the Legal & General Group Employee Share Plan (ESP) to purchase and hold shares of the Group for delivery to employees under various employee share plans. Shares owned by these vehicles are included at cost in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are shown as a deduction from shareholders' equity. They are disclosed as employee plan shares until they vest to employees. Share-based liabilities to employees may also be settled via purchases directly from the market or by the issue of new shares.\n\nThe ESOT has waived its voting rights and its rights to some of the dividends payable on the shares it holds. Employees are entitled to dividends on the shares held on their behalf within the ESP.\n\n|                   | 2023 Number of shares   | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 Number of shares   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|-----------|\n| As at 1 January   | 60,807,213              | 144       | 42,700,058              | 99        |\n| Shares purchased  | 8,093,113               | 18        | 23,424,103              | 59        |\n| Shares vested     | (6,721,535)             | (15)      | (5,316,948)             | (14)      |\n| As at 31 December | 62,178,791              | 147       | 60,807,213              | 144       |\n\n## 33 Restricted Tier 1 convertible notes\n\nOn 24 June 2020, Legal & General Group Plc issued \u00a3500m of 5.625% perpetual restricted Tier 1 contingent convertible notes. The notes are callable at par between 24 March 2031 and 24 September 2031 (the First Reset Date) inclusive and every 5 years after the First Reset Date. If not called, the coupon from 24 September 2031 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 5.378%.\n\nThe notes have no fixed maturity date. Optional cancellation of coupon payments is at the discretion of the issuer and mandatory cancellation is upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The Tier 1 notes are therefore treated as equity and coupon payments are recognised directly in equity when paid. During the year coupon payments of \u00a328m were made (2022: \u00a328m). The notes rank junior to all other liabilities and senior to equity attributable to owners of the parent. On the occurrence of certain conversion trigger events the notes are convertible into ordinary shares of the issuer at the prevailing conversion price.\n\nThe notes are treated as restricted Tier 1 own funds for Solvency II purposes.\n\n## 34 Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests represent third party interests in direct equity investments, including private equity, which are consolidated in the Group's results.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, non-controlling interests primarily represent third party ownership in Thorpe Park Holdings, a mixed residential/ commercial retail space in which the Group holds 50%.",

These include the surrender of Assured Payment Policies (APPs) and their conversion into annuities, as well as a buy-out of the schemes completed by the Trustees, where existing annuity policies were exchanged for individual policies between LGAS and members. Further details are provided in Note 23; and\n- \u00b7 Total payments by LGAS to the pension schemes for insured pension benefits were \u00a355m (2022: \u00a356m).\n\nLoans and commitments to related parties are made in the normal course of business. As at 31 December 2023, the Group had:\n\n- \u00b7 Loans outstanding from related parties of \u00a349m (2022: \u00a358m), with a further commitment of \u00a37m (2022: \u00a36m); and\n- \u00b7 Total other commitments of \u00a31,347m to related parties (2022: \u00a31,265m), of which \u00a31,108m has been drawn (2022: \u00a31,010m).",

The variance between actual experience from that assumed may result in those liabilities differing from the provisions made for them. Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating to the interpretation of policyholder contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them. The extent of these liabilities is influenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the PRA, FCA, ombudsman rulings, industry compensation schemes and court judgments.\n\nVarious Group companies receive claims and become involved in actual or threatened litigation and regulatory issues from time to time. The relevant members of the Group ensure that they make prudent provision as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet reasonably foreseeable eventualities. The provisions made are regularly reviewed.

Significant holdings are entities in which the Group either has a shareholding greater than or equal to 20% of the nominal value of any share class, or a book value greater than 20% of the Group's assets.\n\n## (i) Subsidiaries\n\nThe particulars of the Company's subsidiaries, mutual funds and partnerships that have been consolidated as at 31 December 2023 are listed below. The main territory of operation of subsidiaries incorporated in England and Wales is the UK. For overseas subsidiaries the principal country of operation is the same as the country of incorporation. All subsidiaries have a 31 December year end reporting date and are 100% owned, unless stated otherwise. The registered office of all subsidiaries in England and Wales is One Coleman Street, London EC2R 5AA, United Kingdom, and in Ireland is Dillon Eustace, 33 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland, unless otherwise noted. All subsidiaries are held through intermediate holding companies unless noted that they are held direct by the Company. Subsidiaries that are consolidated where the Group owns less than 50% of the ordinary share capital, are consolidated based on an assessment of control normally arising from special rights attaching to the class of share owned, other contractual arrangements and factors such as the purpose of the investee, the nature of its relevant activities, voting rights (including potential voting rights) and substantive and protective rights.\n\nThe Group reassesses the appropriateness of the consolidation of an investee whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there has been a change in the relationship between the Group and the investee which affects control.\n\n| Company name                                                | Nature of business                                         | Share class                                | Year end reporting date   | % of equity shares held by the Group   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Country of incorporation: Bermuda                           |                                                            |                                            |                           |                                        |\n| Legal & General America Reinsurance Limited 1               | Reinsurance                                                | Ordinary                                   | 31-Dec                    | 100.0                                  |\n| Legal & General Reinsurance Company Limited 1               | Reinsurance                                                | Ordinary                                   | 31-Dec                    | 100.0                                  |\n| Legal & General Reinsurance Company No.2 Limited 1          | Reinsurance                                                | Ordinary                                   | 31-Dec                    | 100.0                                  |\n| Legal & General Resources Bermuda Limited 1                 | Provision of services                                      | Ordinary                                   | 31-Dec                    | 100.0                                  |\n| Country of incorporation: China                             |                                                            |                                            |                           |                                        |\n| Legal & General Business Consulting (Shanghai) Limited 2    | Business information consultancy                           | Ownership  dictated by  subscribed capital | 31-Dec                    | 100.0                                  |\n| Country of incorporation: England and Wales                 |                                                            |                                            |                           |                                        |\n| Alfreton Solar Limited 3                                    | Production of electricity                                  | Ordinary                                   | 31-Dec                    | 100.0                                  |\n| Antham 1 Limited                                            | Investment vehicle                                         | Ordinary                                   | 31-Dec                    | 100.0                                  |\n| Atelier Management Company Limited                          | ECF Manco 4                                                | Ordinary                                   | 31-May                    | -

The Group has interests in investment vehicles which, depending upon their status, are classified as either consolidated or unconsolidated structured entities as described below:\n\n- \u00b7 Debt securities, consisting of traditional asset backed securities, together with securitisation and debentures and Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDOs);\n- \u00b7 Investment funds, largely being unit trusts; and\n- \u00b7 Specialised investment vehicles, analysed between Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles (ICAVs), Open Ended Investment Companies (OEICs), Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d'Investissement \u00e0 Capital Variables (SICAVs), Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs), Authorised Contractual Schemes (ACSs), Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund (QIAIF), Liquidity funds, Common Contractual Fund (CCF) and Property unit trusts.\n\nAll of the Group's holdings in the above vehicles are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective investment vehicle's offering documentation and are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of those investment vehicles. The investment manager makes investment decisions after extensive due diligence of the underlying investment vehicle, including consideration of its strategy and the overall quality of the underlying investment vehicle's manager.\n\nAll of the investment vehicles in the investment portfolio are managed by portfolio managers who are compensated by the respective investment vehicles for their services. Such compensation generally consists of an asset-based fee and a performance related incentive fee, and is reflected in the valuation of the investment vehicles.\n\n## (a) Interests in consolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group has determined that where it has control over an investment vehicle, that investment is a consolidated structured entity. The Group has not provided, and has no intention to provide, financial or other support to any other structured entities which it does not consolidate.\n\n## (b) Interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nAs part of its investment activities, the Group also invests in unconsolidated structured entities.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment property, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and certain assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThere were no material critical accounting estimates used or judgements made by management in the preparation of these financial statements.\n\nThe following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with FRS 101:\n\n- \u00b7 Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, 'Share-based payment' (details of the number and weighted-average exercise price of share options, and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined);\n- \u00b7 The requirement of paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement', where equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group;\n- \u00b7 The following paragraphs of IAS 1, 'Presentation of financial statements':\n- - 10(d), (statement of cash flows);\n- - 10 (f) and 40A (presentation of a 3rd balance sheet);\n- - 16 (a statement of compliance with all IFRS);\n- - 38 in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) (outstanding shares comparative);\n- - 38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements);\n- - 38B-D (additional comparative information);\n- - 111 (cash flow statement information); and\n- - 134-136 (capital management disclosures).\n- \u00b7 IAS 7, 'Statement of cash flows';\n- \u00b7 IFRS 7, 'Financial Instrument Disclosures';\n- \u00b7 Paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8, 'Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors' (requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective); and\n- \u00b7 The requirements in IAS 24, 'Related party disclosures' to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a Group and key management compensation.\n\nThe Company's financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 394 and 396 of the Companies Act 2006 adopting the exemption of omitting the income statement conferred by Section 408 of that Act.\n\nThe Company's financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. See Note 1 of the Group consolidated financial statements for further information on the Directors' assessment of the going concern basis.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nOn initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value. Subsequently, they can be measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification depends on two criteria:\n\n- (i) the business model within which financial assets are managed; and\n- (ii)  their contractual cash flow characteristics (whether the cash flows represent 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI)).\n\nA debt instrument is measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, if it meets the following conditions:\n\n- (i) it is held within a business model that has an objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- (ii)  the contractual terms of the financial asset result in cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).\n\nA debt security is measured at FVOCI if it meets the following conditions:\n\n- (i) it is held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets; and\n- (ii)  the asset's cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nInterest income on these debt securities is calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nAll other assets, including derivative assets which are held for trading are measured at FVTPL. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income and foreign exchange gains and losses, are recognised in profit or loss, unless they arise from derivatives designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges.",

        "page_content": "The Company has no equity instruments other than investments in subsidiaries.\n\nReceivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently accounted for at amortised cost.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nFor financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI the Company reviews the carrying value of its assets at each balance sheet date. For such assets, the Company determines forward looking expected credit losses (ECL), based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. The shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to the asset's original effective interest rate.\n\nThe Company measures loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. In these cases, ECLs are based on the 12-month ECL, which is the ECL that results from a possible default up to 12 months after the reporting date. The Company uses relevant quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on historical experience, and informed credit assessment including forward-looking information in order to evaluate the credit-worthiness of each security at each reporting date, to determine whether a significant increase in credit risk since origination occurred. Should this be the case, the allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL.\n\nECLs are calculated by considering the probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). The PD is determined by reference to third party information on available companies, or using qualitative information available to the Company, and depends on whether a financial asset requires determination of a 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL. The LGD is determined with reference to any exposure reducing instruments such as collateral or liquid assets that the counterparty may have. The EAD is determined as the amount of the loan balance outstanding at the reporting date. The Company has adopted a simplified approach for receivables, which allows measurement of lifetime ECLs only, thereby removing the need to identify significant increase in credit risk (SICR). For these balances, the Company makes use of provision matrices in order to calculate such lifetime ECLs.\n\n## Investment income\n\nInvestment income includes unrealised fair value gains and losses on financial investments at fair value through profit or loss, realised gains and losses, dividends, rent and interest. Dividends are accrued on an ex-dividend basis. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the investment. Interest income for financial assets which are not classified as FVTPL is recognised using the effective interest method.\n\n## Distributions\n\nDividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.\n\n## Interest expense\n\nInterest expense reflects the underlying cost of borrowing, based on the effective interest method and includes payments and receipts made under derivative instruments which are amortised over the interest period to which they relate.\n\n## Investment in subsidiary undertakings\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Where the carrying amount of an investment in subsidiary is greater than recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised in profit and loss.\n\n## Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nThe Company's activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivative instruments, other than those designated as hedging instruments in cash flow or net investment hedges, are recognised immediately in the income statement. Currently, the Company hedges foreign exchange translation and interest rate risks on its fixed rate USD denominated borrowings (the hedged items), using cross currency interest rate swaps (the hedging items). It recognises the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging items in a separate reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs. Borrowings classified as liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost. The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.\n\nA net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying temporary differences can be deducted.",

Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future periods has been entered into by the subsidiary.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items are maintained at historic rates. Exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Pension costs\n\nThe Company contributes to defined contribution schemes. The Company charges the costs of its pension schemes against profit as incurred. Any difference between the cumulative amounts charged against profits and contribution amounts paid is included as a provision or prepayment in the balance sheet.\n\nThe assets of the defined contribution schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds, which have been subject to regular valuation every three years and updated by formal reviews at reporting dates by qualified actuaries.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Company operates a number of share-based payment plans on behalf of its subsidiaries. Full disclosure of these plans is given in Note 31 of the Group consolidated financial statements. The costs associated with these plans are borne by all the participating Group businesses where they relate to their employees and, where relevant, the Company bears an appropriate charge. As the majority of the charge to the Company relates to awards and options issued to the directors, for which full disclosure is made in the Directors' report on remuneration, no further disclosure is provided here.\n\n## 2 Dividends\n\n|                                                            | Dividend 2023 \u00a3m   | Per share 1 2023 p   | Dividend 2022 \u00a3m   | Per share 1 2022 p   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| Ordinary dividends paid and charged to equity in the year: |                    |                      |                    |                      |\n| - Final 2021 dividend paid in June 2022                    | -                  | -                    | 792                | 13.27                |\n| - Interim 2022 dividend paid in September 2022             | -                  | -                    | 324                | 5.44                 |\n| - Final 2022 dividend paid in June 2023 2                  | 831                | 13.93                | -                  | -                    |\n| - Interim 2023 dividend paid in September 2023             | 341                | 5.71                 | -                  | -                    |\n| Total dividends                                            | 1,172              | 19.64                | 1,116              | 18.71                |\n\nSubsequent to 31 December 2023, the directors declared an interim dividend of 14.63 pence per ordinary share.

The notes are callable at par between 24 March 2031 and 24 September 2031 (the First Reset Date) inclusive and every 5 years after the First Reset Date. If not called, the coupon from 24 September 2031 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 5.378%.\n\nThe notes have no fixed maturity date. Optional cancellation of coupon payments is at the discretion of the issuer and mandatory cancellation is upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The Tier 1 notes are therefore treated as equity and coupon payments are recognised directly in equity when paid. During the year coupon payments of \u00a328m were made (2022: \u00a328m). The notes rank junior to all other liabilities and senior to equity attributable to owners of the parent.

Full details of the business to be considered at the meeting will be included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Board and directors Articles of Association\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association may only be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. The Company's Articles of Association were last amended at its Annual General Meeting held on 20 May 2021.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Board has adopted a policy and procedure for the disclosure and authorisation (if appropriate) of conflicts of interest, and these have been followed during 2023. The Board confirms that it has reviewed the schedule of directors' conflicts of interest during the year and that the procedures in place operated effectively in 2023. None of the directors had an interest in any contract of significance with the Company or any of its subsidiaries during 2023.\n\n## Powers of directors\n\nThe directors (as detailed on pages 64 to 65) may exercise all powers of the Company subject to applicable legislation and regulation and the Company's Articles of Association.\n\n## Appointment and removal of directors\n\nWith regards to the appointment and removal of directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. Directors may be appointed by an ordinary resolution of the Company or by the Board, in each case subject to the provisions of the Company's Articles of Association. The Company may, by way of special resolution, remove any director before the expiration of that director's period of office and may by ordinary resolution, appoint another director to act as a replacement. The Company's Articles of Association (in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code) require all the directors to retire from office at each Annual General Meeting of the Company.\n\n## Directors' interests\n\nThe Directors' report on remuneration on pages 94 to 119 provides details of the share interests of each director, including details of current incentive schemes and long-term incentive schemes.\n\n## Indemnities\n\nThe Company has agreed to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each of the directors against any liability incurred by a director in respect of acts or omissions arising in the course of their office. Qualifying pension scheme indemnities (as defined in section 235 of the Companies Act 2006) apply, to the extent permitted by law, to certain directors of the Company's pension schemes. The indemnities were in force throughout 2023 and remain so. Copies of the deeds containing the relevant indemnity are available for inspection at the Company's registered office and will also be available at the AGM.\n\n## Insurance\n\nThe Company has arranged appropriate directors' and officers' liability insurance for directors. This is reviewed annually.\n\n## Change of control\n\nThere are no agreements between the Company and its directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) in the event of a takeover bid, except for those relating to normal notice periods. The rules of the Company's share plans contain provisions under which options and awards to participants, including executive directors, may vest on a takeover or change of control of the Company or transfer of undertaking. The Company has a committed \u00a31.5 billion bank syndicated credit facility which is terminable if revised terms cannot be agreed with the syndicate of banks in a 30-day period following a change of control. As at 4 March 2024, the Company has no borrowings under this facility. There is no change of control conditions in the terms of any of the Company's outstanding debt securities. The terms of the Company's agreements with its banking counterparties, under which derivative transactions are undertaken, include in some instances the provision for termination of transactions upon takeover/ merger depending on the rating of the merged entity. The Company does not have any other committed banking arrangements, either drawn or undrawn, which incorporate any unilateral change of control conditions.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nDetails of related party transactions are set out in Note 36 to the Group consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Shares and dividend information Share capital\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Company's issued share capital comprised 5,979,578,280 ordinary shares each with a nominal value of 2.5 pence. Details of the ordinary share capital can be found in Note 32 to the Group consolidated financial statements.\n\nAt the 2023 AGM, the Company was granted authority by shareholders to purchase up to 597,331,539 ordinary shares, being 10% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2023. In the year to 31 December 2023, no shares were purchased by the Company. This authority will expire at the 2024 AGM. As such, a resolution is proposed in the Notice of AGM seeking shareholder approval to renew this authority.\n\nAt the 2023 AGM, the directors were given the power to allot shares up to an amount of \u00a349,777,628, being 33% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2023. This authority will also expire at the 2024 AGM. As such, a resolution is proposed in the Notice of AGM seeking shareholder approval to renew this authority.\n\nFurther resolutions are proposed, as set out in the Notice of AGM, that will, if approved by shareholders, authorise the directors to issue shares up to the equivalent of 10% of the Company's issued share capital as at 25 March 2024 for cash without offering the shares first to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings. Detailed explanatory notes to these resolutions are set out in the Notice of AGM.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report and additional statutory and regulatory information continued\n\nOther than the above, the directors have no current intention of issuing further share capital and no issue will be made which would effectively alter control of the Company without prior approval of shareholders in a general meeting.\n\n## Interests in voting rights\n\nInformation on major interests in shares provided to the Company under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR 5) of the UK Listing Authority is published via a Regulatory Information Service and on the Company's website: www.legalandgeneralgroup.com. As at 31 December 2023, the Company had been advised of the following significant direct and indirect interests in the issued share capital of the Company:\n\n|                | Number of  ordinary  shares of 2.5p   |   % of  capital\u00b9 |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|\n| BlackRock Inc. | 298,315,445                           |            4.989 |\n\nNo material changes to the interests have been disclosed between 31 December 2023 and 4 March 2024.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Company may, by ordinary resolution in a general meeting, declare dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the members, but no dividend can exceed the amount recommended by the Board. The directors propose a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2023 of 14.63 pence per ordinary share which, together with the interim dividend of 5.71 pence per ordinary share paid to shareholders on 26 September 2023, will make a total dividend for the year of 20.34 pence (2022: 19.37 pence). Subject to shareholder approval at the AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 6 June 2024 to shareholders on the share register on 26 April 2024 provided that the Board may cancel payment of the dividend at any time prior to payment in accordance with the Articles of Association, if it considers it necessary to do so for regulatory capital purposes. Our dividend policy is set out on page 4.\n\n## Rights and obligations attaching to shares\n\nThe rights and obligations relating to the Company's ordinary shares are set out in the Articles of Association. A copy of the Articles of Association can be requested from the Company Secretary at the Company's registered office. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend, speak and vote at general meetings. In a vote on a show of hands, every member present in person or every proxy present, who has been duly appointed by a member, will have one vote and on a poll every member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share held. These rights are subject to any special terms as to voting upon which any shares may be issued or may at the relevant time be held and to any other provisions of the Company's Articles of Association. Under the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles of Association, directors have the power to suspend voting rights and, in certain circumstances, the right to receive dividends in respect of shares where the holder of those shares fails to comply with a notice issued under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe Board can decline to register a transfer of any share which is not a fully paid share. In addition, registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share may be refused in the circumstances set out in the uncertificated securities rules and where the number of joint holders exceeds four. The Board may also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated share unless:\n\n- \u00b7 the instrument of transfer is duly stamped and is left at the Company's registered office or such other place as the Board may from time to time determine, accompanied by the certificate for the share to which it relates and such evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transfer or to make the transfer\n- \u00b7 the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share\n- \u00b7 the number of joint holders does not exceed four.\n\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, all or any of the rights attaching to an existing class of shares may be varied from time to time, either with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class (excluding any treasury shares) or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares.\n\nShares acquired through the employee share plans rank equally with all other ordinary shares in issue. Zedra Trust Company (Guernsey) Limited, as trustee of the Legal & General Employees' Share Ownership Trust, held 1% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 4 March 2024 in trust for the benefit of the executive directors, senior executives and employees of the Group. The trustee of Legal & General Employees' Share Ownership Trust has waived the right of that trust to receive dividends on unallocated shares it holds. The voting rights in relation to these shares are exercised by the trustee. The trustee may vote or abstain from voting, or accept or reject any offer relating to shares, in any way it sees fit, without incurring any liability and without being required to give reasons for its decision. Under the rules of the Legal & General Group Employee Share Plan (the 'Plan'), eligible employees are entitled to acquire shares in the Company. Plan shares are held in trust for participants by Link Market Services Trustees Limited, which held 0.32% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 4 March 2024. Voting rights are exercised by the trustees on receipt of the participants' instructions. If a participant does not submit an instruction to the trustees, no vote is registered. In addition, the trustees do not vote on any unallocated shares held in the trust.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/ or voting rights.",

The basis of preparation (or reporting criteria) for our Group carbon footprint is available within our Climate and nature report and Deloitte's assurance report is available on pages 51 to 52 of our 2023 Climate and nature report.\n\nData Sources: carbon data is collected and aggregated to provide a group-wide footprint and is based on a combination of actual, extrapolated, estimated and benchmarked data. Data is sourced from meter readings, invoices, supplier reports, expenses and travel booking systems. Refer to our reporting criteria document for further details.\n\nScope 1: All direct emissions from the activities under control.\n\n- Scope 2: Emissions from purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat and cooling. \u00b7   Location based - reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs.\n- \u00b7   Market based - reflects emissions from electricity purposefully chosen. It derives emission factors from contractual instruments.\n\nScope 3: Indirect emissions from our value chain. Further details on L&Gs assessment of materiality for all categories of scope 3 emissions can be found within our basis of preparation in our Climate and nature report.\n\n- \u00b7   Cat. 3 emissions related to energy purchased and consumed by Legal & General in the reporting year, that are not included in scope 1 and 2.\n- \u00b7   Cat. 5 emissions from third-party disposal and treatment of waste generated in occupied properties and construction activities in the reporting year.\n- \u00b7   Cat. 6 emissions from business mileage, flights and train journeys for UK and US operations.\n- \u00b7  Cat. 7 emissions from homeworking only, calculated using BEIS conversion factors.\n- \u00b7   Cat. 8 emissions from the operation of assets that are leased to Legal & General in the reporting year and not included in scope 1 or scope 2, calculated using REEB 2020 benchmarks.\n- \u00b7  Cat. 13 emissions from tenant operations of Legal & General owned assets.\n- \u00b7   Cat 15 emissions including equity and debt investments and project finance in the reporting year, not included in scope 1 or scope 2.\n\n## Methodology\n\nWe have reported on the emission sources required under the Companies Act 2006 Strategic report and Directors' report regulations 2013 and have followed the requirements of the Streamlined Energy & Carbon Reporting (SECR) framework. The greenhouse gas emissions data is reported in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 'Operational Control' method, and emission factors for fuels and electricity are published here: https://bit.ly/GHG\\_standards\n\nOur emissions, shown in the table opposite, cover 100% of Legal & General Group Plc's operational footprint. We report scope 1 and 2 emissions where we have operational control. Operational control is where we directly procure utilities for property we occupy, own and manage, including our subsidiary businesses and joint ventures* or where we have significant control over energy use. Please refer to the sustainable business section of this report, our 2023 Climate and nature report and CDP Disclosure for an overview of the management of climate risk through our governance processes and internal controls. The types of measures taken to manage and improve our management of energy can also be found within these documents.\n\n- * Joint ventures are included in our footprint where we are the majority shareholder, or have operational control.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate and nature report\n\nOur Climate and nature report is available on our Group website.

Under that law the directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK accounting standards and applicable law, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.\n\nUnder company law, the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently\n- \u00b7 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent\n- \u00b7 for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards\n- \u00b7 for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements\n- \u00b7 assess the Group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern\n- \u00b7 use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors' report, Directors' report on remuneration and Corporate governance statement that complies with that law and those regulations. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nIn accordance with Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.15R, the annual financial report has been prepared in Extensible Hypertext Markup Language ('XHTML') format. Consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.16R - 4.1.18R, including the requirement to use Extensible Business Reporting Language ('XBRL') markup language. The auditor's report on these financial statements provides no assurance over the XHTML or XBRL format.",

Having assessed the main risks and other matters discussed in connection with the Group Board viability statement set out on page 55, in accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the FRC guidance, the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the financial statements.\n\nThe Directors' report and Strategic report were approved by the Board and signed on its behalf.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## G J Timms\n\nGroup Company Secretary",

They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.\n\n## How to avoid share fraud\n\nHave you been:\n\n## Contacted out of the blue; or\n\nPromised tempting returns and told the investment is safe.\n\n## Called repeatedly\n\nTold the offer is only available for a limited time? If so, you might have been contacted by fraudsters.\n\n## Reject cold calls\n\nIf you've been cold called with an offer to buy or sell shares, chances are it's a high risk investment or a scam. You should treat the call with extreme caution. The safest thing to do is to hang up.\n\nCheck the firm on the FS register at fca.org.uk/register The Financial Services Register is a public record of all the firms and individuals in the financial services industry that are regulated by the FCA.\n\n## Get impartial advice\n\nThink about getting impartial financial advice before you hand over any money. Seek advice from someone unconnected to the firm that has approached you.\n\nIf you suspect that you have been approached by fraudsters, please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at fca.org.uk/scamsmart where you can find out more about investment scams. You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768. Alternatively, you can inform Computershare Investor Services, on 0370 707 1399 (Computershare are not able to investigate such incidents themselves, but they will record the details, pass them on to us, and liaise with the FCA).\n\nIf you have lost money to investment fraud, you should report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or online at actionfraud.police.uk.\n\nIf you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

        "page_content": "## Alternative Performance Measures\n\nAn alternative performance measure (APM) is a financial measure of historic or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined under IFRS or the regulations of Solvency II. APMs offer investors and stakeholders additional information on the Company's performance and the financial effect of 'one-off' events, and the Group uses a range of these metrics to enhance understanding of the Group's performance. However, APMs should be viewed as complementary to, rather than as a substitute for, the figures determined according to other regulations. The APMs used by the Group are listed in this Note, along with their definition/explanation, their closest IFRS or Solvency II measure and, where relevant, the reference to the reconciliations to those measures.\n\nThe adoption of IFRS 17 by the Group has led to changes in both the definition or result of several of the APMs, although the principles underlying them have not changed.\n\nThe APMs used by the Group may not be the same as, or comparable to, those used by other companies, both in similar and different industries. The calculation of APMs is consistent with previous periods, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## APMs derived from IFRS measures\n\n## Adjusted operating profit\n\nAdjusted operating profit is an APM that supports the internal performance management and decision making of the Group's operating businesses, and accordingly underpins the remuneration outcomes of the executive directors and senior management. The Group considers this measure meaningful to stakeholders as it enhances the understanding of the Group's operating performance over time by separately identifying non-operating items.\n\nAdjusted operating profit measures the pre-tax result excluding the impact of investment volatility, economic assumption changes caused by changes in market conditions or expectations and exceptional items. Key considerations in relation to the calculation of adjusted operating profit for the Group's long-term insurance businesses and shareholder funds are set out below.\n\nExceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the year, such as merger and acquisition and start-up costs, are excluded from adjusted operating profit.\n\n## Long-term insurance\n\nAdjusted operating profit reflects longer-term economic assumptions for the Group's retirement and insurance businesses. Variances between actual and long-term expected investment return on traded and real assets are excluded from adjusted operating profit, as well as economic assumption changes caused by changes in market conditions or expectations (e.g. credit default and inflation) and any difference between the actual allocated asset mix and the target long-term asset mix on new pension risk transfer business. Assets held for future new pension risk transfer business are excluded from the asset portfolio used to determine the discount rate for annuities on insurance contract liabilities. The impact of investment management actions that optimise the yield of the assets backing the back book of annuity contracts is now included within adjusted operating profit.\n\nFor the Group's long-term insurance businesses, reinsurance mismatches are also excluded from adjusted operating profit. Reinsurance mismatches arise where the reinsurance offset rules in IFRS 17 do not reflect management's view of the net of reinsurance transaction. In particular, during a period of reinsurance renegotiation, reinsurance gains cannot be recognised to offset any inception losses on the underlying contracts where they are recognised before the new reinsurance agreement is signed. In these circumstances, the onerous contract losses are reduced to reflect the net loss (if any) after reinsurance, and future contractual service margin (CSM) amortisation is reduced over the duration of the contracts.\n\nApplication of IFRS 17 has changed the timing of the recognition of profit from insurance contracts. This includes spreading both the day one profit arising on new business and the impact of assumption changes into the contractual service margin. Accordingly, the application of IFRS 17 reduced the reported 2022 operating profit from divisions by \u00a30.8bn in comparison with the result presented under IFRS 4.\n\n## Shareholder funds\n\nShareholder funds include both the Group's traded investments portfolio and certain direct investments for which adjusted operating profit is based on the long-term economic return expected to be generated. For these direct investments, as well as for the Group's traded investments portfolio, deviations from such long-term economic return are excluded from adjusted operating profit. Direct investments for which adjusted operating profit is reflected in this way include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Development assets, predominantly in the specialist commercial real estate and housing sectors within the LGC alternative asset portfolio: these are assets under construction and contracted to either be sold to other parts of the Group or for other commercial usage, and on which LGC accepts development risks and expects to realise profits once construction is complete.\n- \u00b7 'Scale-up' investments, predominantly in the alternative finance sector within the LGC alternative asset portfolio as well as the fintech business within Retail: these are investments in early-stage ventures in a fast-growing phase of their life cycle, but which have not yet reached a steady-state level of earnings.\n\nShareholder funds also includes other direct investments for which adjusted operating profit reflects the IFRS profit before tax. Direct investments for which adjusted operating profit is reflected in this way include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 'Start-up' investments: these are companies in the beginning stages of their business lifecycle (i.e. typically less than 24 months), which therefore have limited operating history available and typically are in a pre-revenue stage.\n- \u00b7 Mature assets: these are companies in their final stages of business lifecycle. They are stable businesses and have sustainable streams of income, but the growth rate in their earnings is expected to remain less pronounced in the future.",

        "page_content": "Note 2(i) Adjusted operating profit reconciles adjusted operating profit with its closest IFRS measure, which is profit before tax attributable to equity holders. Further details on reconciling items between adjusted operating profit and profit before tax attributable to equity holders are presented in Note 2(v) Investment and other variances.\n\n## Return on Equity (ROE)\n\nROE measures the return earned by shareholders on shareholder capital retained within the business. It is a measure of performance of the business, which shows how efficiently we are using our financial resources to generate a return for shareholders. ROE is calculated as IFRS profit after tax divided by average IFRS shareholders' funds (by reference to opening and closing shareholders' funds as provided in the IFRS Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the period). In the current period, ROE was quantified using annualised profit attributable to equity holders of \u00a3457m (31 December 2022: \u00a3783m) and average equity attributable to the owners of the parent of \u00a34,699m (31 December 2022: \u00a35,014m), based on an opening balance of \u00a35,067m and a closing balance of \u00a34,331m (31 December 2022: based on an opening balance of \u00a34,960m and a closing balance of \u00a35,067m). The methodology for determining the ROE has not changed following the adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9.\n\n## Assets under Management\n\nAssets under management represent funds which are managed by our fund managers on behalf of investors. It represents the total amount of money investors have trusted with our fund managers to invest across our investment products. AUM include assets which are reported in the Group Consolidated Balance Sheet as well as third-party assets that LGIM manage on behalf of others, and assets managed by third parties on behalf of the Group. AUM has not changed following the adoption of IFRS 9.\n\nThe table below reconciles AUM with Total financial investments, investment property and cash and cash equivalents.\n\n|                                                                                 | 2023 \u00a3bn   | Restated 2022 \u00a3bn   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|\n| Assets under management 1                                                       | 1,159      | 1,196               |\n| Derivative notionals 2                                                          | (247)      | (337)               |\n| Third party assets 3                                                            | (458)      | (412)               |\n| Other 4                                                                         | 47         | 45                  |\n| Total financial investments, investment property  and cash and cash equivalents | 501        | 492                 |\n\n## Adjusted profit before tax attributable to equity holders\n\nAdjusted profit before tax attributable to equity holders is equal to profit before tax attributable to equity holders plus the pre-tax results of discontinued operations. There has been no change in definition as a result of the adoption of IFRS 17.\n\nNote 2(i) Adjusted operating profit reconciles adjusted profit before tax attributable to equity holders to profit for the year. In absence of discontinued operations, adjusted profit before tax attributable to equity holders is equal to profit before tax attributable to equity holders.\n\n## APMs derived from Solvency II measures\n\nThe Group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on a regulatory basis and to comply with the minimum capital requirements of regulators in each territory in which it operates. At a Group level, Legal & General has to comply with the requirements established by the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the PRA.\n\n## Solvency II surplus\n\nSolvency II surplus is the excess of Eligible Own Funds over the Solvency Capital Requirements. It represents the amount of capital available to the Group in excess of that required to sustain it in a 1-in-200 year risk event. The Group's Solvency II surplus is based on the Partial Internal Model, Matching Adjustment and Transitional Measures on Technical Provisions (TMTP).\n\nDifferences between the Solvency II surplus and its related regulatory basis include the impact of TMTP recalculation when it is not approved by the PRA, incorporating impacts of economic conditions as at the reporting date, and the inclusion of unaudited profits (or losses) of financial firms, which are excluded from regulatory Own Funds. This view of Solvency II is considered to be representative of the shareholder risk exposure and the Group's real ability to cover the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) with Eligible Own Funds. It also aligns with management's approach to dynamically manage its capital position.\n\nFurther details on Solvency II surplus and its calculation are included in Note 26 Management of capital resources - Solvency II. This note also includes a reconciliation between IFRS equity and Solvency II Own Funds.\n\n## Solvency II capital coverage ratio\n\nSolvency II capital coverage ratio is one of the indicators of the Group's balance sheet strength. It is determined as Eligible Own Funds divided by the SCR, and therefore represents the number of times the SCR is covered by Eligible Own Funds.

It is based on assumed real world returns and best estimate non-market assumptions, and it includes the impact of management actions to the extent that, at the start of the year, these were reasonably expected to be implemented over the year.\n\nIt excludes operating variances, such as the impact of experience variances, changes to valuation assumptions, methodology changes and other management actions including changes in asset mix. It also excludes market movements, which represent the impact of changes in investment market conditions during the period and changes to future economic assumptions. The Group considers this measure meaningful to stakeholders as it enhances the understanding of its operating performance over time, and serves as an indicator on the longer-term components of the movements in the Group's Solvency II surplus.\n\nNote 26 Management of capital resources - Solvency II includes an analysis of change for the Group's Solvency II surplus, showing the contribution of Solvency II operational surplus generation as well as other items to the Solvency II surplus during the reporting period.",

Services provided in respect of assets under administration are of an administrative nature, including safekeeping, collecting investment income, settling purchase and sales transactions and record keeping.\n\n## Assets under management (AUM)*\n\nRefer to the alternative performance measures section.\n\n## Assured Payment Policy (APP)\n\nA long-term contract under which the policyholder (a registered UK pension scheme) pays a day-one premium and in return receives a contractually fixed and/or inflation-linked set of payments over time from the insurer.\n\n## Back book acquisition\n\nNew business transacted with an insurance company which allows the business to continue to utilise Solvency II transitional measures associated with the business.\n\n## CAGR\n\nCompound annual growth rate.\n\n## Common Contractual Fund (CCF)\n\nAn Irish regulated asset pooling fund structure. It enables institutional investors to pool assets into a single fund vehicle with the aim of achieving cost savings, enhanced returns and operational efficiency through economies of scale. A CCF is an unincorporated body established under a deed where investors are 'co-owners' of underlying assets which are held pro rata with their investment. The CCF is authorised and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.\n\n## Contract boundaries\n\nCash flows are within the boundary of an insurance contract if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the Group can compel the policyholder to pay the premiums or has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholder with insurance contract services.\n\n## Contractual service margin (CSM)\n\nThe CSM represents the unearned profit the Group will recognise for a Group of insurance contracts, as it provides services under the insurance contract. It is a component of the asset or liability for the contracts and it results in no income or expense arising from initial recognition of an insurance contract. Therefore, together with the risk adjustment, the CSM provides a view of both stored value of our in-force insurance business, and the growth derived from new business in the current year. A CSM is not set up for groups of contracts assessed as onerous.\n\nThe CSM is released as profit as the insurance services are provided.\n\n## Coverage Period\n\nThe period during which the Group provides insurance contract services. This period includes the insurance contract services that relate to all premiums within the boundary of the insurance contract.\n\n## Credit rating\n\nA measure of the ability of an individual, organisation or country to repay debt.

Regulatory approval has been provided to recognise the (re)insurance subsidiaries in the US and Bermuda on this basis.\n\n## Defined benefit pension scheme (DB scheme)\n\nA type of pension plan in which an employer/sponsor promises a specified monthly benefit on retirement that is predetermined by a formula based on the employee's earnings history, tenure of service and age, rather than depending directly on individual investment returns.\n\n## Defined contribution pension scheme (DC scheme)\n\nA type of pension plan where the pension benefits at retirement are determined by agreed levels of contributions paid into the fund by the member and employer. They provide benefits based upon the money held in each individual's plan specifically on behalf of each member. The amount in each plan at retirement will depend upon the investment returns achieved as well as the member and employer contributions.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nContracts usually giving a commitment or right to buy or sell assets on specified conditions, for example on a set date in the future and at a set price. The value of a derivative contract can vary. Derivatives can generally be used with the aim of enhancing the overall investment returns of a fund by taking on an increased risk, or they can be used with the aim of reducing the amount of risk to which a fund is exposed.\n\n## Direct investments\n\nDirect investments, which generally constitute an agreement with another party, represent an exposure to untraded and often less volatile asset classes. Direct investments also include physical assets, bilateral loans and private equity, but exclude hedge funds.",

This form of investing is most prominent in final salary pension plans, whose liabilities can often reach into billions of pounds for the largest of plans.\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nAn equity release product aimed at people aged 55 years and over. It is a mortgage loan secured against the customer's house. Customers do not make any monthly payments and continue to own and live in their house until they move into long-term care or on death. A no negative equity guarantee exists such that if the house value on repayment is insufficient to cover the outstanding loan, any shortfall is borne by the lender.\n\n## Longevity\n\nMeasure of how long policyholders will live, which affects the risk profile of pension risk transfer, annuity and protection businesses.\n\n## Matching adjustment\n\nAn adjustment to the discount rate used for annuity liabilities in Solvency II balance sheets. This adjustment reflects the fact that the profile of assets held is sufficiently well-matched to the profile of the liabilities, that those assets can be held to maturity, and that any excess return over risk-free (that is not related to defaults) can be earned regardless of asset value fluctuations after purchase.",

Platforms usually provide facilities for buying and selling investments (including, in the UK products such as Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), Self-Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs) and life insurance) and for viewing an individual's entire portfolio to assess asset allocation and risk exposure.\n\n## Present value of future new business premiums (PVNBP)\n\nPVNBP is equivalent to total single premiums plus the discounted value of annual premiums expected to be received over the term of the contracts using the same economic and operating assumptions used for the new business value at the end of the financial period. The discounted value of longevity insurance regular premiums and quota share reinsurance single premiums are calculated on a net of reinsurance basis to enable a more representative margin figure. PVNBP therefore provides an estimate of the present value of the premiums associated with new business written in the year.\n\n## Proprietary assets\n\nTotal investments to which shareholders are directly exposed, minus derivative assets, loans, and cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund (QIAIF)\n\nAn alternative investment fund regulated in Ireland targeted at sophisticated and institutional investors, with minimum subscription and eligibility requirements. Due to not being subject to many investment or borrowing restrictions, QIAIFs present a high level of flexibility in their investment strategy.\n\n## Real assets\n\nReal assets encompass a wide variety of tangible debt and equity investments, primarily real estate, infrastructure and energy. They have the ability to serve as stable sources of long-term income in weak markets, while also providing capital appreciation opportunities in strong markets.\n\n## Retail Retirement new business\n\nSingle premiums arising from annuity sales and individual annuity back book acquisitions and the volume of lifetime and retirement interest only mortgage lending.\n\n## Retirement Interest Only Mortgage (RIO)\n\nA standard retirement mortgage available for non-commercial borrowers above 55 years old. A RIO mortgage is very similar to a standard interest-only mortgage, with two key differences:\n\n- \u00b7 The loan is usually only paid off on death, move into long-term care or sale of the house.\n- \u00b7 The borrowers only have to prove they can afford the monthly interest repayments and not the capital remaining at the end of the mortgage term.\n\nNo repayment solution is required as repayment defaults to sale of property.\n\n## Return on Equity (ROE)*\n\nRefer to the alternative performance measures section.\n\n## Risk adjustment\n\nThe risk adjustment reflects the compensation that the Group would require for bearing uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk after diversification. We have calibrated the Group's risk adjustment using a Value at Risk (VAR) methodology. In some cases, the compensation for risk on reinsured business is linked directly to the price paid for reinsurance. The risk adjustment is a component of the insurance contract liability, and it is released as profit if experience plays out as expected.",

The ESG disclosures should be treated with special caution, as ESG and climate data, models and methodologies are often relatively new, are rapidly evolving and are not of the same standard as those available in the context of other financial information, nor are they subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks, market consensus or globally accepted accounting principals. These judgments, assumptions and estimates are likely to change over time, in particular given the uncertainty around the evolution and impact of climate change and around broader factors, such as impacts and dependencies on nature. In addition, the Group's climate risk analysis and net zero strategy and wider sustainability strategy remain under development and the data underlying the analysis and strategy remain subject to evolution.
