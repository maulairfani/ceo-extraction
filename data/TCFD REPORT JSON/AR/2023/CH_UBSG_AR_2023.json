ambitions' section of the UBS Group Annual Report 2023 for more information about our performance measurement. 2 Refer to 'Alternative performance measures' in the appendix to this report for the definition and calculation method. 3 Based on the Swiss systemically relevant bank framework as of 1 January 2020. Refer to the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information. 4 The disclosed ratios represent averages for the fourth quarter of each year presented, which were calculated based on an average of 63 data points in the fourth quarter of 2023. Refer to the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information. 5 Consists of invested assets for Global Wealth Management, Asset Management and Personal & Corporate Banking. Refer to 'Note 31 Invested assets and net new money' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information. 6 Starting with the second quarter of 2023, invested assets include invested assets from associates in the Asset Management business division, to better reflect the business strategy. Comparative figures have been restated to reflect this change.\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\nAn  alternative  performance  measure  (an APM)  is  a  financial  measure  of  historical  or  future  financial  performance, financial  position  or  cash  flows  other  than  a  financial  measure  defined  or  specified  in  the  applicable  recognized accounting standards or in other applicable regulations. A number of APMs are reported in UBS's external reports (annual, quarterly and other reports). APMs are used to provide a more complete picture of operating performance and to reflect management's view of the fundamental drivers of the business results. A definition of each APM, the method used to calculate it and the information content are presented under 'Alternative performance measures' in the appendix to this report. These APMs may qualify as non-GAAP measures as defined by US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.\n\n1",

The  completion  of  the  merger  is  subject  to regulatory approvals and is expected to occur by the end of the second quarter of 2024. The Group also expects to complete the transition to a single US intermediate holding company in the second quarter of 2024 and the planned merger of UBS Switzerland AG and Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Acquisition and integration of Credit Suisse' in the 'Our strategy, business model and environment' section in the UBS Group Annual Report 2023",

Our global reach and the breadth of our expertise are the major assets setting us apart from our competitors. Our Group functions are support and control functions that provide services to the Group. Virtually all costs incurred by the support and control functions are allocated to the business divisions, leaving a residual amount that we refer to as Group Items in our segment reporting. Disclosures in this report may refer to Group functions as Group Items.\n\nWe see joint efforts as key to our growth, both within and between business divisions. We combine our strengths to provide  our  clients  with  better,  innovative  solutions  and  differentiated  offerings,  for  example,  our  Global  Family  & Institutional Wealth offering with integrated global coverage.\n\n## Global Wealth Management\n\nWe are a leading and truly global wealth manager and strive to help our clients pursue what matters most to them. We are focused on serving the needs of ultra high and high net worth individuals through trusted relationships with our advisors, while expanding our specialized services. We offer clients our global reach, our advisory approach led by the Chief Investment Office (the CIO) and access to our platform with its broad array of solutions, alongside our premium brand.\n\n## Organizational changes\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, we took several steps to simplify our organizational structure into four regions: Americas, EMEA, Asia Pacific and Switzerland. We also unified key solutions and functions under global leads. This will facilitate further convergence and simplification of our global operating model, while retaining the flexibility for local and regional differences.\n\nIn June 2023, the new Global Wealth Management leadership team was announced, including the creation of a new business unit, Global Wealth Management Strategic Clients, which is focused on enabling and delivering to our strategic clients globally, working in partnership with our regional business leaders and supported by senior client coverage teams.\n\n## How we do business\n\nOur distinctive approach to wealth management helps our clients pursue what matters most to them by offering advice, expertise and solutions, and delivering on our client promise.\n\nOur advice to clients is led by our global CIO, which produces the UBS House View , identifying investment opportunities designed to protect and increase our clients' wealth over the long term. CIO views drive investment recommendations for advisory clients and investment decisions for discretionary clients representing more than USD 1.5trn in fee-generating assets globally.\n\nWe make available to clients a broad range of securities and investment products. In addition to traditional equity and fixed-income securities, our investment specialists source and craft a range of investment products, including separately managed accounts (SMAs), structured products, sustainable- and impact-investing products, and alternative investments. Our alternative investments offering gives clients access to private markets, including equity, real estate and other real assets,  and  investments  in  private  equity  funds  and  hedge  funds.  We  offer  our  own  private  equity  multi-manager investments and enable clients to access selected single-manager funds and open-ended programs.\n\nTo  complement  this  advice,  we  provide  clients  with  advice  on  wealth  planning,  sustainability-focused  and  impact investing, and corporate and banking services. Our specialist teams also advise on art and collecting, family strategy and governance, philanthropy, next generation, and wealth transition.\n\nOur Global Family & Institutional Wealth service model, in collaboration with the Investment Bank, provides specialized services to meet the needs of family offices and ultra high net worth clients. For clients with institutional-level trading, execution and clearing needs, our Unified Global Markets offers access to the full capabilities of the Global Markets business of the Investment Bank.\n\nIn Asia Pacific and Switzerland, the Direct Investment Insights function on our online banking platform enables clients to trade directly based on CIO insights via their smartphones and other digital devices. Advice Compass enables advisors to conveniently identify the most relevant ideas and solutions for clients during one-to-one meetings.\n\nTo provide our clients with the full breadth of investment management products and solutions, our Global Lending Unit offers  extensive  mortgage,  securities-based  and  structured  lending  expertise,  catering  to  sophisticated  client  lending needs.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information about sustainability matters",

To this end, we have developed a dedicated approach and resources with specialized teams supporting our clients in achieving their goals.\n\nWe are investing in our operating platforms and tools to better serve our clients' needs, improve their experience, enhance overall  advisor  productivity  and  improve  our  operational  resilience.  We  aim  to  make  our  services  faster  and  more responsive and offer more convenience to our clients. For example, our Global Wealth Management clients have invested more than USD 9bn in UBS My Way, our discretionary mandate solution that enables clients to customize their portfolio themselves via the UBS mobile banking app. Additionally, we continue to broaden our offering across asset classes and themes,  collaborating  with  best-in-class  managers  across  the  most  relevant  strategies.  We  are  making  continuous improvements to our direct-to-client digital offerings and have rolled out innovative new solutions, such as UBS My Way on mobile , a next-generation discretionary mandate solution that now enables clients to tailor their investments within their risk profile to their individual preferences via their mobile devices.\n\nWe also closely  collaborate  across  business  divisions  to  deliver  our  best  capabilities  to  clients.  Joint  efforts  with  the Investment Bank, Asset Management and selected external partners enable us to offer clients broad access to financing, global capital markets and bespoke portfolio solutions. For example, in the US market, the SMA initiative with Asset Management continues to gain momentum, with USD 158bn in assets under management.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur main competitors fall into two categories: competitors with a strong position in the Americas but more limited global footprints, such as Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America; and competitors with international footprints but with a smaller presence than UBS in the US, such as Julius Baer, BNP Paribas and HSBC. We also compete with fintech firms in some regions and products. We have strong positions in the largest region (the US) and the fastest-growing regions (Asia Pacific and the Middle East). The size of our global franchise, bespoke cross-divisional solutions and premium brand and reputation set us apart and would be difficult to replicate.",

This includes a broad range of basic banking products, from payments to deposits, cards and convenient online and mobile banking, as well as lending (predominantly mortgages), investments and retirement planning services.

Personal & Corporate Banking works closely with Global Wealth Management to provide our clients with access to leading wealth management services.\n\nOur corporate and institutional clients benefit from our financing and investment solutions, in particular access to equity and debt capital markets, syndicated and structured credit, private placements, leasing, and traditional financing. We offer transaction banking solutions for payment and cash management services, trade and export finance, and global custody solutions for institutional clients.\n\nPersonal & Corporate Banking works closely with the Investment Bank to offer capital market and foreign exchange products, hedging strategies, and trading capabilities, as well as corporate finance advice. In cooperation with Asset Management, we also provide fund and portfolio management solutions.\n\nIn  2023,  we  continued  to  support  our  clients'  sustainability  ambitions.  In  the  corporate  client  segment,  we  further expanded our client-centric approach and focused on supporting our clients by advising them as part of a strategic dialogue  and  launching  a  sustainability-linked  loan  for  multi-national  corporations.  We  also  took  positive  steps  in providing transparency and sustainability insights to our private clients. With the launch of the carbon tracker in the UBS key4 mobile banking app, clients can see an estimated carbon footprint for their purchases with UBS credit and debit cards and through UBS TWINT, helping them navigate the carbon footprints of their purchases in a relatively simple manner.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information about sustainability matters\n\nWe are building stronger relationships with our clients during the life cycle of their property ownership and providing services along the value chain.

We  operate  a  multi-channel  approach,  and  we  are  constantly  developing  our  digital  and  remote channels.\n\nIn Personal Banking, our main competitors are the cantonal banks, Raiffeisen, PostFinance and other regional and local Swiss banks; we also face competition from international neobanks and other national digital market participants. Areas of competition are basic banking services, mortgages and foreign exchange, as well as investment mandates and funds.\n\nIn the corporate and institutional business, the cantonal banks and globally active foreign banks are our main competitors. We compete in basic banking services, cash management, trade and export finance, asset servicing, investment advice for institutional clients, corporate finance and lending, and cash and securities transactions for banks. We also support the international business activities of our Swiss corporate clients through local hubs in New York, Frankfurt, Singapore and the Hong Kong SAR in competition with globally active foreign banks.

In 2023, we further expanded our offering across asset classes and themes, including new net-zero ambition products. We launched our first sustainability-focused fund of hedge funds strategy, created in close collaboration with Global Wealth Management. We also partnered again with Aon to launch the UBS Global Emerging Markets Equity Climate Transition Fund, which tilts toward emerging market companies supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy, while factoring in important social considerations.\n\nStewardship  is  a  fundamental  element  of  our  sustainability  strategy.  In  2023,  we  sharpened  our  five-year  climate engagement  program's  focus  and  also  aligned  our  voting  policy  to  our  evolved  climate  engagement  objectives.  In addition, to support our increasing focus on natural capital, we became a founding member of the Nature Action 100 collaborative  engagement  initiative  and  joined  the  Principles  for  Responsible  Investment's  Stewardship  Advisory Committee for its initiative on nature.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information about sustainability matters\n\nWe also continue to build on our joint efforts with the other business divisions, enabling our teams to draw on the best ideas,  solutions  and  capabilities  from  across  the  firm  in  order  to  deliver  high-quality  investment  performance  and experiences for our clients. For example, in 2023 we continued to expand our separately managed accounts (SMA) offering as part of our joint initiative with Global Wealth Management in the US. In support of this initiative, we launched the SMA Hub, a new self-service portal that enables financial advisors to generate custom client reports or proposals in only minutes.\n\nGeographically, we are building on our extensive and long-standing presence in the Asia Pacific region, including China, where we continue to capitalize on our on- and offshore products and market presence, including our joint ventures.\n\nTo support our growth, we are focused on disciplined execution of our operational excellence initiatives. This includes further  automation,  simplification,  process  optimization  and  offshoring  or  nearshoring  of  selected  activities, complemented by continued enhancements to our platform and development of our analytics and data capabilities. One example is our Portfolio Engineering & Trading initiative, which will streamline trading and portfolio implementation across our active and index capabilities through an integrated technology architecture. It will harmonize processes and enable further scalability of customization across asset classes.",

The Investment  Bank  is  focused  on  meeting  clients'  needs,  including  those  with  respect  to  environmental,  social  and governance  (ESG)  considerations  and  sustainable  finance,  helping  to  reshape  business  models  and  investment opportunities and to develop sustainable finance products and solutions.\n\nIn Global Markets, we develop products and solutions designed to meet clients' specific and increasingly detailed ESG objectives. In carbon emissions solutions, our clients continued to access solutions that are linked to the recently launched UBS Constant Maturity Commodity Index emissions index, as well as those that are available via our execution and clearing capabilities for carbon emissions futures. We continued to scale the number of portfolio certificates linked to a range of sustainability and climate investment themes, despite challenging market conditions throughout 2023.\n\nUBS is a founding member of Carbonplace, a marketplace platform that seeks to build infrastructure to scale voluntary carbon markets, with the aim of enabling firms such as UBS to offer clients the ability to buy, sell, hold and retire voluntary carbon credits.\n\nIn  Global  Banking,  ESG  is  a  core  component  of  many  corporate  business  strategies  and  a  key  tool  in  achieving sustainability in business and corporate operating models. As pressure from regulators and other key stakeholder groups, such as customers, investors and employees, is increasing, so is the need for transformation. The ESG Advisory group provides the necessary lens helping UBS's clients assess ESG topics throughout the corporate life cycle.\n\nUBS arranged USD 53.7bn in green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked themed (GSSS) bonds through 102 deals during 2023. We also solidified our market position in the Swiss franc-denominated market with a combined market share of nearly 50%. We have also built a strong position in the ESG-labelled local debt market in Brazil.\n\nOur  independent  ESG  research  team  collaborates  with  UBS  sector  analysts  and UBS Evidence  Lab primary  research experts, providing data-driven insights into ESG-relevant questions. The ESG research team works to identify touchpoints between markets, society and the environment, and to respond to ESG issues as they move to the center of investors' agendas. UBS sector lead analysts authored a variety of our flagship ESG Sector Radar reports, as well as a broad range of ESG Company Radar reports.\n\nOur ESG Company Radar research reports, which we launched in 2022, assess the impact of ESG factors at company level,  and  we  continued to see a very positive client response to those reports. Other types of ESG content include thematic  and  cross-sectoral  collaborations, ESG  Keys (which  covers  sustainable  investing  topics),  and  an  increasing number of regional perspectives from our expanded ESG team, which works out of our offices in New York, London, the Hong Kong SAR, Tokyo and Sydney.\n\n## \u203a Refer to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information about sustainability matters\n\nOur digital strategy harnesses technology to provide access to sources of unique, global liquidity, personalized advice and differentiated content. The Investment Bank strives to be the digital investment bank of the future, focused on delivering innovation-led solutions, and efficiencies for our clients. As the world around us changes, our digital capabilities aim to harness emerging technologies and create new products and solutions, which enable our clients to adapt to evolving market structures and achieve their investment goals.\n\nOur ambition to be the most client-focused, efficient and data-driven investment bank is being realized through the simplification of technology architecture, increased speed and quality of delivery and the attraction of best-in-class talent. As we look forward to the continued evolution of our digital capabilities, we will see increased adoption of technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence, the consistent re-use of platforms and products, and the continued drive to make progress in our overall strategic imperatives, with regard to a new, combined Investment Bank.\n\nJoint efforts between the Investment Bank and the other business divisions (for example, our work with Global Wealth Management on our new Global Family & Institutional  Wealth  coverage)  and,  externally,  strategic  partnerships  (for example,  UBS  BB  jointly  with  Banco  do  Brasil,  focused  on  Latin  America)  continue  to  be  key  strategic  priorities. Partnerships with Global Wealth Management and Asset Management enable us to provide clients with broad access to financing, global capital markets and portfolio solutions. We expect these initiatives to continue to lead to growth by delivering  global  products  to  each  region,  leveraging  our  global  connectivity  across  borders  and  sharing  and strengthening our best client relationships.",

Our business is regionally diversified, with a presence in more than 30 countries. We cover the main investment banking markets globally and have major financial hubs across four regions: the Americas; Asia Pacific; EMEA; and Switzerland.\n\nOur global reach gives attractive options for growth. In the Americas, the largest investment banking fee pool globally, we continue to focus on increasing market share in our core Global Banking and Global Markets businesses. In Asia Pacific, opportunities arise mainly from expected market internationalization and growth in China, where we plan to grow by strengthening our presence, both onshore and offshore. In EMEA, we plan to leverage our strong base and brand recognition even further.\n\nCompeting firms operate in many of our markets, but our strategy differentiates us, with our focus on leadership in the areas where we have chosen to compete and a business model that leverages talent and technology rather than balance sheet. Our main competitors are the major global investment banks (e.g., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs) and corporate  investment  banks  (e.g.,  Bank  of  America,  Barclays,  Citigroup,  BNP  Paribas,  Deutsche  Bank  and  JPMorgan Chase). We also compete with boutique investment banks and fintech firms in certain regions and products.\n\n## Non-core and Legacy\n\nIn 2023, subsequent to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group by UBS, Non-core and Legacy was created at the UBS Group level, to bring together positions and businesses, mainly including those of Credit Suisse, which are not aligned with the Group's strategy and policies.\n\nFrom a UBS AG consolidated perspective, Non-core and Legacy includes the remaining assets and liabilities of UBS's Noncore and Legacy Portfolio, previously reported in Group Functions (now renamed to Group Items), and smaller amounts of assets and liabilities of UBS's business divisions that have been assessed as not strategic in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Non-core and Legacy' in the 'Our strategy, business model and environment' section of the UBS Group Annual Report 2023 for more information about Non-core and Legacy from a Group perspective\n\n## Group functions\n\nThe Group functions are support and control functions that provide services to the Group, focusing on effectiveness, risk mitigation and efficiency.\n\n## How we are organized\n\nThe Group functions include the following major areas: Group Services (which consists of the Group Operations and Technology Office, Corporate Services, Compliance, Regulatory & Governance, Finance, Risk Control, Human Resources, Communications & Branding, Legal, the Group Integration Office, Group Sustainability and Impact, and Chief Strategy Office) and Group Treasury.\n\n## Group Services\n\nThe vast majority of the support and control functions are fully aligned or shared among the business divisions, where they have full management responsibility. By keeping the activities of the businesses and support and control functions closely  aligned,  we  improve  efficiency  and  create  a  working  environment  built  on  accountability  and  collaboration. Virtually all costs incurred by the support and control functions are allocated to the business divisions, leaving a residual amount that we refer to as Group Items in our segment reporting in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. Certain activities  are  retained  centrally,  where  not  directly  related  to  the  businesses,  such  as  group  hedging  and  own  debt activities in Group Treasury and certain other costs that are mainly related to deferred tax assets and costs relating to our legal entity transformation program.\n\n## Group Treasury\n\nGroup Treasury manages balance sheet structural risk (e.g., interest rate, structural foreign exchange and collateral risks), as well as the risks associated with our liquidity, capital and funding portfolios. Group Treasury serves all five business divisions, and its risk management is integrated into the Group risk governance framework.",

        "page_content": "## Our environment\n\n## Market environment\n\n## Global economic developments in 2023 1\n\nThe global economy was resilient in 2023, in spite of the steep interest rate rises by major central banks designed to curb inflation from the multi-decade highs reached in 2022.\n\nGlobal growth slowed only slightly, to 3.2%, in 2023, down from 3.4% in 2022. This partly reflected the strength of the US  economy,  where  growth  withstood  higher  interest  rates,  tightening  bank  lending  standards,  and  mediocre  real income growth. US GDP growth increased to 2.5% in 2023, up from 1.9% in 2022, as job security and relatively strong balance sheets encouraged higher spending by middle-income consumers. Economies in Europe also expanded in 2023, though at a slower pace. Growth in the Eurozone slowed to 0.5% in 2023, down from 3.4% in 2022, as the European Central Bank (the ECB) repeatedly raised interest rates. Growth in the Swiss economy slowed to 0.7% in 2023, down from 2.7% in 2022. UK GDP growth slowed to 0.1% in 2023, down from 4.3% in 2022, as high inflation and interest rate rises also limited growth.\n\nGrowth in China increased to 5.2% in 2023, compared with 3% in 2022, when its economy was slowed by pandemic restrictions that were in place until late in that year. However, cautious spending by domestic consumers meant that the rebound in growth was weaker than had been expected. Growth in India remained robust at 7% in 2023, down only slightly from 7.2% in 2022.\n\nInflation eased across developed economies, especially in the second half of 2023, as supply chains continued to recover from COVID-19 disruptions, energy prices were lower than 2022 and central bank interest rate rises increased the cost of borrowing. US consumer price inflation slowed to an annual 3.4% in December 2023, from 6.4% in January 2023. Inflation decelerated even more markedly in the Eurozone, to 2.9% year over year in December 2023, compared with 8.5% in January 2023. This trend enabled the Federal Reserve and the ECB to signal late in 2023 that monetary tightening had probably come to an end.\n\nThe MSCI All Country World Index returned a 22.2% gain in 2023, with close to half of that gain coming in the final two months of the year. The S&P 500 rose by 26.3%, lifted by optimism that innovations in artificial intelligence will boost profits and hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut rates swiftly in response to falling inflation. The FANG+ index, which tracks the 10 most traded US tech stocks, increased 96% over the year. The MSCI Japan was the best-performing major market in local currency terms in 2023, with a return of 28.6%, its highest in a decade. In Europe, the MSCI EMU returned 18.8%. Although the Swiss and UK markets lagged behind global stocks, both ended the year in positive territory, with returns of 5.3% and 7.7%, respectively. The weakest performance by a major market came from the MSCI China, which lost 10.7% amid disappointment over the pace of the economic recovery from pandemic restrictions and more limitedthan-expected stimulus.\n\n## Economic and market outlook for 2024 1\n\nOur baseline scenario for 2024 is for a soft landing in the US and subdued but positive growth in the Eurozone. We expect growth in China to enter a new normal of lower, but potentially higher-quality, growth.\n\nWe believe inflation will continue falling toward central bank targets, and, as a result, we believe policymakers will feel confident enough to lower interest rates starting around the middle of 2024. We expect cuts from the Federal Reserve, the ECB, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of England. In contrast, with Japanese deflation coming to an end, we expect the Bank of Japan to raise rates into positive territory for the first time since late 2015.\n\nWith regard to growth, we expect the US to slow to a sustainable long-term rate of growth, due to declining housing affordability and the withdrawal of some government support measures that helped households during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, middle-income consumers still appear to have spending power, as well as relatively strong balance sheets, and we expect demand for labor to remain resilient. Overall, we expect US GDP growth to remain positive, at around 1.1% in 2024. We expect growth to be weak in the Eurozone, at 0.6%, due to the lagged effect of higher interest rates. We also expect UK GDP to increase by 0.6% in 2024, while GDP growth in Switzerland is expected to increase to 1.2% in 2024.\n\nGeopolitical events and elections also have the potential to play an outsized role in 2024. The US presidential election, the ongoing Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars, and the tension between the US and China could all affect markets globally. In addition, more than four billion people in more than 40 countries are set to go to the polls in 2024, including in the US, India and, potentially, the UK.",

        "page_content": "In 2013, FINMA stated its preference for a single point of entry (an SPE) strategy for globally active SRBs, such as UBS, with a bail-in at the group holding company level. UBS has made structural, financial and operational changes to facilitate an SPE strategy and is confident that a resolution of the bank is operationally executable and legally enforceable. In 2023, UBS  acquired  the  Credit  Suisse  Group  and  merged  Credit  Suisse  Group AG  into  UBS  Group AG.  A  bail-in  remains operationally executable for the combined UBS Group and an SPE resolution strategy remains the preferred strategy for UBS.\n\nFINMA evaluates the recovery and resolution plans of Swiss SRBs on a regular basis. In its most recent assessment, which was published in April 2023 and based on year-end 2022 information, FINMA re-confirmed that UBS's Swiss emergency plan is effective, the recovery plan has been approved and that UBS fulfills all resolvability criteria. This assessment did not reflect the combined organization and the respective plans will need to be amended and approved for the new and combined Group. FINMA will review its resolvability assessment of the combined UBS Group as the integration progresses. A new, interim assessment is expected to be published by FINMA at the end of the second quarter of 2024.\n\n## Crisis management framework\n\nThe UBS Group's crisis management framework assigns responsibility and actions depending on the nature of the stress incident and the scale of the response needed.\n\n- - For incident, risk and crisis management, the Group Crisis Task Force works with incident management teams that provide monitoring and early-warning indicators at the local / regional level, without needing to activate protocols at the Group level. If a local response is insufficient, global task forces and crisis management teams provide decisionmaking guidance and coordination, including crisis management plans, protocols and playbooks, and contingency funding plans.\n- - The Group Executive Board (the GEB) and the Board of Directors (the BoD) would evaluate and decide upon the need to activate the Global Recovery Plan (the GRP) if a stress event reached a severity requiring activation based on the GRP's recovery risk indicators.\n- - FINMA has the authority to determine whether the point of non-viability (the PONV), as defined by Swiss law, has been reached and, as part of the resolution plan, has the power to order the bail-in of creditors to recapitalize and stabilize the Group, limit payments of dividends and interest, alter our legal structure, take actions to reduce business risk, and order a restructuring of the bank.\n\n## UBS crisis management framework\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Global Recovery Plan\n\nThe GRP provides a tool to restore financial strength if UBS comes under severe capital or liquidity stress. Quantitative and qualitative triggers are monitored daily and are subject to predefined governance and escalation processes. Recovery options  are  linked  to  owners  and  checklists,  with  the  objectives  of  preserving  capital,  raising  capital  or  liquidity,  or disposing of or winding down businesses.\n\n## Global Resolution Strategy\n\nFINMA is required to produce a global resolution plan for UBS. The plan includes setting out measures that FINMA can take to resolve UBS in an orderly manner if the UBS Group enters resolution. The SPE bail-in strategy would involve writing down the UBS Group's remaining equity and additional tier 1 and tier 2 instruments, as well as the bailing in of the TLAC-eligible senior unsecured bonds at the UBS Group AG level. An internal recapitalization of undercapitalized subsidiaries would be executed simultaneously with losses transmitted to UBS AG or Credit Suisse AG, and, ultimately, UBS Group AG. Post-resolution restructuring measures could include disposals or wind-down of businesses and assets.\n\n## Local recovery and resolution plans\n\nThe Swiss emergency plans demonstrate how UBS's systemically important functions and critical operations in Switzerland can continue if the UBS Group cannot be restructured. This is achieved mainly by operating the Swiss-booked business in separate legal entities, including UBS Switzerland AG, and by maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity to ensure their continued operation.\n\nThe US resolution plans set out the steps that could be taken to resolve the US intermediate holding companies (the US IHCs), including UBS Americas Holding LLC, and their subsidiaries, if they suffered material financial distress and the UBS Group was unable or unwilling to provide financial support. As such and as required by US regulations, our US plan for UBS Americas Holding LLC contemplates that the US IHC will commence US bankruptcy proceedings. Prior to this, the plan envisages the US IHC downstreaming financial resources to their respective subsidiaries to facilitate an orderly winddown or disposal of businesses.\n\nUBS Europe SE updates a local recovery plan annually based on European Central Bank requirements, and resolution planning information and capabilities based on Single Resolution Board requirements. On the basis of such information, the Internal Resolution Team, composed of members of the Single Resolution Board, produces a resolution plan for UBS Europe SE.\n\nOther local recovery and resolution plans exist for various UBS AG entities and jurisdictions.\n\n## Regulatory trends\n\nIn  2023,  regulatory  policy  was  strongly  impacted  by  the  banking  turmoil  in  March,  with  financial  stability  concerns returning  to  the  forefront,  followed  by  renewed  discussions  around  the  effectiveness  of  too-big-to-fail  /  resolution frameworks  and  subsequent  initial  lessons  drawn  being  discussed  throughout  the  year.  While  the  reviews  by supranational standard-setters and in Switzerland generally upheld the appropriateness of the international regulatory and resolution frameworks, certain themes requiring further attention were identified with additional analyses ongoing.\n\nThe digitalization of banking and corresponding policy responses continued throughout 2023, with attention paid to systemic risks, market integrity, investor protection and cross-border aspects related to digital assets. Initial policy efforts started on decentralized finance. In the meantime, most major central banks increased their engagement related to central bank digital currencies. New capabilities and wider adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) have resulted in increased regulatory focus on the topic, particularly regarding sound governance frameworks, safety and fairness. The large-scale use of both traditional and non-traditional data by AI models has given rise to questions around the adequacy of existing data  legislation  and  in  some  jurisdictions  will  likely  result  in  enhanced  protections.  Separately,  many  jurisdictions continued to make data more available across sectors, with a focus on open finance.\n\nSustainable finance and climate-related financial risks remained a key focus for policymakers in 2023, where we observed noteworthy activity in the areas of corporate and product disclosures for climate-related financial risks, specifically relating to banks' governance, strategy and risk management, as well as efforts to standardize and harmonize regulations across different jurisdictions. Policymakers advanced guidelines related to nature and biodiversity topics by intensifying the focus on disclosures, risk management and quantification methodologies. Furthermore, we observed ongoing regulatory policy related to net-zero financing, while transition planning started to become an important focus topic for policymakers. On the topic of products regulation, regulatory initiatives continued to focus on carbon and carbon markets and addressing issues related to greenwashing. Lastly, we saw increased regulatory attention paid to solutions related to social impact investing and blended finance.",

        "page_content": "The national implementation of the Basel III requirements continued to be an important focus area. The authorities in Switzerland issued rules to implement the final standards into Swiss law, and US banking regulators launched a public consultation in 2023. Switzerland has confirmed the effective date for the revised rules as 1 January 2025. Although the EU is still targeting implementation by January 2025, the UK and the US have delayed the application until July 2025, with the US also including a three-year transition timeline. Differences in the implementation timelines and in the content of the provisions remain a challenge for globally active banks.\n\nIn addition, regulatory authorities continued to refine existing regulations, including efforts to strengthen the anti-moneylaundering guidelines on beneficial ownership and work on enhancing third-party risk management, with operational resilience remaining a key issue. The focus on retail investor protection sharpened, in particular in asset management. In the US, retail investor protection features became a component of an ongoing broader equity market reform. In the UK, reviews of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime focused on determining whether the regime delivers against its  original  aim  and  how  it  can  be  improved.  Finally,  in  light  of  increasing  risks,  non-bank  financial  intermediation remained a topic of concern with national and supranational policymakers.\n\nWe believe the continued adaptations made to our business model and our proactive management of regulatory change put us in a strong position to absorb upcoming changes to the regulatory environment. We trust that our strengthened position as a combined organization will allow us to cope with any potential challenges.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Regulatory and legal developments' and the 'Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' sections of this report for more information\n\n## Regulatory and legal developments\n\n## Developments related to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group and the banking turmoil in March 2023\n\n## Key developments in Switzerland\n\nBased on the emergency ordinance issued by the Swiss Federal Council in connection with the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group on 16 March 2023, as amended on 19 March 2023, (the Emergency Ordinance), UBS Group AG entered into a loss protection agreement (an LPA) with the Swiss Confederation, with an effective date of 12 June 2023. As part of this agreement, the Swiss Confederation would have borne up to CHF 9bn of losses, if realized, on a designated portfolio of Credit Suisse's non-core assets after the first CHF 5bn of losses, which would have been borne by UBS.\n\nUnder the Emergency Ordinance, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG also had access to additional liquidity assistance loans, the Emergency Liquidity Assistance Plus (ELA+) loans, provided by the Swiss National Bank (the SNB) of up to CHF 100bn on a combined basis, with the loans under the facility having preferential rights in bankruptcy proceedings. The Credit Suisse Group was also allowed to borrow up to an additional CHF 100bn from the SNB backed by a Swiss federal default guarantee, the Public Liquidity Backstop (the PLB), with the loans having preferential rights in bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nOn 11 August 2023, UBS Group AG voluntarily terminated the LPA and the PLB. After reviewing all assets covered by the  LPA  since  the  closing  of  the  Transaction  in  June  2023  and  taking  the  appropriate  fair  value  adjustments,  UBS concluded that the LPA was no longer required. All loans under the PLB were fully repaid by the Credit Suisse Group as of  the  end  of  May  2023  and  Credit  Suisse AG  fully  repaid  the  outstanding  ELA+  loans  on  10 August  2023.  As  of 31 December 2023, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG had a total of CHF 38bn outstanding under the Emergency Liquidity Assistance facility, which is fully collateralized by Swiss mortgages.\n\nIn parallel with the measures taken by the Swiss Confederation in March 2023, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) also ordered a write-off of CHF 15.8bn principal amount of Credit Suisse Group AG's additional tier 1 (AT1) instruments.\n\nIn May 2023, the Swiss Federal Department of Finance mandated a group of experts on banking stability to assess the role  of  banks  and  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  related  to  the  stability  of  the  Swiss  financial  center.  The corresponding report, published in September 2023, concluded that Swiss capital regulations are working as intended and that there is no need for a major revision. However, the report sees a need for reforms with regard to banking supervision and proposes that the relevant authorities be granted broader powers. Furthermore, the report suggests improvements regarding liquidity regulations, including a proposal to extend the supply of liquidity in the case of a crisis. The  report  also  suggests  that  Swiss  authorities  should  make  improvements  with  regard  to  crisis  preparation  and management.",

        "page_content": "In  June  2023,  the  Swiss  Parliament  formed  a  parliamentary  inquiry  committee  that  is  mandated  to  investigate  the legitimacy, expediency and effectiveness of the management of the competent authorities and bodies in the context of the events involving the Credit Suisse Group. The committee will report to the Swiss Parliament on the results of its investigation and will propose measures to remedy any identified deficiencies. We expect the results to be published in the  fourth  quarter  of  2024.  The  conclusions  by  the  inquiry  committee  may  include  potentially  significant recommendations, which could result in more stringent regulation.\n\nIn December 2023, FINMA published a report on the case of Credit Suisse that analyzed the development of Credit Suisse in recent years and examined its supervisory work with the bank. In addition, FINMA noted in its report a number of lessons to be learned, calling for a stronger legal basis, specifically for instruments such as a Senior Managers Regime, the power to impose fines, and more stringent rules regarding corporate governance. Furthermore, FINMA explained that it will adapt its supervisory approach in certain areas and will step up its review of whether stabilization measures are ready to be implemented.\n\nThe findings of the group of experts and the lessons drawn by FINMA include recommendations that could result in more stringent regulation, and will be considered by the Swiss Federal Council in its next report on systemically important banks, which is to be presented by April 2024.\n\n## Key developments in the US\n\nIn May 2023, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) released reports that covered the circumstances leading to the closing of certain banking organizations following the events in the banking market in March 2023. The reports noted shortcomings in the supervisory agencies' execution of examination programs, including escalation of supervisory issues and staffing. They also raised concerns related to the regulatory framework, including the Federal Reserve's Tailoring Rule and other topics, such as interest rate risk management. UBS expects these developments to impact the regulatory environment in the US, where UBS has significant operations.\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover losses incurred by the Deposit Insurance Fund in connection with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March 2023. The assessment  is  based  on  the  estimated  uninsured  deposits  of  each  depository  institution  at  the  end  of  2022.  The assessment will be collected over an eight-quarter period that started in January 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2023, UBS Bank USA recorded a charge for the full amount of its estimated assessment of USD 60m.\n\n## Key developments at the supranational level\n\nIn October 2023, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the BCBS) released a report on the causes of the 2023 banking turmoil. The BCBS argues that while the distress of various banks in March 2023 reflected idiosyncratic factors, recurring  themes  can  be  grouped  into  three  broad  categories:  bank  risk-management  practices  and  governance arrangements; strong and effective supervision; and robust regulatory standards.\n\nAlso in October 2023, the Financial Stability Board (the FSB) identified in a review several areas related to the effective operationalization and implementation of the international resolution framework that merit further attention as part of future work, but concluded that recent events demonstrate the soundness of the framework.\n\nNo concrete changes to the Basel standards or the FSB framework are proposed at this stage, but the follow-up work is particularly focused on strengthening supervisory effectiveness, liquidity risk, interest rate risk in the banking book and the effectiveness of the resolution frameworks.\n\n## Developments regarding capital and liquidity adequacy and TBTF frameworks\n\n## Developments related to liquidity adequacy\n\nIn September 2023, the Swiss Federal Council adopted a dispatch and draft legislation on the introduction of a public liquidity  backstop  for  systemically  important  banks  (SIBs),  which  was  initially  implemented  as  part  of  the  Emergency Ordinance. The proposed legislative changes aim to establish the public liquidity backstop as part of ordinary law in order to enable the Swiss government and the SNB to support an SIB domiciled in Switzerland with liquidity in the process of resolution, in line with other financial centers. The introduction of the public liquidity backstop is intended to increase the confidence of market participants in the ability of SIBs to be successfully recapitalized and remain solvent in a crisis. Furthermore, the draft legislation provides that SIBs will pay the Swiss Confederation an annual fee to mitigate a potential impact on competition and to compensate the Swiss Confederation for its guarantee to the SNB of the public liquidity backstop, if required.\n\nIn addition to the public liquidity backstop, the proposed legislative changes would enact into ordinary law additional provisions contained in the Emergency Ordinance, including mandated clawback of variable compensation in the event that government support is provided to an SIB.",

        "page_content": "The legislative changes are expected to come into force by January 2025, at the earliest, as in November 2023, the Swiss Parliament suspended discussions on the public liquidity backstop until the presentation of the Swiss Federal Council's report on systemically important banks.\n\nFurthermore, FINMA communicated in the third quarter of 2023 the liquidity requirements arising from the revisions to the Swiss Liquidity Ordinance, with the aim of strengthening the resilience of SIBs in Switzerland. The affected legal entities of the UBS Group are compliant with these requirements, which became effective on 1 January 2024.\n\n## Developments related to capital adequacy\n\nIn July 2023, US banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC), issued a public consultation on a proposal that would implement the final components of the Basel III capital standards for US banking organizations and foreign-owned intermediate holding companies, such as UBS Americas Holding LLC and Credit Suisse Holdings (USA), Inc. Among other matters, the proposed rules would end the use of the internal model approach for credit risk by the largest banking organizations and would introduce instead a new  standardized  approach.  In  addition,  the  proposed  rules  for  operational  risks  would  replace  the  advanced measurement approach with a standardized measure. The proposal calls for a three-year transition period, starting on 1 July 2025, and full implementation by 1 July 2028. We currently estimate that the proposed rule changes would result in increased capital requirements for our US-based intermediate holding companies if implemented as proposed.\n\nIn November 2023, the Swiss Federal Council adopted amendments to the Capital Adequacy Ordinance (the CAO) for banks to incorporate the final Basel III standards adopted by the BCBS in Swiss law. The amended CAO will enter into force on 1 January 2025. The final degree of alignment between the Swiss implementation and those in other jurisdictions remains uncertain at this stage. Although EU legislators target implementation by January 2025, the implementation timelines in the UK and the US have been delayed until July 2025. The Swiss Federal Department of Finance will inform the Swiss Federal Council about the status of international implementation by the end of July 2024. We currently estimate that the revised Basel III framework will lead to a further net increase in risk-weighted assets of approximately USD 25bn, of which USD 10bn is in Non-core and Legacy. This estimate is based on static balances, before taking into account mitigating actions, as well as not reflecting the impact of the output floor, which is phased in over time.\n\n## Developments related to TBTF frameworks\n\nIn August 2023, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC issued joint proposals on long-term debt requirements and resolution planning guidance for large banks. The long-term debt proposal would require certain large bank-holding companies, intermediate holding companies and insured depositories with USD 100bn or more in total assets to maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt, intended to enhance the resilience and resolvability of such organizations. Large banking organizations would also be prohibited from certain activities that could complicate the resolution or would lead to contagion risks. If the proposals are implemented, UBS Bank USA would be subject to the long-term debt requirement, which would be incremental to the requirements already imposed upon its parent organization, UBS Americas Holding LLC. The resolution planning guidance proposed by US banking regulators would cover our US-based entities and calls for certain enhancements in the requirements of the submitted resolution plans.\n\nIn November 2023, the FSB published the 2023 list of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). UBS has been moved from Bucket 1 to Bucket 2, corresponding to an increased FSB common equity tier 1 capital surcharge requirement of 1.5% from 1.0%, effective from 1 January 2025. Credit Suisse has been removed from the list. As UBS is subject to higher requirements under the Swiss CAO, the change does not affect the capital requirements applicable to UBS.\n\nIn February 2024, the FSB published its Peer Review of Switzerland, which examines Switzerland's implementation of the FSB's TBTF reforms for G-SIBs. The review states that although Swiss authorities have made important steps toward implementing an effective TBTF regime for G-SIBs, additional steps can be taken to further strengthen the Swiss TBTF framework. Recommendations include increasing supervisory resources, strengthening early intervention powers and enhancing the recovery and resolution regime.",

        "page_content": "## Developments regarding climate-related financial risks and sustainable finance\n\nIn 2023, the Swiss National Council discussed the revision of the Act on the Reduction of CO2 Emissions (the CO2 Act), which contains measures to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 1990. The proposal is based on supplementing the existing CO2 Act with additional incentives to reduce emissions in different industry sectors of the economy. For the financial sector, it contains a provision mandating FINMA and the SNB to regularly assess climaterelated  financial  risks  in  the  financial  sector  and  to  report  the  results,  as  well  as  potential  measures,  to  the  Swiss government.  FINMA  is  currently  collecting  the  data  from  the  financial  sector  in  order  to  be  able  to  carry  out  the assessment in 2024. It is expected that the proposal will be formally adopted by the Swiss Parliament in spring 2024.\n\nIn June 2023, the Swiss electorate voted in favor of the new Climate and Innovation Act (the CI Act). The CI Act defines a net-zero-by-2050 target for Switzerland, including interim targets for selected sectors of the Swiss economy covering scope 1  and  2  emissions.  In  addition,  each  Switzerland-domiciled  company  is  required  to  set  a  net-zero  target  by 1 January 2025. The CI Act also contains provisions for public funding to replace aged heating systems in buildings and for application of innovative technologies within companies. Article 9 of the CI Act requires the financial sector to make an effective contribution to the transition to net zero and sets the general goal of the alignment of financial resources to climate-friendly outcomes. Specific measures to achieve the targets will be proposed in the CO2 Act.\n\nIn December 2023, the Swiss Parliament added a provision on greenwashing to the Unfair Competition Act under which companies are required to make truthful and clear statements in relation to their climate impact that can be substantiated by objective and verifiable bases.\n\nAlso in December 2023, the Swiss Federal Council announced that it intends to further improve climate transparency for financial products and to further develop the voluntary Swiss Climate Scores (the SCS), which were introduced in 2022. The SCS provide investors with information about the extent to which their financial investments are compatible with climate goals. The updated SCS, which will apply from 1 January 2025, will continue to prescribe disclosures by financial institutions  on  climate  alignment  and  climate  change  mitigation  characteristics  of  financial  products  and  will  newly prescribe disclosure of exposures to renewable energy. UBS has committed to the voluntary use of the SCS.\n\nIn October 2023, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC approved guidance on the principles for climaterelated  financial  risk  management.  The  final  principles  describe  how  climate-related  risks  can  be  addressed  in  the management of traditional financial risks. The principles cover six areas: governance; policies, procedures and limits; strategic planning; risk management; data, risk measurement and reporting; and scenario analysis. The guidance applies to our US-based operations. UBS is evaluating the guidance to ensure the principles are addressed by the relevant Group practices.\n\nIn June 2023, the International Sustainability Standards Board (the ISSB) finalized its first set of requirements for corporate disclosures  regarding  sustainability  matters:  IFRS S1  and  IFRS S2.  IFRS S1  addresses  the  disclosure  of  a  company's sustainability-related risks and opportunities. IFRS S2 addresses the disclosures for the governance processes, controls and procedures an entity uses to monitor, manage and oversee climate-related risks and opportunities and the entity's strategy for managing risks and opportunities. The standards incorporate the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the TCFD). These ISSB standards have been available for use from January 2024 onward. UBS's implementation of the standards will depend, among other factors, on whether the standards are adopted in jurisdictions in which UBS files financial reports.\n\nIn October 2023, the EU finalized the first set of cross-sectoral European Sustainability Reporting Standards (the ESRS) under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. In addition to general disclosures and requirements, the ESRS set out disclosure requirements, which are subject to a materiality assessment that is contingent on external assurance, effectively allowing companies to focus on reporting sustainability factors that are material to their businesses. Companies that were previously subject to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and large non-EU listed companies with more than 500 employees, including UBS, are required to begin reporting under the ESRS for the 2024 financial year, with the first reports to be published in 2025. The European Commission will develop and adopt additional sector-specific reporting standards by June 2026.\n\nIn March 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) released the final rules regarding climate-related disclosures  for  investors.  The  rules  will  require  certain  firms,  including  UBS,  to  disclose  qualitative  and  quantitative information on the firm's exposures to climate-related risks and risk management practices. The rules are anticipated to be effective for filings for the 2025 financial year.",

        "page_content": "## Other developments in Switzerland\n\nIn June 2023, the Swiss electorate voted in favor of the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate of 15% applicable to companies with a consolidated turnover of more than EUR 750m, as stipulated by the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In December 2023, the Swiss Federal Council decided on a partial adoption in Switzerland, by way of an ordinance, and, as a result, a domestic minimum topup  tax  regime  became  effective  from  1 January  2024,  ensuring  a  Swiss  local  minimal  tax  burden  of  at  least  15%. Switzerland will not implement any top-up tax regime in 2024 with respect to non-Swiss taxation below 15%. The Swiss Federal Council will further observe international developments and decide at a later stage if and when any top-up tax with respect to non-Swiss taxation below 15% will be introduced in Switzerland. UBS does not expect the implementation of global minimum taxation in Switzerland to materially impact its effective tax rate.\n\nIn  August  2023,  the  Swiss  Federal  Council  launched  a  consultation  on  a  bill  to  strengthen  the  Swiss  anti-moneylaundering framework, with the aim of reinforcing the integrity and competitiveness of Switzerland as a financial and business location. The measures aim to comply with the international standards of the Financial Action Task Force (the FATF). Among other matters, key elements of the proposal include the introduction of a non-public register managed by the Federal Department of Justice and Police containing information about the beneficial owners of companies and other legal  entities  in  Switzerland,  as  well  as  due  diligence  requirements  for  activities  with  an  increased  risk  of  money laundering. In the context of the Swiss anti-money-laundering framework, the FATF also acknowledged in October 2023 the progress made by Switzerland, especially with the revision of the Anti-Money Laundering Act adopted in March 2021.\n\nIn November 2023, the Swiss Federal Council adopted an amendment to the Financial Market Infrastructure Act that enacts a measure aimed at protecting the Swiss stock exchange infrastructure into Swiss law with effect from 1 January 2024. This ruling followed the EU's decision to withdraw equivalence for the Swiss stock exchange regulation in 2019. The protective measure enables EU firms to trade Swiss shares on the Swiss trading venues, even without EU equivalence. In the event of equivalence recognition by the EU, the measure may be deactivated at any time.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Swiss Federal Council implemented the remaining measures of the 9th and 10th sanctions packages imposed by the EU against Russia in December 2022 and February 2023, respectively. The measures include additional export restrictions and more detailed reporting obligations with regard to frozen assets.\n\nIn August 2023, the Swiss Federal Council adopted the EU's 11th package of sanctions against Russia, which was partially adopted by Switzerland in June 2023 by expanding the sanction lists. As part of the 11th sanctions package, the EU has created a specific legal basis for an instrument to prevent the evasion of sanctions. The Swiss Federal Council emphasized its determination to take effective action against the evasion of sanctions and will examine the implementation of this instrument in the event of its actual application by the EU. In addition, Switzerland joined the EU in imposing sanctions at Moldova's request and against Belarus, in view of its continued involvement in Russia's ongoing military aggression against Ukraine.\n\nIn September 2023, the Swiss Federal Council issued sanctions measures in connection with the delivery of Iranian drones to Russia. The sale, supply, export and transit of components used in the construction and production of drones is now prohibited. In January 2024, the Swiss Federal Council adopted the measures of the EU's 12th sanctions package relevant to Switzerland, following the expansion of the sanction lists by Switzerland in December 2023. The measures include import bans on certain goods that generate significant revenue for Russia, as well as certain bans in the financial and services  sectors.  In  February  2024,  the  Federal  Department  of  Economic  Affairs,  Education  and  Research  adopted measures of the EU's 13th sanctions package, which target, among others, individuals, entities and organizations that are  operating  in  Russia's  military-industrial  complex  and  that  are  involved  in  supplying  defense  equipment  from  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as officials from the occupied territories of Ukraine.\n\nUBS's sanctions programs are designed to comply with sanctions across multiple jurisdictions, including those imposed by the United Nations, Switzerland, the EU, the UK and the US.\n\nThe revised Swiss Federal Data Protection Act and the corresponding Data Protection Ordinance entered into force on 1 September 2023. The revised law represents a fundamental reform that strengthens the rights of consumers regarding their data by enhancing the transparency and accountability rules for companies processing data, among other measures. In addition, it seeks to align Swiss data protection law with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, in order to ensure continued cross-border transmission of data with EU Member States.\n\n## Other developments in the US\n\nIn October 2023, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC adopted revisions to their regulations implementing the Community Reinvestment Act (the CRA). The CRA encourages banks to meet the credit needs of the communities in which they do business, with a focus on low- and moderate-income communities. The final rule will implement separate evaluations  for  retail  lending,  retail  services  and  products,  community  development  financing,  and  community development services for banks with over USD 2bn in total assets. For large banks with over USD 10bn in total assets, the evaluation of retail services and products will cover digital delivery systems. The final rule also updates requirements on the reporting of exposures. The rule has an implementation date of 1 April 2024, with additional phase-in periods for general provisions and reporting that extend out to April 2027. UBS Bank USA expects a modest level of increased monitoring and reporting requirements.",

        "page_content": "In  October  2022,  the  SEC  adopted  rules  requiring  US  national  securities  exchanges,  including  the  New  York  Stock Exchange (the NYSE) and Nasdaq, to adopt listing standards that require issuers to adopt and enforce a policy to recover from executive officers incentive compensation received based on attainment of a financial reporting measure in the event that the issuer is required to prepare an accounting restatement of financial statements due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. The SEC approved the listing standards promulgated by the NYSE and Nasdaq in June 2023 and the clawback policy requirement came into effect as of 1 December 2023. Under the listing standards, an issuer must recover the amount of incentive-based compensation that would not have been received if it had been determined based on the restated financial information. UBS Group AG, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG each have securities listed on US national securities exchanges and have adopted a policy to comply with the listing standards.\n\nIn  September  2023,  the  new  rules  from  the  SEC  to  enhance  and  standardize  disclosure  requirements  related  to cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance became effective. Among other changes, the rules require foreign private issuers, including UBS Group AG, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG, to annually report material information regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance on Form 20-F. The Form 20-F disclosures are applicable with annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after 15 December 2023.\n\n## Other developments in Europe\n\nUS securities markets will transition to one business day after the trade date (T+1) settlement of most transactions in May 2024. In October 2023, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) launched a call for evidence on shortening the standard settlement cycle for securities transactions from two business days after the trade date (T+2) to T+1. ESMA aims to perform an assessment of the costs and benefits linked to the potential reduction of the securities settlement cycle in the EU and intends to submit the results of its assessment to the European Commission and publish a final report in the fourth quarter of 2024, at the latest. The UK Treasury has also established an Accelerated Settlement Taskforce to consider whether the UK should follow the US and transition to a T+1 settlement. The UK task force is expected to publish  its  findings  in  2024,  with  further  work  expected  during  2024.  UBS  is  implementing  and  testing  required enhancements based on the US rules and will prepare for further implementation according to the evolving rules and market practice in the UK, the EU and Switzerland.\n\nIn May 2023, the European Commission presented draft legislative proposals aimed at empowering retail investors to make investment decisions that are aligned with their needs and preferences and ensuring that they are treated fairly and duly protected. The proposals also aim to encourage greater participation in EU capital markets and to enable a greater volume of funds to flow more easily into EU capital markets. The package revises EU capital markets rules, which, once agreed and in force, could have significant implications and require significant implementation efforts by UBS across business divisions.\n\nIn  June  2023,  legislators  in  the  EU  reached  a  provisional  agreement  on  amendments  to  the  Capital  Requirements Regulation and the Capital Requirements Directive. The provisional agreement includes, alongside measures to implement the remaining elements of the Basel III standard, a framework that would require non-EU firms to establish a physical presence within the EU when providing certain banking services to EU-domiciled clients and counterparties (including deposit-taking and commercial lending), unless they are subject to an exemption. The changes will affect the cross-border provision of certain banking services and will require UBS to adapt its approaches to providing such services to clients in the EU. The requirement is expected to become effective in late 2026, with grandfathering provisions for contracts already in existence at the date of introduction.\n\nIn December 2023, the Swiss Confederation and the UK signed a mutual recognition agreement (an MRA) for financial services  to  facilitate  cross-border  financial  activities.  The  MRA  is  supplemented  by  measures  to  enhance  supervisory cooperation and coordination. The MRA envisages a memorandum of understanding between FINMA and the Bank of England on resolution arrangements, and it is expected to enable Swiss banks to provide cross-border investment services to high net worth UK-domiciled clients and to broadly allow UK and Swiss over-the-counter derivatives counterparties to choose whether to rely on Swiss or UK risk mitigation rules (except for physically settled foreign exchange swaps and forwards). The agreement is expected to apply from 2026, depending on the completion of parliamentary approval in both countries.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors\n\nCertain risks, including those described below, may affect our ability to execute our strategy or our business activities, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We are inherently exposed to multiple risks, many of which may become apparent only with the benefit of hindsight. As a result, risks that we do not consider to be material, or of which we are not currently aware, could also adversely affect us. Within each category, the risks that we consider to be most material are presented first.\n\n## Strategy, management and operational risks\n\nUBS's acquisition of Credit Suisse Group AG exposes us to heightened litigation risk and regulatory scrutiny and entails significant additional costs, liabilities and business integration risks that affect UBS AG\n\nUBS acquired Credit Suisse Group AG under exceptional circumstances of volatile financial markets and the continued outflows and deteriorating overall financial position of Credit Suisse, in order to avert a failure of Credit Suisse and thus damage to the Swiss financial center and to global financial stability. The acquisition was effected through a merger of Credit Suisse Group AG with and into UBS Group AG, with UBS Group AG succeeding to all assets and all liabilities of Credit Suisse Group AG, becoming the direct or indirect shareholder of the former Credit Suisse Group AG's direct and indirect subsidiaries. Therefore, on a consolidated basis, all assets, risks and liabilities of the Credit Suisse Group became a part of UBS. This includes all ongoing and future litigation, regulatory and similar matters arising out of the business of the Credit Suisse Group, thereby materially increasing UBS's exposure to litigation and investigation risks, as described in further detail below.\n\nWe have incurred substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the transaction and will continue to incur substantial integration and restructuring costs. In addition, we may not realize all of the expected cost reductions and other benefits of the transaction. We may not be able to successfully execute our strategic plans or to achieve the expected benefits of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. The success of the transaction, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on the ability to successfully integrate the operations of both firms rapidly and effectively, while maintaining stability of operations and high levels of service to customers of the combined franchise.\n\nOur ability to successfully integrate Credit Suisse will depend on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including our ability to:\n\n- - combine the operations of the two firms in a manner that preserves client service, simplifies infrastructure and results in operating cost savings;\n- - reverse outflows of deposits and client invested assets at Credit Suisse, particularly in its Wealth Management and Switzerland and to attract additional deposits and other client assets to the combined firm;\n- - achieve cost reductions at the levels and in the timeframe we plan;\n- - enhance, integrate, and, where necessary, remediate risk management and financial control and other systems and frameworks, including to remediate the material weakness in Credit Suisse's internal controls over financial reporting;\n- - simplify the legal structure of the combined firm in an expedited manner, through the planned mergers of UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG and of UBS Switzerland AG and Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG, as well as the creation of a single intermediate holding company (IHC) for the combined firm in the U.S., other entity mergers and consolidations and asset dispositions, including obtaining regulatory approvals and licenses required to implement such changes;\n- - retain staff and to reverse attrition of staff in certain of Credit Suisse's business areas;\n- - successfully execute the wind-down of the assets and liabilities in its Non-core and Legacy division and release capital and resources for other purposes; and\n- - resolve outstanding litigation, regulatory and similar matters, including matters relating to Credit Suisse, on terms that are  not  significantly  adverse  to  the  UBS  Group,  as  well  as  to  successfully  remediate  outstanding  regulatory  and supervisory matters and meet other regulatory commitments.\n\nFurther investigation and planning for integration is taking place, and risks that we do not currently consider to be material, or of which we are not currently aware, could also adversely affect us.\n\nThe  level  of  success  in  the  absorption  of  Credit  Suisse,  in  the  integration  of  the  two  groups  and  their  businesses, particularly in the area of the Swiss domestic bank, as well as domestic and international wealth management business, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reduction and divestment of any non-core assets, and the level of resulting impairments and write-downs, may impact the operational results, share price and the credit rating of UBS entities. The past financial performance of each of UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse may not be indicative of their future financial performance. The combined group will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and support functions. The diversion of management's attention and any delays  or  difficulties  encountered  in  connection  with  the  transaction  and  the  coordination  of  the  two  companies' operations could have an adverse effect on the business, financial results, financial condition or the share price of the combined  group  following  the  transaction.  The  coordination  process  may  also  result  in  additional  and  unforeseen expenses.",

        "page_content": "## Our reputation is critical to our success\n\nOur reputation is critical to the success of our strategic plans, business and prospects. Reputational damage is difficult to reverse, and improvements tend to be slow and difficult to measure. In the past, our reputation has been adversely affected by our losses during the financial crisis, investigations into our cross-border private banking services, criminal resolutions of LIBOR-related and foreign exchange matters, as well as other matters. We believe that reputational damage as a result of these events was an important factor in our loss of clients and client assets across our asset-gathering businesses. The Credit Suisse Group has more recently been subject to significant litigation and regulatory matters and to financial losses that adversely affected its reputation and the confidence of clients, which played a significant role in the failure of the Credit Suisse Group in March 2023. These events, or new events that cause reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition, as well as our ability to achieve our strategic goals and financial targets.\n\n## Operational risks affect our business\n\nOur businesses depend on our ability to process a large number of transactions, many of which are complex, across multiple and diverse markets in different currencies, to comply with requirements of many different legal and regulatory regimes to which we are subject and to prevent, or promptly detect and stop, unauthorized, fictitious or fraudulent transactions. We also rely on access to, and on the functioning of, systems maintained by third parties, including clearing systems, exchanges, information processors and central counterparties. Any failure of our or third-party systems could have an adverse effect on us. These risks may be greater as we deploy newer technologies, such as blockchain, or processes, platforms or products that rely on these technologies. Our operational risk management and control systems and processes are designed to help ensure that the risks associated with our activities - including those arising from process error, failed execution, misconduct, unauthorized trading, fraud, system failures, financial crime, cyberattacks, breaches of information security, inadequate or ineffective access controls and failure of security and physical protection - are appropriately controlled. If our internal controls fail or prove ineffective in identifying and remedying these risks, we could suffer operational failures that might result in material losses, such as the substantial loss we incurred from the unauthorized trading incident announced in September 2011. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group may elevate these risks,  particularly  during  the  first  phases  of  integration,  as  the  firms  have  historically  operated  under  different procedures, IT systems, risk policies and structures of governance.\n\nAs a significant proportion of our staff have been and will continue working from outside the office, we have faced, and will  continue  to  face,  new  challenges  and  operational  risks,  including  maintenance  of  supervisory  and  surveillance controls, as well as increased fraud and data security risks. While we have taken measures to manage these risks, these measures could prove not to be effective.\n\nWe use automation as part of our efforts to improve efficiency, reduce the risk of error and improve our client experience. We intend to expand the use of robotic processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence to further these goals. Use of these tools presents their own risks, including the need for effective design and testing; the quality of the data used  for  development  and  operation  of  machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence  tools  may  adversely  affect  their functioning and result in errors and other operational risks.\n\nFinancial services firms have increasingly been subject to breaches of security and to cyber- and other forms of attack, some of which are sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to gain access to confidential information or systems, disrupt service or steal or destroy data, which may result in business disruption or the corruption or loss of data at UBS's locations or those of third parties. Cyberattacks by hackers, terrorists, criminal organizations, nation states and extremists have also  increased  in  frequency  and  sophistication.  Current  geopolitical  tensions  have  also  led  to  increased  risk  of cyberattack from foreign state actors. In particular, the Russia-Ukraine war and the imposition of significant sanctions on Russia by Switzerland, the US, the EU, the UK and others has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in the risk of cyberattacks. Such attacks may occur on our own systems or on the systems that are operated by external service providers, may be attempted through the introduction of ransomware, viruses or malware, phishing and other forms of social engineering, distributed denial of service attacks and other means. These attempts may occur directly, or using equipment or security passwords of our employees, third-party service providers or other users. Cybersecurity risks also have increased due to the widespread use of digital technologies, cloud computing and mobile devices to conduct financial business and transactions, as well as due to generative AI, which increases the capabilities of adversaries to mount  sophisticated  phishing  attacks,  for  example,  through  the  use  of  deepfake  technologies,  and  presents  new challenges to the protection of our systems and networks and the confidentiality and integrity of our data. During the first quarter of 2023, a third-party vendor, ION XTP, suffered a ransomware attack, which resulted in some disruption to our exchange-traded derivatives clearing activities, although we restored our services within 36 hours, using an available alternative solution. In addition to external attacks, we have experienced loss of client data from failure by employees and others to follow internal policies and procedures and from misappropriation of our data by employees and others.",

        "page_content": "We may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or data and our preventative measures may not  be  effective  to  prevent  an  attack  or  a  security  breach.  In  the  event  of  a  security  breach,  notwithstanding  our preventative measures, we may not immediately detect a particular breach or attack. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group may elevate and intensify these risks as would-be attackers have a larger potential target in the combined bank and  differences  in  systems,  policies,  and  platforms  could  make  threat  detection  more  difficult.  In  addition,  the implementation of the large-scale technological change program that is necessary to integrate the combined bank's systems at pace may also result in increased risks. Once a particular attack is detected, time may be required to investigate and assess the nature and extent of the attack, and to restore and test systems and data. If a successful attack occurs at a service provider, as we have recently experienced, we may be dependent on the service provider's ability to detect the attack, investigate and assess the attack and successfully restore the relevant systems and data. A successful breach or circumvention of security of our or a service provider's systems or data could have significant negative consequences for us, including disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information concerning us or our clients, damage to our systems, financial losses for us or our clients, violations of data privacy and similar laws, litigation exposure and damage to our reputation. We may be subject to enforcement actions as regulatory focus on cybersecurity increases and regulators have announced new rules, guidance and initiatives on ransomware and other cybersecurity-related issues.\n\nWe are subject to complex and frequently changing laws and regulations governing the protection of client and personal data, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Ensuring that we comply with applicable laws and regulations when we collect, use and transfer personal information requires substantial resources and may affect the ways in which we conduct our business. In the event that we fail to comply with applicable laws, we may be exposed to regulatory fines and penalties and other sanctions. We may also incur such penalties if our vendors or other service providers or clients or counterparties fail to comply with these laws or to maintain appropriate controls over protected data. In addition, any loss or exposure of client or other data may adversely damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.\n\nA major focus of US and other countries' governmental policies relating to financial institutions in recent years has been on fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. We are required to maintain effective policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing, and to verify the identity of our clients under the laws of many of the countries in which we operate. We are also subject to laws and regulations related to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials by others, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with such laws and regulations. Notwithstanding this, US regulators have found deficiencies in the design and operation of anti-money laundering  programs  in  our  US  operations.  We  have  undertaken  a  significant  program  to  address  these  regulatory findings with the objective of fully meeting regulatory expectations for our programs. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering, terrorist financing or corruption, or any failure of our programs in these areas, could have serious consequences both from legal enforcement action and from damage to our reputation. Frequent changes in sanctions imposed and increasingly complex sanctions imposed on countries, entities and individuals, as exemplified by the breadth and scope of the sanctions imposed in relation to the war in Ukraine, increase our cost of monitoring and complying with sanctions requirements and increase the risk that we will not identify in a timely manner client activity that is subject to a sanction.\n\nAs a result of new and changed regulatory requirements and the changes we have made in our legal structure, the volume, frequency and complexity of our regulatory and other reporting has remained elevated. Regulators have also significantly  increased  expectations  regarding  our  internal  reporting  and  data  aggregation,  as  well  as  management reporting.  We  have  incurred,  and  continue  to  incur,  significant  costs  to  implement  infrastructure  to  meet  these requirements. Failure  to  meet  external  reporting  requirements  accurately  and  in  a  timely  manner  or  failure  to  meet regulatory expectations of internal reporting, data aggregation and management reporting could result in enforcement action or other adverse consequences for us.\n\nIn addition, despite the contingency plans that we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we operate. This may include  a  disruption  due  to  natural  disasters,  pandemics,  civil  unrest,  war  or  terrorism  and  involve  electrical, communications, transportation or other services that we use or that are used by third parties with whom we conduct business.\n\n## We depend on our risk management and control processes to avoid or limit potential losses in our businesses\n\nControlled risk-taking is a major part of the business of a financial services firm. Some losses from risk-taking activities are inevitable, but to be successful over time, we must balance the risks we take against the returns generated. Therefore, we must diligently identify, assess, manage and control our risks, not only in normal market conditions but also as they might develop under more extreme, stressed conditions, when concentrations of exposures can lead to severe losses.\n\nWe have not always been able to prevent serious losses arising from risk management failures and extreme or sudden market  events.  We  recorded  substantial  losses  on  fixed-income  trading  positions  in  the  2008  financial  crisis,  in  the unauthorized trading incident in 2011 and, more recently, positions resulting from the default of a US prime brokerage client. In the recent past, the Credit Suisse Group has suffered very significant losses from the default of the US prime brokerage client, the losses in supply-chain finance funds managed by it, as well as other matters. As a result of these, Credit Suisse is subject to significant regulatory remediation obligations to address deficiencies in its risk management and controls systems, that continue following the merger.",

        "page_content": "We  regularly  revise  and  strengthen  our  risk  management  and  control  frameworks  to  seek  to  address  identified shortcomings. Nonetheless, we could suffer further losses in the future if, for example:\n\n- - we do not fully identify the risks in our portfolio, in particular risk concentrations and correlated risks;\n- - our  assessment  of  the  risks  identified,  or  our  response  to  negative  trends,  proves  to  be  untimely,  inadequate, insufficient or incorrect;\n- - our risk models prove insufficient to predict the scale of financial risks the bank faces;\n- - markets move in ways that we do not expect - in terms of their speed, direction, severity or correlation - and our ability to manage risks in the resulting environment is, therefore, affected;\n- - third parties to whom we have credit exposure or whose securities we hold are severely affected by events and we suffer defaults and impairments beyond the level implied by our risk assessment; or\n- - collateral or other security provided by our counterparties and clients proves inadequate to cover their obligations at the time of default.\n\nWe also hold legacy risk positions, primarily in Non-core and Legacy, that, in many cases, are illiquid and may deteriorate in value. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, and the planned integration of UBS AG with Credit Suisse AG, is increasing,  materially,  the  portfolio  of  business  that  are  outside  of  our  risk  appetite  and  subject  to  exit  that  will  be managed in the Non-core and Legacy segment.\n\nWe also manage risk on behalf of our clients. The performance of assets we hold for our clients may be adversely affected by the same aforementioned factors. If clients suffer losses or the performance of their assets held with us is not in line with relevant benchmarks against which clients assess investment performance, we may suffer reduced fee income and a decline in assets under management, or withdrawal of mandates.\n\nInvestment positions, such as equity investments made as part of strategic initiatives and seed investments made at the inception of funds that we manage, may also be affected by market risk factors. These investments are often not liquid and generally are intended or required to be held beyond a normal trading horizon. Deteriorations in the fair value of these positions would have a negative effect on our earnings.\n\n## We may be unable to identify or capture revenue or competitive opportunities, or retain and attract qualified employees\n\nThe financial services industry is characterized by intense competition, continuous innovation, restrictive, detailed, and sometimes fragmented regulation and ongoing consolidation. We face competition at the level of local markets and individual business lines, and from global financial institutions that are comparable to us in their size and breadth, as well as competition from new technology-based market entrants, which may not be subject to the same level of regulation. Barriers to entry in individual markets and pricing levels are being eroded by new technology. We expect these trends to continue and competition to increase. Our competitive strength and market position could be eroded if we are unable to  identify  market  trends  and  developments,  do  not  respond  to  such  trends  and  developments  by  devising  and implementing adequate business strategies, do not adequately develop or update our technology, including our digital channels and tools, or are unable to attract or retain the qualified people needed.\n\nThe  amount  and  structure  of  our  employee  compensation  is  affected  not  only  by  our  business  results,  but  also  by competitive factors and regulatory considerations.\n\nIn response to the demands of various stakeholders, including regulatory authorities and shareholders, and in order to better  align  the  interests  of  our  staff  with  other  stakeholders,  we  have  increased  average  deferral  periods  for  stock awards, expanded forfeiture provisions and, to a more limited extent, introduced clawback provisions for certain awards linked to business performance. We have also introduced individual caps on the proportion of fixed to variable pay for the Executive Board (EB) members, as well as certain other employees. We will also be required to introduce and enforce provisions  requiring  UBS  to  recover  from  EB  members  and  certain  other  executives  a  portion  of  performance-based incentive compensation in the event that UBS Group or another entity with securities listed on a US national securities exchange, is required to restate its financial statements as a result of a material error.\n\nConstraints on the amount or structure of employee compensation, higher levels of deferral, performance conditions and other circumstances triggering the forfeiture of unvested awards may adversely affect our ability to retain and attract key employees, particularly where we compete with companies that are not subject to these constraints. The loss of key staff and the inability to attract qualified replacements could seriously compromise our ability to execute our strategy and to successfully improve our operating and control environment, and could affect our business performance. This risk is intensified by elevated levels of attrition among Credit Suisse employees. Swiss law requires that shareholders approve the compensation of the UBS Group AG Board of Directors (the Group Board) and the UBS Group AG Group Executive Board (GEB) each year. If UBS Group AG's shareholders fail to approve the compensation for the GEB or the Group Board, this could have an adverse effect on our ability to retain experienced directors and our senior management.",

        "page_content": "Our operating results, financial condition and ability to pay our obligations in the future may be affected by funding, dividends and other distributions received directly or indirectly from its subsidiaries, which may be subject to restrictions\n\nUBS AG's ability to pay its obligations in the future will depend on the level of funding, dividends and other distributions, if  any,  received  from  UBS  Switzerland  AG  and  other  subsidiaries.  The  ability  of  such  subsidiaries  to  make  loans  or distributions, directly or indirectly, to UBS AG may be restricted as a result of several factors, including restrictions in financing agreements and the requirements of applicable law and regulatory, fiscal or other restrictions. In particular, UBS AG's direct and indirect subsidiaries, including UBS Switzerland AG, UBS Americas Holding LLC and UBS Europe SE, are subject to laws and regulations require the entities to maintain minimum levels of capital and liquidity, that restrict dividend payments, authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to UBS AG, or could affect their ability to repay any loans made to, or other investments in, such subsidiary by UBS AG or another member of the Group. For example, in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Central Bank ordered all banks under its supervision to cease dividend distributions and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System limited capital distributions by bank holding companies and intermediate holding companies. Restrictions and regulatory actions could impede access to funds that UBS AG may need to meet its obligations. In addition, UBS AG's right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to all prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.\n\nFurthermore, UBS AG may guarantee some of the payment obligations of certain of the Group's subsidiaries from time to time. These guarantees may require UBS AG to provide substantial funds or assets to subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when UBS AG is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations.\n\n## Market, credit and macroeconomic risks\n\n## Performance in the financial services industry is affected by market conditions and the macroeconomic climate\n\nOur  businesses  are  materially  affected  by  market  and  macroeconomic  conditions.  A  market  downturn  and  weak macroeconomic conditions can be precipitated by a number of factors, including geopolitical events, such as international armed conflicts, war, or acts of terrorism, the imposition of sanctions, global trade or global supply chain disruptions, including  energy  shortages  and  food  insecurity,  changes  in  monetary  or  fiscal  policy,  changes  in  trade  policies  or international trade disputes, significant inflationary or deflationary price changes, disruptions in one or more concentrated economic  sectors,  natural  disasters,  pandemics  or  local  and  regional  civil  unrest.  Such  developments  can  have unpredictable and destabilizing effects.\n\nAdverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, securities prices, market volatility and liquidity, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and other market fluctuations, as well as changes in investor sentiment, can affect our earnings and ultimately our financial and capital positions. As financial markets are global and highly interconnected, local and regional events can have widespread effects well beyond the countries in which they occur. Any of these developments may adversely affect our business or financial results.\n\nAs a result of significant volatility in the market, our businesses may experience a decrease in client activity levels and market  volumes,  which  would  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  generate  transaction  fees,  commissions  and  margins, particularly in Global Wealth Management and the Investment Bank. A market downturn would likely reduce the volume and valuation of assets that we manage on behalf of clients, which would reduce recurring fee income that is charged based on invested assets, primarily in Global Wealth Management and Asset Management, and performance-based fees in Asset Management. Such a downturn could also cause a decline in the value of assets that we own and account for as investments or trading positions. In addition, reduced market liquidity or volatility may limit trading opportunities and therefore may reduce transaction-based income and may also impede our ability to manage risks.\n\nHealth emergencies, including pandemics and measures taken by governmental authorities to manage them, may have effects such as labor market displacements, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary pressures, and adversely affect global and regional economic conditions, resulting in contraction in the global economy, substantial volatility in the financial markets, crises in markets for goods and services, disruptions in real estate markets, increased unemployment, increased  credit  and  counterparty  risk,  and  operational  challenges,  as  we  saw  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Such economic or market disruptions, including inflationary pressures, may lead to reduced levels of client activity and demand for  our  products  and  services,  increased  utilization  of  lending  commitments,  significantly  increased  client  defaults, continued and increasing credit and valuation losses in our loan portfolios, loan commitments and other assets, and impairments of other financial assets. A fall in equity markets and a consequent decline in invested assets would also reduce recurring fee income in our Global Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses, as UBS experienced in the second quarter of 2022. These factors and other consequences of a health emergency may negatively affect our financial condition, including possible constraints on capital and liquidity, as well as a higher cost of capital, and possible downgrades to our credit ratings.",

        "page_content": "Geopolitical events: Terrorist activity and escalating armed conflict in the Middle East, as well as the continuing RussiaUkraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth.  In  addition,  the  ongoing  conflicts  may  continue  to  cause  significant  population  displacement,  and  lead  to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed  conflict.  Governmental  responses  to  the  armed  conflicts,  including,  with  respect  to  the  Russia/Ukraine  war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. If individual countries impose restrictions on cross-border payments or trade, or other exchange or capital controls, or change their currency (for example, if one or more countries should leave the Eurozone, as a result of the imposition of sanctions on individuals, entities or countries, or escalation of trade restrictions and other actions between the US, or other countries, and China), we could suffer adverse effects on our business, losses from enforced default by counterparties, be unable to access our own assets or be unable to effectively manage our risks.\n\nWe could be materially affected if a crisis develops, regionally or globally, as a result of disruptions in markets due to macroeconomic or political developments, trade restrictions, or the failure of a major market participant. Over time, our strategic plans have become more heavily dependent on our ability to generate growth and revenue in emerging markets, including China, causing us to be more exposed to the risks associated with such markets.\n\nGlobal Wealth Management derives revenues from all the principal regions, but has a greater concentration in Asia than many peers and a substantial presence in the US, unlike many European peers. The Investment Bank's business is more heavily weighted to Europe and Asia than our peers, while its derivatives business is more heavily weighted to structured products for  wealth  management clients, in  particular  with  European  and  Asian  underlyings.  Our  performance  may therefore be more affected by political, economic and market developments in these regions and businesses than some other financial service providers.\n\nThe extent to which ongoing conflicts, current inflationary pressures and related adverse economic conditions affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, including the effects of the current conditions on our clients, counterparties, employees and third-party service providers.\n\n## Our credit risk exposure to clients, trading counterparties and other financial institutions would increase under adverse or other economic conditions\n\nCredit risk is an integral part of many of our activities, including lending, underwriting and derivatives activities. Adverse economic or market conditions, or the imposition of sanctions or other restrictions on clients, counterparties or financial institutions, may lead to impairments and defaults on these credit exposures. Losses may be exacerbated by declines in the value of collateral securing loans and other exposures. In our prime brokerage, securities finance and Lombard lending businesses, we extend substantial amounts of credit against securities collateral, the value or liquidity of which may decline rapidly. Market closures and the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other measures may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or to realize on collateral, which may result in unexpected increases in exposures. Our Swiss mortgage and corporate lending portfolios are a large part of our overall lending. We are therefore exposed to the risk of adverse economic developments in Switzerland, including property valuations in the housing market, the strength of the Swiss franc and its effect on Swiss exports, return to negative interest rates applied by the Swiss National Bank, economic conditions within the Eurozone or the EU, and the evolution of agreements between Switzerland and the EU or EEA, which represent Switzerland's largest export market. We have exposures related to real estate in various countries, including a substantial Swiss mortgage portfolio. Although we believe this portfolio is prudently managed, we could nevertheless be exposed to losses if a substantial deterioration in the Swiss real estate market were to occur.\n\nAs we experienced in 2020, under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9 expected credit loss (ECL) regime, credit loss expenses may increase rapidly at the onset of an economic downturn as a result of higher levels of credit  impairments  (stage 3),  as  well  as  higher  ECL  from  stages 1  and  2.  Substantial  increases  in  ECL  could  exceed expected loss for regulatory capital purposes and adversely affect our common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and regulatory capital ratios.\n\n## Interest rate trends and changes could negatively affect our financial results\n\nUBS's businesses are sensitive to changes in interest rate trends. A prolonged period of low or negative interest rates, particularly in Switzerland and the Eurozone, adversely affected the net interest income generated by UBS's Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management businesses prior to 2022. Actions that UBS took to mitigate adverse effects on income, such as the introduction of selective deposit fees or minimum lending rates, contributed to outflows of customer deposits (a key source of funding for UBS), net new money outflows and a declining market share in its Swiss lending business.",

        "page_content": "During 2022, interest rates increased sharply in the US and most other markets, including a shift from negative to positive central bank policy rates in the Eurozone and Switzerland, as central banks responded to higher inflation. Higher interest rates generally benefit UBS's net interest income. However, as returns on alternatives to deposits increase with rising interest rates, such as returns on money market funds, UBS experienced outflows from customer deposits and shifts of deposits from lower-interest account types to accounts bearing higher interest rates, such as savings and certificates of deposit, starting with effects in the US, where rates had rapidly increased. In addition, higher for longer rates, such as those experienced in 2023, have led similar shifts in euro and Swiss Franc deposits. Sustained higher interest rates also may  adversely  affect  our  credit  counterparties.  Customer  deposit  outflows  could  require  UBS  to  obtain  alternative funding, which would likely be more costly than customer deposits.\n\n## Currency fluctuation may have an adverse effect on our profits, balance sheet and regulatory capital\n\nWe are subject to currency fluctuation risks as a substantial portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than our UBS AG presentation currency, the US dollar. In order to hedge our CET1 capital ratio, our CET1 capital must have foreign currency exposure, which leads to currency sensitivity. As a consequence, it is not possible to simultaneously fully hedge both CET1 capital and the CET1 capital ratio. Accordingly, changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our profits, balance sheet, and capital, leverage and liquidity coverage ratios.\n\n## Regulatory and legal risks\n\n## Material legal and regulatory risks arise in the conduct of our business\n\nAs a global financial services firm operating in more than 50 countries, we are subject to many different legal, tax and regulatory regimes, including extensive regulatory oversight, and are exposed to significant liability risk. We are subject to a large number of claims, disputes, legal proceedings and government investigations, and we expect that our ongoing business activities will continue to give rise to such matters in the future. In addition, as noted above, UBS Group inherited claims against Credit Suisse entities as part of the acquisition, including matters that may be material to the operating results of the combined group such as the ongoing supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter. This will affect UBS AG upon the planned merger with Credit Suisse AG. The extent of our financial exposure to these and other matters is material and could substantially exceed the level of provisions that we have established. We are not able to predict the financial and non-financial consequences these matters may have when resolved.\n\nWe may be subject to adverse preliminary determinations or court decisions that may negatively affect public perception and our reputation, result in prudential actions from regulators, and cause us to record additional provisions for such matters even when we believe we have substantial defenses and expect to ultimately achieve a more favorable outcome. This risk is illustrated by the award of aggregate penalties and damages of EUR 4.5bn by the court of first instance in France. This award was reduced to an aggregate of EUR 1.8bn by the Court of Appeal, and in a further appeal, the French Supreme Court referred the case back to the Paris Court of Appeal to reconsider the amount after a new trial.\n\nLitigation, regulatory and similar matters may also result in non-monetary penalties and consequences. Among other things,  a  guilty  plea  to,  or  conviction  of,  a  crime  (including  as  a  result  of  termination  of  the  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement Credit Suisse entered into with the United States Department of Justice in 2021 to resolve its Mozambique matter) could have material consequences for UBS.\n\nResolution of regulatory proceedings has required us to obtain waivers of regulatory disqualifications to maintain certain operations, may entitle regulatory authorities to limit, suspend or terminate licenses and regulatory authorizations, and may permit financial market utilities to limit, suspend or terminate our participation in them. Failure to obtain such waivers, or any limitation, suspension or termination of licenses, authorizations or participations, could have material adverse consequences for us.\n\nOur settlements with governmental authorities in connection with foreign exchange, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) and other benchmark interest rates starkly illustrate the significantly increased level of financial and reputational risk now associated with regulatory matters in major jurisdictions. In connection with investigations related to LIBOR and other benchmark rates and to foreign exchange and precious metals, very large fines and disgorgement amounts were assessed against us, and we were required to enter guilty pleas despite our full cooperation with the authorities in the investigations, and despite our receipt of conditional leniency or conditional immunity from anti-trust authorities in a number of jurisdictions, including the US and Switzerland.\n\nFor a number of years, we have been, and we continue to be, subject to a very high level of regulatory scrutiny and to certain regulatory measures that constrain our strategic flexibility. We believe we have remediated the deficiencies that led to significant losses in the past and made substantial changes in our controls and conduct risk frameworks to address the issues highlighted by the LIBOR-related, foreign exchange and precious metals regulatory resolutions. We have also undertaken extensive efforts to implement new regulatory requirements and meet heightened expectations.\n\nCredit Suisse and UBS have become the target of lawsuits, and may become the target of further litigation, in connection with the merger transaction and/or the regulatory and other actions taken in connection with the merger transaction, all of which could result in substantial costs.\n\nWe continue to be in active dialogue with regulators concerning the actions we are taking to improve our operational risk management, risk control, anti-money laundering, data management and other frameworks, and otherwise seek to meet supervisory expectations, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will have the desired effects. As a result of this history, our level of risk with respect to regulatory enforcement may be greater than that of some of our peers.",

        "page_content": "## Substantial changes in regulation may adversely affect our businesses and our ability to execute our strategic plans\n\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, we have been subject to significant regulatory requirements, including recovery and resolution planning, changes in capital and prudential standards, changes in taxation regimes as a result of changes in governmental administrations, new and revised market standards and fiduciary duties, as well as new and developing environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and requirements. Notwithstanding attempts by regulators to align  their efforts,  the measures  adopted or proposed for banking regulation  differ significantly across the major jurisdictions, making it increasingly difficult to manage a global institution. Regulatory reviews of the events leading to the failures of US banks and the acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS Group in 2023, as well as regulatory measures to complete the implementation of the Basel 3 standards, may increase capital, liquidity and other requirements applicable to banks, including UBS AG. In addition, Swiss regulatory changes with regard to such matters as capital and liquidity have often proceeded more quickly than those in other major jurisdictions, and Switzerland's requirements for major international banks are among the strictest of the major financial centers. This could put Swiss banks, such as UBS AG, at a disadvantage when competing with peer financial institutions subject to more lenient regulation or with unregulated non-bank competitors.\n\nOur  implementation of  additional regulatory  requirements and changes  in supervisory standards, as  well  as our compliance with existing laws and regulations, continue to receive heightened scrutiny from supervisors. If we do not meet supervisory expectations in relation to these or other matters, or if additional supervisory or regulatory issues arise, we would likely be subject to further regulatory scrutiny, as well as measures that may further constrain our strategic flexibility.\n\nResolvability and resolution and recovery planning: We have moved significant operations into subsidiaries to improve resolvability and meet other regulatory requirements, and this has resulted in substantial implementation costs, increased our  capital  and  funding costs and  reduced  operational flexibility.  For example,  we  have  transferred  all  of  our  US subsidiaries under a  US  intermediate  holding company  to  meet  US  regulatory requirements,  and  have  transferred substantially all the operations of Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management booked in Switzerland to UBS Switzerland AG to improve resolvability.\n\nThese changes create operational, capital, liquidity, funding and tax inefficiencies. Our operations in subsidiaries are subject to local capital, liquidity, stable funding, capital planning and stress testing requirements. These requirements have resulted in increased capital and liquidity requirements in affected subsidiaries, which limit our operational flexibility and negatively affect our ability to benefit from synergies between business units and to distribute earnings to the Group.\n\nUnder the Swiss too-big-to-fail (TBTF) framework, we are required to put in place viable emergency plans to preserve the operation of systemically important functions in the event of a failure. Moreover, under this framework and similar regulations in the US, the UK, the EU and other jurisdictions in which we operate, we are required to prepare credible recovery and resolution plans detailing the measures that would be taken to recover in a significant adverse event or in the event of winding down the Group or the operations in a host country through resolution or insolvency proceedings. If a recovery or resolution plan that we produce is determined by the relevant authority to be inadequate or not credible, relevant regulation may permit the authority to place limitations on the scope or size of our business in that jurisdiction, or oblige us to hold higher amounts of capital or liquidity or to change our legal structure or business in order to remove the relevant impediments to resolution.\n\nThe authorities in Switzerland and internationally are working on lessons learned from the Credit Suisse Group and the US  regional  bank  failures,  which  might  result  in  additional  requirements  regarding  resolution  planning  and  early intervention  tools  for  authorities.\n\nCapital and prudential standards: As an internationally active Swiss systemically relevant bank (an SRB), we are subject to  capital  and  total  loss-absorbing  capacity  (TLAC)  requirements  that  are  among  the  most  stringent  in  the  world. Moreover, many of our subsidiaries must comply with minimum capital, liquidity and similar requirements and, as a result,  UBS  Group  AG  and  UBS  AG  have  contributed  a  significant  portion  of  their  capital  and  provide  substantial liquidity to these subsidiaries. These funds are available to meet funding and collateral needs in the relevant entities, but are generally not readily available for use by the Group as a whole.\n\nWe expect  our  risk-weighted  assets  (RWA)  to  further  increase  as  the  effective  date  for  additional  capital  standards promulgated  by  the  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  (the  BCBS)  draws  nearer.  In  connection  with  the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, FINMA has permitted Credit Suisse entities to continue to apply certain prior interpretations and has provided supervisory rulings on the treatment of certain items for RWA or capital purposes. In general, these interpretations require that UBS phase out the treatment over the next several years. In addition, FINMA has agreed that additional  capital  requirement  applicable  to  Swiss  systemically  relevant  banks,  which  is  based  on market  share  in Switzerland and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), will not increase as a result of acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group before the end of 2025. The phase-out or end of these periods will likely increase our overall capital requirements upon the planned merger with Credit Suisse AG, which increase may be substantial.\n\nIncreases in capital and liquidity standards could significantly curtail our ability to pursue strategic opportunities.",

        "page_content": "Market regulation and fiduciary standards: Our wealth and asset management businesses operate in an environment of increasing regulatory scrutiny and changing standards with respect to fiduciary and other standards of care and the focus on mitigating or eliminating conflicts of interest between a manager or advisor and the client, which require effective implementation across the global systems and processes of investment managers and other industry participants. For example, we have made material changes to our business processes, policies and the terms on which we interact with these clients in order to comply with SEC Regulation Best Interest, which is intended to enhance and clarify the duties of brokers and investment advisers to retail customers, the Volcker Rule, which limits our ability to engage in proprietary trading, as well as changes in European and Swiss market conduct regulation. Future changes in the regulation of our duties to customers may require us to make further changes to our businesses, which would result in additional expense and may adversely affect our business. We may also become subject to other similar regulations substantively limiting the types of activities in which we may engage or the way we conduct our operations.\n\nIn  many instances, we provide services on a cross-border basis, and we are therefore sensitive to barriers restricting market access for third-country firms. In particular, efforts in the EU to harmonize the regime for third-country firms to access the European market may have the effect of creating new barriers that adversely affect our ability to conduct business in these jurisdictions from Switzerland. In addition, a number of jurisdictions are increasingly regulating crossborder activities based on determinations of equivalence of home country regulation, substituted compliance or similar principles of comity. A negative determination with respect to Swiss equivalence could limit our access to the market in those jurisdictions and may negatively influence our ability to act as a global firm. For example, the EU declined to extend its equivalence determination for Swiss exchanges, which lapsed as of 30 June 2019.\n\nUBS AG Group experienced cross-border outflows over a number of years as a result of heightened focus by fiscal authorities on cross-border investment and fiscal amnesty programs, in anticipation of the implementation in Switzerland of the global automatic exchange of tax information, and as a result of the measures UBS AG Group has implemented in response to these changes. Further changes in local tax laws or regulations and their enforcement, additional crossborder tax information exchange regimes, national tax amnesty or enforcement programs or similar actions may affect our clients' ability or willingness to do business with us and could result in additional cross-border outflows.\n\nIf we experience financial difficulties, FINMA has the power to open restructuring or liquidation proceedings or impose protective measures in relation to UBS Group AG, UBS AG or UBS Switzerland AG, and such proceedings or measures may have a material adverse effect on our shareholders and creditors\n\nUnder the Swiss Banking Act, FINMA is able to exercise broad statutory powers with respect to Swiss banks and Swiss parent companies of financial groups, such as UBS Group AG, UBS AG and UBS Switzerland AG, if there is justified concern that the entity is over-indebted, has serious liquidity problems or, after the expiration of any relevant deadline, no  longer  fulfills  capital  adequacy  requirements.  Such  powers  include  ordering  protective  measures,  instituting restructuring  proceedings  (and  exercising  any  Swiss  resolution  powers  in  connection  therewith),  and  instituting liquidation proceedings, all of which may have a material adverse effect on shareholders and creditors or may prevent UBS Group AG, UBS AG or UBS Switzerland AG from paying dividends or making payments on debt obligations.\n\nUBS would have limited ability to challenge any such protective measures, and creditors and shareholders would also have limited ability under Swiss law or in Swiss courts to reject them, seek their suspension, or challenge their imposition, including measures that require or result in the deferment of payments.\n\nIf restructuring proceedings are opened with respect to UBS Group AG, UBS AG or UBS Switzerland AG, the resolution powers that FINMA may exercise include the power to: (i) transfer all or some of the assets, debt and other liabilities, and contracts of the entity subject to proceedings to another entity; (ii) stay for a maximum of two business days (a) the termination of, or the exercise of rights to terminate, netting rights, (b) rights to enforce or dispose of certain types of collateral or (c) rights to transfer claims, liabilities or certain collateral, under contracts to which the entity subject to proceedings is a party; and / or (iii) partially or fully write down the equity capital and regulatory capital instruments and, if such regulatory capital is fully written down, write down or convert into equity the other debt instruments of the entity subject to proceedings. Shareholders and creditors would have no right to reject, or to seek the suspension of, any restructuring  plan  pursuant  to  which  such  resolution  powers  are  exercised.  They  would  have  only  limited  rights  to challenge any decision to exercise resolution powers or to have that decision reviewed by a judicial or administrative process or otherwise.\n\nUpon full or partial write-down of the equity and regulatory capital instruments of the entity subject to restructuring proceedings, the relevant shareholders and creditors would receive no payment in respect of the equity and debt that is written down, the write-down would be permanent, and the investors would likely not, at such time or at any time thereafter, receive any shares or other participation rights, or be entitled to any write-up or any other compensation in the event of a potential subsequent recovery of the debtor. If FINMA orders the conversion of debt of the entity subject to restructuring proceedings into equity, the securities received by the investors may be worth significantly less than the original debt and may have a significantly different risk profile. In addition, creditors receiving equity would be effectively subordinated to all creditors of the restructured entity in the event of a subsequent winding up, liquidation or dissolution of the restructured entity, which would increase the risk that investors would lose all or some of their investment.",

        "page_content": "FINMA has significant discretion in the exercise of its powers in connection with restructuring proceedings. Furthermore, certain categories of debt obligations, such as certain types of deposits, are subject to preferential treatment. As a result, holders of obligations of an entity subject to a Swiss restructuring proceeding may have their obligations written down or converted into equity even though obligations ranking on par with such obligations are not written down or converted.\n\n## Developments in sustainability, climate, environmental and social standards and regulations may affect our business and impact our ability to fully realize our goals\n\nWe have set ambitious goals for ESG matters. These goals include our ambitions for environmental sustainability in our operations, including carbon emissions, in the business we do with clients and in products that we offer. They also include goals or aspirations for diversity in our workforce and supply chain, and support for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. There is substantial uncertainty as to the scope of actions that may be required of us, governments and others to achieve the goals we have set, and many of our goals and objectives are only achievable with a combination of government and private action. National and international standards and expectations, industry and scientific practices, and regulatory taxonomies and disclosure obligations addressing these matters are relatively immature and are rapidly evolving.  In  addition,  there  are  significant  limitations  in  the  data  available  to  measure  our  climate  and  other  goals. Although we have defined and disclosed our goals based on the standards existing at the time of disclosure, there can be no assurance (i) that the various ESG regulatory and disclosure regimes under which we operate will not come into conflict with one another, (ii) that the current standards will not be interpreted differently than our understanding or change in a manner that substantially increases the cost or effort for us to achieve such goals or (iii) that additional data or methods, whether voluntary or required by regulation, may substantially change our calculation of our goals and ambitions. It is possible that such goals may prove to be considerably more difficult or even impossible to achieve. The evolving standards may also require us to substantially change the stated goals and ambitions. If we are not able to achieve the goals we have set, or can only do so at significant expense to our business, we may fail to meet regulatory expectations, incur damage to our reputation or be exposed to an increased risk of litigation or other adverse action.\n\nWhile ESG regulatory regimes and international standards are being developed, including to require consideration of ESG risks in investment decisions, some jurisdictions, notably in the US, have developed rules restricting the consideration of ESG factors in investment and business decisions. Under these anti-ESG rules, companies that are perceived as boycotting or discriminating against certain industries may be restricted from doing business with certain governmental entities. Our businesses  may  be  adversely  affected  if  UBS  is  considered  as  discriminating  against  companies  based  on  ESG considerations, or if further anti-ESG rules are developed or broadened.\n\n## Material weakness of Credit Suisse controls over financial reporting\n\nThe Credit Suisse Group delayed its reporting for the year ending 2022 stating that it had identified material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting as a result of which the Credit Suisse Group management had concluded that, as of 31 December 2022, its internal controls over financial reporting were not effective, and for the same reasons, it reached the same conclusion regarding 31 December 2021. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies  in  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting  such  that  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  a  material misstatement of a registrant's financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. There is a risk that a  material  error  may  not  be  detected  by  UBS  Group  AG's  internal  control  structure  that  could  result  in  a  material misstatement to Credit Suisse's reported financial results, which are consolidated with UBS Group AG's results. Since the acquisition, UBS Group AG has undertaken a review of the processes and systems giving rise to the material weaknesses and the remediation program undertaken. This review is ongoing, and UBS expects to adopt and implement further controls  and  procedures  following  the  completion  of  such  review  and  discussions  with  regulators.  Based  on  this assessment, management believes that, as of 31 December 2023, UBS's internal control over financial reporting was effective.  Management  has  excluded  Credit  Suisse,  which  UBS  Group  AG  acquired  in  2023,  from  the  scope  of  its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, as permitted by SEC guidance for acquired businesses. This may affect the UBS AG Group upon the planned merger with Credit Suisse AG.\n\n## Our financial results may be negatively affected by changes to assumptions and valuations, as well as changes to accounting standards\n\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The application of these accounting standards requires the use of judgment based on estimates and assumptions that may involve significant uncertainty at the time they are made. This is the case, for example, with respect to the measurement of fair value of financial instruments, the recognition of deferred tax assets (DTAs), the assessment of the impairment of goodwill, expected credit losses and estimation of provisions for litigation, regulatory and similar matters. Such judgments, including the underlying estimates and assumptions, which encompass historical experience, expectations of the future and other factors, are regularly evaluated to determine their continuing relevance based on current conditions. Using different assumptions could cause the reported results to differ. Changes in assumptions, or failure to make the changes necessary to reflect evolving market conditions, may have a significant effect on the financial statements in the periods when changes occur. Estimates of provisions may be subject to a wide range of potential outcomes and significant uncertainty. For example, the broad range of potential outcomes in our legal proceedings in France and in a number of Credit Suisse's legal proceedings increase the uncertainty associated with assessing the appropriate provision. If the estimates and assumptions in future periods deviate from the current outlook, our financial results may also be negatively affected.",

        "page_content": "Changes to IFRS or interpretations thereof may cause future reported results and financial position to differ from current expectations, or historical results to differ from those previously reported due to the adoption of accounting standards on a retrospective basis. Such changes may also affect our regulatory capital and ratios. For example, the introduction of the ECL regime under IFRS 9 in 2018 fundamentally changed how credit risk arising from loans, loan commitments, guarantees and certain revocable facilities is accounted for. Under the ECL regime, credit loss expenses may increase rapidly at the onset of an economic downturn as a result of higher levels of credit impairments (stage 3), as well as higher ECL from stages 1 and 2, only gradually diminishing once the economic outlook improves. As we observed in 2020, this effect may be more pronounced in a deteriorating economic environment. Substantial increases in ECL could exceed expected loss for regulatory capital purposes and adversely affect our CET1 capital and regulatory capital ratios.\n\n## We may be unable to maintain our capital strength\n\nCapital strength enables us to grow our businesses and absorb increases in regulatory and capital requirements. Our ability to maintain our capital ratios is subject to numerous risks, including the financial results of our businesses, the effect of changes to capital standards, methodologies and interpretations that may adversely affect the calculation of our capital ratios, the imposition of risk add-ons or capital buffers, and the application of additional capital, liquidity and similar requirements to subsidiaries. Our capital and leverage ratios are driven primarily by RWA, LRD and eligible capital, all of which may fluctuate based on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control. The results of our businesses may be adversely affected by events arising from other risk factors described herein. In some cases, such as litigation and regulatory risk and operational risk events, losses may be sudden and large.\n\nOur eligible capital may be reduced by losses recognized within net profit or other comprehensive income. Eligible capital may also be reduced for other reasons, including acquisitions that change the level of goodwill, changes in temporary differences related to DTAs included in capital, adverse currency movements affecting the value of equity, prudential adjustments that may be required due to the valuation uncertainty associated with certain types of positions, and changes in the value of certain pension fund assets and liabilities or in the interest rate and other assumptions used to calculate the changes in our net defined benefit obligation recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nRWA are driven by our business activities, by changes in the risk profile of our exposures, by changes in our foreign currency exposures and foreign exchange rates, and by regulation. For instance, substantial market volatility, a widening of credit spreads, adverse currency movements, increased counterparty risk, deterioration in the economic environment or increased operational risk could result in an increase in RWA. Changes in the calculation of RWA, the imposition of additional supplemental RWA charges or multipliers applied to certain exposures and other methodology changes, as well as the finalization of the Basel III framework and Fundamental Review of the Trading Book promulgated by the BCBS, which are expected to increase our RWA.\n\nThe  leverage  ratio  is  a  balance  sheet-driven  measure  and  therefore  limits  balance  sheet-intensive  activities,  such  as lending, more than activities that are less balance sheet intensive, and it may constrain our business even if we satisfy other risk-based capital requirements. Our LRD is driven by, among other things, the level of client activity, including deposits and loans, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, other market factors and changes in required liquidity. Many of these factors are wholly or partly outside of our control.\n\n## The effect of taxes on our financial results is significantly influenced by tax law changes and reassessments of our deferred tax assets and, also, operating losses of certain entities with no associated tax benefit\n\nOur effective tax rate is highly sensitive to our performance, our expectation of future profitability and any potential increases or decreases in statutory tax rates, such as any potential increase or decrease in the US federal corporate tax rate.  Furthermore, based on prior years' tax losses and deductible temporary differences, we have recognized DTAs reflecting  the  probable  recoverable  level  based  on  future  taxable  profit  as  informed  by  our  business  plans.  If  our performance is expected to produce diminished taxable profit in future years, particularly in the US, we may be required to write down all or a portion of the currently recognized DTAs through the income statement in excess of anticipated amortization. This would have the effect of increasing our effective tax rate in the year in which any write-downs are taken.  Conversely,  if  we  expect  the  performance  of  entities  in  which  we  have  unrecognized  tax  losses  to  improve, particularly in the US or the UK, we could potentially recognize additional DTAs. The effect of doing so would be to reduce our effective tax rate in years in which additional DTAs are recognized and to increase our effective tax rate in future years. Our effective tax rate is also sensitive to any future reductions in statutory tax rates, particularly in the US, which would cause the expected future tax benefit from items such as tax loss carry-forwards in the affected locations to diminish in value. This, in turn, would cause a write-down of the associated DTAs. Conversely, an increase in US corporate tax rates would result in an increase in the Group's DTAs.\n\nWe generally revalue our DTAs in the fourth quarter of the financial year based on a reassessment of future profitability taking into account our updated business plans. We consider the performance of our businesses and the accuracy of historical forecasts, tax rates and other factors in evaluating the recoverability of our DTAs, including the remaining tax loss carry-forward period and our assessment of expected future taxable profits over the life of DTAs. Estimating future profitability is inherently subjective and is particularly sensitive to future economic, market and other conditions, which are difficult to predict.",

        "page_content": "Our results in past years have demonstrated that changes in the recognition of DTAs can have a very significant effect on our reported results. Any future change in the manner in which UBS AG remeasures DTAs could affect UBS AG's effective tax rate, particularly in the year in which the change is made.\n\nOur full-year effective tax rate would be impacted if aggregate tax expenses in respect of profits from branches and subsidiaries without loss coverage differ from what is expected, or if certain branches and subsidiaries incur operating losses that we cannot benefit from through the income statement. In particular, operating losses at entities or branches that cannot offset for tax purposes taxable profits in other Group entities, and which do not result in additional DTA recognition, would increase our effective tax rate. In addition, tax laws or the tax authorities in countries where we have undertaken legal structure changes may cause entities to be subject to taxation as permanent establishments or may prevent the transfer of tax losses incurred in one legal entity to newly organized or reorganized subsidiaries or affiliates or may impose limitations on the utilization of tax losses that relate to businesses formerly conducted by the transferor. Were this to occur in situations where there were also limited planning opportunities to utilize the tax losses in the originating entity, the DTAs associated with such tax losses may be required to be written down through the income statement.\n\nChanges in tax law may materially affect our effective tax rate, and, in some cases, may substantially affect the profitability of certain activities. In addition, statutory and regulatory changes, as well as changes to the way in which courts and tax authorities interpret tax laws, including assertions that we are required to pay taxes in a jurisdiction as a result of activities connected to that jurisdiction constituting a permanent establishment or similar theory, and changes in our assessment of uncertain tax positions, could cause the amount of taxes we ultimately pay to materially differ from the amount accrued.\n\n## We may incur material future tax liabilities in connection with the Credit Suisse Group's merger with the UBS Group\n\nIn the past, the Credit Suisse Group has made significant impairments of the tax value of its participations in subsidiaries below their tax acquisition costs. Following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group by UBS Group AG, tax acquisition costs of certain participations held by Credit Suisse Group AG and its subsidiaries will be transferred to the UBS AG Group as a result of further company mergers and restructurings. UBS AG and its subsidiaries may become subject to additional Swiss tax on future reversals of such impairments for Swiss tax purposes. Reversals of prior impairments may occur to the extent that the net asset value of the previously impaired subsidiary increases, e.g., as a result of an increase in retained earnings.  Although  it  is  difficult  to  quantify  this  additional  future  tax  exposure,  as  various  potential  mitigants  (e.g., transfers of assets and liabilities, business activities, subsidiary investments, as well as other restructuring measures within the combined Group in the course of the integration) exist, it may be material.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\n## Liquidity and funding management are critical to our ongoing performance\n\nThe viability of our business depends on the availability of funding sources, and our success depends on our ability to obtain funding at times, in amounts, for tenors and at rates that enable us to efficiently support our asset base in all market conditions. Our funding sources have generally been stable, but could change in the future because of, among other things, general market disruptions or widening credit spreads, which could also influence the cost of funding. A substantial part of our liquidity and funding requirements are met using short-term unsecured funding sources, including retail and wholesale deposits and the regular issuance of money market securities. A change in the availability of shortterm funding could occur quickly.\n\nThe addition of loss-absorbing debt as a component of capital requirements, the regulatory requirements to maintain minimum TLAC at UBS's holding company and at certain of its subsidiaries, as well as the power of resolution authorities to bail in TLAC instruments and other debt obligations, and uncertainty as to how such powers will be exercised, caused and may still cause further increase of our cost of funding, and could potentially increase the total amount of funding required, in the absence of other changes in our business.\n\nReductions in our credit ratings may adversely affect the market value of the securities and other obligations and increase our funding costs, in particular with regard to funding from wholesale unsecured sources, and could affect the availability of certain kinds of funding. In addition, as experienced in connection with Moody's Investors Service Ltd. downgrade of UBS AG's long-term debt rating in June 2012, rating downgrades can require us to post additional collateral or make additional  cash  payments  under  trading  agreements.  Our  credit  ratings,  together  with  our  capital  strength  and reputation, also contribute to maintaining client and counterparty confidence, and it is possible that rating changes could influence the performance of some of our businesses. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has elevated these risks and  may  cause  these  risks  to  intensify.  Upon  the  close  the  acquisition  in  June  2023,  Fitch  Ratings  Ireland  Limited downgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of UBS AG to 'A+' from 'AA-'. Fitch Ratings Ltd also upgraded Credit Suisse AG's Long-Term IDR to 'A+' from 'BBB+'.",

The liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements are intended to ensure that we are not overly reliant on short-term funding and that we have sufficient long-term funding for illiquid assets. The relevant calculations make assumptions about the relative likelihood and amount of outflows of funding and available sources of additional funding in market-wide and firm-specific stress situations. In an actual stress situation, however, our funding outflows could exceed the assumed amounts. Further, UBS AG is subject to increased liquidity requirements related to too-big-to-fail (TBTF) measures under the direction of FINMA, which became effective on 1 January 2024.",

included a net tax expense of USD 1,206m.\n\nOperating profit before tax decreased by USD 4,439m, or 50%, to USD 4,521m, reflecting higher operating expenses, lower total revenues and higher net credit loss expenses. Operating expenses increased by USD 3,084m, or 12%, to USD 29,011m  and  included  USD 1,392m  of  integration-related  expenses.  This  increase  was  mainly  driven  by  a USD 2,117m  increase  in  general  and  administrative  expenses.  Personnel  expenses  increased  by  USD 575m  and depreciation, amortization and impairment of non-financial assets increased by USD 393m. Net credit loss expenses were  USD 143m,  compared  with  USD 29m  in  2022.  Total  revenues  decreased  by  USD 1,240m,  or  4%,  to USD 33,675m, mainly driven by other income, which decreased by USD 1,316m, largely attributable to the prior year including a gain of USD 848m in Asset Management on the sale of our shareholding in our Japanese real estate joint venture, Mitsubishi Corp.-UBS Realty Inc. Total combined net interest income and other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss increased by USD 489m, partly offset by a USD 413m decrease in net fee and commission income.",

In addition, there was a USD 142m increase in Global Banking, mainly due to higher revenues in both Risk Management and Leveraged Capital Markets, reflecting an improvement in mark-to-market.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 3 Net interest income and other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n\n## Net interest income and other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\n|                                                                                                                              | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | % change from   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| USD m                                                                                                                        | 31.12.23             | 31.12.22             | 31.12.21             | 31.12.22        |\n| Net interest income from financial instruments measured at amortized cost and fair value through other  comprehensive income | 2,801                | 5,108                | 5,168                | (45)            |\n| Net interest income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss and other                       | 1,765                | 1,410                | 1,437                | 25              |\n| Other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss                                    | 9,934                | 7,493                | 5,844                | 33              |\n| Total                                                                                                                        | 14,500               | 14,011               | 12,449               | 3               |\n| Global Wealth Management                                                                                                     | 6,607                | 6,357                | 5,341                | 4               |\n| of which: net interest income                                                                                                | 5,436                | 5,274                | 4,244                | 3               |\n| of which: transaction-based income from foreign exchange and other intermediary activity  1                                  | 1,171                | 1,082                | 1,097                | 8               |\n| Personal & Corporate Banking                                                                                                 | 3,641                | 2,686                | 2,557                | 36              |\n| of which: net interest income                                                                                                | 3,128                | 2,192                | 2,120                | 43              |\n| of which: transaction-based income from foreign exchange and other intermediary activity  1                                  | 513                  | 495                  | 437                  | 4               |\n| Asset Management                                                                                                             | (35)                 | (23)                 | (13)                 | 51              |\n| Investment Bank 2                                                                                                            | 4,997                | 5,770                | 5,074                | (13)            |\n| Global Banking                                                                                                               | 329                  | 187                  | 596                  | 76              |\n| Global Markets                                                                                                               | 4,667                | 5,582                | 4,478                | (16)            |\n| Non-core and Legacy                                                                                                          | 44                   | 118                  | 7                    | (63)            |\n| Group Items                                                                                                                  | (755)                | (896)                | (516)                | (16)            |\n\n1 Mainly includes spread-related income in connection with client-driven transactions, foreign currency translation effects and income and expenses from precious metals, which are included in the income statement line Other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.

In addition, there was a USD 939m increase in shared services costs charged by other subsidiaries of UBS Group AG, as well as a USD 468m increase in expenses for litigation, regulatory and similar matters, driven by a USD 665m increase in provisions recognized in the first quarter of 2023 related to the US residential mortgage-backed securities litigation matter. Technology costs increased by USD 56m.\n\nWe believe  that  the  industry  continues  to  operate  in  an  environment  in  which  expenses  associated  with  litigation, regulatory and similar matters will remain elevated for the foreseeable future, and we continue to be exposed to a number of significant claims and regulatory matters. The outcome of many of these matters, the timing of a resolution, and the potential effects  of  resolutions  on  our  future  business,  financial  results  or  financial  condition  are  extremely difficult to predict.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 7 General and administrative expenses' and 'Note 17 Provisions and contingent liabilities' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n\n## Depreciation, amortization and impairment of non-financial assets\n\nDepreciation, amortization and impairment of non-financial assets increased by USD 393m to USD 2,238m and included integration-related expenses of USD 274m, primarily relating to a USD 214m impairment of software projects in progress resulting  from  a  reprioritization  of  software  development  activity  in  the  context  of  the  integration  of  Credit  Suisse. Excluding the aforementioned effects, depreciation of internally developed software increased by USD 143m, reflecting a higher level of capitalized costs.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n|                                                                       | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | % change from   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| USD m                                                                 | 31.12.23             | 31.12.22             | 31.12.21             | 31.12.22        |\n| Personnel expenses                                                    | 15,655               | 15,080               | 15,661               | 4               |\n| of which: salaries                                                    | 5,898                | 5,528                | 5,723                | 7               |\n| of which: variable compensation                                       | 7,669                | 7,636                | 7,973                | 0               |\n| of which: performance awards                                          | 2,841                | 2,910                | 2,916                | (2)             |\n| of which: financial advisors  1                                       | 4,549                | 4,508                | 4,860                | 1               |\n| of which: other                                                       | 279                  | 217                  | 196                  | 29              |\n| of which: other personnel expenses  2                                 | 2,088                | 1,916                | 1,965                | 9               |\n| General and administrative expenses                                   | 11,118               | 9,001                | 9,476                | 24              |\n| of which: net expenses for litigation, regulatory and similar matters | 816                  | 348                  | 910                  | 135             |\n| of which: other general and administrative expenses                   | 10,302               | 8,653                | 8,566                | 19              |\n| Depreciation, amortization and impairment of non-financial assets     | 2,238                | 1,845                | 1,875                | 21              |\n| Total operating expenses                                              | 29,011               | 25,927               | 27,012               | 12              |\n\n## Tax\n\nIncome tax expenses of USD 1,206m were recognized for UBS AG in 2023, representing an effective tax rate of 26.7%, compared with USD 1,844m for 2022, which represented an effective tax rate of 20.6%. The income tax expenses for 2023 included Swiss tax expenses of USD 849m and non-Swiss tax expenses of USD 356m.\n\nThe Swiss tax expenses included current tax expenses of USD 810m in respect of taxable profits of UBS Switzerland AG and other Swiss entities and deferred tax expenses of USD 39m.\n\nThe non-Swiss tax expenses included current tax expenses of USD 618m that related to expenses of USD 100m in respect of  US  corporate  alternative  minimum  tax  (CAMT)  and  USD  518m  in  respect  of  other  taxable  profits  of  non-Swiss subsidiaries and branches. These were partly offset by a net deferred tax benefit of USD 262m that primarily related to a benefit of USD 274m in respect of an increase in deferred tax assets (DTAs) that resulted from an increase in the expected value of future tax deductions for deferred compensation awards due to an increase in the Group's share price during the year. In addition, the net deferred tax benefit included a benefit of USD 100m in respect of the recognition of DTAs for tax credits carried forward in respect of CAMT. These benefits were partly offset by a net deferred tax expense of USD 112m that primarily related to the amortization of DTAs previously recognized in relation to tax losses carried forward.",

Total net pre-tax OCI related to the Swiss pension plan was negative USD 56m. This reflected losses of USD 1,901m from the defined benefit obligation (DBO) remeasurement, largely offset by an increase in the plan assets of USD 513m and a decrease in the effect of the asset ceiling under IFRS Accounting Standards of USD 1,332m. Total pre-tax OCI related to our non-Swiss pension plans was negative USD 47m, mostly driven by the UK pension plan, which recorded negative net pre-tax OCI of USD 31m. The negative OCI in the UK pension plan reflected a loss from the remeasurement of the DBO of USD 96m, partly offset by a positive return on plan assets of USD 65m.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Statement of comprehensive income' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 20 Fair value measurement' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about own credit on financial liabilities designated at fair value\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 25 Hedge accounting' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about cash flow hedges of forecast transactions\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 26 Post-employment benefit plans' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about OCI related to defined benefit plans\n\n## Sensitivity to interest rate movements\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, we estimated that a parallel shift in yield curves by +100 basis points could lead to a combined increase in annual net interest income from our banking book of approximately USD 1.2bn in the first year after such a shift. Of this increase, approximately USD 0.8bn, USD 0.2bn and USD 0.1bn would result from changes in Swiss franc, US dollar and euro interest rates, respectively. A parallel shift in yield curves by -100 basis points could lead to a combined decrease in annual net interest income of approximately USD 1.2bn in the first year after such a shift, showing similar currency contributions as for the aforementioned increase in rates.\n\nThese estimates are based on a hypothetical scenario of an immediate change in interest rates, equal across all currencies and relative to implied forward rates as of 31 December 2023 applied to our banking book. These estimates further assume no change to balance sheet size and product mix, stable foreign exchange rates, and no specific management action. These estimates do not represent a forecast of net interest income variability.\n\n## Seasonal characteristics\n\nOur revenues may show seasonal patterns, notably in the Investment Bank and transaction-based revenues for Global Wealth Management, and typically reflect the highest client activity levels in the first quarter, with lower levels throughout the rest of the year, especially during the summer months and the end-of-year holiday season.\n\n## Key figures\n\nBelow we provide an overview of selected key figures of UBS AG consolidated. For further information about key figures related to capital management, refer to the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report.\n\n## Cost / income ratio\n\nThe cost / income ratio was 86.2%, compared with 74.3%, mainly reflecting an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in total revenues.\n\n## Return on common equity tier 1 capital\n\nThe  annualized  return  on  our  common  equity  tier 1  (CET1)  capital  was  7.6%,  compared  with  16.8%,  reflecting  a USD 3,794m decrease in net profit attributable to shareholders and a USD 1.3bn increase in average CET1 capital.",

        "page_content": "## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses increased by USD 831m, or 6%, to USD 14,900m, mostly driven by integration-related expenses associated with the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, higher technology expenses and adverse foreign currency effects. These increases were partly offset by lower provisions for litigation, regulatory and similar matters. In addition, 2023 included a charge of USD 60m for the special assessment by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to recover losses incurred by the Deposit Insurance Fund in connection with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\n\n## Pre-tax profit growth\n\nPre-tax profit growth was negative 24.3%, compared with positive 4.0% in 2022.\n\n## Cost / income ratio\n\nThe cost / income ratio increased to 80.0% from 74.2%, reflecting both higher operating expenses and lower total revenues.\n\n## Invested assets\n\nInvested assets increased by USD 372bn, or 13%, to USD 3,187bn, mainly driven by positive market performance of USD 279bn, net new money inflows of USD 75.0bn and positive foreign currency effects of USD 31bn.\n\n## Loans\n\nLoans decreased by USD 6.7bn to USD 218.3bn, mainly driven by net new loan outflows of USD 12.6bn, partly offset by positive foreign currency effects.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information\n\n## Customer deposits\n\nCustomer deposits increased by USD 7.1bn to USD 355.3bn, mainly driven by positive foreign currency effects and net inflows into fixed-term deposit products. This was partly offset by continued shifts into money market funds and USgovernment securities.\n\n## Personal & Corporate Banking\n\n## Personal & Corporate Banking - in Swiss francs 1\n\n|                                                                                | As of or for the year ended   | As of or for the year ended   | % change from   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|\n| CHF m, except where indicated                                                  | 31.12.23                      | 31.12.22                      | 31.12.22        |\n| Results                                                                        |                               |                               |                 |\n| Net interest income                                                            | 2,804                         | 2,088                         | 34              |\n| Recurring net fee income 2                                                     | 851                           | 812                           | 5               |\n| Transaction-based income 2                                                     | 1,179                         | 1,155                         | 2               |\n| Other income                                                                   | (83)                          | 47                            |                 |\n| Total revenues                                                                 | 4,751                         | 4,101                         | 16              |\n| Credit loss expense / (release)                                                | 46                            | 36                            | 27              |\n| Operating expenses                                                             | 2,589                         | 2,359                         | 10              |\n| Business division operating profit / (loss) before tax                         | 2,116                         | 1,706                         | 24              |\n| Performance measures and other information                                     |                               |                               |                 |\n| Pre-tax profit growth (year-on-year, %) 2                                      | 24.1                          | 7.8                           |                 |\n| Cost / income ratio (%) 2                                                      | 54.5                          | 57.5                          |                 |\n| Net interest margin (bps) 2                                                    | 192                           | 147                           |                 |\n| Fee and trading income for Corporate & Institutional Clients 2                 | 847                           | 810                           | 4               |\n| Investment products for Personal Banking (CHF bn) 2                            | 24.4                          | 21.6                          | 13              |\n| Net new investment products for Personal Banking (CHF bn) 2                    | 1.81                          | 1.99                          | (9)             |\n| Active Digital Banking clients in Personal Banking (%) 2,3                     | 77.9                          | 74.3                          |                 |\n| Active Mobile Banking clients in Personal Banking (%) 2                        | 65.0                          | 56.5                          |                 |\n| Active Digital Banking clients in Corporate & Institutional Clients (%) 2      | 81.2                          | 80.0                          |                 |\n| Loans, gross (CHF bn)                                                          | 146.8                         | 143.0                         | 3               |\n| Customer deposits (CHF bn)                                                     | 169.6                         | 168.0                         | 1               |\n| Impaired loan portfolio as a percentage of total loan portfolio, gross (%) 2,4 | 0.9                           | 0.8                           |                 |",

Income related to centralized Group Treasury risk management was positive USD 107m, compared with negative USD 41m in 2022.\n\nIn addition, 2023 included integration-related expenses of USD 289m associated with the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, an increase of USD 273m in funding costs related to deferred tax assets and a USD 17m decrease in net gains on properties held for sale.",

UBS AG's risk management and control practices and frameworks remained in line with those of the UBS Group. UBS AG's risk governance continued to operate along our three lines of defense.\n\n2023 was a challenging year for  the  global  economy  and  most  markets,  stage  3  net  expenses  of  USD 120m  were recognized in a number of defaulted positions across our business divisions and a USD 0.5bn increase in credit-impaired exposure to USD 3.0bn was observed. Overall, we saw a USD 48bn increase in banking product exposure driven by Group Items and Personal & Corporate Banking while exposure in Global Wealth Management decreased. Traded product exposures saw an increase of USD 1.4bn across our business divisions. Market risk remained at low levels, as a result of our continued focus on managing tail risks.",

risks\n\nThe top and emerging risks disclosed below reflect those that we currently think have the potential to materialize within one year and which could significantly affect UBS AG. Investors should also carefully review all information set out in the 'Risk factors' section of this report, where we discuss these and other material risks that we consider could have an effect on our ability to execute our strategy and may affect our business activities, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\n\n- - UBS AG remains watchful of a range of geopolitical developments and political changes in a number of countries, as well as international tensions arising from the Russia-Ukraine war, conflicts in the Middle East and US-China trade relations. Geopolitical tensions will continue to create uncertainty and complicate the energy price outlook. UBS AG is closely watching elections in several key markets in 2024.\n- - Inflation has abated to some extent in major Western economies, though there are still concerns regarding future developments, and central banks' monetary policy is in the spotlight. The potential for 'higher-for-longer' interest rates raises the prospect of a global recession, particularly as the growth of China's economy has been muted. This combination of factors translates into a more uncertain and volatile environment, which increases the risk of financial market disruption.\n- - UBS AG is exposed to a number of macroeconomic issues, as well as general market conditions. As noted in 'Market, credit and macroeconomic risks' in the 'Risk factors' section of this report, these external pressures may have a significant adverse effect on our business activities and related financial results, primarily through reduced margins and revenues, asset impairments and other valuation adjustments. Accordingly, these macroeconomic factors are considered in the development of stress-testing scenarios for our ongoing risk management activities.\n- - UBS AG is monitoring the downturn in the commercial real estate sector. Adverse effects on valuations from higher interest rates and structural decline in demand for office and retail space may trigger broader impacts given bank and non-bank lenders' material balance sheet exposure to the sector.\n- - We are exposed to substantial changes in the regulation of our businesses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, as discussed in the 'Regulatory and legal developments' section of this report and in 'Regulatory and legal risks' in the 'Risk factors' section of this report.",

        "page_content": "- - As a global financial services firm, we are subject to many different legal, tax and regulatory regimes and extensive regulatory oversight. We are exposed to significant liability risk, and we are subject to various claims, disputes, legal proceedings and government investigations, as noted in 'Regulatory and legal risks' in the 'Risk factors' section of this report. Information about litigation, regulatory and similar matters we consider significant is disclosed in 'Note 17 Provisions and contingent liabilities' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report.\n- - Global geopolitical trends increase the likelihood of external state-driven cyber activity. Alongside a general trend toward more sophisticated forms of ransomware and other cyber threats, there is a risk of business disruption or the corruption or loss of data. Additionally, as a result of the dynamic and material nature of recent geopolitical and environmental events and the operational complexity of all our businesses, we are continually exposed to operational resilience scenarios such as process error, failed execution, system failures and fraud.\n- - Conduct risks are inherent in our businesses. Achieving fair outcomes for our clients, upholding market integrity and cultivating the highest standards of employee conduct are of critical importance to us. Management of conduct risks is an integral part of our risk management framework.\n- - Financial crime (including money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions violations, fraud, bribery and corruption) presents significant risk. Heightened regulatory expectations and attention require investment in people and systems, while  emerging  technologies  and  changing  geopolitical  risks  further  increase  the  complexity  of  identifying  and preventing financial crime.\n- \u203a Refer to 'Non-financial risk' in this section and 'Strategy, management and operational risks' in the 'Risk factors' section of this report for more information\n- - Sustainability and climate risks continue to be in the focus of regulators and stakeholders, with further emphasis put on measurement of nature-related risk and management of greenwashing risks in 2023. To address these emerging risks, UBS has enhanced its nature-related risk methodology and established guidelines for sustainable lending, bonds and greenhouse gas emissions trading to address potential greenwashing risks.\n- \u203a Refer to 'Sustainability and climate risk' in the 'Risk management and control' section of the UBS Group Annual Report 2023, available under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information\n- \u203a Refer to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for a full description of our sustainability and climate risk policy framework\n- - In addition, industry guidelines and regulations are emerging simultaneously in various jurisdictions, leading to an increased risk of divergence, which in turn increases the risk that UBS may not comply with all relevant regulations.\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Non-financial risk' section of this report and 'Sustainability and climate risk' in the 'Risk management and control' section of the UBS Group Annual Report 2023, available under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors\n- - New risks continue to emerge. For example, client demand for distributed ledger technology, blockchain-based assets and virtual currencies creates new risks, to which we currently have limited exposure and for which relevant control frameworks are continuously enhanced and implemented.\n\n## Risk governance\n\nThe risk governance of UBS AG is modeled on that of UBS Group AG, with the same three lines of defense and equal governance structure in terms of key roles and responsibility for risk management.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk governance' in the 'Risk management and control' section of the UBS Group Annual Report 2023, available under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors, for more information about our risk governance and the three lines of defense\n\n## Risk appetite framework\n\nUBS AG manages its risk appetite in line with the UBS Group framework, covering financial and non-financial risk types, via a complementary set of qualitative and quantitative risk appetite statements. The UBS Group framework is reviewed and recalibrated annually and presented to the Board of Directors (the BoD) for approval.\n\nOur risk appetite is defined at the aggregate Group level and reflects the risk that we are willing to accept or wish to avoid. It is set via complementary qualitative and quantitative risk appetite statements defined at a firm-wide level and is embedded throughout our business divisions and legal entities by Group, business division and legal entity policies, limits and authorities. Our risk appetite is reviewed and recalibrated annually, with the aim of ensuring that risk-taking at every level of the organization is in line with our strategic priorities, our capital and liquidity plans, our Pillars, Principles and Behaviors , and minimum regulatory requirements. The 'Risk appetite framework' chart below shows the key elements of the framework, which is described in detail in this section.",

Additional  specialized  training  is  provided  depending  on  employees'  specific  roles  and responsibilities, e.g., credit risk and market risk training for those working in trading areas.\n\n## Quantitative risk appetite objectives\n\nOur quantitative risk  appetite  objectives  aim  to  ensure  that  our  aggregate  risk  exposure  remains  within  desired  risk capacity, based on capital and business plans. The specific definition of risk capacity for each objective is aimed at ensuring we have sufficient capital, earnings, funding and liquidity to protect our businesses and exceed minimum regulatory requirements under a severe stress event. The risk appetite objectives are evaluated during the annual business planning process and approved by the BoD. The comparison of risk exposure with risk capacity is a key consideration in decisions on potential adjustments to the business strategy, risk profile, and the level of capital returns to shareholders.\n\nIn the annual business planning process, UBS's business strategy, including that of UBS AG, is reviewed, the risk profile that our operations and activities result in is assessed, and that risk profile is stressed. We use both scenario-based stress tests and economic capital risk measurement techniques to assess the effects of severe stress events at a firm-wide level. These complementary frameworks capture exposures to material risks across our business divisions and Group Items.\n\nFor 2023, the following risk appetite objectives were applied to UBS AG.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk measurement' in this section for more information about our stress-testing and economic capital measures\n\n## Quantitative risk appetite objectives\n\nQuantitative risk appetite objectives\n\n## Minimum leverage ratio objectives\n\nCET1 capital is sufficient to meet minimum leverage-ratio-based capital requirements even if a severe stress event were to occur.\n\n## Liquidity objectives\n\nEnsure that the firm has sufficient liquidity to survive a severe threemonth idiosyncratic and marketwide liquidity stress event without government support, allowing for discrete management actions.\n\n## Solvency objectives\n\nCET1 capital plus contingent capital is sufficient to ensure that the probability of loss for the firm's debt holders is consistent with the firm's target credit rating.\n\n## Funding objectives\n\nEnsure that the firm has sufficient long-term funding to maintain franchise assets at a constant level under stressed market conditions for up to one year without government support, allowing for discrete management actions.\n\nRisk exposure\n\n## Minimum capital objectives\n\nCET1 capital is sufficient to meet minimum RWA-based capital requirements even if a severe stress event were to occur.\n\n## Earnings objectives\n\nLosses do not exceed average historical earnings even if a severe stress event were to occur.\n\nRisk capacity\n\n## Projected earnings\n\nadjusted to reflect business risk\n\n## Capital\n\nadjusted to reflect stress impact on capitalrelevant elements\n\n## Economic capital measures\n\nearnings-at-risk, capital-at-risk, risk-based capital\n\n## Stress measures\n\ncombined stress test\n\nCredit risk\n\nCountry risk\n\nMarket risk\u00b9\n\nNon-financial risk\n\n## Granular limit framework\n\n- 1 Includes interest rate risk.

        "page_content": "Our risk capacity is underpinned by performance targets and capital guidance as per our business plan. When determining our risk capacity in case of a severe stress event, we estimate projected earnings under stress, factoring in lower expected income and expenses. We also consider capital impacts under stress from deferred tax assets, pension plan assets and liabilities, and accruals for capital returns to shareholders.\n\nRisk appetite objectives define the aggregate risk exposure acceptable at the firm-wide level, given our risk capacity. The maximum acceptable risk exposure is supported by a full set of risk limits, which are cascaded to businesses and portfolios. These limits aim to ensure that our risks remain in line with risk appetite.\n\nRisk appetite statements at the business division level are derived from the firm-wide risk appetite. They may also include division-specific strategic goals related to that division's activities and risks. Risk appetite statements are also set for certain legal entities, which must be consistent with the firm-wide risk appetite framework and approved in accordance with Group and legal entity regulations. Differences may exist that reflect the specific nature, size, complexity and regulations applicable to the relevant legal entity.\n\n## Internal risk reporting\n\nComprehensive and transparent reporting of risks is central to our risk governance framework's control and oversight responsibilities and required by our risk management and control principles. Accordingly, risks are reported at a frequency and level of detail commensurate with the extent and variability of the risk and the needs of the various governance bodies, regulators and risk authority holders.\n\nThe  UBS AG  Risk  Report  (formerly  the  Group  Risk  Report)  provides  a  detailed  qualitative  and  quantitative  monthly overview of developments in financial and non-financial risks at the firm-wide level. The UBS AG Risk Report is distributed internally to the BoD and the Executive Board (EB), and senior members of Risk Control and Group Internal Audit (GIA). Risk  reports  are  also  produced  for  significant  UBS AG  entities  (entities  subject  to  enhanced  standards  of  corporate governance) and significant branches.\n\nGranular divisional risk reports are provided to the respective business division CROs and business division Presidents. This monthly reporting is supplemented with daily or weekly reports, at various levels of granularity, covering market and credit risks for the business divisions to enable risk officers and senior management to monitor and control the Group's risk profile, including that of UBS AG.\n\nOur internal risk reporting covers financial and non-financial risks and is supported by risk data and measurement systems that are also used for external disclosure and regulatory reporting. Dedicated units within Risk Control assume responsibility for measurement, analysis and reporting of risk and for overseeing the quality and integrity of risk-related data. Our risk data and measurement systems are subject to periodic review by GIA, following a risk-based audit approach.\n\n## Model risk management\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe rely on models to inform risk management and control decisions, to measure risks or exposures, value instruments or positions, conduct stress testing, assess adequacy of capital, and manage clients' assets and our own assets. Models may also be used to measure and monitor compliance with rules and regulations, for surveillance activities, or to meet financial or regulatory reporting requirements.\n\nModel risk is defined as the risk of adverse consequences (e.g., financial losses or reputational damage) resulting from incorrect or misused models.\n\n## Model governance framework\n\nOur model governance framework establishes requirements for identifying, measuring, monitoring, reporting, controlling and mitigating model risk. All the models that we use are subject to governance and controls throughout their life cycles, with rigor, depth and frequency determined by the model's materiality and complexity. This is designed to ensure that risks arising from model use are identified, understood, managed, monitored, controlled and reported on both a modelspecific and an aggregated level. Before they can be granted approval for use, all our models are independently validated.\n\nOnce validated and approved for use, a model is subject to ongoing model monitoring and regular model confirmation, ensuring that the model is only used if it continues to be found fit for purpose. All models are subject to periodic model re-validation.",

Risks that are not fully reflected within standard measures are subject to additional controls, which may include  preapproval  of  specific  transactions  and  the  application  of  specific  restrictions.  Models  to  quantify  risk  are generally developed by dedicated units within control functions and are subject to independent validation. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Credit risk,' 'Market risk' and 'Non-financial risk' in this section for more information about model confirmation procedures\n\nThe text below describes the scenario-based stress testing and economic capital measures of UBS AG on a consolidated basis during 2023.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nWe perform stress testing to estimate losses that could result from extreme yet plausible macroeconomic and geopolitical stress events to identify, better understand and manage our potential vulnerabilities and risk concentrations. Stress testing has a key role in our limits framework at the firm-wide, business division, legal entity and portfolio levels. Stress-test results are regularly reported to the BoD and the EB. As described in 'Risk appetite framework,' stress testing, along with economic capital measures, has a central role in our risk appetite and business planning processes.\n\nOur stress-testing framework has three pillars: (i) combined stress tests; (ii) an extensive set of portfolio- and risk-typespecific stress tests; and (iii) reverse stress testing.\n\nThe combined stress-testing (CST) framework is scenario-based and aims to quantify overall firm-wide losses that could result  from  various  potential  global  systemic  events.  The  framework  captures  all  material  risks,  as  covered  in  'Risk categories.' Scenarios are forward-looking and encompass macroeconomic and geopolitical stress events calibrated to different  levels  of  severity.  We  implement  each  scenario  through  the  expected  evolution  of  market  indicators  and economic variables under that scenario and then estimate the overall loss and capital implications were the scenario to occur. Following the existing UBS AG scenario governance, at least once a year, the Risk Committee approves the most relevant  scenario,  known  as  the  binding  scenario,  for  use  as  the  main  scenario  for  regular  CST  reporting  and  for monitoring  risk  exposure  against  our  minimum  capital,  earnings  and  leverage  ratio  objectives  in  our  risk  appetite framework.\n\nWe provide detailed stress loss analyses to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and regulators of our legal entities in accordance with their requirements.",

        "page_content": "The Enterprise-wide Stress Forum (the ESF) aims to ensure the consistency and adequacy of the assumptions and scenarios used for firm-wide stress measures. As part of its responsibilities, the ESF, with input from the Think Tank, a panel of senior representatives from the business divisions, Risk Control and Economic Research, seeks to ensure that the set of stress  scenarios  adequately  reflects  current  and  potential  developments  in  the  macroeconomic  and  geopolitical environment, current and planned business activities, and actual or potential risk concentrations and vulnerabilities in our portfolios.\n\nEach scenario captures a wide range of macroeconomic variables, including GDP, equity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange  rates,  commodity  prices,  property  prices  and  unemployment.  We  use  assumed  changes  in  these macroeconomic and market variables in each scenario to stress the key risk drivers of our portfolios. We also capture the business risk resulting from lower fee, interest and trading income net of lower expenses. These effects are measured for all businesses and material risk types to calculate the aggregate estimated effect of the scenario on profit or loss, other comprehensive income, risk-weighted assets, the leverage ratio denominator and, ultimately, capital and leverage ratios. The assumed changes in macroeconomic variables are updated periodically to account for changes in the current and possible future market environment.\n\nIn 2023, the binding scenario for CST was the internal stagflationary geopolitical crisis scenario. This scenario assumes that a geopolitical event leads to economic regionalization and fears of prolonged stagflation. Central banks signal a firm commitment to price stability and continue to tighten monetary policy, triggering a broad rise in interest rates and impacting economic activity and asset values.\n\nAs part of the CST framework, we routinely monitored three additional stress scenarios throughout 2023:\n\n- - The global crisis scenario assumes a fall in global trade, which particularly hits China and leads to a hard landing. Combined with political, solvency and liquidity concerns, this results in a sharp sell-off of emerging markets sovereign debt and some emerging markets default. The macroeconomic and market impacts amplify concerns about peripheral European sovereign debt, causing Greece and Cyprus to default.\n- - The global depression scenario explores a global risk-off market with a combination of political, solvency and liquidity concerns  around  emerging  markets  sovereign  debt,  causing  several  large  emerging  markets  to  default.  Several European  economies  also  default,  and  some  leave  the  Eurozone.  A  negative  feedback  loop  between  collapsing demand, declining asset values and commodity prices, and disruption in the banking system leads to a deep and prolonged recession across the globe.\n- - The US  monetary  crisis scenario  explores  a  loss  of  confidence  in  the  US,  which  leads  to  a  sell-off  of  US  dollardenominated assets, sparking an abrupt and substantial depreciation of the US dollar. The US economy is hit hard, financial markets enter a period of high volatility and other industrialized countries replicate the cyclical pattern of the US. Regional inflation trends diverge as the US experiences significant inflationary pressures while other developed markets experience deflation.\n\nPortfolio-specific stress tests are measures tailored to the risks of specific portfolios. Our portfolio stress loss measures are derived  from  data  on  past  events,  but  also  include  forward-looking  elements  (e.g.,  we  derive  the  expected  market movements in our liquidity-adjusted stress metric using a combination of historical market behavior, based on an analysis of historical events, and forward-looking analysis, including consideration of defined scenarios that have never occurred). Results of portfolio-specific stress tests may be subject to limits to explicitly control risk-taking or may be monitored without limits to identify vulnerabilities.\n\nReverse stress testing starts from a defined stress outcome (e.g., a specified loss amount, reputational damage, a liquidity shortfall  or  a  breach  of  minimum  capital  ratios)  and  works  backward  to  identify  macroeconomic  scenarios  and  /  or idiosyncratic events that could result in such an outcome. As such, reverse stress testing is intended to complement scenario-based stress tests by assuming 'what if' outcomes that could extend beyond the range normally considered, and thereby potentially challenge assumptions regarding severity and plausibility.\n\nWe also routinely analyze the effect of increases or decreases in interest rates and changes in the structure of yield curves.\n\nWithin Group Treasury, we also perform stress testing to determine the optimal asset and liability structure, enabling us to maintain an appropriately balanced liquidity and funding position under various scenarios. These scenarios differ from those  outlined  above,  because  they  focus  on  specific  situations  that  could  generate  liquidity  and  funding  stress,  as opposed to the scenarios used in the CST framework, which focus on the effect on profit or loss and capital.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Credit risk' and 'Market risk' in this section for more information about stress loss measures\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about stress testing\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 19 Expected credit loss measurement' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about scenarios used for expected credit loss measurement",

        "page_content": "## Economic capital measures\n\nWe complement the scenario-based CST measures with economic capital stress measures to calculate and aggregate risks using statistical techniques to derive stress events at chosen confidence levels.\n\nThis framework is used to derive a loss distribution, considering effects on both income and expenses, based on the simulation of historically observed financial and economic risk factors in combination with the firm's actual earnings and relevant risk exposures. From that, we determine earnings-at-risk (EaR), measuring the potential shortfall in earnings (i.e., the deviation from forecast earnings) at a 95% confidence level and evaluated over a one-year horizon. EaR is used for the assessment of the earnings objectives in our risk appetite framework.\n\nWe extend the EaR measure, incorporating the effects of gains and losses recognized through other comprehensive income, to derive a distribution of potential effects of stress events on common equity tier 1 capital. From this distribution, we derive our capital-at-risk (CaR) buffer measure at a 95% confidence level to assess our capital and leverage ratio risk appetite objectives, and derive our CaR solvency measure at a 99.9% confidence level to assess our solvency risk appetite objective.\n\nWe use the CaR solvency measure as a basis for deriving the contributions of the business divisions to risk-based capital (RBC). RBC measures the potential capital impairment from an extreme stress event at a 99.9% confidence level.\n\n## Portfolio and position limits\n\nUBS maintains a comprehensive set of risk limits across its major risk portfolios. These portfolio limits are set based on our risk appetite and periodically reviewed and adjusted as part of the business planning process.\n\nFirm-wide stress and statistical metrics are complemented by more granular portfolio and position limits, triggers and targets. Combining these measures provides a comprehensive framework for control of the key risks of our business divisions, as well as significant legal entities.\n\nUBS AG applies limits to a variety of exposures at the portfolio level, using statistical and stress-based measures, such as value-at-risk,  liquidity-adjusted  stress,  loan  underwriting  limits,  economic  value  sensitivity  and  portfolio  default simulations for loan books. These are complemented with a set of controls for net interest income sensitivity, mark-tomarket losses on available-for-sale portfolios, and the effect of foreign exchange movements on capital and capital ratios.\n\nPortfolio measures are supplemented with counterparty- and position-level controls. Risk measures for position controls are  based  on  market  risk  sensitivities  and  counterparty-level  credit  risk  exposures.  Market  risk  sensitivities  include sensitivities to changes in general market risk factors (e.g., equity indices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates) and sensitivities to issuer-specific factors (e.g., changes in an issuer's credit spread or default risk). We monitor numerous market  and  treasury  risk  controls  on  a  daily  basis.  Counterparty  measures  capture  the  current  and  potential  future exposure to an individual counterparty, considering collateral and legally enforceable netting agreements.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Credit risk' in this section for more information about counterparty limits\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk appetite framework' in this section for more information about the risk appetite framework\n\n## Risk concentrations\n\nAudited | Risk concentrations may exist where one or several positions within or across different risk categories could result in  significant  losses  relative  to  UBS  AG's  financial  strength.  Identifying  such  risk  concentrations  and  assessing  their potential impact is a critical component of our risk management and control process.\n\nFor financial risks, we consider a number of elements, such as shared characteristics of positions, the size of the portfolio and the sensitivity of positions to changes in the underlying risk factors. Also important in our assessment is the liquidity of the markets where the positions are traded, as well as the availability and effectiveness of hedges or other potential risk-mitigating factors. This includes an assessment of, for example, the provider of the hedge and market liquidity where the hedge might be traded. Particular attention is given to identification of wrong-way risk and risk on risk. Wrong-way risk is defined as a positive correlation between the size of the exposure and the likelihood of a loss. Risk on risk is when a position and its risk mitigation can be impacted by the same event.\n\nFor non-financial risks, risk concentrations may result from, for example, a single operational risk issue that is large on its own (i.e., it has the potential to produce a single high-impact loss or a number of losses that together are high impact) or related risk issues that may link together to create a high impact.\n\nRisk  concentrations  are  subject  to  increased  oversight  by  Group  Risk  Control  and  Group  Compliance,  Regulatory  & Governance, and assessed to determine whether they should be reduced or mitigated, depending on the available means to do so. It is possible that material losses could occur on financial or non-financial risks, particularly if the correlations that emerge in a stressed environment differ markedly from those envisaged by risk models. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Credit risk' and 'Market risk' in this section for more information about the composition of our portfolios\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk factors' section of this report for more information",

Derivatives trading and securities financing are mainly investment grade. Loan underwriting activity can be lower rated and give rise to temporary concentrated exposure.\n- - Credit risk within Non-core and Legacy relates to exposures in auction rate preferred securities, public finance loans and derivatives, and residual exposures to securitized products. \uf070\n\n## Credit loss expense / release\n\nTotal net credit loss expenses were USD 143m in 2023, reflecting net credit loss expenses of USD 23m related to stage 1 and 2 positions and net credit loss expenses of USD 120m related to credit-impaired (stage 3) positions.\n\nStage 3  net  expenses  of  USD 120m  were  recognized  across  a  number  of  defaulted  positions,  with  net  expenses  of USD 56m  in  the  Investment  Bank,  USD 37m  in  Personal  &  Corporate  Banking  and  USD 27m  in  Global  Wealth Management.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies,' 'Note 9 Financial assets at amortized cost and other positions in scope of expected credit loss measurement' and 'Note 19 Expected credit loss measurement' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about IFRS 9 and expected credit losses\n\n| Credit loss expense / (release)   | Performing positions   | Credit-impaired positions   | Credit-impaired positions   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| USD m                             | Stages 1 and 2         | Stage 3                     | Total                       |\n| For the year ended 31.12.23       |                        |                             |                             |\n| Global Wealth Management          | (2)                    | 27                          | 25                          |\n| Personal & Corporate Banking      | 13                     | 37                          | 50                          |\n| Asset Management                  | 0                      | (1)                         | (1)                         |\n| Investment Bank                   | 11                     | 56                          | 67                          |\n| Non-core and Legacy               | 0                      | 1                           | 1                           |\n| Group Items 1                     | 1                      | 0                           | 1                           |\n| Total                             | 23                     | 120                         | 143                         |\n| For the year ended 31.12.22       |                        |                             |                             |\n| Global Wealth Management          | (5)                    | 5                           | 0                           |\n| Personal & Corporate Banking      | 27                     | 12                          | 39                          |\n| Asset Management                  | 0                      | 0                           | 0                           |\n| Investment Bank                   | 6                      | (18)                        | (12)                        |\n| Non-core and Legacy               | 0                      | 2                           | 2                           |\n| Group Items 1                     | 0                      | 0                           | 0                           |\n| Total                             | 29                     | 0                           | 29                          |\n| For the year ended 31.12.21       |                        |                             |                             |\n| Global Wealth Management          | (28)                   | (1)                         | (29)                        |\n| Personal & Corporate Banking      | (62)                   | (24)                        | (86)                        |\n| Asset Management                  | 0                      | 1                           | 1                           |\n| Investment Bank                   | (34)                   | 0                           | (34)                        |\n| Non-core and Legacy               | 0                      | 0                           | 0                           |\n| Group Items 1                     | 0                      | 0                           | 0                           |\n| Total                             | (123)                  | (25)                        | (148)                       |\n\n## Audited | Overview of measurement, monitoring and management techniques\n\n- - Credit risk from transactions with individual counterparties is based on our estimates of probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD). Limits are established for individual counterparties and groups of related counterparties covering banking and traded products, and for settlement amounts. Risk authorities are approved by the Board of Directors and are delegated to the Group CEO, the Group Chief Risk Officer (the CRO) and divisional CROs, based on risk exposure amounts, internal credit rating and potential for losses.\n- - Limits apply not only to the current outstanding amount but also to contingent commitments and the potential future exposure of traded products.",

        "page_content": "- - The Investment Bank monitoring, measurement and limit framework distinguishes between exposures intended to be held to maturity (take-and-hold exposures) and those intended for distribution or risk transfer (temporary exposures).\n- - We use models to derive portfolio credit risk measures of expected loss, statistical loss and stress loss at firm-wide and business division levels, and to establish portfolio limits.\n- - Credit risk concentrations can arise if clients are engaged in similar activities, located in the same geographical region or have comparable economic characteristics, e.g., if their ability to meet contractual obligations would be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. To avoid credit risk concentrations, we establish limits /  operational controls that constrain risk concentrations at portfolio, sub-portfolio or counterparty levels for sector exposure, country risk and specific product exposures. \uf070\n\n## Credit risk profile of UBS AG\n\nThe exposures detailed in this section are based on management's view of credit risk, which differs in certain respects from the ECL measurement requirements of IFRS Accounting Standards.\n\nInternally,  credit  risk  exposures  are  put  into  two  broad  categories:  banking  products  and  traded  products.  Banking products include drawn loans, guarantees and loan commitments, amounts due from banks, balances at central banks, and other financial assets at amortized cost. Traded products include over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives  (ETDs)  and  securities  financing  transactions  (SFTs),  consisting  of  securities  borrowing  and  lending,  and repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.\n\n## Banking and traded products exposure in our business divisions and Group Items\n\n|

Most of our USD 139bn of Lombard loans, including traded products collateralized by securities, were of high quality, with 91% rated as investment grade based on our internal ratings. Moreover, Lombard loans are typically uncommitted, shortterm in nature and can be canceled immediately if the collateral quality deteriorates and margin calls are not met. Lending values in the Lombard book are derived by applying discounts to the pledged collateral's market value in line with a possible adverse change in market value over a given close-out period and confidence level. Less liquid or more volatile collateral will typically have larger haircuts. In 2023, the Lombard book, including traded products, decreased approximately 10%, mainly driven by the US, from a larger amount of clients paying down as a result of the repricing of loans at current rates, and Asia Pacific, where deleveraging already started in the second half of 2021 and had slowed by the end of 2023. The share of non-standard Lombard loans, for example those with less liquid or concentrated collateral, slightly increased to 7% from 5% of the total Lombard book.\n\nThe mortgage book (residential and commercial real estate) increased by approximately 9%, mainly driven by higher volumes of mortgage loans within the Swiss and the US residential and commercial real estate portfolios.\n\nOther financings represent approximately 8% of the total banking products exposures and are consolidated in a corporate and other portfolio that increased 17% in 2023, mainly through the private equity subscription facilities portfolio in the US.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Lending secured by real estate' and 'Lombard lending' in this section for further information on these types of lending\n\n## Collateralization of Loans and advances to customers 1\n\n|                                                                                                         | Global Wealth Management   | Global Wealth Management   | Personal & Corporate Banking   | Personal & Corporate Banking   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| USD m, except where indicated                                                                           | 31.12.23                   | 31.12.22                   | 31.12.23                       | 31.12.22                       |\n| Secured by collateral                                                                                   | 210,243                    | 216,993                    | 157,278                        | 138,854                        |\n| Residential real estate                                                                                 | 67,910                     | 62,200                     | 126,199                        | 110,500                        |\n| Commercial / industrial real estate                                                                     | 5,045                      | 4,955                      | 22,632                         | 19,795                         |\n| Cash                                                                                                    | 24,797                     | 30,514                     | 2,750                          | 3,039                          |\n| Equity and debt instruments                                                                             | 96,371                     | 107,253                    | 2,626                          | 2,228                          |\n| Other collateral  2                                                                                     | 16,121                     | 12,071                     | 3,071                          | 3,293                          |\n| Subject to guarantees                                                                                   | 92                         | 144                        | 2,706                          | 2,758                          |\n| Uncollateralized and not subject to guarantees                                                          | 3,042                      | 2,247                      | 14,441                         | 13,136                         |\n| Total loans and advances to customers, gross                                                            | 213,377                    | 219,385                    | 174,425                        | 154,748                        |\n| Allowances                                                                                              | (147)                      | (138)                      | (634)                          | (559)                          |\n| Total loans and advances to customers, net of allowances                                                | 213,230                    | 219,247                    | 173,791                        | 154,189                        |\n| Collateralized loans and advances to customers in % of total loans and advances to customers, gross (%) | 98.5                       | 98.9                       | 90.2                           | 89.7                           |\n\n## Personal & Corporate Banking\n\nGross  banking  products  exposure  within  Personal  &  Corporate  Banking  increased  to  USD 255bn,  compared  with USD 237bn in 2022. Net banking products exposure (excluding exposure reallocated from Group Treasury) increased to USD 205bn (CHF 173bn), of which approximately 65% was classified as investment grade, broadly unchanged from 2022. Around 48% of the exposure is categorized in the lowest LGD bucket, i.e., 0-25%, unchanged compared with 2022.\n\nPersonal & Corporate Banking's gross loan portfolio was USD 174bn (CHF 147bn) compared with USD 155bn (CHF 143bn) in 2022. This portfolio is predominantly denominated in Swiss francs and the increase in US dollar terms was largely due to the effect of the Swiss franc appreciating. As of 31 December 2023, 90% of this portfolio was secured by collateral, mainly residential and commercial property. Of the total unsecured amount, 86% related to cash flow-based lending to corporate counterparties and 3% related to lending to public authorities. Based on our internal ratings, 57% of the unsecured loan portfolio was rated as investment grade, compared with 53% in 2022.\n\nOur Swiss corporate banking products take-and-hold portfolio, which was USD 38bn (CHF 32bn) and increased by USD 2bn compared with 2022, consists of loans, guarantees and loan commitments to multi-national and domestic counterparties. The  small  and  medium-sized  entity  (SME)  portfolio,  in  particular,  is  well  diversified  across  industries.  However,  such companies are reliant on the domestic economy and the economies to which they export, in particular the EU and the US.",

These mortgage loans (excluding loans on self-used commercial real estate), totaling USD 193bn (CHF 162bn), mainly originate from Personal & Corporate Banking, but also from Global Wealth Management Region Switzerland. Of these mortgage loans, USD 174bn (CHF 146bn) related to residential properties that the borrower was either  occupying  or  renting  out,  with  full  recourse  to  the  borrower.  Of  this  USD 174bn  (CHF 146bn),  USD 125bn (CHF 105bn) is related to properties occupied by the borrower, with an average LTV ratio of 50%, compared with 51% as of 31 December 2022.

The business is broadly diversified across industry sectors, but concentrated in North America.\n\nGross banking products exposure decreased to USD 70bn as of 31 December 2023, compared with USD 77bn as of 31 December 2022, mostly driven by balances at central banks allocated to the business division. Excluding balances at central banks and Group Treasury reallocations, gross banking products exposure increased to USD 37bn from USD 32bn in 2022, mostly driven by an increase in irrevocable loan commitments. Based on our internal ratings, 49% of this gross banking products exposure was classified as investment grade. The vast majority of the gross banking products exposure had an estimated LGD below 50%.\n\nIn  the  Investment  Bank,  mandated  temporary  loan  underwriting  exposure  as  of  the  end  of  2023  was  USD 2.1bn, compared with USD 2.6bn at the end of the prior year. USD 50m of commitments had not yet been distributed as originally planned as of 31 December 2023.

This takes into account possible effects of market movements on the exposure and any associated collateral over the time it would take to close out our positions. Limits are applied to the potential future exposure per counterparty, with  the  size  of  the  limit  dependent  on  the  counterparty's  creditworthiness  (as  determined  by  Risk  Control).  Limit frameworks are also used to control overall exposure to specific sectors. Such portfolio limits are monitored and reported to senior management.\n\nTrading in OTC derivatives is conducted through central counterparties where practicable. Where central counterparties are not used, we have clearly defined policies and processes for trading on a bilateral basis. Trading is typically conducted under bilateral International Swaps and Derivatives Association or similar master netting agreements, which generally allow for close-out and netting of transactions in case of default, subject to applicable law. For certain counterparties, initial margin is taken to cover some or all of the calculated close-out exposure. This is in addition to the variation margin taken to settle changes in market value of transactions. For most major market participant counterparties, two-way collateral agreements under which either party can be required to provide collateral in the form of cash or marketable securities  are  used  when  the  exposure  exceeds  specified  levels.  Non-cash  collateral  typically  consists  of  well-rated government debt or other collateral acceptable to Risk Control and permitted by applicable regulations. Regulations on margining uncleared OTC derivatives have generally expanded the scope of bilateral derivatives activity subject to initial margining  and  increased  the  amounts  of  initial  margin  received  from,  and  posted  to,  certain  bilateral  trading counterparties, resulting in lower close-out risk over time. \uf070",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk mitigation\n\nAudited | UBS AG actively manages credit risk in its portfolios by taking collateral against exposures and by utilizing credit hedging. \uf070\n\n## Lending secured by real estate\n\nAudited | UBS AG uses a scoring model as part of a standardized front-to-back process for credit decisions on originating or modifying Swiss mortgage loans. The model's two key factors are the LTV ratio and an affordability calculation. \uf070\n\nThe calculation of affordability takes into account interest payments, minimum amortization requirements and potential property maintenance costs in relation to gross income or rental income for rental properties. The interest rate is set at 5% per annum in the context of the current environment.\n\nFor residential properties occupied by the borrower, the maximum LTV for the standard approval process is 80%. For IPRE, the maximum LTV allowed within the standard approval process ranges from 30% to 75%, depending on the type and age of the property, and the amount of renovation work needed.\n\nAudited | The value assigned to each property is based on the lowest value determined from model-derived valuations, the purchase  price,  an  asset  value  for  income-producing  real  estate  (IPRE),  and,  in  some  cases,  an  additional  external valuation. \uf070\n\nSeparate models provided by a market-leading external vendor are used to derive property valuations for owner-occupied residential properties (ORPs) and IPRE. We estimate the current value of an ORP using a regression model (a hedonic model) based on statistical comparison against current transaction data. The value of a property is derived from the characteristics of the real estate itself, as well as those of its location. In addition to the initial valuation, values for ORPs are updated regularly over the lifetime of the loan using region-specific real estate price indices or hedonic valuation. The price indices are sourced from an external vendor and subject to internal validation and benchmarking. UBS AG uses these valuations regularly to compute indexed LTV for all ORPs. A portfolio-specific monitoring system considers these along with other risk measures (e.g., rating and behavioral information) to identify higher-risk loans.\n\nFor IPRE, the capitalization rate model is used to determine the property valuation by discounting estimated sustainable future income using a capitalization rate based on various attributes. These attributes consider regional and specific property characteristics, such as market and location data (e.g., vacancy rates), benchmarks (e.g., for running costs), and certain other standardized input parameters (e.g., property condition). Updated information regarding rental income from IPRE is requested from the client at least once every three years. Our portfolio-specific monitoring system alerts us to changes in rental income and other risk measures (e.g., LTV, rating, behavioral information).\n\nTo take market developments into account for these models, the external vendor regularly updates the parameters and / or refines the architecture for each model. Model changes and parameter updates are subject to the same validation procedures as our internally developed models.\n\nAudited | UBS AG similarly applies underwriting guidelines for our Global Wealth Management Region Americas mortgage loan portfolio, taking into account loan affordability and collateral sufficiency. LTV standards are defined for the various mortgage types, such as residential mortgages or investment properties, based on associated risk factors, such as property type, loan size, and purpose. The maximum LTV allowed within the standard approval process ranges from 45 to 80%. In addition to LTV, other credit risk metrics, such as debt-to-income ratios, credit scores and required client reserves, are also part of our underwriting guidelines.\n\nA risk limit framework is applied to the Global Wealth Management Region Americas mortgage loan portfolio. Limits are set  to  govern  exposures  within  LTV  categories,  geographic  concentrations,  portfolio  growth and high-risk mortgage segments, such as interest-only loans. These limits are monitored by a specialized credit risk monitoring team and reported to senior management. Supplementing this limit framework is a real estate lending policy and procedures framework, set up to govern real estate lending activities. Quality assurance and quality control programs monitor compliance with mortgage underwriting and documentation requirements.\n\nFor  UBS AG's mortgage loan portfolio in the Global Wealth Management regions of EMEA and Asia Pacific, global underwriting guidelines with regional variations are applied to allow for regulatory and market differentials. As in other regions, the underwriting guidelines take into account affordability and collateral sufficiency. Affordability is assessed at a stressed interest rate using, for residential real estate, the borrowers' sustainable income and declared liabilities, and for commercial real estate the quality and sustainability of rental income. For interest-only loans, a declared and evidenced repayment strategy must be in place. The applicable LTV for each mortgage is based on the quality and liquidity of the property and assessed against valuations from bank-appointed third-party valuers. Maximum LTV varies from 30% to 70%, depending on the type and location of the property, as well as other factors. Collateral sufficiency is often further supported by personal guarantees from related third parties. The overall portfolio is centrally assessed against a number of stress scenarios to ensure that exposures remain within predefined stress limits. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Swiss mortgage loan portfolio' in this section for more information about LTV in our Swiss mortgage portfolio",

        "page_content": "## Lombard lending\n\nAudited | Lombard loans are secured by pledges of marketable securities, guarantees and other forms of collateral. Eligible financial securities are primarily liquid and actively traded transferable securities (such as bonds and equities), and other transferable securities, such as approved structured products for which regular prices are available and the issuer of the security provides a market. To a lesser degree, less liquid collateral is also used.\n\nLending values are derived by applying discounts (haircuts) to the pledged collateral's market value. Haircuts for marketable securities are calculated to cover a possible adverse change in market value over a given close-out period and confidence level. Less liquid or more volatile collateral will typically have larger haircuts.\n\nConcentration and correlation risks across collateral posted are assessed at a counterparty level, and at a divisional level across counterparties. Targeted firm-wide reviews of concentration are performed. Concentration of collateral in single securities, issuers or issuer groups, industry sectors, countries, regions or currencies may result in higher risk and reduced liquidity. In such cases, the lending value of the collateral, margin call and close-out levels are adjusted accordingly. \uf070\n\nExposures and collateral market values are monitored daily, with the aim of ensuring that the credit exposure is always within the established risk tolerance. A shortfall occurs when the lending value drops below the exposure; if it exceeds a defined trigger level, a margin call is initiated, requiring the client to provide additional collateral, reduce the exposure or take other action to bring exposure in line with the agreed lending value of the collateral. If a shortfall is not corrected within the required period, a close-out is initiated, through which collateral is liquidated, open derivative positions are closed and guarantees are called.\n\nStress testing of collateralized exposures to simulate market events that reduce market collateral value, increase exposure of traded products, or do both, is conducted. For certain classes of counterparties, limits on such calculated stress exposures are applied and controlled at a counterparty level. Also, portfolio limits are applied across certain businesses or collateral types.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Stress loss' in this section for more information about our stress testing\n\n## Credit hedging\n\nAudited  | UBS AG  uses  single-name  credit  default  swaps  (CDSs),  credit-index  CDSs,  bespoke  protection  and  other instruments to actively manage credit risk. The aim is to reduce concentrations of risk from specific counterparties, sectors or portfolios and, for CCR, the profit or loss effect arising from changes in credit valuation adjustments.\n\nWe have strict guidelines with regard to taking credit hedges into account for credit risk mitigation purposes. For example, when monitoring exposures against counterparty limits, we do not usually apply certain credit risk mitigants, such as proxy hedges (credit protection on a correlated but different name) or credit-index CDSs, to reduce counterparty exposures. Buying credit protection also creates credit exposure with regard to the protection provider. We monitor and limit exposures to credit protection providers, and also monitor the effectiveness of credit hedges as part of our overall credit exposures to the relevant counterparties, which are typically collateralized. For credit protection purchased to hedge the lending portfolio, this includes monitoring mismatches between the maturity of credit protection purchased and the maturity of the associated loan. Such mismatches result in basis risk and may reduce the effectiveness of the credit protection. Mismatches are routinely reported to credit officers and mitigating actions are taken when necessary. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 10 Derivative instruments' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n\n## Mitigation of settlement risk\n\nTo mitigate settlement risk, actual settlement volumes are reduced by using multi-lateral and bi-lateral agreements with counterparties, including payment netting. In relation to the exchange of cash or securities, transactions can be settled on a delivery-versus-payment basis.\n\nForeign exchange transactions are our most significant source of settlement risk. We are a member of Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS), an industry utility that provides a multi-lateral framework to settle transactions on a payment-versuspayment basis, thus reducing foreign-exchange-related settlement risk relative  to  the  volume  of  business.  However, mitigation  of  settlement  risk  through  CLS  and  other  means  does  not  fully  eliminate  credit  risk  in  foreign  exchange transactions resulting from changes in exchange rates prior to settlement, which is managed as part of our overall credit risk management of OTC derivatives.\n\n## Credit risk models\n\n## Basel III - A-IRB credit risk models\n\nAudited  | UBS  AG has developed tools and models to estimate future credit losses that may be implicit in our current portfolio.\n\nExposures to individual counterparties are measured using three generally accepted parameters: PD, EAD and LGD. For a given credit facility, the product of these three parameters results in the expected loss (the EL). These parameters are the basis for the majority of our internal measures of credit risk, and key inputs for regulatory capital calculation under the advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) approach of the Basel III framework. We also use models to derive the portfolio credit risk measures of EL, statistical loss and stress loss. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 31 December 2023 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors, for more information about the regulatory capital calculation under the advanced internal ratings-based approach",

The 'Key features of UBS AG's main credit risk models' table above gives an overview of the approaches used for our main asset classes and presents the main drivers of the PD.\n\nThe ratings of major credit rating agencies, and their mapping to the UBS masterscale and internal PD bands, are shown in the 'Internal UBS rating scale and mapping of external ratings' table above. For Moody's and S&P, the mapping is based on the long-term average of one-year default rates available from these rating agencies, with Fitch ratings being mapped to the equivalent S&P ratings. For each external rating category, the average default rate is compared with our internal PD bands to derive a periodically reviewed mapping to our internal rating scale.\n\n## Exposure at default\n\nEAD is the amount we expect to be owed by a counterparty at the time of possible default. We derive EAD from current exposure to the counterparty and possible future exposure development.\n\nThe EAD of an on-balance sheet loan is its notional amount, while for off-balance sheet commitments that are not drawn, credit conversion factors (CCFs) are used in order to obtain an expected on-balance sheet amount.\n\nFor traded products, we derive EAD by modeling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using a simulation based on a scenario-consistent technique. UBS AG assesses the net amount that may be owed to it or that it may owe to others, taking into account the effect of market movements over the potential time it would take to close out positions.\n\nExposures where there is a material correlation between the factors driving the credit quality of the counterparty and those driving the potential future value of UBS AG's traded products exposure (wrong-way risk) are assessed, and specific controls to mitigate such risks have been established.\n\n## Loss given default\n\nLGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. Our LGD estimates, which consider downturn conditions, include loss of principal, interest and other amounts less recovered amounts. UBS AG determines LGD based on the likely recovery rate of claims against defaulted counterparties, which depends on the type of counterparty and any credit mitigation  due  to  collateral  or  guarantees.  UBS  AG's  estimates  are  supported  by  internal  loss  data  and  external information, where available. If collateral is held, such as marketable securities or a mortgage on a property, LTV ratios are typically a key parameter in determining LGD. For risk-weighted asset (RWA) calculation, floors are applied to LGD in line with regulation.\n\n## Expected loss\n\nUBS AG uses the concept of expected loss to quantify future credit losses that may be implicit in our current portfolio. The expected loss for a given credit facility is a product of the three components described above, i.e., PD, EAD and LGD. We aggregate the expected loss for individual counterparties to derive expected portfolio credit losses.",

For loan commitments and other credit facilities in scope of ECL requirements, expected cash shortfalls are determined by considering expected future drawdowns. Rather than focusing on an average through-the-cycle (TTC) expected annual loss, the purpose of ECL is to estimate the amount of losses inherent in a portfolio based on current conditions and future outlook (a point-in-time (PIT) measure), whereby such a forecast has to include all information available without undue cost and effort, and address multiple scenarios where there is perceived non-linearity between changes in economic conditions and their effect on credit losses. From a credit risk modeling perspective, ECL parameters are generally derivations of the factors assessed for regulatory Basel III EL.\n\n## Comparison of Basel III EL and IFRS 9 ECL credit risk models\n\nThe IFRS 9 ECL concept has a number of key differences from our Basel III credit risk models, both in the loss estimation process and the result thereof. Most notably, regulatory Basel III EL parameters are TTC / downturn estimates, which might  include  a  margin  of  conservatism,  while  IFRS 9  ECL  parameters  are  typically  PIT,  reflecting  current  economic conditions and future outlook. The table below summarizes the main differences. Stage 1 and 2 ECL expenses in 2023 were USD 23m and respective allowances and provisions as of 31 December 2023 were USD 580m. This included ECL allowances and provisions of USD 522m related to positions under the Basel III advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) approach. Basel III EL for non-defaulted positions increased by USD 96m to USD 1,052m.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about our accounting policy for allowances and provisions for ECL including key definitions relevant for the ECL calculation under IFRS 9\n\nThe table below shows the main differences between the two expected loss measures.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Basel III EL (advanced internal ratings-based approach) IFRS 9 ECL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| The Basel III A-IRB approach applies to most credit risk  exposures.

Once an SICR event has occurred, a lifetime ECL is  recognized considering expected default events over the life of the  transaction.    | 12-month versus lifetime expected loss |\n| EAD is the amount we expect a counterparty to owe us at  the time of a possible default. For banking products, EAD  equals the book value as of the reporting date; for traded  products, the vast majority of EAD is modeled. For lending,  EAD is expected to remain constant over a 12-month period.  For loan commitments, a credit conversion factor is applied  to model expected future drawdowns over the 12-month  period, irrespective of the actual maturity of a particular  transaction. The credit conversion factor includes downturn  adjustments. | EAD is generally calculated on the basis of the cash flows that are  expected to be outstanding at the individual points in time during  the life of the transaction.

We therefore perform regular analyses of the evolution of portfolios to identify such changes in the structure and credit quality of portfolios.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Model risk management' in this section for more information\n\n## Backtesting\n\nUBS AG monitors the performance of models by backtesting and benchmarking them, with model outcomes compared with actual results, based on our internal experience and externally observed results. To assess the predictive power of credit exposure models for traded products, such as OTC derivatives and ETD products, we statistically compare predicted future exposure distributions at different forecast horizons with realized values.\n\nFor PD, we derive a predicted distribution of the number of defaults. The observed number of defaults is compared with the upper tail of the predicted distribution. If the observed number of defaults is higher than a given upper tail quantile, we conclude there is evidence that the model may underpredict the number of defaults. Based on historical long-run average default rates and, if required, additional margin of conservatism, we also derive PD calibration targets and a lower boundary. As a general rule, follow-up actions, such as a recalibration of the rating tool, are defined if the portfolio average PD lies below the derived lower boundary.\n\nFor LGD, backtesting statistically tests whether the mean difference between the observed and predicted LGD is zero. If the test fails, there is evidence that our predicted LGD is too low. In such cases, and where these differences are outside expectations, follow-up actions, such as a recalibration of the models, are taken.\n\nCCFs,  used  for  the  calculation  of  EAD  for  undrawn  facilities,  are  dependent  on  several  credit  facility  contractual dimensions.  We  compare  the  predicted  amount  drawn  with  observed  historical  use  of  such  facilities  by  defaulted counterparties. If any statistically significant deviation is observed, follow-up actions, such as an update of the relevant CCFs, are performed.\n\n## Changes to models and model parameters during the period\n\nAs part of our continuous efforts to enhance models to reflect market developments and newly available data, we updated several models in 2023.\n\nIn Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management models, we recalibrated the risk parameters for the income-producing real estate mortgages in Switzerland and implemented a model update for the Swiss corporate PD model. In addition, we recalibrated the PD and LGD models for the commodity trade finance business within Personal & Corporate  Banking  and  updated  the  LGD  model  for  corporate  clients  and  financial  institutions.  In  Global  Wealth Management, we also implemented a model update for the standard Lombard model.\n\nIn the Investment Bank, new PD models, corporations, insurance companies and managed funds went live. In addition, certain RWA multipliers were recalibrated as a result of improvements to models.\n\nWhere required, changes to models and model parameters were approved by FINMA before being made.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk-weighted assets' in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about the effect of the changes to models and model parameters on credit risk RWA",

        "page_content": "## Future credit risk-related regulatory capital developments\n\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the BCBS) announced the finalization of the Basel III framework. In November 2023, the Swiss Federal Council published the national implementation of the final Basel III standards, which is expected to enter into force by January 2025. The updated framework makes a number of revisions to the internal ratings-based (IRB) approaches, namely: (i) removing the option of using the A-IRB approach for certain asset classes (including large and medium-sized corporate clients, and banks and other financial institutions); (ii) placing floors on certain model inputs under the IRB approach, e.g., PD and LGD; and (iii) introducing various requirements to reduce RWA variability (e.g., for LGD). In addition, revisions to the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) framework were published in November 2023, including the removal of the advanced CVA approach. UBS has a close dialogue with FINMA to discuss in detail the implementation objectives and prepare for a smooth transition of the capital regime for credit risk.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Capital management objectives, planning and activities' in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about the development of RWA\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk measurement' in this section for more information about our approach to model confirmation procedures\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Regulatory and legal developments' and 'Risk factors' sections of this report for more information\n\n## Credit policies for distressed assets\n\n## Non-performing\n\nAudited | In line with the regulatory definition, we report a claim as non-performing when: (i) it is more than 90 days past due; (ii) it is subject to restructuring proceedings, where preferential conditions concerning interest rates, subordination, tenor, etc. have been granted in order to avoid default of the counterparty (forbearance); (iii) the counterparty is subject to  bankruptcy  /  enforced  liquidation  proceedings  in  any  form,  even  if  there  is  sufficient  collateral  to  cover  the  due payment; or (iv) there is other evidence that payment obligations will not be fully met without recourse to collateral.\n\n## Default and credit-impaired\n\nUBS AG uses a single definition of default for classifying assets and determining the PD of its obligors for risk modeling purposes.  The  definition  of  default  is  based  on  quantitative  and  qualitative  criteria.  A  counterparty  is  classified  as defaulted when material payments of interest, principal or fees are overdue for more than 90 days, or more than 180 days for certain exposures in relation to loans to private and commercial clients in Personal & Corporate Banking and to private  clients  of  Global  Wealth  Management  Region  Switzerland.  UBS  AG  does  not  consider  the  general  90-day presumption  for  default  recognition  appropriate  for  those  portfolios,  given  the  cure  rates,  which  show  that  strict application of the 90-day criterion would not accurately reflect the inherent credit risk. Counterparties are also classified as defaulted when: bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings or enforced liquidation have commenced; obligations have been restructured on preferential terms (forbearance); or there is other evidence that payment obligations will not be fully met without recourse to collateral. The latter may be the case even if, to date, all contractual payments have been made when due. If one claim against a counterparty is defaulted on, generally all claims against the counterparty are treated as defaulted.\n\nAn instrument is classified as credit impaired if the counterparty is classified as defaulted and / or the instrument is identified as purchased credit impaired (PCI). An instrument is PCI if it has been purchased at a deep discount to its carrying amount following a risk event of the issuer or originated with a defaulted counterparty. Once a financial asset is classified as defaulted / credit impaired (except PCI), it is reported as a stage 3 instrument and remains as such unless all past due amounts have been rectified, additional payments have been made on time, the position is not classified as credit-restructured, and there is general evidence of credit recovery. A three-month probation period is applied before a transfer back to stages 1 or 2 can be triggered. However, most instruments remain in stage 3 for a longer period. \uf070\n\n## Forbearance (credit restructuring)\n\nAudited | If payment default is imminent or default has already occurred, we may grant concessions to borrowers in financial difficulties that we would otherwise not consider in the normal course of business, such as offering preferential interest rates,  extending  maturity,  modifying  the  schedule  of  repayments,  debt  /  equity  swap,  subordination,  etc.  When  a forbearance measure takes place, each case is considered individually and the exposure is generally classified as defaulted. Forbearance classification remains until the loan is repaid or written off, non-preferential conditions are granted that supersede the preferential conditions, or the counterparty has recovered and the preferential conditions no longer exceed our risk tolerance.\n\nContractual  adjustments  when  there  is  no  evidence  of  imminent  payment  default,  or  where  changes  to  terms  and conditions are within our usual risk tolerance, are not considered to be forborne. \uf070",

Trading market risks are mainly connected with primary debt and equity underwriting and securities and derivatives trading for market-making and client facilitation in our Investment Bank, as well as the remaining positions in Noncore and Legacy and our municipal securities trading business in Global Wealth Management.\n- - Non-trading market risks arise predominantly in the form of interest rate and foreign exchange risks connected with personal banking and lending in our wealth management businesses, the Swiss business of our Personal & Corporate Banking business division, the Investment Bank's lending business, and treasury activities.\n- - Group Treasury assumes market risks in the process of managing interest rate risk, structural foreign exchange risk and the Group's liquidity and funding profile, including high-quality liquid assets (HQLA).\n- - Equity and debt investments can also give rise to market risks, as can some aspects of employee benefits, such as defined benefit pension schemes. \uf070\n\n## Audited | Overview of measurement, monitoring and management techniques\n\n- - Market risk limits are set for the Group, the business divisions and Group Treasury at granular levels in the various business lines, reflecting the nature and magnitude of the market risks.\n- - Management value-at-risk (VaR) measures exposures under the market risk framework, including trading market risks and  some  non-trading  market  risks.  Non-trading  market  risks  not  included  in  VaR  are  also  covered  in  the  risks controlled by Market and Treasury Risk Control functions.\n- - Our primary portfolio measures of market risk are liquidity-adjusted stress loss and VaR. Both are subject to limits that are approved by the Board of Directors (the BoD).\n- - These measures are complemented by concentration and granular limits for general and specific market risk factors. Our trading businesses are subject to multiple market risk limits, which take into account the extent of market liquidity and volatility, available operational capacity, valuation uncertainty, and, for our single-name exposures, issuer credit quality.\n- - Trading  market  risks  are  managed  at  portfolio  level.  As  risk  factor  sensitivities  change  due  to  new  transactions, transaction expiries or changes in market levels, risk factors are dynamically rehedged to remain within limits. We do not generally seek to distinguish in the trading portfolio between specific positions and associated hedges.",

The framework captures the economic losses that could arise under specified stress scenarios. Shocks are applied to positions based on expected market movements in the liquidity-adjusted holding periods resulting from the specified scenario.\n\nThe holding periods used for liquidity-adjusted stress are calibrated to reflect the time needed to reduce or hedge the risk of positions in each major risk factor in a stressed environment. UBS AG applies minimum holding periods, regardless of observed liquidity levels, as identification of and reaction to a crisis may not always be immediate.\n\nThe expected market movements are derived using historical market behavior (based on analysis of historical events) and forward-looking analysis including consideration of defined scenarios that have not occurred in the past.\n\nStress-based limits apply at several levels of the organizational hierarchy. Liquidity-adjusted stress is also the core market risk component of our combined stress test framework and therefore integral to our overall risk appetite framework.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk appetite framework' in this section for more information\n- \u203a Refer to 'Stress testing' in this section for more information about our stress testing framework\n\n## Value-at-risk\n\n## VaR definition\n\nAudited | VaR is a statistical measure of market risk, quantifying the potential market risk losses over a set time horizon (holding period) at an established level of confidence. VaR assumes no change in UBS AG's trading positions over the set time horizon.\n\nUBS AG calculates VaR daily. The profit or loss distribution from which VaR is estimated is derived from our internally developed VaR model, which simulates returns over the holding period for risk factors our trading positions are sensitive to, and subsequently quantifies the profit / loss effect of these risk factor returns on our trading positions. Systematic commodity, credit, equity, foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk factor returns are based on a pure historical simulation approach. UBS AG uses an unweighted five-year look-back window. Modeling idiosyncratic and specific risks for equity and credit risk factors using historical simulation is challenging, due to the limited availability of continuous good-quality historical data. UBS AG relies upon factor models to distinguish systematic and idiosyncratic returns. UBS AG simulates idiosyncratic returns through a Monte Carlo simulation, aggregating the sum of systematic and residual returns in such a way that systematic and residual risk are consistently captured. When modeling risk factor returns, we consider the stationarity properties of the historical time series of risk factor changes. Depending on the stationarity properties of the  risk  factors  within  a  given  factor  class,  the  factor  returns  are  modeled  using  absolute  returns,  proportional  or logarithmic returns. Risk factor return distributions are updated fortnightly.\n\nRisk factor returns are converted into profit or loss values via sensitivities and full revaluation grids sourced from frontoffice systems, enabling us to capture material non-linear effects.",

For  internal  management purposes, risk limits are established and exposures measured using VaR at a 95% confidence level with a 1-day holding period, aligned to the way we consider the risks associated with our trading activities. The regulatory measure of market risk  used  to  underpin  the  market  risk  capital  requirement  under  Basel III  involves  a  measure  equivalent  to  a  99% confidence level using a 10-day holding period. To calculate a 10-day holding period VaR, we use 10-day risk factor returns.\n\nAdditionally, the portfolio populations for management and regulatory VaR are slightly different.

For example, regulatory VaR excludes credit spread risks from the securitization portfolio, which are treated instead under the securitization approach for regulatory purposes.\n\nWe also use stressed VaR (SVaR) for the calculation of market risk RWA. SVaR uses broadly the same methodology as regulatory VaR and is calculated using the same population, holding period (10-day) and confidence level (99%). For SVaR, UBS AG identifies the most significant one-year period of financial stress from a historical dataset covering the period from 1 January 2007 to the present. SVaR is computed weekly at a minimum. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 31 December 2023 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors, for more information about the regulatory capital calculation under the advanced internal ratings-based approach\n\n## Management VaR for the period\n\nUBS AG continued to maintain management VaR at low levels, with average VaR increasing to USD 15m from USD 11m in 2023, mainly driven by the Investment Bank's Global Markets business.\n\n## Audited |\n\nManagement value-at-risk (1-day, 95% confidence, 5 years of historical

        "page_content": "## VaR limitations\n\nAudited | Actual realized market risk losses may differ from those implied by VaR for a variety of reasons.\n\n- - VaR is calibrated to a specified level of confidence and may not indicate potential losses beyond this confidence level.\n- - The 1-day time horizon used for VaR for internal management purposes (10-day for regulatory VaR) may not fully capture market risk of positions that cannot be closed out or hedged within the specified period.\n- - In  some  cases,  VaR  calculations  approximate  the  effect  of  changes  in  risk  factors  on  the  values  of  positions  and portfolios.\n- - Effects  of  extreme  market  movements  are  subject  to  estimation  errors,  which  may  result  from  non-linear  risk sensitivities,  and  the  potential for actual volatility and correlation levels to differ from assumptions implicit in VaR calculations.\n- - The choice of a longer historical window means sudden increases in market volatility will tend not to increase VaR as quickly as the use of shorter historical observation periods, but such increases will affect VaR for a longer period of time. Similarly, after periods of increased volatility, as markets stabilize, VaR predictions will remain more conservative for a period of time influenced by the length of the historical observation period.\n\nSVaR is subject to the limitations noted for VaR above, but the use of one-year datasets avoids the smoothing effect of longer datasets used for VaR. In addition, the ability to select a one-year period outside of recent market history allows for a wider variety of potential loss events. Therefore, although the significant period of stress during the 2007-2009 financial crisis is no longer contained in the look-back window used for management and regulatory VaR, SVaR continues to use that data. This approach aims to reduce the procyclicality of the regulatory capital requirements for market risks.\n\nUBS AG recognizes that no single measure can encompass all risks associated with a position or portfolio. We use a set of metrics with both overlapping and complementary characteristics to create a holistic framework that aims to ensure material completeness of risk identification and measurement. As a statistical aggregate risk measure, VaR supplements our comprehensive stress testing framework.\n\nWe also have a framework to identify and quantify potential risks not fully captured by our VaR model and refer to such risks as risks not in VaR. The framework underpins these potential risks with additional regulatory capital. \uf070\n\n## Backtesting of VaR\n\nVaR backtesting is a performance measurement process in which a 1-day VaR prediction is compared with the realized 1-day profit or loss (P&L). We compute backtesting VaR using a 99% confidence level and 1-day holding period for the regulatory  VaR  population.  Since  99%  VaR  is  defined  as  a  risk  measure  that  operates  on  the  lower  tail  of  the  P&L distribution, 99% backtesting VaR is a negative number. Backtesting revenues exclude non-trading revenues, such as valuation reserves, fees and commissions, and revenues from intraday trading, so as to provide a like-for-like comparison. A backtesting exception occurs when backtesting revenues are lower than the previous day's backtesting VaR.\n\nUBS Group excluding Credit Suisse:\u00b9 development of regulatory backtesting revenues\u00b2 and actual trading revenues\u00b3 against backtesting VaR 4 (1-day, 99% confidence)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The chart is based on UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse as the risk profile compared with UBS AG does not materially differ. 2 Excludes non-trading revenues, such as valuation reserves, commissions and fees, and revenues from intraday trading. 3 Includes backtesting revenues and  revenues from intraday trading. 4 Based on Basel III regulatory VaR, excludes CVA positions and their eligible hedges, which are subject to the standalone CVA charge.",

        "page_content": "Statistically, given the 99% confidence level, two or three backtesting exceptions a year can be expected. More than four exceptions could indicate that the VaR model is not performing appropriately, as could too few exceptions over a long period. However, as noted for VaR limitations above, a sudden increase (or decrease) in market volatility relative to the volatility observed in the look-back window could lead to a higher (or lower) number of exceptions. Therefore, backtesting exceptions are investigated, as are exceptional positive backtesting revenues, with the results reported to senior business management and regulators.\n\nThe number of negative backtesting exceptions within a 250-business-day window decreased to zero from one by the end  of  2023.  The  Swiss  Financial  Market  Supervisory  Authority  (FINMA)  VaR  multiplier  derived  from  backtesting exceptions for market risk RWA was unchanged compared with the prior year, at 3.0.\n\n## VaR model confirmation\n\nIn addition to the for-regulatory-purposes backtesting described above, we conduct extended backtesting for internal model confirmation purposes. This includes observing model performance across the entire P&L distribution (not just the tails) and at multiple levels within the business division hierarchies.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk measurement' in this section for more information about our approach to model confirmation procedures\n\n## VaR model developments in 2023\n\nAudited | No material changes were made to the UBS AG VaR model in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Future market risk-related regulatory capital developments\n\nIn January 2019, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the BCBS) published the final standards on the minimum capital requirements for market risk (the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book). In December 2022, the Swiss State Secretariat for International Finance changed the expected date on which the final Basel III guidelines are to enter into force, from 1 July 2024 to 1 January 2025. As a result, the Swiss implementation timeline would be aligned to the currently  expected  implementation  timeline  in  the  EU.  In  November  2023,  the  Swiss  Federal  Council  adopted amendments to the Capital Adequacy Ordinance (the CAO) for banks to incorporate the final Basel III standards adopted by the BCBS in Swiss law. The Federal Department of Finance (FDF) will inform the Federal Council again about the status of international implementation by the end of July 2024.\n\nKey elements of the revised market risk framework include: (i) changes to the internal model-based approach, including changes to the model approval and performance measurement process; (ii) changes to the standardized approach with the aim of it being a credible fallback method for an internal model-based approach; and (iii) a revised boundary between the trading book and the banking book. UBS maintains a close dialogue with FINMA to discuss the implementation objectives in more detail and to provide a smooth transition of the capital regime for market risk.\n\nIn September 2021, FINMA mandated UBS to hold an RWA add-on for the omission of time decay in regulatory VaR and SVaR. The add-on reflects the outcome of discussions with FINMA regarding our regulatory VaR model, which started in late 2019. The integration of time decay into the regulatory VaR model went live in January 2024.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk-weighted assets' in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about the development of RWA including the regulatory add-on\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk measurement' in this section for more information about our approach to model confirmation procedures\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Regulatory and legal developments' and 'Risk factors' sections of this report for more information\n\n## Interest rate risk in the banking book\n\n## Sources of interest rate risk in the banking book\n\nAudited | IRRBB arises from balance sheet positions such as amounts due from banks, Loans and advances to customers, Financial assets at fair value not held for trading, Financial assets measured at amortized cost, Customer deposits, Debt issued measured at amortized cost, and derivatives, including those subject to hedge accounting. Fair value changes to these positions may affect other comprehensive income (OCI) or the income statement, depending on their accounting treatment.\n\nUBS AG's largest banking book interest rate exposures arise from customer deposits and lending products in Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking, as well as from debt issuance, liquidity buffers and interest rate hedges in Group Treasury. The inherent interest rate risks stemming from Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking are generally transferred to Group Treasury, to manage them centrally together with our modeled interest rate duration assigned to equity, goodwill and real estate. This makes the netting of interest rate risks across different sources possible, while leaving the originating businesses with commercial margin and volume management. The residual interest rate risk is mainly hedged with interest rate swaps, to the vast majority of which we apply hedge accounting. Short-term exposures and HQLA classified as Financial assets at fair value not held for trading are hedged with derivatives accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. Long-term fixed-rate debt issued and HQLA hedged with external interest rate swaps are designated in fair value hedge accounting relationships.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management and governance\n\nIRRBB is measured using several metrics, the most relevant of which are the following.\n\n- - EVE sensitivity to yield curve moves is calculated as changes in the present value of future cash flows irrespective of accounting treatment. These yield curve moves are also the key risk factors for statistical and stress-based measures, e.g., VaR and stress scenarios, as well as the regulatory interest rate scenarios. These are measured and reported daily. The regulatory IRRBB EVE exposure is the most adverse regulatory interest rate scenario that is netted across currencies. It excludes the sensitivity from additional tier 1 (AT1) capital instruments (as per specific FINMA requirements) and the modeled interest rate duration assigned to equity, goodwill and real estate. UBS AG also applies granular internal interest rate shock scenarios to its banking book positions to monitor its specific risk profile.\n- - Net interest income (NII) sensitivities to yield curve moves are calculated as changes of baseline NII over a set time horizon, which we internally compute by assuming interest rates in all currencies develop according to their marketimplied forward rates and assuming constant business volumes and product mix and no specific management actions. The sensitivities are measured and reported monthly.\n\nUBS AG actively manages IRRBB, with the aim of reducing the volatility of NII subject to limits and triggers for EVE and NII exposure at consolidated and significant legal entity levels.\n\nThe  Group  Asset  and  Liability  Committee  (the  ALCO)  and,  where  relevant,  ALCOs  at  a  legal  entity  level  perform independent  oversight  over  the  management  of  IRRBB,  which  is  also  subject  to  Group  Internal  Audit  and  model governance.\n\n## \u203a Refer to 'Risk measurement' in this section for more information\n\n## Key modeling assumptions\n\nThe cash flows from customer deposits and lending products used in calculation of EVE sensitivity exclude commercial margins and other spread components, are aggregated by daily time buckets and are discounted using risk-free rates. Our external issuances are discounted using UBS's senior debt curve, and capital instruments are modeled to the first call date. NII sensitivity, which includes commercial margins, is calculated over a one-year time horizon, assuming constant balance sheet structure and volumes, and considers embedded interest rate options.\n\nThe average repricing maturity of non-maturing deposits and loans is determined via target replication portfolios designed to protect product margins. Optimal replicating portfolios are determined at granular currency- and product-specific levels by simulating and applying a real-world market rate model to historically calibrated client rate and volume models.\n\nUBS AG uses an econometric prepayment model to forecast prepayment rates on US mortgage loans in UBS Bank USA and  agency  mortgage-backed  securities  (MBSs)  held  in  various  liquidity  portfolios  of  UBS  Americas  Holding  LLC consolidated.  These  prepayment  rates  are  used  to  forecast  both  mortgage  loan  and  MBS  balances  under  various macroeconomic scenarios. The prepayment model is used for a variety of purposes, including risk management and regulatory  stress  testing.  Swiss  mortgages  and  fixed-term  deposits  generally  do  not  carry  similar  optionality,  due  to prepayment and early redemption penalties. \uf070\n\n## Effect of interest rate changes on shareholders' equity and CET1 capital\n\nThe 'Accounting and capital effect of changes in interest rates' table below shows the effects on shareholders' equity and CET1 capital of gains and losses from changes in interest rates in the main banking book positions. We use derivatives to hedge interest rate risks in the banking book and these reflect changes in interest rates as an immediate fair value gain or loss, recognized either in the income statement or through OCI. Where hedged items are accrual accounted, we aim to minimize accounting asymmetries by applying hedge accounting to reflect the economic hedge relationship.\n\nIn a rising rate scenario, we would have an initial decrease in shareholders' equity as a result of fair value losses on our derivatives recognized in OCI while we would expect higher NII over time as rates increase. The effect on CET1 capital would be much lower as gains and losses on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are not recognized for regulatory capital purposes.",

This excludes the sensitivity of USD 4.8m from AT1 capital instruments (as per specific FINMA requirements) in contrast to general BCBS guidance.\n\nThe majority of our interest rate risk in the banking book is a reflection of the net asset duration that we run to offset our modeled sensitivity of net USD 22.4m (31 December 2022: USD 19.6m) assigned to our equity, goodwill and real estate, with the aim of generating a stable NII contribution. Of this, USD 15.8m and USD 5.6m are attributable to the US dollar and the Swiss franc portfolios, respectively (31 December 2022: USD 14.0m and USD 4.8m, respectively).\n\nIn addition to the sensitivity mentioned above, we calculate the six interest rate shock scenarios prescribed by FINMA. The 'Parallel up' scenario, assuming all positions were fair valued, was the most severe and would have resulted in a change in EVE of negative USD 5.3bn, or 9.3%, of our tier 1 capital (31 December 2022: negative USD 4.6bn, or 8.4%), which is well below the 15% threshold as per the BCBS supervisory outlier test for high levels of interest rate risk in the banking book.\n\nThe immediate effect on UBS AG's tier 1 capital in the 'Parallel up' scenario as of 31 December 2023 would have been a decrease of USD 0.5bn, or 0.9% (31 December 2022: USD 0.4bn, or 0.7%), reflecting the fact that the vast majority of our banking book is accrual accounted or subject to hedge accounting. The 'Parallel up' scenario would subsequently have a positive effect on NII, assuming a constant balance sheet.\n\nUBS AG also applies granular internal interest rate shock scenarios to its banking book positions to monitor the banking book's specific risk profile.\n\n## Net interest income sensitivity\n\nThe main NII sensitivity in the banking book resides in Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking. We assign a target duration to our investment of equity portfolio, and Group Treasury actively manages the residual IRRBB. This sensitivity is assessed using a number of scenarios assuming parallel and non-parallel shifts in yield curves, with various degrees of severity, and we have set and monitor thresholds for the NII sensitivity to immediate parallel shocks of -200 and +200 basis points under the assumption of constant balance sheet volume and structure. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'UBS AG consolidated performance' section for more information about sensitivity to interest rate movements",

Value changes (in US dollars) of non-US dollar assets or liabilities due to foreign exchange movements are recognized in OCI and therefore affect shareholders' equity and CET1 capital.\n\nGroup Treasury uses strategies to manage this foreign currency exposure, including matched funding of assets and liabilities and net investment hedging.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about our exposure to and management of structural foreign exchange risk\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 10 Derivative instruments' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about our hedges of net investments in foreign operations\n\n## Equity investments and investment fund units\n\nAudited  | UBS AG makes direct investments in a variety of entities and buys equity holdings in both listed and unlisted companies,  with  the  aim  of  supporting  our  business  activities  and  delivering  strategic  value  to  UBS.  This  includes investments in exchange and clearing house memberships, as well as minority investments in early-stage fintechs and technology companies via UBS Next. We may also make investments in funds that we manage in order to fund or seed them at inception or to demonstrate that our interests align with those of investors. We also buy, and are sometimes required by agreement to buy, securities and units from funds that we have sold to clients.\n\nThe fair  value  of  equity  investments  tends  to  be  influenced  by  factors  specific  to  the  individual  investments.  Equity investments are generally intended to be held for the medium or long term and may be subject to lock-up agreements. For these reasons, we generally do not control these exposures by using market risk measures applied to trading activities. However, such equity investments are subject to a different range of controls, including preapproval of new investments by business management and Risk Control, portfolio and concentration limits, and regular monitoring and reporting to senior management. They are also included in our firm-wide statistical and stress-testing metrics, which flow into our risk appetite framework.\n\n\uf070",

This can result from falls in the value of a plan's assets or in the investment returns, increases in defined benefit obligations, or combinations of the above.\n\nImportant risk factors affecting the fair value of pension plans' assets include equity market returns, interest rates, bond yields,  and real estate prices. Important risk factors affecting the present value of expected future benefit payments include high-grade bond yields, interest rates, inflation rates, and life expectancy.\n\nPension risk is included in our firm-wide statistical and stress-testing metrics, which flow into our risk appetite framework. The potential effects are thus captured in the post-stress capital ratio calculations.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies' and 'Note 26 Post-employment benefit plans' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about defined benefit plans\n\n## Country risk\n\n## Country risk framework\n\nCountry risk includes all country-specific events occurring in a sovereign jurisdiction that may lead to impairment of UBS AG's exposures. It may take the form of: (i) sovereign risk, which is the ability and willingness of a government to honor its  financial  commitments; (ii) transfer risk,  which arises if a counterparty or issuer cannot acquire foreign currencies following a moratorium by a central bank on foreign exchange transfers; or (iii) 'other' country risk. 'Other' country risk may manifest itself through, on the one hand, increased and multiple counterparty and issuer default risk (systemic risk)  and,  on  the  other  hand,  events that may affect a country's standing, such as adverse shocks affecting political stability or institutional and / or legal frameworks. UBS AG has a well-established risk control framework to assess the risk profiles of all countries where we have exposure.",

        "page_content": "We assign a country rating to each country, which reflects our view of its creditworthiness and of the probability of a country risk event occurring. Country ratings are mapped to statistically derived default probabilities, described under 'Probability of default' in this section. We use this internal analysis to set the credit ratings of governments and central banks, estimate the probability of a transfer event occurring, and establish rules on how aspects of country risk should be incorporated in counterparty ratings of non-sovereign entities domiciled in the respective country.\n\nCountry ratings are also used to define UBS AG's risk appetite regarding foreign countries. A country risk limit (i.e., maximum aggregate exposure) applies to exposures to counterparties or issuers of securities and financial investments in the given foreign country. UBS AG may limit the extension of credit, transactions in traded products or positions in securities based on a country risk ceiling even if its exposure to a counterparty is otherwise acceptable.\n\nFor internal measurement and control of country risk, UBS AG also considers the financial effect of market disruptions arising prior to, during and after a country crisis. These may take the form of a severe deterioration in a country's debt, equity or other asset markets, or a sharp depreciation of its currency. We use stress testing to assess potential financial effects of severe country or sovereign crises. This involves the developing of plausible stress scenarios for combined stress testing and the identification of countries that may potentially be subject to a crisis event, determining potential losses and making assumptions about recovery rates depending on the types of credit transactions involved and their economic importance to the affected countries.\n\n## Country risk exposure\n\n## Country risk exposure measure\n\nThe presentation of country risk follows our internal risk view, where the basis for measuring exposures depends on the product category in which we classify the exposures. In addition to the classification of exposures into banking products and traded products, covered in 'Credit risk profile of UBS AG' in this section, in the trading inventory UBS AG classifies issuer risk on securities such as bonds and equities, as well as risk relating to underlying reference assets for derivative positions.\n\nThe trading inventory is managed on a net basis, and the value of long positions is netted against that of short positions with the same underlying issuer. Net exposures are, however, floored at zero per issuer in the figures presented in the following tables. As a result, potentially offsetting benefits of certain hedges and short positions across issuers are not recognized.\n\nWe do not recognize any expected recovery values when reporting country exposures as exposure before hedges, except for  risk-reducing  effects  of  master  netting  agreements  and  collateral  held  in  either  cash  or  portfolios  of  diversified marketable  securities,  which  we  deduct  from  the  potential  exposure  values.  Within  banking  products  and  traded products, risk-reducing effects of credit protection are generally taken into account on a notional basis when determining the net of hedge exposures.\n\n## Country risk exposure allocation\n\nIn general, exposures are shown against the country of domicile of the contractual counterparty or the issuer of the security.  For  some counterparties whose economic substance in terms of assets or source of revenues is primarily located in a different country, the exposure is allocated to the risk domicile of those assets or revenues.\n\nWe apply a specific approach for banking products exposures to branches of banks that are located in a country other than the legal entity's domicile. In such cases, exposures are recorded in full against the country of domicile of the counterparty and additionally in full against the country where the branch is located.\n\nIn the case of derivatives, we show the counterparty's risk potential exposure against the counterparty's country of risk (presented  within  traded  products).  In  addition,  risk  associated  with  an  instantaneous  fall  in  value  of  underlying reference assets to zero (assuming no recovery) is shown against the country of risk of the issuer of the reference asset (presented within trading inventory). This approach allows us to capture both counterparty and, where applicable, issuer elements of risk arising from derivatives and applies comprehensively for all derivatives, including single-name credit default swaps (CDSs) and other credit derivatives.\n\nCDSs are primarily bought and sold in relation to our trading businesses, and, to a much lesser degree, used to hedge credit  valuation  adjustments.  Holding  CDSs  for  credit  default  protection  does  not  necessarily  protect  the  buyer  of protection against losses, as contracts only pay out under certain scenarios. The effectiveness of our CDS protection as a hedge of default risk is influenced by several factors, including the contractual terms under which a given CDS was written. Generally, only the occurrence of credit events as defined by the CDS contract's terms (which may include, among other events, failure to pay, restructuring or bankruptcy) results in payments under the purchased credit protection contracts.  For  CDS  contracts  on  sovereign  obligations,  repudiation  can  also  be  deemed  as  a  default  event.  The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) determination committees (composed of various ISDA member firms) based on the terms of the CDS and the facts and circumstances surrounding the event.",

Net exposure to the UK increased by USD 8.7bn, driven by central bank exposures due to treasury activities.\n\nBased on the sovereign rating categories, as of 31 December 2023, 88% of UBS AG's emerging market country exposure was rated investment grade, compared with 87% as of 31 December 2022.\n\n## Israel\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, UBS AG's direct country risk exposure to Israel was USD 289m, mainly from lending and collateralized  OTC  derivatives  exposure  within  the  Investment  Bank.  UBS  AG's  direct  exposure  to  Gulf  Cooperation Council countries was USD 2.5bn. The direct exposure to Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon is limited, and UBS AG has no direct exposure to Iran, Iraq or Syria.\n\n## Russia\n\nUBS  AG's  direct  country  risk  exposure  to  Russia  contributed  USD 66m  to  our  total  emerging  market  exposure  of USD 22.0bn as of 31 December 2023, compared with a contribution of USD 98m as of 31 December 2022.

Similarly, we identify and manage climate risks, including climate-related financial risks, in our own operations, balance sheet, client assets and supply chain on the UBS Group level.\n\nClimate-related metrics for UBS AG are presented in the UBS Group Annual Report 2023.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Sustainability and climate risk' in the 'Risk management and control' section of the UBS Group Annual Report 2023, available under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Our sustainability and impact strategy' section of the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information\n\n## Non-financial risk\n\nNon-financial  risk  is  the  risk  of  undue  monetary  loss  and  /  or  non-monetary  adverse  consequences  resulting  from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and / or systems, failure to comply with laws and regulations and internal policies and procedures, or external events (deliberate, accidental or natural) that have an impact on UBS, its clients or its markets.\n\n## Key developments\n\nWe have identified nine non-financial risk themes as being currently key to us. These are:\n\n- - governance and legal structure integration;\n- - financial and regulatory reporting;\n- - operational resilience, stability and cybersecurity;\n- - data life cycle;\n- - investor protection and market interaction;\n- - strategic growth initiatives and cross-divisional interaction;\n- - the evolving nature of anti-money laundering (AML), know your client (KYC), sanctions, anti-bribery and corruption (ABC), and fraud;\n- - employee conduct, capacity and culture; and\n- - environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks.\n\nUBS continues to actively manage the non-financial risks emerging from the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, including  the  current  operation  of  dual  corporate  structures,  and  the  scale,  pace  and  complexity  of  the  required integration activities. These activities continue to be managed by the program run by our Group Integration Office. The integration of Credit Suisse requires data to be migrated into the UBS environment and we aim to ensure that we have robust controls to preserve data integrity, quality and availability to mitigate data migration risks and to meet regulatory expectations.\n\nThrough this period of change, we place an increased focus on maintaining and enhancing our control environment and continue to cooperate with regulators in relation to the submission and execution of implementation plans to meet regulatory expectations, including remediation requirements applicable to Credit Suisse AG. In addition, the Group is closely monitoring non-financial risk indicators to detect any potential for adverse impacts on the control environment.\n\nThere is an increased risk of cyber-related operational disruption to business activities at our locations and / or those of third-party suppliers due to operating an enlarged group of entities. This is combined with the increasingly dynamic threat environment,  which  is  intensified  by  current  geopolitical  factors  and  evidenced  by  the  increased  volumes  and sophistication of cyberattacks against financial institutions globally.\n\nCyberattacks on third-party vendors have affected our operations in the past and continue to be a source of residual risk to our business. We remain on heightened alert to respond to and mitigate elevated cyber- and information-security threats. During the first quarter of 2023, a third-party vendor, ION XTP, suffered a ransomware attack, which resulted in some disruption to our exchange-traded derivatives clearing activities, although we restored our services within 36 hours, using an available alternative solution. Following a post-incident review, we are improving our frameworks for managing third parties that support our important business services and are taking actions to enhance our cyber-risk assessments and controls over third-party vendors. We continue to invest in improving our technology infrastructure and informationsecurity governance to improve our defense, detection and response capabilities against cyberattacks.\n\nIn  addition,  we  are  working  to  enhance  our  operational  resilience  to  address  these  heightened  risks  and  to  meet regulatory  deadlines  through  2026.  We  are  implementing  a  global  framework  designed  to  drive  enhancements  in operational resilience across all business divisions and relevant jurisdictions, as well as working with the third parties, including vendors, that are of critical importance to our operations to assess their operational resilience against our standards.",

        "page_content": "The increasing interest in data-driven advisory processes, and use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, is opening up new questions related to the fairness of AI algorithms, data life-cycle management, data ethics, data privacy and security, and records management. In addition, new risks continue to emerge, such as those that result from the demand from our clients for distributed ledger technology, blockchain-based assets and cryptocurrencies; however, we currently have limited exposure to such risks, and relevant control frameworks for them are implemented and reviewed on a regular basis as they evolve.\n\nCompetition to find new business opportunities, products and services across the financial services sector, both for firms and for customers, is increasing, particularly during periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. Thus, suitability risk,  product  selection,  cross-divisional  service  offerings,  quality  of  advice  and  price  transparency  remain  areas  of heightened focus for UBS and for the industry as a whole.\n\nEvolving ESG regulations and major legislation, such as the Consumer Duty regulation in the United Kingdom, the Swiss Financial Services Act (FIDLEG) in Switzerland, Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) in the US and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) in the EU, all significantly affect the industry and have required adjustments to control processes.\n\nCross-border risk (including unintended permanent establishment) remains an area of regulatory attention for global financial institutions, including a focus on market access, such as third-country market access into the European Economic Area, and taxation of US persons. We maintain a series of controls designed to address these risks, and we are increasing the number of controls that are automated.\n\nFinancial  crime,  including  money  laundering,  terrorist  financing,  sanctions  violations,  fraud,  bribery  and  corruption, continues to present a major risk, as technological innovation and geopolitical developments increase the complexity of doing business and heightened regulatory attention continues. An effective financial crime prevention program therefore remains essential, and we continue to focus on strategic enhancements to our global AML, KYC and sanctions programs. Money laundering and financial fraud techniques are becoming increasingly sophisticated,  and  geopolitical  volatility makes the sanctions landscape more complex. The extensive and continuously evolving sanctions arising from the RussiaUkraine war require constant attention to prevent circumvention risks, while the conflicts in the Middle East may increase terrorist-financing risks.\n\nIn the US, UBS AG entered into a Consent Order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC) in May 2018 relating to our US branch AML and KYC programs. In response, we have introduced significant improvements to our framework for the purpose of ensuring sustainable remediation of US-relevant Bank Secrecy Act / AML issues across all our US legal entities.\n\nAchieving fair outcomes for our clients, upholding market integrity and cultivating the highest standards of employee conduct are of critical importance to us. We maintain a conduct risk framework across our activities, which is designed to align our standards and conduct with these objectives and to retain momentum on fostering a strong culture.\n\nIn  September  2022,  the  US  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the  SEC)  and  the  Commodity  Futures  Trading Commission (the CFTC) issued settlement orders relating  to  communications  recordkeeping  requirements  in  our  US broker-dealers and our registered swap dealers. In response to shortcomings identified in that context, we continued work on a global remediation program started in 2022.\n\n## Non-financial risk framework\n\nWe follow a Group-wide non-financial risk framework that establishes requirements for identifying, managing, assessing and mitigating operational, compliance and financial crime risks to achieve an agreed balance between risk and return. It is built on the following pillars:\n\n- - classifying inherent risks through 19 non-financial risk taxonomies, which define the universe of material non-financial risks that can arise as a consequence of our business activities and external factors;\n- - performing control assurance activities, including self-assessing the design and operating effectiveness of controls, first- and second-line-of-defense control reviews and independent control testing;\n- - defining  the  non-financial  risk  appetite  (including  a  financial  risk  appetite  statement  at  the  Group,  UBS AG  and business  division  levels  for  non-financial  risk  events)  through  quantitative  metrics  and  thresholds  and  qualitative measures, and assessing risk exposure against appetite;\n- - assessing  inherent  and  residual  risk  through  risk  assessment  processes  and  determining  whether  additional remediation plans are required to address identified deficiencies; and\n- - proactively and sustainably remediating identified control deficiencies.\n\nDivisional Presidents are accountable for the effectiveness of non-financial risk management and for the robustness of the front-to-back control environment within their business divisions, and legal-entity-responsible executives are in charge of non-financial risk management within their legal entities. Group function heads are accountable for supporting the divisional Presidents and legal-entity-responsible executives of our legal entities in the discharge of this responsibility, by confirming completeness and effectiveness of the control environment and non-financial risk management within their Group functions. Collectively, divisional Presidents, central Group function heads and legal-entity-responsible executives are in charge of implementing the non-financial risk framework.",

C&ORC business- or functionaligned  teams  sit  within  the  Group  Compliance,  Regulatory  &  Governance  function,  reporting  to  the  Group  Chief Compliance and Governance Officer, who is a member of the Group Executive Board.\n\nThe non-financial risk framework forms the common basis for managing and assessing compliance risk, financial crime risk  and  operational  risk,  and  there  are  additional  C&ORC  activities  intended  to  ensure  we  are  able  to  demonstrate compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n\nIn 2023, we successfully executed on the framework enhancements designed in 2022, with, for example, several cycles of risk appetite assessments performed on the basis of the Group-wide non-financial risk appetite statements across all taxonomies. We focused on improving effectiveness by simplifying and digitalizing the non-financial risk framework and respective processes.\n\nAll functions within UBS are required to periodically assess the design and operating effectiveness of key internal nonfinancial risk controls. The output of these reviews supports the assessment and testing scope of internal controls over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Section 404 (SOX 404).\n\nKey control deficiencies identified during the internal control and risk assessment processes must be reported in the nonfinancial  risk  inventory,  and  sustainable  remediation  must  be  defined  and  executed.  These  control  deficiencies  are assigned to owners at senior management level and the remediation progress is reflected in the respective managers' annual performance measurement and objectives. To assist with prioritizing the most material control deficiencies and measuring aggregated risk exposure, irrespective of origin, a common rating methodology is applied across all three lines of defense, as well as by external audit.\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\nCybersecurity for UBS AG is integrated into the UBS Group risk control framework.\n\n## Risk management and strategy\n\nCyber- and information security risk is the risk that a malicious internal or external act, or a failure of IT hardware or software,  or  human  error  may  have  a  material  impact  on  confidentiality,  integrity,  or  availability  of  UBS's  data  or information systems.\n\nCybersecurity is a key operational risk facing UBS and we devote considerable resources to establishing and maintaining processes for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risk through our global workforce and cyber-operations centers around the world.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk governance' in this section for information about our approach to risk management, including our risk governance framework\n\n## Governance\n\nIn line with our overall non-financial risk management framework, we take a cross-functional approach to addressing cybersecurity risk, with the Group Operations and Technology Office (GOTO), business divisions, Group Compliance, Regulatory & Governance (GCRG), Group Risk Control, Group Legal, and Group Internal Audit all playing key roles. Our risk control framework follows the three-lines-of-defense model. GOTO establishes the policies and procedures designed to safeguard our information systems and the information those systems collect and process. The business divisions, together with GOTO, are then responsible for implementing those policies and procedures as part of the first line of defense. Group Compliance, Regulatory & Governance (GCRG) leads the second line of defense, by convening and consulting with additional control functions to provide independent oversight, and challenges the first line's cybersecurity framework and implementation. As the third line of defense, Group Internal Audit conducts independent reviews and validates the first-line and second-line processes and functions.\n\nThe Cyber- and Information Security Committee (the CIS-C) is the primary decision-making body with oversight of and accountability for the Group-wide cyber- and information security (CIS) program. The committee is jointly chaired by the Group Chief Operations and Technology Officer and the Group Chief Compliance and Governance Officer. The Head Group Internal Audit is a standing guest. The committee meets on a monthly basis and serves as a platform for interaction across all business divisions, Group functions and the three lines of defense for the identification and effective governance of  CIS  strategy,  risks  and  regulatory  obligations.  The  CIS-C  governance  structure  is  intended  to  streamline  decisionmaking and, where necessary, escalation to the Board of Directors (the BoD) and Group Executive Board (GEB), who maintain overall responsibility for overseeing UBS.\n\nBecause Credit Suisse and UBS still have separate digital platforms, Credit Suisse maintained much of its pre-acquisition cyber- and information security governance during 2023, but was increasingly aligned to the UBS CIS risk governance framework. Credit Suisse's CIS program is led by the Credit Suisse Chief Information Security Officer, who reports to the Credit  Suisse  Chief  Technology  Officer  and  the  UBS  Group  Chief  Information  Security  Officer  (the  Group  CISO).  In addition, the Credit Suisse Chief Technology Officer and Credit Suisse Chief Operations Officer report to the Group Chief Operations and Technology Officer.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Cybersecurity governance' in 'Board of Directors' in the 'Corporate governance' section of this report for more information",

        "page_content": "## Our cyber- and information security program\n\nOur CIS program is led by the Group CISO, who reports both to the Group Chief Operations and Technology Officer and the Group Chief Compliance and Governance Officer. The CIS program is designed to identify, prevent, detect and respond to CIS events, with the goal of maintaining the integrity and availability of our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality  and  integrity  of  our  information.  Our  Group  CISO,  senior  management  within  GOTO,  as  well  as management personnel overseeing the CIS program, all have substantial relevant expertise in the areas of cyber- and information security. Our CIS program includes the following elements:\n\n- -Threat intelligence: We systematically gather threat information and monitor threat alerts from external sources. Our cyber-threat  intelligence  team  analyzes  such  information  and  uses  it  to  enhance  existing  defense  capabilities,  to respond to identified threats and to adjust our cybersecurity strategy where needed.\n- -Preventative and detection controls: We use layered firm-wide controls to prevent and detect cyberattacks. Defenses include system hardening, firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, and other controls. External network connections are identified and recorded in an inventory. Access rights are defined for information assets, and IT systems and applications enforce authentication. We maintain access controls and approval processes designed to prevent unauthorized access.\n- -Cyber-defense and incident response capabilities :  The Cybersecurity Operations Center is responsible for providing 24/7/365 real-time monitoring, detection and response capabilities for cybersecurity threats and attacks. Incidents assessed as having the potential to adversely affect our critical operations are subject to mandatory management notification.  If  assessed  as  potentially  significant,  cybersecurity  and  data  incidents  are  managed  under  our  crisis management framework.\n- -Education and training: All UBS staff, including the external workforce, receive appropriate CIS awareness training, commensurate with their roles and responsibilities.\n- -Third-party risk: Vulnerabilities in the cyber-risk environment of third parties represent a particular threat to our CIS and our ability to maintain our business services. We follow a risk-based approach to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks related to third parties. Third-party services and processes are monitored and checked on an ongoing basis, with appropriate  supervision  from  the  CIS-C.  This  is  a  key  component  of  our  third-party  risk  management  program, notwithstanding the challenges we face in imposing the same levels of protection to the systems and data of third parties that we rely on ourselves.\n- -Monitoring  and  testing: Effective  incident  response  and  problem  management  processes  are  complemented  by vulnerability assessments, penetration and testing engagements based on specific threat scenarios that simulate tactics, techniques  and  procedures  that  might  be  used  against  our  systems,  as  mandated  by  our  policy  regulations.  This includes testing by internal and external red teams. Actual security-related events are directly correlated with threat scenarios to monitor and detect potential threats, such as network-intrusion and malware-driven events. Our deployed security measures are designed with the objective to isolate and contain threats that are detected to allow for effective incident response and analysis.\n\n## Our cybersecurity assessment framework\n\nOur cybersecurity assessment framework includes internal and external cybersecurity risk assessments for applications and bank processes alongside a structured risk assessment process of third-party service providers. These processes are designed, along with our security capabilities, to support business objectives and priorities.\n\nWe conduct  assessments  to  evaluate  and  test  our  cybersecurity  program,  and  provide  guidance  on  operating  and improving the CIS program, including the design and operational effectiveness of the security  and resiliency  of  our information systems. Our assessments, along with our threat intelligence capabilities, are used to assess and prioritize programs to improve our security, our incident response capabilities and our operational resilience. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves at an increasing pace, we seek to enhance our cybersecurity controls to meet developing threats. We have ongoing programs that are intended to increase our cybersecurity maturity across various dimensions, including governance, identification, protection and detection, as well as cyberattack response and recovery, and risk from thirdparty service providers.\n\nWe recognize that we will never be able to completely eliminate the risk of a future cyberattack, but, by using a riskbased approach, we work toward reducing the likelihood of a successful attack and toward mitigation of the potential business impact of such an attack.\n\nThe BoD, its Risk Committee and the GEB receive regular presentations and reports throughout the year from our Group Chief Operations and Technology Officer and our Group CISO on internal and external cybersecurity developments, threats and risks. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the BoD receives reports on the performance of cybersecurity risk appetite metrics, including metrics on vulnerabilities and third-party cybersecurity risks and incidents, and is notified promptly if a Board-level cybersecurity risk limit is breached. The Risk Committee of the BoD and the GEB also receive regular updates on CIS strategy, risks and alignment with regulatory requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Operational resilience and incident response\n\nOur business continuity and resilience framework is designed to limit the disruption cybersecurity events cause to our business activities. In accordance with the firm's cyber-incident response framework, the CIS-C, including the incident response  team,  tracks,  documents,  responds  to  and  analyzes  cybersecurity  threats  and  incidents,  including  those experienced by the firm's third-party service providers that may impact the firm. Additionally, we maintain established procedures for responding to, and escalating, cybersecurity and other system availability incidents. These are regularly practiced, including tabletop exercises up to and including the GEB and BoD levels.\n\nOur cybersecurity and data confidentiality contingency plans include event playbooks and escalation procedures designed to support a structured assessment of potential incidents and timely escalation and reporting of incidents based on the assessed potential impact. Incidents assessed to have the potential to adversely affect our critical operations are subject to  mandatory  management  notification.  If  assessed  as  potentially  significant,  cybersecurity  and  data  incidents  are managed  under  our  crisis  management  framework,  which  provides  pre-established  cross-functional  task  forces  to manage the incident, ensure appropriate and timely regulatory, market and client communications and robust oversight by management, with escalation frameworks to inform and ensure oversight by the GEB and the BoD.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Crisis management framework' in the 'Regulation and supervision' section of this report for more information about our crisis management framework\n\n## Advanced measurement approach model\n\nThe non-financial risk framework outlined above underpins the calculation of regulatory capital for operational risk, which enables us to quantify operational risk and define effective risk-mitigating management incentives as part of the related operational risk capital allocation approach to the business divisions.\n\nWe  measure  Group  operational  risk  exposure  and  calculate  operational  risk  regulatory  capital  using  the  advanced measurement  approach  (AMA)  in  accordance  with  Swiss  Financial  Market  Supervisory  Authority  (FINMA)  and international requirements. In 2023, we introduced an aggregation of the AMAs for UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG to report on total operational-risk-related risk-weighted assets (RWA) for the UBS Group. The related diversification effect, agreed with FINMA, resulted in a USD 10bn reduction for reported RWA from the second quarter of 2023 onward, of which USD 4.9bn was recognized for UBS AG.\n\nAn entity-specific AMA model has been applied for UBS Switzerland AG, while for other regulated entities the basic indicators or standardized approaches are adopted for regulatory capital in agreement with local regulators. Also, the methodology of the UBS AMA is leveraged for entity-specific internal capital adequacy assessment processes.\n\nCurrently, the model includes 18 AMA units of measure (UoM), which are aligned with our non-financial risk taxonomy. Frequency and severity distributions are calibrated for each of the model's UoM. The modeled distribution functions for both frequency and severity are used to generate the annual loss distribution. The resulting 99.9% quantile of the overall annual operational risk loss distribution across all UoM determines the required regulatory capital. Currently, we do not reflect mitigation through insurance or any other risk transfer mechanism in our AMA model.\n\n## AMA model calibration and review\n\nA  key  assumption  when  calibrating  data-driven  frequency  and  severity  distributions  is  that  historical  losses  form  a reasonable proxy for future events. In line with regulatory expectations, the AMA methodology utilizes both historical internal losses and external losses suffered by the broader industry for model calibration purposes.\n\nInitial model outputs driven by the loss history are reviewed and adjusted to reflect fast-changing external developments, such as new regulations, geopolitical change, volatile market and economic conditions, and internal factors (e.g., changes in business strategy and control framework enhancements). The resulting baseline data-driven frequency and severity distributions  are  reviewed  by  subject  matter  experts  and  where  necessary  adjusted  based  on  a  review  of  qualitative information about the business environment and internal control factors, as well as expert judgment, with the aim of forecasting losses.\n\nOur model is reviewed regularly to maintain risk sensitivity and recalibrated at least annually. Any changes to regulatory capital  as  a  result  of  a  recalibration  or  methodology  changes  are  presented  to  FINMA  for  approval  prior  to  use  for disclosure purposes.\n\nThe  Group-  and  entity-specific  AMA  models  are  subject  to  an  independent  validation  performed  by  Model  Risk Management & Control in line with the Group's model risk management framework.\n\nThe AMA is expected to be replaced by the standardized approach for regulatory capital determination purposes in line with the relevant Basel Committee for Banking Supervision Basel III capital regulations. UBS is interacting closely with the relevant Swiss authorities to discuss the implementation details and related implementation timeline.",

We believe that our capital strength, consistent with our capital guidance, is a source of confidence for our stakeholders, contributes to our sound credit ratings and is one of the foundations of our success.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'We may be unable to maintain our capital strength' in the 'Risk factors' section of this report for more information about capital ratio-related risks\n- \u203a Refer to 'Capital and capital ratios of our significant regulated subsidiaries' in this section for more information\n- \u203a Refer to 'Economic capital measures' in the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information about capital-at-risk\n\n## Swiss SRB total loss-absorbing capacity framework\n\nThe disclosures in this section are provided for UBS AG on a consolidated basis and focus on key developments during the reporting period and information in accordance with the Basel III framework, as applicable to Swiss SRBs.\n\nAdditional regulatory disclosures for UBS AG on a consolidated basis are provided in the 31 December 2023 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors .\n\nCapital and other regulatory information for UBS Group AG consolidated in accordance with the Basel III framework, as applicable to Swiss SRBs, is provided in the UBS Group Annual Report 2023, available under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors .\n\n## Regulatory framework\n\nThe  Basel III  framework  came  into  effect  in  Switzerland  on  1 January  2013  and  is  embedded  in  the  Swiss  Capital Adequacy Ordinance (the CAO). The CAO also includes the too-big-to-fail provisions applicable to Swiss SRBs.\n\nUnder the Swiss SRB framework, going and gone concern requirements represent the UBS AG's TLAC requirement. TLAC encompasses regulatory capital, such as CET1, loss-absorbing additional tier 1 (AT1) and tier 2 capital instruments, and liabilities that can be written down or converted into equity in case of resolution or for the purpose of restructuring measures.\n\n## Capital and other instruments contributing to total loss-absorbing capacity\n\nIn addition to CET1 capital, the following instruments contribute to loss-absorbing capacity:\n\n- - loss-absorbing AT1 capital instruments (high- and low-trigger);\n- - non-Basel III-compliant tier 2 capital instruments; and\n- - TLAC-eligible unsecured debt instruments.\n\nUnder the Swiss SRB rules, going concern capital includes CET1 and high-trigger loss-absorbing AT1 capital instruments. Existing outstanding low-trigger loss-absorbing AT1 capital instruments are available to meet the going concern capital requirements until their first call date. As of their first call date, these instruments are eligible to meet the gone concern requirements.\n\nOutstanding  high-  and  low-trigger  loss-absorbing  tier 2  capital  instruments,  non-Basel III-compliant  tier 2  capital instruments and TLAC-eligible unsecured debt instruments are eligible to meet gone concern requirements until one year before  maturity.  A  maximum  of  25%  of  the  gone  concern  requirements  can  be  met  with  instruments  that  have  a remaining maturity of between one and two years (i.e., are in the last year of eligibility). However, once at least 75% of the gone concern requirement has been met with instruments that have a remaining maturity of greater than two years, all instruments that have a remaining maturity of between one and two years remain eligible to be included in the total gone concern capital.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Bondholder information,' available at ubs.com/investors, for more information about the eligibility and key features and terms and conditions of capital instruments",

        "page_content": "## Total loss-absorbing capacity and leverage ratio requirements\n\n## Going concern capital requirements\n\nUnder the Swiss SRB requirements, total going concern minimum requirements for all Swiss SRBs are a capital ratio requirement of 12.86% of RWA and a leverage ratio requirement of 4.5%. In addition to these minimum requirements, an add-on reflecting the degree of systemic importance is applied, based on market share and LRD. The applicable market share add-on and LRD requirements for UBS AG were both unchanged at 0.72% of RWA and 0.25% of LRD, resulting in add-ons of 1.44% of RWA and 0.50% of LRD.\n\nThe Swiss countercyclical capital buffer, at a maximum level of 2.5% on risk-weighted positions that are directly or indirectly backed by residential properties in Switzerland, increased the minimum CET1 capital requirement by 32 basis points as of 31 December 2023. We also continued to apply countercyclical buffer requirements introduced in other BCBS member jurisdictions, which resulted in an additional buffer requirement of 13 basis points as of 31 December 2023. Overall, countercyclical capital buffers contributed 45 basis points to the minimum CET1 capital requirement as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThe  total  going  concern  capital  requirements  applicable  are  14.75%  of  RWA  (including  countercyclical  buffer requirements) and 5.00% of LRD. Furthermore, of the total going concern capital requirement of 14.75% of RWA, at least 10.45% must be met with CET1 capital, while a maximum of 4.3% can be met with high-trigger loss-absorbing AT1 capital instruments (and our existing outstanding low-trigger AT1 capital instruments, which qualify until their first call date as mentioned above).\n\nSimilarly, of the total going concern leverage ratio requirement of 5.00%, at least 3.5% must be met with CET1 capital, while  a  maximum  of  1.5%  can  be  met  with  high-trigger  loss-absorbing  AT1  capital  instruments  (and  our  existing outstanding low-trigger AT1 capital instruments, which qualify until their first call date as mentioned above).\n\n## Gone concern loss-absorbing capacity requirements\n\nAs an internationally active Swiss SRB, UBS AG is also subject to gone concern loss-absorbing capacity requirements. The gone concern requirements also include add-ons for market share and LRD.\n\nIn November 2022, the Swiss Federal Council adopted amendments to the Banking Act and the Banking Ordinance, which entered into force as of 1 January 2023. The amendments replaced the resolvability discount on the gone concern capital  requirements for systemically important banks (SIBs), including UBS, with reduced base gone concern capital requirements equivalent to 75% of the total going concern requirements (excluding countercyclical buffer requirements). In addition, as of July 2024, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) will have the authority to impose a surcharge of up to 25% of the total going concern requirements (excluding countercyclical buffer requirements) based on obstacles to an SIB's resolvability identified in future resolvability assessments. Our total gone concern requirements remained substantially unchanged in 2023.\n\nOur  gone  concern  requirements  can  be  reduced  when  higher  quality  capital  instruments  (CET1  capital,  low-trigger loss-absorbing AT1 or certain low-trigger tier 2 capital instruments) are used to meet gone concern requirements. As of 31 December 2023, UBS did not use any higher quality capital instruments to fulfill gone concern requirements.\n\nFrom 1 January 2022 onward, the gone concern requirement after the potential reduction for the use of higher quality capital instruments has been floored at 10.0% and 3.75% for the RWA- and LRD-based requirements, respectively.\n\nIn  this  report,  we  refer  to  the  RWA-based  gone  concern  requirements  as  gone  concern  loss-absorbing  capacity requirements and the RWA-based gone concern ratio is referred to as the gone concern loss-absorbing capacity ratio.\n\nThe table below provides the RWA- and LRD-based requirements and information as of 31 December 2023.",

A detailed reconciliation of equity under IFRS Accounting Standards to CET1 capital is provided in the 'Reconciliation of equity under IFRS Accounting Standards to Swiss SRB common equity tier 1 capital' table.\n\nCET1 capital increased by USD 1.2bn to USD 44.1bn as of 31 December 2023, mainly as a result of operating profit before tax of USD 4.5bn, with associated current tax expenses of USD 1.4bn, positive foreign currency translation effects of USD 0.9bn and a net increase of USD 0.2bn in eligible deferred tax assets on temporary differences, partly offset by dividend accruals of USD 3.0bn.\n\nLoss-absorbing AT1 capital issued by the Group and on-lent to UBS AG increased by USD 0.7bn to USD 12.5bn, mainly driven by two issuances of AT1 capital instruments denominated in US dollars of USD 3.5bn and positive impacts from interest risk hedge, foreign currency translation and other effects. These increases were partly offset by a USD 2.5bn AT1 capital instrument that ceased to be eligible as going concern capital when UBS Group AG issued a notice of redemption of the instrument. In addition, high-trigger loss-absorbing AT1 capital instruments of USD 1.1bn equivalent previously on lent from the Group to UBS AG were transferred to Credit Suisse AG. \uf070\n\nAT1 capital instruments issued from the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023 are currently subject to write-down upon occurrence of a trigger event or a viability event. The notes provide, however, that, following approval of a minimum amount of conversion capital by UBS Group AG's shareholders at the 2024 Annual General Meeting, upon the occurrence of a trigger event or a viability event, the notes will be converted into UBS Group AG ordinary shares rather than being subject to a write-down. The corresponding on-lends to UBS AG contain the same provision.\n\n## Gone concern loss-absorbing capacity and movement\n\nAudited | Total gone concern loss-absorbing capacity increased by USD 7.5bn to USD 54.5bn as of 31 December 2023 and included USD 53.9bn of TLAC-eligible unsecured debt issued by the Group and on-lent to UBS AG. \uf070\n\nThe increase of USD 7.5bn mainly reflected new issuances of USD 13.4bn equivalent of TLAC-eligible unsecured debt instruments, as well as positive impacts from interest risk hedge, foreign currency translation and other effects. These increases were partly offset by the redemption of USD 4.0bn equivalent of TLAC-eligible unsecured debt instruments, amortization of a USD 0.8bn unsecured debt instrument that ceased to be TLAC-eligible as its residual time to maturity fell below one year, and a partial repurchase of two TLAC-eligible unsecured debt instruments under a tender offer (in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, UBS announced on 22 March 2023 a tender offer to repurchase two TLAC-eligible  unsecured  debt  instruments,  both  issued  on  17 March  2023,  with  an  initial  nominal  amount  totaling EUR 2.8bn, at their respective re-offer prices; the nominal amounts of the two instruments bought back under the tender offer totaled an equivalent of USD 0.8bn). In addition, a USD 2.4bn low-trigger loss-absorbing tier 2 capital instrument ceased to be eligible as gone concern capital as it had less than one year to maturity.\n\n## Loss-absorbing capacity and leverage ratios\n\nOur CET1 capital ratio decreased to 13.2% from 13.5%, reflecting a USD 16.2bn increase in RWA, partly offset by a USD 1.2bn increase in CET1 capital.\n\nOur CET1 leverage ratio decreased to 4.0% from 4.2%, due to a USD 74.8bn increase in the LRD, partly offset by the aforementioned increase in CET1 capital.\n\nOur gone concern loss-absorbing capacity ratio increased to 16.3% from 14.8%, due to an increase in gone concern loss-absorbing capacity of USD 7.5bn, partly offset by the aforementioned increase in RWA.\n\nOur gone concern leverage ratio increased to 4.9% from 4.6%, driven by the aforementioned increase in gone concern loss-absorbing capacity, partly offset by the increase in the LRD.",

effects from changes in foreign currency rates on our CET1 capital and / or CET1 capital ratio of UBS AG consolidated. A significant portion of our CET1 capital and RWA is denominated in Swiss francs, euro, pounds sterling and other currencies. In order to hedge the CET1 capital ratio, CET1 capital needs to have foreign currency exposure, leading to foreign currency rates sensitivity of CET1 capital.\n\nConsequently, it is not possible to simultaneously fully hedge CET1 capital and the CET1 capital ratio. As the proportion of RWA denominated in currencies other than the US dollar outweighs CET1 capital in such currencies, a significant appreciation of the US dollar against such currencies could benefit our capital ratios, while a significant depreciation of the US dollar against these currencies could adversely affect our capital ratios.\n\nThe UBS AG Asset and Liability Committee has mandated Group Treasury to adjust the currency mix of CET1 capital of UBS AG consolidated, within limits set by the Board of Directors, to balance the effect of foreign exchange movements on CET1 capital and the CET1 capital ratio. Limits are in place for the sensitivity of both CET1 capital and the CET1 capital ratio to an appreciation or depreciation of 10% in the value of the US dollar against other currencies.\n\n## Sensitivity to currency movements\n\n## Risk-weighted assets\n\nWe estimate that a 10% depreciation of the US dollar against other currencies would have increased our RWA by USD 15bn and our CET1 capital by USD 1.5bn as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: USD 13bn and USD 1.4bn, respectively) and decreased our CET1 capital ratio by 12 basis points (31 December 2022: 12 basis points).",

        "page_content": "Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the US dollar against other currencies would have decreased our RWA by USD 13bn and our CET1 capital by USD 1.4bn (31 December 2022: USD 12bn and USD 1.2bn, respectively) and increased our CET1 capital ratio by 12 basis points (31 December 2022: 12 basis points).\n\n## Leverage ratio denominator\n\nOur leverage ratio is also sensitive to foreign exchange movements as a result of the currency mix of our capital and LRD. When adjusting the currency mix in capital, potential effects on the going concern leverage ratio are taken into account and the sensitivity of the going concern leverage ratio to an appreciation or depreciation of 10% in the value of the US dollar against other currencies is actively monitored.\n\nWe estimate  that  a  10%  depreciation  of  the  US  dollar  against  other  currencies  would  have  increased  our  LRD  by USD 69bn as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: USD 62bn) and decreased our CET1 leverage ratio by 10 basis points (31 December 2022: 11 basis points). Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the US dollar against other currencies would have decreased our LRD by USD 62bn (31 December 2022: USD 57bn) and increased our CET1 leverage ratio by 11 basis points (31 December 2022: 12 basis points).\n\nThe aforementioned sensitivities do not consider foreign currency translation effects related to defined benefit plans other than those related to the currency translation of the net equity of foreign operations.\n\n## Estimated effect on capital from litigation, regulatory and similar matters subject to provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nWe have estimated the loss in capital that we could incur as a result of the risks associated with the matters described in 'Note 17 Provisions and contingent liabilities' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report. We have employed for this purpose the advanced measurement approach (AMA) methodology that we use when determining the capital requirements associated with operational risks, based on a 99.9% confidence level over a 12-month horizon. The methodology takes into consideration UBS and industry experience for the AMA operational risk categories to which those matters correspond, as well as the external environment affecting risks of these types, in isolation from other areas. On this basis, we estimate the maximum loss in capital that we could incur over a 12-month period as a result of our risks associated with these operational risk categories at USD 4.0bn as of 31 December 2023. This estimate is not related to and does not take into account any provisions recognized for any of these matters and does not constitute a subjective assessment of our actual exposure in any of these matters.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Non-financial risk' in the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 17 Provisions and contingent liabilities' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n\n## Capital and capital ratios of our significant regulated subsidiaries\n\nUBS AG has contributed a significant portion of capital to, and provided substantial liquidity to its subsidiaries. Many of these  subsidiaries  are  subject  to  regulations  requiring  compliance  with  minimum  capital,  liquidity  and  similar requirements. Regulatory capital components and capital ratios of our significant regulated subsidiaries determined under the regulatory framework of each subsidiary's home jurisdiction are provided in the 'Financial and regulatory key figures for our significant regulated subsidiaries and sub-groups' section of the UBS Group Annual Report 2023, available under 'Annual  reporting'  at ubs.com/investors . Supervisory  authorities  generally  have  discretion  to  impose  higher requirements,  or  to  otherwise  limit  the  activities  of  subsidiaries.  Supervisory  authorities  also  may  require  entities  to measure capital and leverage ratios on a stressed basis and may limit the ability of the entity to engage in new activities or take capital actions based on the results of those tests.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 31 December 2023 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors , for more capital and other regulatory information about our significant regulated subsidiaries and sub-groups\n\n## Joint liability of UBS AG and UBS Switzerland AG\n\nIn June 2015, upon the transfer of the Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management businesses booked in  Switzerland  from  UBS AG  to  UBS  Switzerland  AG,  UBS AG  and  UBS  Switzerland  AG  assumed  joint  liability  for obligations transferred to UBS Switzerland AG and existing at UBS AG, respectively. Under certain circumstances, the Swiss Banking Act and FINMA's Banking Insolvency Ordinance authorize FINMA to modify, extinguish or convert to common equity liabilities of a bank in connection with a resolution or insolvency of such bank.\n\nThe joint liability amounts have declined as obligations matured, terminated or were novated following the transfer date. As  of  31 December  2023,  the  liability  of  UBS  Switzerland  AG  amounted  to  CHF 2.8bn  (USD 3.3bn),  a  decrease  of CHF 1.2bn (USD 1.0bn) compared with 31 December 2022. The respective liability of UBS AG has been substantially extinguished.",

effects.\n\nOn-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives and securities financing transactions) increased by USD 26.8bn, mainly driven by higher trading portfolio assets due to a client-driven increase in hedging activities and market-driven movements in the Investment Bank and higher lending balances, partly offset by lower cash and central bank balances.\n\nDerivative exposures increased by USD 2.8bn, primarily in the Investment Bank, reflecting higher trading volumes across products and lower netting, partly offset by market-driven movements in foreign-currency and interest-rate contracts.\n\nSecurities financing transactions increased by USD 6.6bn, mainly due to higher collateral sourcing activities, partly offset by roll-offs of excess cash reinvestment in Group Treasury.\n\nOff-balance sheet items increased by USD 1.4bn, mainly driven by higher loan commitment across various projects in the Investment Bank.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Balance sheet and off-balance

        "page_content": "## Liquidity and funding management\n\nWe manage the structural risks of our balance sheet, including interest rate risk, structural foreign exchange risk and collateral risk, as well as liquidity and funding risk. This section provides information about liquidity and funding regulatory requirements, governance, management (including sources of liquidity and funding), contingency planning, and stress testing.  The  balances  disclosed  in  this  section  represent  year-end  positions,  unless  indicated  otherwise.  Intra-period balances fluctuate in the ordinary course of business and may differ from year-end positions.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group and the corresponding additional disclosure requirements according to FINMA Circular 2016/1 'Disclosure - banks', we disclose the liquidity coverage ratio (the LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (the NSFR) for UBS AG consolidated for the first time in this section.\n\n## Strategy, objectives and governance\n\nAudited  | Our management of liquidity and funding has the overall objective of protecting our business franchises and prudently managing our internal and regulatory liquidity and funding requirements. We measure liquidity and funding risk using internal and regulatory models and metrics. We define and implement internal stress testing across different time horizons, scenarios and currencies to ensure we have sufficient liquidity and funding, while remaining compliant with regulatory requirements, primarily expressed through the LCR and the NSFR. Our liquidity and funding strategy is proposed by Group Treasury and approved by the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) of UBS AG, which is a committee of the Group Executive Board (the GEB) that is overseen by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the BoD).\n\nLiquidity and funding limits and other indicators (including early-warning indicators) are set at UBS AG (consolidated) and, where appropriate, at legal entity and business division levels. Key limits (under the authority of the BoD) and indicators linked to these limits are reviewed and reconfirmed at least once a year by the BoD of UBS AG, the Executive Board of UBS AG, the ALCO of UBS AG and the Group Treasurer, taking into consideration the Group's business strategy and risk appetite. Treasury Risk Control provides independent oversight over liquidity and funding risk. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Corporate governance' and 'Risk management and control' sections of this report for more information\n\nGroup Treasury monitors and oversees the implementation and execution of our liquidity and funding strategy and manages liquidity and funding risk within the limits and other relevant indicators, thereby adhering to the internal risk appetite and regulatory requirements. This includes close control of both our cash and collateral, including our highquality  liquid  assets  (HQLA),  and  centralizes  the  Group's  access  to  wholesale  cash  markets  in  Group  Treasury.  To complement our business-as-usual management, Group Treasury maintains a Contingency Funding Plan and contributes to plans for recovery and resolution to define procedures throughout the crisis continuum. Group Treasury reports on the liquidity and funding status and position, at least monthly, to the ALCO of UBS AG and the Risk Committee of the BoD.\n\n## Liquidity and funding stress testing\n\nAudited | Our liquidity and funding risk management aims to ensure that the firm has sufficient liquidity and funding to survive a severe idiosyncratic and market-wide liquidity and funding stress event without government support, allowing for discrete management actions.\n\nGroup Treasury maintains a diversified, high-quality pool of unencumbered liquid assets under Treasury control. The liquid asset portfolio is managed dynamically, so as to operate at all times within the internal risk appetite and other relevant Group and subsidiary liquidity and funding requirements. \uf070\n\nOur liquidity and funding stress testing covers two main stress scenarios: a combined (market and idiosyncratic) scenario and a structural market-wide scenario. We continuously refine stress-testing assumptions.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk measurement' in the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information about stress testing\n\n## Combined (market and idiosyncratic) scenario\n\nIn  this  scenario,  UBS  faces  the  consequences  of  both  a  severely  deteriorated  macroeconomic  and  financial  market environment and a UBS-specific event, resulting in an acute loss of liquidity over a relatively short period of time. This scenario represents severe yet plausible events encompassing both market-wide and idiosyncratic elements, in which, however, franchise client relationships are materially maintained.\n\nThe risk appetite objective of this stress test is to ensure that UBS keeps a cumulative liquidity surplus on each day in the three-month stress horizon. The liquidity gap is assessed by modeling the stressed liquidity value of the liquidity buffer and stressed liquidity inflows and outflows under the scenario.",

        "page_content": "## Structural market-wide scenario\n\nIn this scenario, UBS is subject to a significant deterioration of macroeconomic and financial market conditions globally, resulting in a requirement for long-term funding to survive the liquidity drain and support the franchise of the business. Macroeconomic shocks result in deteriorated financial market conditions over the scenario horizon of one year. UBS is assumed to be affected equally relative to other global financial institutions.\n\nThe risk appetite objective of this stress test is to ensure that UBS maintains a positive cumulative behavioral liquidity gap across the 3-month, 6-month, 9-month and 12-month tenors. The liquidity gap is assessed by modeling the stressed liquidity value of the liquidity buffer, and stressed liquidity inflows and outflows under the scenario.\n\n## Funding management\n\nAudited | Group Treasury monitors our funding position, including concentration risk, aiming to ensure that we maintain a well-balanced  and  diversified  liability  structure.  Our  funding  management  team  looks  to  create  the  optimal  liability structure to finance our businesses in a reliable and cost-efficient manner. Our funding activities are planned by analyzing the overall liquidity and funding requirements, taking into account the amount of stable funding that would be needed to support ongoing business activities through periods of difficult market conditions. \uf070\n\nThe funding strategy of UBS AG is set annually in the Funding Plan and is reviewed on an ongoing basis. The Funding Plan is developed by Group Treasury and approved by the ALCO of UBS AG.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Balance sheet and off-balance sheet' in this section for more information about the development of our short- and long-term debt during 2023\n\nGlobal Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking provide significant, cost-efficient and stable sources of funding. These include deposits and debt issued through the Swiss central mortgage institutions, which use a portion of our portfolio of Swiss residential mortgages as collateral to generate long-term funding. In addition, we have several short-, medium- and long-term funding programs under which we issue senior unsecured debt and structured notes, as well as short-term debt. These programs enable UBS to source funding from institutional and private investors who are active in Europe, the US and Asia Pacific. Collectively, these broad product offerings and funding sources, together with the global scope of our business activities, support our funding stability.\n\n## Internal funding and funds transfer pricing\n\nWe use our global liquidity and funding framework to govern the liquidity management of our branches and subsidiaries. Group Treasury meets internal demands for funding by channeling funds from entities generating surplus cash to those in need of financing, except in circumstances where transfer restrictions exist.\n\nFunding costs and benefits are allocated to our business divisions according to our liquidity and funding risk management framework. Our internal funds transfer pricing system aims to incentivize that we have the right balance of assets and liabilities in currencies and tenors.\n\n## Credit ratings\n\nCredit ratings can affect the cost and availability of funding, especially from wholesale unsecured sources. Our credit ratings can also influence the performance of some of our businesses and the levels of client and counterparty confidence. Rating agencies take into account a range of factors when assessing creditworthiness and setting credit ratings. These include  the  company's  strategy,  its  business  position  and  franchise  value,  stability  and  quality  of  earnings,  capital adequacy, risk profile and management, liquidity management, diversification of funding sources, asset quality, and corporate governance. Credit ratings reflect the opinions of the rating agencies and can change at any time.\n\nIn evaluating our liquidity and funding requirements, we consider the potential effect of a reduction in our long-term credit ratings and a corresponding reduction in short-term ratings. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, rating trigger clauses could result in an immediate cash settlement or the need to deliver additional collateral to counterparties from contractual obligations related to over-the-counter (OTC) derivative positions and other obligations. Based on our credit ratings as of 31 December 2023, in the event of a one-notch reduction in our long-term credit ratings of UBS AG and UBS Europe SE, we would have been required to provide USD 0.0bn in cash or other collateral. In the event of a two-notch reduction, it would have been USD 0.3bn and for a three-notch downgrade USD 0.6bn. In the two- and threenotch scenarios the collateral requirements predominantly relate to OTC derivative positions.\n\nIn March 2023, following the announcement of planned acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, rating agencies took following actions regarding UBS AG's ratings: Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited (Fitch) placed its 'AA-' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) on Rating Watch Negative and Moody's Investors Service Limited (Moody's) changed the outlook on its Baseline Credit Assessment and Long-term Senior Debt ratings to Negative. Upon the close of UBS's acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in June 2023, Fitch downgraded the Long-Term IDR of UBS AG to 'A+' from 'AA-' and changed the outlook to Stable, while Moody's maintained all the ratings. S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited (S&P) affirmed UBS AG's Long-term and Short-term issuer credit rating and outlook in March 2023 and, more recently, in February 2024.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Liquidity and funding management are critical to our ongoing performance' in the 'Risk factors' section of this report for more information",

        "page_content": "## Contingency Funding Plan\n\nAudited  | We maintain our Contingency Funding Plan as a preparation and action plan, aiming to ensure we maintain sufficient liquidity to meet payment obligations in a liquidity and funding stress. The plan specifies the processes, tools and responsibilities that we have available to effectively manage liquidity and funding through these periods. Our funding diversification and global scope help to protect our liquidity position in the event of a crisis. Our contingent funding sources include our HQLA portfolios, available Central Bank eligible non-HQLA collateral for liquidity facilities at several major central banks, contingent reductions of trading portfolio assets, and other actions available to the management. \uf070\n\n## Liquidity coverage ratio\n\nThe LCR measures the short-term resilience of a bank's liquidity profile by assessing whether sufficient HQLA are available to meet expected net cash outflows from a significant liquidity stress scenario, as defined by the relevant regulator.\n\nFor UBS AG, HQLA are low-risk unencumbered assets under the control of Group Treasury that are easily and immediately convertible into cash at little or no loss of value, in order to meet liquidity needs. Our HQLA predominantly consist of assets that qualify as Level 1 in the LCR framework, including cash, central bank reserves and government bonds. HQLA are held by UBS AG and its subsidiaries and may include amounts that are available to meet funding and collateral needs in certain jurisdictions but are not readily available for use by UBS AG consolidated as a whole. These limitations are typically the result of local regulatory requirements, including local LCR and large exposure requirements. Funds that are effectively restricted in subsidiaries and branches are excluded from the calculation of UBS AG consolidated HQLA. On this basis, USD 33.5bn of assets were excluded from our daily average UBS AG consolidated HQLA for the fourth quarter of 2023. Amounts held in excess of local liquidity requirements that are not subject to other restrictions are generally available for transfer within UBS AG consolidated.\n\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) standards require an LCR of at least 100%. In a period of financial stress, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) may allow banks to use their HQLA and let their LCR temporarily fall below the minimum threshold. We monitor the LCR in all significant currencies in order to manage any currency mismatches between HQLA and the net expected cash outflows in times of stress.\n\nThe daily average LCR of UBS AG consolidated for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 189.7%\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 31 December 2023 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors, for more information about the LCR on a UBS Group AG consolidated basis\n\n## Liquidity coverage ratio\n\n| USD bn, except where indicated   |   Average 4Q23 1 |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|\n| High-quality liquid assets       |            254.5 |\n| Total net cash outflows 2        |            134.3 |\n| Liquidity coverage ratio (%) 3   |            189.7 |\n\n- 1 Calculated based on an average of 63 data points in the fourth quarter of 2023. 2 Represents the net cash outflows expected over a stress period of 30 calendar days. 3 Calculated after the application of haircuts and inflow and outflow rates, as well as, where applicable, caps on Level 2 assets and cash inflows.\n\n## Too-big-to-fail liquidity requirements\n\nThe too-big-to-fail (TBTF) liquidity requirements communicated by FINMA in the third quarter of 2023 became effective on 1 January 2024. The affected legal entities of UBS AG consolidated are compliant with these requirements.\n\n## Net stable funding ratio\n\nThe NSFR framework is intended to limit overreliance on short-term wholesale funding, to encourage a better assessment of  funding  risk  across  all  on-  and  off-balance  sheet  items  and  to  promote  funding  stability.  The  NSFR  has  two components: available stable funding (ASF), as numerator, and required stable funding (RSF), as denominator. ASF is the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be available over the period of one year. RSF is a measure of the stable funding requirement of assets based on their maturity, encumbrance and other characteristics, as well as the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity from off-balance sheet exposures. The BCBS NSFR regulatory framework requires a ratio of at least 100%.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the NSFR of UBS AG consolidated was 119.6%.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 31 December 2023 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors, for more information about the NSFR on a UBS Group AG consolidated basis\n\n## Net stable funding ratio\n\n| USD bn, except where indicated   |   31.12.23 |\n|----------------------------------|------------|\n| Available stable funding (ASF)   |      602.6 |\n| Required stable funding (RSF)    |      503.8 |\n| Net stable funding ratio (%)     |      119.6 |",

Intra-period balances fluctuate in the ordinary course of business and may differ from year-end positions. Refer to the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about the development of UBS AG's financial position.\n\n## Balance sheet assets\n\nAs  of  31 December  2023,  balance  sheet  assets  totaled  USD 1,156.0bn,  an  increase  of  USD 50.6bn  compared  with 31 December 2022.\n\nLending assets increased by USD 29.1bn, mainly driven by currency effects of approximately USD 21.0bn. The movement not related to currency effects was mainly driven by funding provided by Group Treasury to Credit Suisse, as well as increases in Personal & Corporate Banking, primarily reflecting higher mortgage loans and real estate financing, partly offset by decreases in Lombard loans in Global Wealth Management. Trading portfolio assets increased by USD 27.1bn, mainly in Financing and Derivatives & Solutions in the Investment Bank, reflecting higher inventory held to hedge client positions and market-driven movements. Securities financing transactions at amortized cost increased by USD 6.3bn, mainly reflecting higher net cash reinvestment trades in Group Treasury.\n\nThese increases were partly offset by a USD 21.1bn decrease in Derivatives and cash collateral receivables on derivative instruments. The decrease was mainly in Derivatives & Solutions and Financing, predominantly reflecting decreases in foreign exchange contracts, where the contracts in place at the end of 2023 had lower fair values than the contracts in place at the end of 2022, as well as decreases in interest rate contracts, mainly resulting from valuation effects due to decreases in long-term interest rates. These decreases were partly offset by market-driven increases in equity contracts reflecting a rise in equity markets.\n\n## Assets\n\n|                                                                       | As of    | As of    | % change from   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|-----------------|\n| USD bn                                                                | 31.12.23 | 31.12.22 | 31.12.22        |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                                    | 171.8    | 169.4    | 1               |\n| Lending 1                                                             | 433.8    | 404.7    | 7               |\n| Securities financing transactions at amortized cost                   | 74.1     | 67.8     | 9               |\n| Trading assets                                                        | 135.1    | 108.0    | 25              |\n| Derivatives and cash collateral receivables on derivative instruments | 164.0    | 185.1    | (11)            |\n| Brokerage receivables                                                 | 20.9     | 17.6     | 19              |\n| Other financial assets measured at amortized cost                     | 54.3     | 53.4     | 2               |\n| Other financial assets measured at fair value 2                       | 66.0     | 61.6     | 7               |\n| Non-financial assets                                                  | 35.9     | 37.7     | (5)             |\n| Total assets                                                          | 1,156.0  | 1,105.4  | 5               |\n\n- 1 Consists of Loans and advances to customers and Amounts due from banks. 2 Consists of Financial assets at fair value not held for trading and Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Asset encumbrance\n\nThe table below provides a breakdown of on- and off-balance sheet assets between encumbered assets, unencumbered assets and assets that cannot be pledged as collateral.\n\nAssets are presented as Encumbered if they have been pledged as collateral against an existing liability or are otherwise not available for securing additional funding. Included within the latter category are assets protected under client asset segregation rules, financial assets for unit-linked investment contracts, and assets held in certain jurisdictions to comply with explicit minimum local asset maintenance requirements.\n\nAssets  that  cannot  be  pledged  as  collateral  represent  assets  that  are  not  encumbered  but  by  their  nature  are  not considered available to secure funding or meet collateral needs.\n\nAll other assets are presented as Unencumbered. This category consists of cash and securities readily realizable in the normal course of business, which include high-quality liquid assets and unencumbered positions in the trading portfolio of UBS AG. In addition, unencumbered assets include loans and advances to customers and amounts due from banks. Unencumbered assets that are considered to be available to secure funding at the legal entity level may be subject to restrictions that limit the total amount of assets available to UBS AG as a whole.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 22 Restricted and transferred financial assets' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information",

sheet liabilities\n\nTotal liabilities as of 31 December 2023 were USD 1,100.4bn, an increase of USD 51.9bn compared with 31 December 2022.\n\nCustomer deposits increased by USD 28.5bn, driven by currency effects of approximately USD 21.3bn and non-foreignexchange-related increases of USD 7.2bn, mainly in Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management as a result  of  net  inflows  into  fixed-term  deposit  products,  partly  offset  by  lower  demand  and  sweep  deposits  driven  by continued shifts into money market funds and US-government securities. As of 31 December 2023, the ratio of customer deposits to outstanding loans and advances to customers was at 137% (31 December 2022: 135%).\n\nDebt issued designated at fair value and long-term debt issued measured at amortized cost increased by USD 17.1bn. Debt issued designated at fair value increased by USD 14.5bn, reflecting net new issuances and market-driven increases due to the rise in equity markets. Long-term debt issued measured at amortized cost increased by USD 2.7bn, mainly driven  by  net  new  issuances  of  covered  bonds  and  debt  issued  through  the  Swiss  central  mortgage  institutions. Subordinated  debt  remained  stable  during  2023,  with  one  low-trigger  loss-absorbing  tier  2  capital  instrument  of USD 2.4bn being no longer eligible as a capital instrument as the residual maturity was less than one year. Funding from UBS Group AG measured at amortized cost increased by USD 11.2bn, mainly reflecting higher on-lends eligible as TLAC.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Capital management' section of this report for more information\n\nShort-term borrowings increased by USD 12.7bn, mainly due to net new issuances of commercial paper and certificates of deposit in Group Treasury, as well as an increase in funding obtained from US Federal Home Loan Banks.\n\nThese increases were partly offset by a USD 15.7bn decrease in Derivatives and cash collateral payables on derivative instruments. The decrease was mainly in Derivatives & Solutions and Financing, reflecting the same drivers as on the asset side.\n\n## Equity\n\nEquity attributable to shareholders decreased by USD 1,364m to USD 55,234m as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThis decrease was mainly driven by the 2022 dividend distribution of USD 6,000m to UBS Group AG, partly offset by total comprehensive income attributable to shareholders of USD 4,598m, reflecting net profit of USD 3,290m and other comprehensive income (OCI) of USD 1,308m. OCI mainly included cash flow hedge OCI of USD 1,400m, OCI related to foreign currency translation of USD 849m, negative OCI related to own credit on financial liabilities designated at fair value of USD 790m and negative defined benefit plan OCI of USD 136m.",

As a result, the nominal value per share was changed from CHF 0.10 to USD 0.10, resulting in a reclassification between share capital and capital contribution reserve (presented as share premium in the consolidated financial statements). Total equity reported was not affected by this change.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'UBS AG consolidated performance' and 'Consolidated financial statements' sections of this report for more information about OCI\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Reconciliation of equity under IFRS Accounting Standards to Swiss SRB common equity tier 1 capital' table in this section for more information about the effects of OCI on common equity tier 1 capital\n\n## Liabilities and equity\n\n|                                                                                             | As of    | As of    | % change from   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|-----------------|\n| USD bn                                                                                      | 31.12.23 | 31.12.22 | 31.12.22        |\n| Short-term borrowings 1                                                                     | 54.0     | 41.3     | 31              |\n| Securities financing transactions at amortized cost                                         | 5.8      | 4.2      | 38              |\n| Customer deposits                                                                           | 555.7    | 527.2    | 5               |\n| Funding from UBS Group AG measured at amortized cost                                        | 67.3     | 56.1     | 20              |\n| Debt issued designated at fair value and long-term debt issued measured at amortized cost 2 | 118.8    | 101.7    | 17              |\n| Trading liabilities                                                                         | 31.7     | 29.5     | 7               |\n| Derivatives and cash collateral payables on derivative instruments                          | 175.6    | 191.3    | (8)             |\n| Brokerage payables                                                                          | 42.3     | 45.1     | (6)             |\n| Other financial liabilities measured at amortized cost                                      | 12.7     | 10.4     | 22              |\n| Other financial liabilities designated at fair value                                        | 27.4     | 32.0     | (15)            |\n| Non-financial liabilities                                                                   | 9.2      | 9.7      | (5)             |\n| Total liabilities                                                                           | 1,100.4  | 1,048.5  | 5               |\n| Share capital                                                                               | 0.4      | 0.3      | 14              |\n| Share premium                                                                               | 24.6     | 24.6     | 0               |\n| Retained earnings                                                                           | 28.2     | 31.7     | (11)            |\n| Other comprehensive income 3                                                                | 2.0      | (0.1)    |                 |\n| Total equity attributable to shareholders                                                   | 55.2     | 56.6     | (2)             |\n| Equity attributable to non-controlling interests                                            | 0.3      | 0.3      | (2)             |\n| Total equity                                                                                | 55.6     | 56.9     | (2)             |\n| Total liabilities and equity                                                                | 1,156.0  | 1,105.4  | 5               |\n\n- 1 Consists of short-term debt issued measured at amortized cost and amounts due to banks. 2 The classification of debt issued measured at amortized cost into short-term and long-term is based on original contractual maturity and therefore long-term debt also includes debt with a remaining time to maturity of less than one year.

enters into transactions where, pursuant to IFRS Accounting Standards, the maximum contractual exposure may not be recognized in whole or in part on its balance sheet. These transactions include derivative instruments, guarantees, loan commitments and similar arrangements.\n\nWhen UBS AG incurs an obligation or becomes entitled to an asset through these arrangements, it recognizes them on the balance sheet. It should be noted that in certain instances the amount recognized on the balance sheet does not represent the full gain or loss potential inherent in such arrangements.\n\nThe  following  paragraphs  provide  more  information  about  certain  off-balance  sheet  arrangements.  Additional  offbalance sheet information is primarily provided in Notes 9, 10, 17, 19, 20h, 22 and 28 in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report .\n\n## Guarantees, loan commitments and similar arrangements\n\nIn the normal course of business, UBS AG issues various forms of guarantees, commitments to extend credit, standby and  other  letters  of  credit  to  support  clients,  forward  starting  transactions,  note  issuance  facilities,  and  revolving underwriting facilities. With the exception of related premiums, generally these guarantees and similar obligations are kept as off-balance sheet items, unless a provision to cover probable losses or expected credit losses is required.\n\nGuarantees  represent  irrevocable  assurances  that,  subject  to  the  satisfying  of  certain  conditions,  UBS AG  will  make payments if its clients fail to fulfill their obligations to third parties. As of 31 December 2023, the net exposure (i.e., gross values less sub-participations) from guarantees and similar instruments was USD 31.5bn, compared with USD 20.6bn as of 31 December 2022. The increase of USD 10.9bn, was mainly driven by sponsored repo clearing in Group Treasury. Fee income from issuing guarantees compared with total net fee and commission income is insignificant for both 2023 and 2022.\n\nUBS AG also enters into commitments to extend credit in the form of credit lines available to secure the liquidity needs of clients. The majority of irrevocable loan commitments range in maturity from one month to three years. During 2023, irrevocable loan commitments increased by USD 4.0bn, mainly in the Investment Bank, and committed unconditionally revocable credit lines increased by USD 3.7bn, mainly driven by increases in facilities provided to clients in Personal & Corporate Banking, as well as currency effects. Forward starting reverse repurchase agreements increased by USD 6.6bn, in  Group  Treasury,  reflecting  fluctuations  in  levels  of  business  division  activity  in  short-dated  securities  financing transactions.",

The risk is similar to the risk involved in extending loan facilities and is subject to the same risk management and control framework. In 2023, UBS AG recognized net credit loss releases of USD 13m related to irrevocable loan commitments, guarantees and other credit facilities in the scope of expected credit loss measurement, compared with net credit loss releases of USD 3m in 2022. Provisions recognized for irrevocable loan commitments, guarantees  and  other  credit  facilities  in  the  scope  of  expected  credit  loss  measurement  were  USD 188m  as  of 31 December 2023, compared with USD 201m as of 31 December 2022.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 9 Financial assets at amortized cost and other positions in scope of expected credit loss measurement' and 'Note 19 Expected credit loss measurement' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about provisions for expected credit losses\n\nFor  certain  obligations,  UBS AG  enters  into  partial  sub-participations  to  mitigate  various  risks  from  guarantees  and irrevocable loan commitments. A sub-participation is an agreement by another party to take a share of the loss in the event that the obligation is not fulfilled by the obligor and, where applicable, to fund a part of the credit facility. UBS AG retains the contractual relationship with the obligor, and the sub-participant has only an indirect relationship. Generally, UBS AG only enters into sub-participation agreements with banks to which it ascribes a credit rating equal to or better than that of the obligor.\n\nUBS AG also provides representations, warranties and indemnifications to third parties in the normal course of business.\n\n## Support provided to non-consolidated investment funds\n\nIn 2023, UBS AG did not provide material support, financial or otherwise, to unconsolidated investment funds when it was not contractually obligated to do so, nor does it currently have an intention to do so.\n\n## Clearing house and exchange memberships\n\nUBS AG is a member of numerous securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses. In connection with some of these memberships, UBS AG may be required to pay a share of the financial obligations of another member who defaults, or UBS AG may be otherwise exposed to additional financial obligations. While the membership rules vary, obligations generally would arise only if the exchange or clearing house had exhausted its resources. UBS AG considers the probability of a material loss due to such obligations to be remote.\n\n## Deposit insurance\n\nSwiss banking law and the deposit insurance system require Swiss banks and securities dealers to jointly guarantee an amount of up to CHF 8bn for privileged client deposits in the event that a Swiss bank or securities dealer becomes insolvent. As of 31 December 2023, FINMA estimates UBS AG's share in the deposit insurance system to be CHF 1.2bn. This  represents  a  contingent  payment  obligation  and  exposes  UBS AG  to  additional  risk.  As  of  31 December  2023, UBS AG considered the probability of a material loss from its obligations to be remote.\n\nUBS AG is also subject to, or is a member of, other deposit protection schemes in other countries. However, no contingent payment obligation existed as of 31 December 2023 from any other material scheme.\n\n## Material cash requirements\n\nThe material cash requirements of UBS AG as of 31 December 2023 are represented by the residual contractual maturities for non-derivative and non-trading financial liabilities included in the table presented in 'Note 23b Maturity analysis of financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report. Included in the table are debt issued designated at fair value (USD 93.0bn), debt issued measured at amortized cost (USD 73.6bn) and funding from UBS Group AG measured at amortized cost (USD 86.1bn). The amounts represent estimated future interest and principal payments on an undiscounted basis.\n\nIn  the  normal  course  of  business,  UBS AG  also  issues  or  enters  into  various  forms  of  guarantees,  irrevocable  loan commitments and other similar arrangements that may result in an outflow of cash in the future. The maturity profile of these  obligations,  which  are  presented  off-balance  sheet,  are  included  in  'Note 23b  Maturity  analysis  of  financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report.",

        "page_content": "## Cash flows\n\nAs a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and often may bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. Consequently, we believe that a traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful when evaluating our liquidity position  than  the  liquidity,  funding  and  capital  management  frameworks  and  measures  described  elsewhere  in  this section.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Liquidity and funding management' section of this report for more information\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled USD 190.5bn, a decrease of USD 4.7bn compared with 31 December 2022, driven by net cash outflows from operating and investing activities. These outflows were largely offset by net cash inflows from financing activities, as well as positive foreign exchange effects, mainly reflecting the depreciation of the US dollar against the Swiss franc in 2023.\n\n## Operating activities\n\nNet cash outflows from operating activities were USD 28.2bn in 2023, compared with inflows of USD 10.6bn in 2022, reflecting changes in operating assets and liabilities of USD 28.1bn and other adjustments to remove the net impact of non-cash items, such as foreign currency effects. The net change in operating assets and liabilities includes funding of USD 15bn provided to Credit Suisse (included within amounts due from banks), as well as a USD 16.0bn movement in financial assets and liabilities at fair value held for trading and derivative financial instruments, USD 6.1bn from brokerage receivables and payables, and USD 5.0bn from receivables from securities financing transactions measured at amortized cost. These effects were partly offset by a USD 6.5bn increase in customer deposits and a USD 3.7bn decrease in loans and advances to customers.\n\n## Investing activities\n\nInvesting activities resulted in a net cash outflow of USD 4.9bn in 2023, compared with USD 12.3bn in 2022, primarily related to cash outflows of USD 3.8bn from net purchases of debt securities measured at amortized cost.\n\n## Financing activities\n\nFinancing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of USD 19.7bn in 2023, compared with an outflow of USD 5.3bn in 2022, mainly due to net issuance proceeds of USD 19.0bn from debt designated at fair value and long-term debt measured at amortized cost, as well as net issuances of short-term debt of USD 7.2bn.

        "page_content": "## Currency management\n\n## Strategy, objectives and governance\n\nGroup Treasury focuses on three main areas of currency risk management: (i) currency-matched funding and investment of non-US-dollar assets and liabilities; (ii) the sell-down of foreign currency IFRS Accounting Standards profits and losses; and  (iii) selective  hedging  of  anticipated  non-US-dollar  profits  and  losses  to  further  mitigate  the  effect  of  structural imbalances in the balance sheet. Group Treasury also manages structural currency composition across three scopes: UBS Group AG consolidated, UBS AG consolidated, and Credit Suisse AG consolidated.\n\n## Currency-matched funding and investment of non-US-dollar assets and liabilities\n\nFor monetary balance sheet items and other investments, as far as is practical and efficient, UBS AG follows the principle of matching the currencies of its assets and liabilities for funding purposes. This avoids profits and losses arising from the translation of non-US-dollar assets and liabilities.\n\nNet investment hedge accounting is applied to non-US-dollar core investments to balance the effect of foreign exchange movements on both common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and the CET1 capital ratio.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies' and 'Note 25 Hedge accounting' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n- \u203a Refer to 'Capital management' in this section for more information about UBS AG's active management of sensitivity to currency movements and the effect thereof on the key ratios\n\n## Sell-down of non-US-dollar reported profits and losses\n\nIncome statement items of foreign subsidiaries and branches of UBS AG with a functional currency other than the US dollar  are  translated  into  US  dollars  at  average  exchange  rates.  To  reduce  earnings  volatility  on  the  translation  of previously  recognized  earnings  in  foreign  currencies,  Group  Treasury  centralizes  the  profits  and  losses  (under  IFRS Accounting Standards) arising in UBS AG and its branches and sells or buys the profit or loss for US dollars on a monthly basis. The foreign subsidiaries of UBS AG follow a similar monthly sell-down process into their own functional currencies. Retained earnings in subsidiaries and branches with a functional currency other than the US dollar are integrated and managed as part of UBS AG's net investment hedge accounting program.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\nUBS AG is incorporated and domiciled in Switzerland and operates under Art. 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations and Swiss banking law as an Aktiengesellschaft , a corporation limited by shares. The addresses and telephone numbers of the two registered offices of UBS AG are: Bahnhofstrasse 45, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland, telephone +41-44-234 11 11;  and  Aeschenvorstadt 1, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland, telephone +41-61-288 50 50. The corporate identification number is CHE-101.329.561.\n\nThe company was incorporated with unlimited duration on 29 June 1998, when Union Bank of Switzerland (founded in 1862) and Swiss Bank Corporation (founded in 1872) merged to form UBS AG. UBS AG is a regulated bank in Switzerland and is 100% owned by UBS Group AG, the ultimate parent of the UBS Group. UBS AG's purpose, in accordance with art. 2 of its Articles of Association, as amended on 4 April 2023, is the operation bank and its scope extends to a full range of financial services activities in Switzerland and abroad.\n\nAs a non-US company with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE), UBS AG complies with the relevant corporate governance standards applicable to foreign private issuers listing debt securities. In addition, it also follows  the  standards  established  in  the  Swiss  Code  of  Best  Practice  for  Corporate  Governance.  The  Organization Regulations of UBS AG, adopted by the Board of Directors of UBS AG (the BoD) based on Art. 716b of the Swiss Code of Obligations and Art. 25 and 27 of the Articles of Association of UBS AG (the AoA), constitute UBS AG's primary corporate governance guidelines.\n\n## Operational structure\n\n## Operational structure\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the operational structure of the UBS AG is composed of the Global Wealth Management, Personal & Corporate Banking, Asset Management, the Investment Bank, and Non-core and Legacy business divisions, as well as Group functions.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Our businesses' section of this report for more information about our business divisions and Group functions\n\n## Share capital structure\n\n## Ordinary share capital\n\nIn April 2023, the Annual General Meeting (the AGM) approved the conversion of the share capital currency of UBS AG from the Swiss franc to the US dollar. To obtain a Swiss franc nominal value per share equaling USD 0.10 after the conversion, the AGM also approved a CHF 28,860,895.32568 ordinary reduction of the share capital, and this reduction resulted in a corresponding allocation to the capital contribution reserve on UBS AG's standalone financial statements.\n\nAt year-end 2023, UBS AG had 3,858,408,466 issued shares, with a nominal value of USD 0.10 each, equating to a share capital of USD 385,840,846.60.\n\nUnder Swiss company law, shareholders must approve, in a general meeting of shareholders, any increase or reduction in the ordinary share capital, the creation of conditional share capital or the introduction of a capital band.\n\n## Conditional share capital\n\nAt year-end 2023, the following conditional share capital was available to the BoD.\n\n- - A maximum of USD 38,000,000, represented by up to 380,000,000 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of USD 0.10 each, to be issued through the voluntary or mandatory exercise of conversion rights and / or warrants granted in connection with the issuance of bonds or similar financial instruments on national or international capital markets. This conditional capital allowance was approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting (the EGM) held on 26 November 2014, having originally been approved at the AGM of UBS AG on 14 April 2010. The BoD has not made use of such allowance.\n- \u203a Refer to article 4a of the AoA for more information about the terms and conditions of the issue of shares out of existing conditional capital - the AoA are available at ubs.com/governance",

Each registered share has a nominal value of USD 0.10 and carries one vote. UBS AG imposes no limitation on the rights to own its securities.\n\n## Dividend distributions\n\nThe decision to pay a dividend and the amount of any dividend depend on a variety of factors, including our profits, cash flow generation and capital ratios.\n\nAt the 2024 AGM, the BoD is proposing to the shareholder for approval a dividend of USD 3,000m for the 2023 financial year.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, UBS AG had 3,858,408,466 issued shares with a nominal value of USD 0.10 each, equating to a share capital of USD 385,840,846.60. All shares carry voting rights, were fully paid in and eligible for dividends. There are no preferential rights associated with these shares, and no other classes of shares have been issued by UBS AG.\n\n## Shareholders' participation rights\n\n## Voting rights\n\nThe sole direct shareholder of UBS AG is UBS Group AG, which holds 100% of UBS AG shares. These shares are entitled to voting rights without restriction.\n\n## Statutory quorums\n\nMotions are decided at a general meeting by a majority of the votes represented, excluding blank and invalid ballots. For the approval of certain specific issues, the Swiss Code of Obligations requires a positive vote from a two-thirds majority of the votes represented at the given general meeting and from a majority of the nominal value of shares represented thereat. Such issues include creating shares with privileged voting rights, introducing restrictions on the transferability of registered shares, creating contingent capital or introducing a capital band, conversion capital or reserve capital and restricting or excluding shareholders' preemptive rights.\n\nThe AoA also require a two-thirds majority of votes represented for approval of any change to their provisions regarding the number of BoD members, any decision to remove one-quarter or more of the BoD members and any modification to the provision establishing this qualified quorum.\n\n## Convocation of general meetings of shareholders\n\nThe AGM must be held within six months of the close of the financial year (i.e., 31 December). In 2024, the AGM will take place on 23 April.\n\nEGMs may be convened whenever the BoD or the auditors consider it necessary. Shareholders individually or jointly representing at least 10% of the share capital may at any time, including during an AGM, require, by way of a written statement, that an EGM be convened to address a specific issue they put forward.",

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee\n\nThroughout  2023,  the  Audit  Committee  consisted  of  the  same  four  independent  BoD  members,  Jeremy  Anderson (Chairperson), Patrick Firmenich, Dieter Wemmer and Jeanette Wong. All Audit Committee members have accounting or  related  financial  management  expertise  and,  in  compliance  with  the  rules  established  pursuant  to  the  2002  US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, at least one member qualifies as a financial expert. The NYSE standards on corporate governance and Rule 10A-3 under the US Securities Exchange Act set more stringent independence requirements for members of audit committees than for the other members of the BoD. Throughout 2023, all members of the Audit Committee satisfied these requirements, in that they did not receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or compensatory fees from any member of the Group other than in their capacity as a BoD member, did not hold, directly or indirectly, UBS AG shares in excess of 5% of the outstanding capital, and did not serve on the audit committees of more than two other public companies. The function of the Audit Committee is to support the Board in fulfilling its oversight duty relating to financial reporting and internal controls over financial reporting, the effectiveness of the external and internal audit functions, as well as the whistleblowing procedures. Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the financial statements, while the external auditors are responsible for auditing financial statements. The Audit Committee's responsibility is one of oversight and review.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\nThroughout  2023,  the  Compensation  Committee  consisted  of  the  same  three  independent  BoD  members,  Julie  G. Richardson (Chairperson), Dieter Wemmer and Jeanette Wong. The function of the Compensation Committee is to support the Board in its duties to set guidelines on compensation and benefits, to oversee implementation thereof, to approve certain compensation and to scrutinize executive performance.\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nIn  2023,  the  Risk  Committee  consisted  of  four  independent  BoD  members,  Mark  Hughes  (Chairperson),  William  C. Dudley,  Nathalie  Rachou  and  Julie  G.  Richardson.  After  the  AGM,  the  Vice  Chairman,  Lukas  G\u00e4hwiler,  joined  the committee. The function of the Risk Committee is to oversee and support the Board in fulfilling its duty to set and supervise an appropriate risk management and control framework in the areas of:\n\n- (i) financial and non-financial risks; and\n- (ii) balance sheet, treasury and capital management, including funding, liquidity and equity attribution.\n\n## Cybersecurity governance\n\nCybersecurity as one of the inherently highest and most rapidly evolving non-financial risks is a key focus for the BoD. It is primarily covered by the Risk Committee through a combination of (i) regular reporting as part of the monthly risk reports and quarterly technology risk updates, and (ii) dedicated deep-dives on specific cybersecurity topics, including summaries and assessments of actual cybersecurity incidents in the industry, assessments of the firm's security posture and related continuous improvement measures. In addition, the BoD members receive periodic updates from the Group Chief Information Security Office on key cybersecurity threats and incidents across the globe and industries, and the Risk Committee regularly organizes education and training sessions, including cyber exercises, for all BoD members.\n\nWith respect to the BoD, Jeremy Anderson, Fred Hu, Mark Hughes and Julie G. Richardson all have expertise in technology and cybersecurity. Mr. Anderson is an IT expert, having started out as a software developer in the early 1980s, before working in IT consulting and developing a broad knowledge of systems integration and IT outsourcing services, as well as software development. He cemented his reputation as a tech specialist by becoming a founding sponsor of KPMG's Global Fintech Network in 2014. Mr. Hu has a Master's degree in engineering science from Tsinghua University and has vast experience advising and investing in leading firms in the technology sector in China and globally. Mr. Hughes gained substantial experience overseeing cybersecurity risk as the Group Chief Risk Officer at Royal Bank of Canada. Finally, Ms. Richardson has spent significant time with both incumbent and new technology companies, including being a board member of a digital knowledge management company, a leading cloud monitoring firm and a cyber insurance company.\n\nThe BoD is supported in overseeing risk at the executive management level by the cybersecurity expertise of Mike Dargan, who is the Group Chief Operations and Technology Officer, and Markus Ronner, who is the Group Chief Compliance and Governance Officer. Mr. Dargan is responsible for delivering digital platforms, technology services, infrastructure, and operations, including cybersecurity and information security. Previously, he was Group Chief Digital and Information Officer, after leading our Group Technology function since joining UBS in 2016. In addition to this remit, he was also UBS Group AG's Group Executive Board (GEB) sponsor for our digital assets strategy and a sponsor of artificial intelligence and our agile transformation, which were integrated into his area of responsibility in 2023. Prior to joining UBS, he held various senior roles in technology, corporate strategy and investment banking at Standard Chartered Bank, Merrill Lynch, and Oliver Wyman. Mr. Ronner has been with UBS for more than 40 years and held various positions across the firm, including manager of the Group-wide too-big-to-fail program, COO Wealth Management & Swiss Bank, Head Products and Services of Wealth Management & Swiss Bank, COO Asset Management, and Head Group Internal Audit. In his current position, he is responsible at the Group level for the control of all non-financial risks, governmental and regulatory affairs, and investigations and governance matters.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Non-financial risk' in the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for information about cybersecurity",

        "page_content": "## Important business connections of independent members of the Board of Directors\n\nAs a global financial services provider and a major Swiss bank, we enter into business relationships with many large companies, including some in which our BoD members have management or independent board responsibilities.\n\nOur  Organization  Regulations  require  one-third  of  UBS AG  BoD  members  to  be  independent.  For  this  purpose, independence is determined in accordance with FINMA Circular 2017/1 'Corporate governance - banks' and the NYSE rules.\n\nIn 2023, our BoD met the standards of the Organization Regulations for the percentage of directors who are considered independent under the criteria described above.\n\nAll relationships and transactions with UBS AG's independent BoD members are conducted in the ordinary course of business and are on the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated persons. All relationships and transactions with BoD members' associated companies are conducted at arm's length.\n\n## Checks and balances: Board of Directors and Executive Board\n\nWe operate under a strict dual board structure, as mandated by Swiss banking law. The separation of responsibilities between the BoD and the EB is clearly defined in the Organization Regulations. The BoD decides on the strategy of UBS AG,  upon  recommendations  by  the  President  of  the  EB,  and  exercises  ultimate  supervision  over  management; whereas the EB, headed by the President of the EB, has executive management responsibility. The functions of Chairman and President of the EB are assigned to two different people, leading to a separation of powers. This structure establishes checks and balances and preserves the institutional independence of the BoD from the executive management of UBS AG, for which responsibility is delegated to the EB, under the leadership of the President of the EB. No member of one board may simultaneously be a member of the other.\n\nSupervision and control of the EB remain with the BoD. The authorities and responsibilities of the two bodies are governed by the AoA and the Organization Regulations.\n\nAlthough the recruiting process for BoD and EB members takes into account a broad spectrum of factors, such as skills, backgrounds,  experience  and  expertise,  our  approach  with  regard  to  diversity  considerations  does  not  constitute  a diversity policy within the meaning of the EU Directive on Non-Financial Reporting, and Swiss law does not require UBS to maintain such a policy.\n\n## Executive Board\n\nThe BoD delegates the management of the business to the Executive Board.\n\n## Responsibilities, authorities and organizational principles of the Executive Board\n\nAt UBS AG, management of the business is also delegated, and its EB, under the leadership of the President of the EB, has executive management responsibility for UBS AG and its business. All members of the EB are members of the GEB. Sabine Keller-Busse, who serves as President UBS Switzerland AG and Ulrich K\u00f6rner, CEO of Credit Suisse AG are both not member of the EB.\n\nUBS AG EB has two permanent committees: the Asset and Liability Committee (the ALCO) and the Finance and Risk Committee (the FRC).\n\nThe ALCO is responsible for managing UBS AG's assets and liabilities in line with the UBS AG and Group strategy and regulatory requirements. In 2023, the ALCO held 10 meetings.\n\nThe FRC is responsible for supervising and controlling UBS AG's business, financial and risk profile of the overall UBS AG standalone as well as the entity's business activities in Switzerland and cross-jurisdictional branch-related matters, in line with the UBS AG and Group strategy and regulatory requirements. The FRC is also responsible for ensuring the financial and risk profile of UBS AG standalone complies with the agreed risk appetite, by ascertaining that appropriate and timely actions are taken. In 2023, the FRC held three meetings.",

        "page_content": "## Auditors\n\nAudit is an integral part of corporate governance. While safeguarding their independence, the external auditors closely coordinate their work with Internal Audit (IA). The Audit Committee and, ultimately, the BoD supervise the effectiveness of audit work.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Board of Directors' in this section for more information about the Audit Committee\n\n## External independent auditors\n\nThe 2023 AGM re-elected Ernst & Young Ltd (EY) as auditors for UBS AG for the 2023 financial year. EY assumes virtually all auditing functions according to laws, regulatory requests and the AoA. Robert Jacob is the EY lead partner in charge of the overall coordination of the UBS Group financial and regulatory audits and the co-signing partner of the financial audit.  In  2020,  Maurice  McCormick  became  the  lead  audit  partner  for  the  financial  statement  audit  and  has  an incumbency limit of five years. In 2021, Hannes Smit became the Lead Auditor to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), with an incumbency limit of seven years. Daniel Martin has been the co-signing partner for the FINMA audit since 2019, with an incumbency limit of seven years.\n\nDuring 2023, the Audit Committee held 14 meetings with the external auditors.\n\n## Review of UBS AG audit engagement\n\nEU rules require UBS Europe SE, an indirect subsidiary of UBS AG, to rotate its external auditors in the 2024 financial year. In connection with this required change, and in consideration of governance best practices, the Board of Directors of UBS Group AG considered whether it would propose to shareholders a rotation of the Group auditor concurrent with the change at UBS Europe SE. Under the direction of the Audit Committee of UBS Group AG, UBS Group conducted a formal review of the Group audit engagement including soliciting proposals from potential auditors. In early 2022, based on the results of this assessment, the Board of Directors of UBS Group AG decided to retain EY as the Group's external auditors.\n\n## Audit effectiveness assessment\n\nThe Audit Committee assesses the performance, effectiveness and independence of the external auditors on an annual basis. The assessment is generally based on interviews with senior management and survey feedback from stakeholders across the Group. Assessment criteria include quality of service delivery, quality and competence of the audit team, value added as  part  of  the  audit,  insightfulness,  and  the  overall  relationship  with  EY.  Based  on  its  own  analysis  and  the assessment results, including feedback received as part of the review of the Group audit engagement described above, the Audit Committee concluded that EY's audit has been effective.\n\n## Fees paid to external independent auditors\n\nUBS AG and its subsidiaries paid the following fees (including expenses) to their external independent auditors.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| USD m                                                                                                                                          | 31.12.23             | 31.12.22             |\n| Audit                                                                                                                                          |                      |                      |\n| Global audit fees                                                                                                                              | 52                   | 48                   |\n| Additional services classified as audit (services required by law or statute, including work of a non-recurring nature mandated by regulators) | 5                    | 7                    |\n| Total audit                                                                                                                                    | 57                   | 56                   |\n| Non-audit                                                                                                                                      |                      |                      |\n| Audit-related fees                                                                                                                             | 10                   | 11                   |\n| of which: assurance and attestation services                                                                                                   | 5                    | 6                    |\n| of which: control and performance reports                                                                                                      | 5                    | 5                    |\n| of which: consultation concerning financial accounting and reporting standards                                                                 | 0                    | 0                    |\n| Tax fees                                                                                                                                       | 1                    | 2                    |\n| All other fees                                                                                                                                 | 0                    | 1                    |\n| Total non-audit                                                                                                                                | 11                   | 14                   |",

        "page_content": "## Special auditors for potential capital increases\n\nAt the AGM on 8 April 2021, BDO AG was reappointed as special auditors for a three-year term of office. Special auditors provide audit opinions in connection with potential capital increases independently from other auditors.\n\n## Services performed and fees\n\nThe Audit Committee oversees all services provided to UBS by the external auditors. For services requiring the approval from the Audit Committee, a preapproval may be granted either for a specific mandate or in the form of a blanket preapproval authorizing a limited and well-defined type and scope of services. The fees (including expenses) paid to EY are set forth in the table above. In addition, EY received USD 27m in 2023 (USD 35m in 2022) for services performed on behalf of our investment funds, many of which have independent fund boards or trustees.\n\nAudit work includes all services necessary to perform the audit for UBS AG in accordance with applicable laws and generally  accepted  auditing  standards,  as  well  as  other  assurance  services  that  conventionally  only  the  auditor  can provide. These include statutory and regulatory audits, attestation services and the review of documents to be filed with regulatory bodies. The additional services classified as audit in 2023 included several engagements for which EY was mandated at the request of FINMA.\n\nAudit-related work consists of assurance and related services traditionally performed by auditors, such as attestation services related to financial reporting, internal control reviews and performance standard reviews, as well as consultation concerning financial accounting and reporting standards.\n\nTax  work  involves  services  performed  by  professional  staff  in  EY's  tax  division  and  includes  tax  compliance  and  tax consultation with respect to our own affairs.\n\n'Other' services are permitted services, which include technical IT security control reviews and assessments.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nIA performs the internal auditing role for UBS AG. It is an independent function that provides expertise and insights to confirm controls are functioning correctly and highlight where UBS needs to better manage current and emerging risks.\n\nIA supports the BoD in discharging its governance responsibilities by taking a dynamic approach to audit, issue assurance and risk assessment, drawing attention to key risks in order to drive action to prevent unexpected loss or damage to the firm's  reputation.  To  support  the  achievement  of  UBS's  objectives,  IA  independently,  objectively  and  systematically assesses the:\n\n- (i) soundness of UBS AG's risk and control culture;\n- (ii) reliability and integrity of financial and operational information, including whether activities are properly, accurately and completely recorded, and the quality of underlying data and models; and\n- (iii) design, operating effectiveness and sustainability of:\n- -processes to define strategy and risk appetite, as well as the overall adherence to the approved strategy;\n- -governance processes;\n- -risk management, including whether risks are appropriately identified and managed;\n- -internal controls, specifically whether they are commensurate with the risks taken;\n- -remediation activities; and\n- -processes  to  comply  with  legal  and  regulatory  requirements,  internal  policies,  and  UBS  AG's  constitutional documents and contracts.\n\nAudit reports that include significant issues are provided to the President of the EB, relevant EB members and other responsible management. The Chairman, the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee of the BoD are regularly informed of such issues.\n\nIn addition, IA provides independent assurance on the effective and sustainable remediation of control deficiencies within its mandate, taking a prudent and conservative risk-based approach and assessing at the issue level whether the root cause and the potential exposure for the firm have been holistically and sustainably addressed. IA also cooperates closely with risk control functions and internal and external legal advisors on investigations into major control issues.\n\nTo ensure IA's independence from management, the IA Executive UBS AG reports to the Chairman of the BoD and to the Audit Committee, which assesses annually whether IA has sufficient resources to perform its function, as well as its independence and performance. In the Audit Committee's assessment, IA is sufficiently resourced to fulfill its mandate and  complete  its  auditing  objectives.  IA's  role,  position,  responsibilities  and  accountability  are  set  out  in  UBS  AG's Organization Regulations and the Charter for IA . IA has unrestricted access to all accounts, books, records, systems, property  and  personnel,  and  must  be  provided  with  all  information  and  data  that  it  needs  to  fulfill  its  auditing responsibilities. IA also conducts special audits at the request of the Audit Committee, or other BoD members, committees or the President of the EB in consultation with the Audit Committee.\n\nIA enhances the efficiency of its work through coordination and close cooperation with the external auditors.",

In our opinion, UBS AG and subsidiaries ('the Group') maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Group as of 31 December 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated  income statements,  statements of comprehensive income, statements  of  changes in equity and statements of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2023, and the related notes and our report dated 27 March 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Group's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  included  in  the  accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group at 31 December 2023 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2023, in conformity with the IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Group ' s internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013  framework)  and  our  report  dated  27  March  2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Group 's Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group 's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated  financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.",

These instruments are reported within the following accounts: financial assets and liabilities at fair value held for trading, derivative financial instruments, financial assets at fair value not held for trading, debt issued designated at fair value, brokerage payables designated at fair value, and other financial liabilities designated at fair value. In determining the fair value of these financial instruments, the Group used valuation techniques, modelling assumptions,  and  estimates  of  unobservable  market  inputs  which  required  significant management judgment.\n\nAuditing management's judgments and assumptions used in the estimation of the fair value of these instruments was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of valuation techniques, key modelling assumptions and significant unobservable inputs. Auditing the valuation of complex or illiquid instruments at fair value included consideration of any incremental risks arising from the impact of current macroeconomic influences on valuation techniques and inputs, such as geopolitics and inflation. The valuation techniques that required especially complex judgment were comprised of discounted cash flow and earnings-based valuation techniques. Highly judgmental modelling assumptions result from a range of different models or model calibrations used by market participants. Valuation inputs which were particularly complex  and  subjective  included  those  with  a  limited  degree  of  observability  and  the associated extrapolation, interpolation or calibration of curves using limited and proxy data points. Examples of such inputs included unobservable credit spreads and bond prices, and volatility.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over management's financial instrument valuation processes, including controls over market data inputs, model and methodology governance, and valuation adjustments.\n\nWe tested the valuation techniques, models and methodologies, and the inputs used in those models, as outlined above, by performing an independent revaluation of certain complex or illiquid financial assets and liabilities with the support of specialists. We used independent models and inputs and compared inputs to available market data among other procedures. We  also  independently  challenged  key  judgments  in  relation  to  a  sample  of  fair  value adjustments.\n\nWe also assessed management's disclosures regarding fair value measurement ( within Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Legal provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group's provisions for litigation, regulatory and similar matters and contingent liabilities (legal provisions) were USD 1,810 million. As explained in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that is exposed to significant litigation and similar risks arising from disputes and regulatory proceedings. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes",

These uncertainties inherently affect the amount and timing of potential outflows with respect to the legal provisions which have been established.\n\nAuditing management's assessment of legal provisions was complex and judgmental due to the significant subjectivity involved in manage ment's estimate of the amount and probability that an outflow of resources will be required for existing legal matters, including inquiries regarding cross-border wealth management businesses (Note 17b 1). The legal provisions for these matters are based o n management's estimation of the amount and likelihood of the occurrence of certain scenarios.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operational effectiveness of management's controls over the legal provision process. Our procedures included testing management's review of the accuracy of the inputs to the estimation of the amount and likelihood of the occurrence of certain scenarios.\n\nWhere appropriate, we assessed the methodologies on which the provision amounts were based  with  the  involvement  of  specialists,  recalculated  the  provisions  and  tested  the underlying information. We inspected internal and external legal analyses of the matters supporting  the  judgmental  aspects  impacted  by  legal  interpretations.  We  obtained correspondence directly from external legal counsel to assess the information provided by management and performed inquiries with external counsel as necessary.\n\nWe also assessed management's disclosure regarding legal provisions ( within Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Recognition of deferred tax assets\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group's deferred tax assets ('DTAs') were USD 9,244 million (see Note  8  to the consolidated financial statements). DTAs are recognized to  the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available, against which applicable deductible temporary differences or the carryforward of unused tax losses within the loss carryforward period can be utilized. There is significant judgment exercised when estimating future taxable income that is not based on the reversal of taxable temporary differences. Management's estimate of future taxable profits is based on its strategic plan that is sensitive to the assumptions made in estimating future taxable income.\n\nAuditing management's assessment of the recognition of the Group's DTAs was complex due to  the  highly  judgmental  nature  of  estimating  future  taxable  profits.  Estimating  future profitability is inherently subjective as it is sensitive to future economic, market and other conditions, which are difficult to predict, such as the impact of geopolitics, inflation, and interest rates. Specifically, some of the more subjective key macro-economic assumptions used included gross domestic product growth rates, equity market performance, and interest rate expectations.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls over DTA valuation, which included the assumptions used in developing the strategic plans and estimating future taxable income.",

This included recalculating the outputs of models applied to the recognition process for DTAs.\n\nWe involved specialists to assist in assessing the key economic assumptions embedded in the strategic plans. We compared key assumptions used to forecast future taxable income to externally available historical and prospective data and assumptions and assessed the sensitivity of the outcomes using reasonably possible changes in assumptions.\n\nWe  also  assessed  management's  disclosure  regarding  recognized  and  unrecognized deferred tax assets (within Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group's allowances and provisions for expected credit losses ('ECL') were USD 1,244 million. As explained in Notes 1, 9 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, ECL is recognized for financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income,  fee  and  lease receivables, financial guarantees, and loan commitments not measured at fair value. ECL is also recognized on the undrawn portion of committed unconditionally revocable credit lines, which include the Group's credit card limits and master credit facilities. The allowances and provisions for ECL consists of exposures that are in default which are individually evaluated for impairment (stage 3), as well as losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified (stage 1 and stage 2). Management's ECL estimates represent the difference between contractual cash flows and those the Group expects to receive, discounted at the effective interest rate. The method used to calculate ECL is based on a combination of the following  principal  factors:  probability  of  default  ('PD'),  loss  given  default  ('LGD')  and exposure at default ('EAD').\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the allowances and provisions for ECL was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of forward-looking economic scenarios that form the basis of the ECL calculation, their probability weightings, related post-model adjustments, and the credit  risk  models  used  to  estimate  stage  1  and  stage  2  ECL.  The  macroeconomic developments during 2023, including persisting geopolitical tensions and inflation, contributed to further uncertainty and complexity in estimating ECL. As a result, the ECL estimation required higher management judgment, specifically within the following two areas: (i) scenario selection, including assumptions about the scenario severity, underlying macroeconomic variables, and the number of scenarios necessary to sufficiently cover the bandwidth of potential outcomes, as well as related scenario weights and  post-model adjustments; and (ii) credit risk models, since the output from historic data based models may not be indicative of current or future conditions.\n\nAdditionally, auditing the measurement of individual ECL for stage 3 was complex due to the high degree of judgment involved in management's process for estimating ECL based on assumptions. These assumptions take into account expected future cash flows from collateral and  other  credit  enhancements  or  expected  payouts  from  bankruptcy  proceedings  for unsecured claims and, where applicable, time to realization of collateral and the seniority of claims.",

We evaluated management's methodologies and governance controls for developing and monitoring the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings assigned to them, and related post-model adjustments. Supported by specialists, we assessed the key macroeconomic variables used in the forward-looking scenarios, such as real gross domestic product growth, unemployment rate, interest rates and house price indices, and evaluated the modelled correlation and translation of those macroeconomic factors to the ECL estimate.  We  further  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  post-model  adjustments  by considering management's governance process, assumptions used and sensitivity analysis.\n\nWe  also  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating effectiveness of controls over credit risk models used in the ECL estimate, including controls over the completeness and accuracy of model input data, calculation logic, and output data used in the overall ECL calculation. With the support of specialists, on a sample basis, we performed  an  evaluation  of  management's  models  and  tested  the  model  outcomes  by inspecting model documentation, reperforming model calculations, and comparing data used as inputs to management's forecast to external sources, among other procedures.\n\nFor the measurement of stage 3, we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's process, including an evaluation of the assumptions used by management regarding the future cash flows from debtors' continuing operations and/or the liquidation of collateral. Supported by specialists in certain areas, we additionally tested collateral valuation, cash flow assumptions and exit strategies by performing inquiries of management, inspecting underlying documents, such as loan contracts, financial statements, covenants, budgets and business plans, and by reperforming discounted cash flow calculations among other procedures, on a sample basis.\n\nWe also as sessed management's disclosures regarding financial assets at amortized cost and other positions in scope of expected credit loss measurement (within Notes 1, 9 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nErnst & Young Ltd\n\nWe have served as the Group 's auditor since 1998 .\n\nBasel, Switzerland\n\n27 March 2024",

Auditing the valuation of complex or illiquid instruments at fair value included consideration of any incremental risks arising from the impact of current macroeconomic influences on valuation  techniques  and  inputs,  such  as  geopolitics  and  inflation.  The  valuation techniques that required especially complex judgment were comprised of discounted cash  flow  and  earnings-based  valuation  techniques.  Highly  judgmental  modelling assumptions result from a range of different models or model calibrations used by market participants. Valuation inputs which were particularly complex and subjective included those  with  a  limited  degree  of  observability  and  the  associated  extrapolation, interpolation or calibration of curves using limited and proxy data points. Examples of such inputs included unobservable credit spreads and bond prices, and volatility.\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating effectiveness  of  the  controls  over  management's  financial  instrument  valuation processes,  including  controls  over  market  data  inputs,  model  and  methodology governance, and valuation adjustments.\n\nWe tested the valuation techniques, models and methodologies, and the inputs used in those models, as outlined above, by performing an independent revaluation of certain complex or illiquid financial assets and liabilities with the support of specialists. We used independent models and inputs and compared inputs to available market data among other procedures. We also independently challenged key judgments in relation to a sample of fair value adjustments.\n\nWe also assessed management's discl osures regarding fair value measurement (within Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Legal provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nArea of focus\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group's provisions for litigation, regulatory and similar matters and contingent liabilities (legal provisions) were USD 1,810 million. As explained in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that is exposed to significant litigation and similar risks arising from  disputes  and  regulatory  proceedings.  Such  matters  are  subject  to  many uncertainties and the outcomes may be difficult to predict. These uncertainties inherently",

The legal provisions for these matters are based o n management's estimation of the amount and likelihood of the occurrence of certain scenarios.\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operational effectiveness  of  management's  controls  over  the  legal  provision  process.  Our procedures included testing management's review of the accuracy of the inputs to the estimation of the amount and likelihood of the occurrence of certain scenarios.\n\nWhere appropriate, we assessed the methodologies on which the provision amounts were based with the involvement of specialists, recalculated the provisions and tested the underlying information. We inspected internal and external legal analyses of the matters  supporting  the  judgmental  aspects  impacted  by  legal  interpretations.  We obtained correspondence directly from external legal counsel to assess the information provided by management and performed inquiries with external counsel as necessary.\n\nWe also assessed management's disclosure regarding legal provisions (within Note 1 7 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Recognition of deferred tax assets\n\nArea of focus\n\nOur audit response\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group's deferred tax assets ('DTAs') were USD 9,244 million (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). DTAs are recognized to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available, against which applicable deductible temporary  differences  or  the  carryforward  of  unused  tax  losses  within  the  loss carryforward period can be utilized. There is significant judgment exercised when estimating future taxable income that is not based on the reversal of taxable temporary differences. Management's estimate of future taxable profits is based on its strategic plan that is sensitive to the assumptions made in estimating future taxable income.\n\nAuditing  management's  assessment  of  the  recognition  of  the  Group's  DTAs  was complex  due  to  the  highly  judgmental  nature  of  estimating  future  taxable  profits. Estimating future profitability is inherently subjective as it is sensitive to future economic, market and other conditions, which are difficult to predict, such as the impact of geopolitics, inflation, and interest rates. Specifically, some of the more subjective key macro-economic assumptions used included gross domestic product growth rates, equity market performance, and interest rate expectations.\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design,  and  tested  the  operating effectiveness  of  management's  controls  over  DTA  valuation,  which  included  the assumptions used in developing the strategic plans and estimating future taxable income.",

This included recalculating the outputs of models applied to the recognition process for DTAs.\n\nWe involved specialists to assist in assessing the key economic assumptions embedded in the strategic plans. We compared key assumptions used to forecast future taxable income to externally available historical and prospective data and assumptions and assessed  the  sensitivity  of  the  outcomes  using  reasonably  possible  changes  in assumptions.\n\nWe also assessed management's disclosure regarding recognized and unrecognized deferred tax assets (within Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nArea of focus\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group's allowances and provisions for expected credit losses ('ECL') were USD 1,244 million. As explained in Notes 1, 9 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, ECL is recognized for financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, fee and lease receivables, financial guarantees, and loan commitments not measured at fair value. ECL is also recognized on the undrawn portion of committed unconditionally revo cable credit lines, which include the Group's credit card limits and master credit facilities. The allowances and provisions for ECL consists of exposures that are in default which are individually evaluated for impairment (stage 3), as well as losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified (stage 1 and stage 2). Management's ECL estimates represent the difference between contractual cash flows and those the Group expects to receive, discounted at the effective interest rate. The method used to calculate ECL is based on a combination of the following principal factors: probability of default ('PD'), loss given default ('LGD') and exposure at default ('EAD').\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the allowances and provisions for ECL was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of forward-looking economic scenarios that form the basis  of  the  ECL  calculation,  their  probability  weightings,  related  post-model adjustments, and the credit risk models used to estimate stage 1 and stage 2 ECL. The macroeconomic developments during 2023, including persisting geopolitical tensions and inflation, contributed to further uncertainty and complexity in estimating ECL. As a result, the ECL estimation required higher management judgment, specifically within the following two areas: (i) scenario selection, including assumptions about the scenario severity, underlying macroeconomic variables, and the number of scenarios necessary to sufficiently cover the bandwidth of potential outcomes, as well as related scenario weights and  post-model adjustments; and (ii) credit risk models, since the output from historic data based models may not be indicative of current or future conditions.\n\nAdditionally, auditing the measurement of individual ECL for stage 3 was complex due to the high degree of judgment involved in management's process for estimating ECL based on assumptions. These assumptions take into account expected future cash flows from collateral and other credit enhancements or expected payouts from bankruptcy proceedings for unsecured claims and, where applicable, time to realization of collateral and the seniority of claims.",

We evaluated managemen t's methodologies and governance controls for developing and monitoring the economic scenarios used and the  probability  weightings  assigned  to  them,  and  related  post-model  adjustments. Supported by specialists, we assessed the key macroeconomic variables used in the forward-looking scenarios, such as real gross domestic product growth, unemployment rate, interest rates and house price indices, and evaluated the modelled correlation and translation of those macroeconomic factors to the ECL estimate. We further assessed the  appropriateness  of  the  postmodel  adjustments  by  considering  management's governance process, assumptions used and sensitivity analysis.\n\nWe also obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over credit risk models used in the ECL estimate, including controls over the completeness and accuracy of model input data, calculation logic, and output data used in the overall ECL calculation. With the support of specialists, on a sample basis, we performed an evaluation of management's models and tested the model outcomes by inspecting model documentation, reperforming model calculations, and comparing data used as inputs to management's forecast to external sources, among other procedures.\n\nFor the measurement of stage 3, we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's process, including an evaluation of the assumptions used by management regarding the future cash flows from de btors' continuing operations and/or the liquidation of collateral. Supported by specialists  in  certain  areas,  we  additionally  tested  collateral  valuation,  cash  flow assumptions and exit strategies by performing inquiries of management, inspecting underlying documents, such as loan contracts, financial statements, covenants, budgets and business plans, and by re-performing discounted cash flow calculations among other procedures, on a sample basis.\n\nWe also assessed management's disclosures regarding financia l assets at amortized cost and other positions in scope of expected credit loss measurement (within Notes 1, 9 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Other information in the annual report\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information in the annual report.

        "page_content": "## Ordinary share capital\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, UBS AG had 3,858,408,466 issued shares (31 December 2022: 3,858,408,466 shares). In the second quarter of 2023, the share capital currency of UBS AG was changed from the Swiss franc to the US dollar, as approved by shareholders at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (the AGM). As a result, the nominal value per share has changed from CHF 0.10 to USD 0.10, resulting in a reclassification between share capital and capital contribution reserve (presented  as  share  premium  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements)  and  leading  to  a  share  capital  of USD 385,840,846.60. The shares were entirely held by UBS Group AG.\n\n## Conditional share capital\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the following conditional share capital was available to the Board of Directors (the BoD) of UBS AG:\n\n- - A maximum of USD 38,000,000 represented by up to 380,000,000 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of USD 0.10 each, to be issued through the voluntary or mandatory exercise of conversion rights and / or warrants granted in connection with the issuance of bonds or similar financial instruments on national or international capital markets.  This  conditional  capital  allowance  was  approved  at  the  Extraordinary  General  Meeting  held  on 26 November 2014, having originally been approved at the AGM of UBS AG on 14 April 2010. The BoD has not made use of such allowance.\n\n## Capital band, conversion capital and reserve capital\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, UBS AG has not introduced a capital band, any conversion capital or any reserve capital.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nIn 2015, UBS AG shares were delisted from the SIX Swiss Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. As of 31 December 2023, 100% of UBS AG's issued shares were held by UBS Group AG and therefore were not publicly traded. Accordingly, earnings per share information is not provided for UBS AG.",

These disclosures relate to requirements under IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures , and IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements , and are not repeated in this section.\n\nThe accounting policies described in this Note have been applied consistently in all years presented unless otherwise stated in Note 1b.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nPreparation of these Financial Statements under IFRS Accounting Standards requires management to apply judgment and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and disclosure, of contingent assets and liabilities, and may involve significant uncertainty at the time they are made. Such estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information. UBS AG regularly reassesses such estimates and assumptions, which encompass historical experience, expectations of the future and other pertinent factors, to determine their continuing relevance based on current conditions, updating them as necessary. Changes in those estimates and assumptions may have a significant effect on the Financial Statements. Furthermore, actual results may differ significantly from UBS AG's estimates, which could result in significant losses to UBS AG, beyond what was anticipated or provided for.\n\nThe following areas contain estimation uncertainty or require critical judgment and have a significant effect on amounts recognized in the Financial Statements:\n\n- -expected credit loss measurement (refer to item 2g in this Note and to Note 19);\n- -fair value measurement (refer to item 2f in this Note and to Note 20);\n- -income taxes (refer to item 6 in this Note and to Note 8);\n- -provisions and contingent liabilities (refer to item 10 in this Note and to Note 17);\n- -post-employment benefit plans (refer to item 5 in this Note and to Note 26);\n- -goodwill (refer to item 9 in this Note and to Note 12); and\n- -consolidation of structured entities (refer to item 1 in this Note and to Note 28).\n\n## 1) Consolidation\n\nThe Financial Statements include the financial statements of UBS AG and its subsidiaries, presented as a single economic entity; intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. UBS AG consolidates all entities that it controls, including  structured  entities  (SEs),  which  is  the  case  when  it  has:  (i) power  over  the  relevant  activities  of  the  entity; (ii) exposure to the entity's variable returns; and (iii) the ability to use its power to affect its own returns.\n\nConsideration is given to all facts and circumstances to determine whether UBS AG has power over another entity, i.e., the current ability to direct the relevant activities of an entity when decisions about those activities need to be made.\n\nSubsidiaries, including SEs, are consolidated from the date when control is gained and deconsolidated from the date when control ceases. Control, or the lack thereof, is reassessed if facts and circumstances indicate that there is a change to one or more elements required to establish that control is present.\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The amount of non-controlling interests, if any, is measured at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 28 for more information\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nEach individual entity is assessed for consolidation in line with the aforementioned consolidation principles. The assessment of control can be complex and requires the use of significant judgment, in particular in determining whether UBS AG has power over the entity. As the nature and extent of UBS AG's involvement is unique for each entity, there is no uniform consolidation outcome by entity. Certain entities within a class may be consolidated while others may not. When carrying out the consolidation assessment, judgment is exercised considering all the relevant facts and circumstances, including the nature and activities of the investee, as well as the substance of voting and similar rights.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 28 for more information\n\n## 2) Financial instruments\n\n## a. Recognition\n\nUBS AG generally recognizes financial instruments when it becomes a party to contractual provisions of an instrument. However, UBS AG does not recognize assets received in transfers that do not qualify for derecognition by the transferor (applying derecognition principles under IFRS Accounting Standards as described in item 2e below). UBS AG applies settlement date accounting to all standard purchases and sales of non-derivative financial instruments.",

        "page_content": "UBS AG may act in a fiduciary capacity, which results in it holding or placing assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions. Unless these items meet the definition of an asset and the recognition criteria are satisfied, they are not recognized on UBS AG's balance sheet and the related income is excluded from the Financial Statements.\n\nClient cash balances associated with derivatives clearing and execution services are not recognized on the balance sheet if, through contractual agreement, regulation or practice, UBS AG neither obtains benefits from nor controls such cash balances.\n\n## b. Classification, measurement and presentation\n\n## Financial assets\n\nWhere the contractual terms of a debt instrument result in cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding, the debt instrument is classified as measured at amortized cost if it is held within a business model that has an objective of holding financial assets to collect contractual cash flows, or at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) if it is held within a business model with the objective of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.\n\nAll other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), including those held for trading or those managed on a fair value basis, except for derivatives designated in certain hedge accounting relationships (refer to item 2j in this Note for more information).\n\n## Business model assessment and contractual cash flow characteristics\n\nUBS AG determines the nature of a business model by considering the way financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective at the time an asset is recognized.\n\nIn assessing whether contractual cash flows are SPPI, UBS AG considers whether the contractual terms of the financial asset  contain  a  term  that  could  change  the  timing  or  amount  of  contractual  cash  flows  arising  over  the  life  of  the instrument. This assessment includes contractual cash flows that may vary due to environmental, social and governance (ESG) triggers.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortized cost include Debt issued measured at amortized cost and Funding from UBS Group AG measured at amortized cost . The latter includes contingent capital instruments issued to UBS Group AG prior to November 2023 that contain contractual provisions under which the principal amounts would be written down upon either a specified common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio breach or a determination by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) that a viability event has occurred. Such contractual provisions are not derivatives, as the underlying is deemed to be a non-financial variable specific to a party to the contract. Issuances after November 2023 include a contractual equity conversion feature with the same triggers, i.e., a CET1 ratio breach or FINMA viability event. When the debt is issued in US dollars, these conversion features are classified as equity and are accounted for in Share premium separately from the amortized cost debt host.\n\nWhen the legal bail-in mechanism for write-down or conversion into equity does not form part of the contractual terms of issued debt instruments, it does not affect the accounting classification of these instruments as debt or equity.\n\nIf a debt were to be written down or converted into equity in a future period, it would be partially or fully derecognized, with  the  difference  between  its  carrying  amount  and  the  fair  value  of  any  equity  issued  recognized  in  the  income statement.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nUBS AG designates certain issued debt instruments as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, on the basis that such financial instruments include embedded derivatives that are not closely related and which significantly impact the cash flows of the instrument and / or are managed on a fair value basis (refer to the table below for more information). Financial instruments including embedded derivatives arise predominantly from the issuance of certain structured debt instruments.\n\n## Measurement and presentation\n\nAfter initial recognition, UBS AG classifies, measures and presents its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IFRS 9, as described in the table below.",

        "page_content": "## c. Loan commitments and financial guarantees\n\nLoan  commitments  are  arrangements  to  provide  credit  under  defined  terms  and  conditions.  Irrevocable  loan commitments are classified as: (i) derivative loan commitments measured at fair value through profit or loss; (ii) loan commitments  designated  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss;  or  (iii) loan  commitments  not  measured  at  fair  value. Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require UBS AG to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for an incurred loss because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a specified debt instrument.\n\n## d. Interest income and expense\n\nInterest income and expense are recognized in the income statement based on the effective interest method. When calculating the effective interest rate (the EIR) for financial instruments (other than credit-impaired financial instruments), UBS AG estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the instrument, but not expected credit losses, with the EIR applied to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or the amortized cost of a financial liability. However, when a financial asset becomes credit impaired after initial recognition,  interest  income  is  determined  by applying the EIR to the amortized cost of the instrument, which represents the gross carrying amount adjusted for any credit loss allowance.\n\nUpfront fees, including fees on loan commitments not measured at fair value where a loan is expected to be issued, and direct costs are included within the initial measurement of a financial instrument measured at amortized cost or FVOCI and recognized over the expected life of the instrument as part of its EIR.\n\nFees related to loan commitments where no loan is expected to be issued, as well as loan syndication fees where UBS AG does not retain a portion of the syndicated loan or where UBS AG does retain a portion of the syndicated loan at the same effective yield for comparable risk as other participants, are included in Net fee and commission income and either recognized over the life of the commitment or when syndication occurs.\n\n## \u203a Refer to item 3 in this Note for more information\n\nInterest income on financial assets, excluding derivatives, is included in interest income when positive and in interest expense when negative. Similarly, interest expense on financial liabilities, excluding derivatives, is included in interest expense, except when interest rates are negative, in which case it is included in interest income.\n\n## \u203a Refer to item 2b in this Note and Note 3 for more information\n\n## e. Derecognition\n\n## Financial assets\n\nUBS AG  derecognizes  a  transferred  financial  asset,  or  a  portion  of  a  financial  asset,  if  the  purchaser  has  obtained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or a significant part of the risks and rewards combined with a practical ability to sell or pledge the asset.\n\nWhere financial assets have been pledged as collateral or in similar arrangements, they are considered to have been transferred if the counterparty has received the contractual rights to the cash flows of the pledged assets, as may be evidenced by, for example, the counterparty's right to sell or repledge the assets. In transfers where control over the financial  asset  is  retained,  UBS AG  continues  to  recognize  the  asset  to  the  extent  of  its  continuing  involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset following the transfer.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 22 for more information\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nUBS AG derecognizes a financial liability when it is extinguished, i.e., when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, canceled or expires. When an existing financial liability is exchanged for a new one from the same lender on substantially  different  terms,  or  the  terms  of  an  existing  liability  are  substantially  modified,  the  original  liability  is derecognized and a new liability recognized with any difference in the respective carrying amounts recorded in the income statement.\n\nCertain OTC derivative contracts and most exchange-traded futures and option contracts cleared through central clearing counterparties and exchanges are considered to be settled on a daily basis, as the payment or receipt of a variation margin on a daily basis represents a legal or economic settlement, which results in derecognition of the associated derivatives.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 21 for more information\n\n## f. Fair value of financial instruments\n\nUBS AG  accounts  for  a  significant  portion  of  its  assets  and  liabilities  at  fair  value.  Fair  value  is  the  price  on  the measurement date that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market, or in the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 20 for more information",

        "page_content": "## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe use of valuation techniques, modeling assumptions and estimates of unobservable market inputs in the fair valuation of financial instruments requires significant  judgment  and  could  affect  the  amount  of  gain  or  loss  recorded  for  a  particular  position.  Valuation  techniques  that  rely  more  heavily  on unobservable inputs and sophisticated models inherently require a higher level of judgment and may require adjustment to reflect factors that market participants would consider in estimating fair value, such as close-out costs, which are presented in Note 20d.\n\nUBS AG's governance framework over fair value measurement is described in Note 20b, and UBS AG provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated effects arising from changing significant unobservable inputs in Level 3 financial instruments to reasonably possible alternative assumptions in Note 20f.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 20 for more information\n\n## g. Allowances and provisions for expected credit losses\n\nECL are recognized for financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets measured at FVOCI, fee and lease receivables, financial guarantees, and loan commitments not measured at fair value. ECL are also recognized on the undrawn portion of committed unconditionally revocable credit lines, which include UBS AG's credit card limits and master credit facilities, as UBS AG is exposed to credit risk because the borrower has the ability to draw down funds before UBS AG can take credit risk mitigation actions.\n\n## Recognition of expected credit losses\n\nECL are recognized on the following basis.\n\n- - Stage 1 instruments: Maximum 12-month ECL are recognized from initial recognition, reflecting the portion of lifetime ECL that would result if a default occurs in the 12 months after the reporting date, weighted by the risk of a default occurring.\n- - Stage 2 instruments: Lifetime ECL are recognized if a significant increase in credit risk (an SICR) is observed subsequent to the instrument's initial recognition, reflecting lifetime cash shortfalls that would result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument, weighted by the risk of a default occurring. When an SICR is no longer observed, the instrument will move back to stage 1.\n- - Stage 3 instruments: Lifetime ECL are always recognized for credit-impaired financial instruments, as determined by the occurrence of one or more loss events, by estimating expected cash flows based on a chosen recovery strategy. Credit-impaired exposures may include positions for which no allowance has been recognized, for example because they are expected to be fully recoverable through collateral held.\n- - Changes in lifetime ECL since initial recognition are also recognized for assets that are purchased credit impaired (PCI). PCI financial instruments include those that are purchased at a deep discount or newly originated with a defaulted counterparty; they remain a separate category until derecognition.\n\nAll or part of a financial asset is written off if it is deemed uncollectible or forgiven. Write-offs reduce the principal amount of a claim and are charged against related allowances for credit losses. Recoveries, in part or in full, of amounts previously written off are generally credited to Credit loss expense / (release) .\n\nECL are recognized in the income statement in Credit loss expense / (release) . A corresponding ECL allowance is reported as a decrease in the carrying amount of financial assets measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. For financial assets that are measured at FVOCI, the carrying amount is not reduced, but an accumulated amount is recognized in Other comprehensive income . For off-balance sheet financial instruments and other credit lines, provisions for ECL are presented in Provisions.\n\n## Default and credit impairment\n\nUBS AG applies a single definition of default for credit risk management purposes, regulatory reporting and ECL, with a counterparty classified as defaulted based on quantitative and qualitative criteria.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information\n\n## Measurement of expected credit losses\n\nIFRS 9 ECL reflect an unbiased, probability-weighted estimate based on loss expectations resulting from default events. The method used to calculate ECL applies the following principal factors: probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). Parameters are generally determined on an individual financial asset level. Based on the materiality of the portfolio, for credit card exposures and personal account overdrafts in Switzerland, a portfolio approach is applied that derives an average PD and LGD for the entire portfolio. PDs and LGDs used in the ECL calculation are point-in-time(PIT)-based for key portfolios and consider both current conditions and expected cyclical changes. For material portfolios, PDs and LGDs are determined for different scenarios, whereas EAD projections are treated as scenario independent.",

        "page_content": "## Note 1  Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n\nFor the purpose of determining the ECL-relevant parameters, UBS AG leverages its Basel III advanced internal ratingsbased (A-IRB) models that are also used in determining expected loss (EL) and risk-weighted assets under the Basel III framework and Pillar 2 stress loss models. Adjustments have been made to these models and IFRS 9-related models have been developed that consider the complexity, structure and risk profile of relevant portfolios and take account of the fact that PDs and LGDs used in the ECL calculation are PIT-based, as opposed to the corresponding Basel III through-the-cycle (TTC)  parameters.  All  models  that  are  relevant  for  measuring  expected  credit  losses  are  subject  to  UBS AG's  model validation and oversight processes.\n\nProbability of default: PD represents the probability of a default over a specified time period. A 12-month PD represents the probability of default determined for the next 12 months and a lifetime PD represents the probability of default over the remaining lifetime of the instrument. PIT PDs are derived from TTC PDs and scenario forecasts. The modeling is region, industry and client segment specific and considers both macroeconomic scenario dependencies and client-idiosyncratic information.\n\nExposure at default: EAD represents an estimate of the exposure to credit risk at the time of a potential default occurring, considering expected repayments, interest payments and accruals, discounted at the EIR. Future drawdowns on facilities are considered through a credit conversion factor (a CCF) that is reflective of historical drawdown and default patterns and the characteristics of the respective portfolios.\n\nLoss given default: LGD represents an estimate of the loss at the time of a potential default occurring, taking into account expected  future  cash  flows  from  collateral  and  other  credit  enhancements,  or  expected  payouts  from  bankruptcy proceedings for unsecured claims and, where applicable, time to realization of collateral and the seniority of claims. LGD is commonly expressed as a percentage of EAD.\n\n## Estimation of expected credit losses\n\n## Number of scenarios and estimation of scenario weights\n\nDetermination of probability-weighted ECL requires evaluating a range of diverse and relevant future economic conditions, especially with a view to modeling the non-linear effect of assumptions about macroeconomic factors on the estimate.\n\nTo accommodate this requirement, UBS AG uses different economic scenarios in the ECL calculation. Each scenario is represented by a specific scenario narrative, which is relevant considering the exposure of key portfolios to economic risks, and for which a set of consistent macroeconomic variables is determined. The estimation of the appropriate weights for  these scenarios is predominantly judgment-based. The assessment is based on a holistic review of the prevailing economic or political conditions, which may exhibit different levels of uncertainty. It takes into account the impact of changes in the nature and severity of the underlying scenario narratives and the projected economic variables.\n\nThe determined weights constitute the probabilities that the respective set of macroeconomic conditions will occur and not that the chosen particular narratives with the related macroeconomic variables will materialize.\n\n## Macroeconomic and other factors\n\nThe range of macroeconomic, market and other factors that is modeled as part of the scenario determination is wide, and historical information is used to support the identification of the key factors. As the forecast horizon increases, the availability of information decreases, requiring an increase in judgment. For cycle-sensitive PD and LGD determination purposes, UBS AG projects the relevant economic factors for a period of three years before reverting, over a specified period, to cycle-neutral PD and LGD for longer-term projections.\n\nFactors relevant for ECL calculation vary by type of exposure. Regional and client-segment characteristics are generally taken into account, with specific focus on Switzerland and the US, considering UBS AG's key ECL-relevant portfolios.\n\nFor  UBS AG,  the  following  forward-looking  macroeconomic  variables  represent  the  most  relevant  factors  for  ECL calculation:\n\n- - gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates, given their significant effect on borrowers' performance;\n- - unemployment rates, given their significant effect on private clients' ability to meet contractual obligations;\n- - house price indices, given their significant effect on mortgage collateral valuations;\n- - interest rates, given their significant effect on counterparties' abilities to service debt;\n- - consumer price indices, given their overall relevance for companies' performance, private clients' purchasing power and economic stability; and\n- - equity indices, given that they are an important factor in UBS AG's corporate rating tools.\n\n## Scenario generation, review process and governance\n\nA team of economists, which is part of Group Risk Control, develops the forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions with involvement from a broad range of experts.",

        "page_content": "## Note 1  Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n\nThe scenarios, their weights and the key macroeconomic and other factors are subject to a critical assessment by the IFRS 9 Scenario Sounding Sessions and ECL Management Forum, which include senior management from Group Risk and Group Finance. Important aspects for the review include whether there may be particular credit risk concerns that may not be capable of being addressed systematically and require post-model adjustments for stage allocation and ECL allowance.\n\nThe Group Model Governance Committee (the GMGC), as the highest authority under UBS AG's model governance framework, ratifies the decisions taken by the ECL Management Forum.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 19 for more information\n\n## ECL measurement period\n\nThe period for which lifetime ECL are determined is based on the maximum contractual period that UBS AG is exposed to  credit  risk,  taking  into  account  contractual  extension,  termination  and  prepayment  options.  For  irrevocable  loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, the measurement period represents the maximum contractual period for which UBS AG has an obligation to extend credit.\n\nAdditionally, some financial instruments include both an on-demand loan and a revocable undrawn commitment, where the contractual cancellation right does not limit UBS AG's exposure to credit risk to the contractual notice period, as the client has the ability to draw down funds before UBS AG can take risk-mitigating actions. In such cases UBS AG is required to estimate the period over which it is exposed to credit risk. This applies to UBS AG's credit card limits, which do not have a defined contractual maturity date, are callable on demand and where the drawn and undrawn components are managed as one exposure. The exposure arising from UBS AG's credit card limits is not significant and is managed at a portfolio level, with credit actions triggered when balances are past due. An ECL measurement period of seven years is applied for credit card limits, capped at 12 months for stage 1 balances, as a proxy for the period that UBS AG is exposed to credit risk.\n\nCustomary master credit agreements in the Swiss corporate market also include on-demand loans and revocable undrawn commitments.  For  smaller  commercial  facilities,  a  risk-based  monitoring  (RbM)  approach  is  in  place  that  highlights negative  trends  as  risk  events,  at  an  individual  facility  level,  based  on  a  combination  of  continuously  updated  risk indicators. The risk events trigger additional credit reviews by a risk officer, enabling informed credit decisions to be taken. Larger corporate facilities are not subject to RbM, but are reviewed at least annually through a formal credit review. UBS AG has assessed these credit risk management practices and considers both the RbM approach and formal credit reviews  as  substantive  credit  reviews  resulting  in  a  re-origination  of  the  given  facility.  Following  this,  a  12-month measurement period from the reporting date is used for both types of facilities as an appropriate proxy of the period over which UBS AG is exposed to credit risk, with 12 months also used as a look-back period for assessing an SICR, always from the respective reporting date.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk\n\nFinancial instruments subject to ECL are monitored on an ongoing basis. To determine whether the recognition of a maximum 12-month ECL continues to be appropriate, an assessment is made as to whether an SICR has occurred since initial recognition of the financial instrument, applying both quantitative and qualitative factors.\n\nPrimarily, UBS AG assesses changes in an instrument's risk of default on a quantitative basis by comparing the annualized forward-looking and scenario-weighted lifetime PD of an instrument determined at two different dates:\n\n- - at the reporting date; and\n- - at inception of the instrument.\n\nIf, based on UBS AG's quantitative modeling, an increase exceeds a set threshold, an SICR is deemed to have occurred and the instrument is transferred to stage 2 with lifetime ECL recognized.\n\nThe threshold applied varies depending on the original credit quality of the borrower, with a higher SICR threshold set for those instruments with a low PD at inception. The SICR assessment based on PD changes is made at an individual financial asset level. A high-level overview of the SICR trigger, which is a multiple of the annualized remaining lifetime PIT PD expressed in rating downgrades, is provided in the 'SICR thresholds' table below. The actual SICR thresholds applied are defined on a more granular level by interpolating between the values shown in the table.\n\n## SICR thresholds\n\n| Internal rating at origination  of the instrument   |   Rating downgrades / SICR trigger |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| 0-3                                                 |                                  3 |\n| 4-8                                                 |                                  2 |\n| 9-13                                                |                                  1 |",

        "page_content": "## Note 1  Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n\nIrrespective of the SICR assessment based on default probabilities, credit risk is generally deemed to have significantly increased for an instrument if contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. For certain less material portfolios, specifically the Swiss credit card portfolio, the 30-day past due criterion is used as the primary indicator of an SICR. Where instruments are transferred to stage 2 due to the 30-day past due criterion, a minimum period of six months is applied before a transfer back to stage 1 can be triggered, where applicable. For instruments in Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management Region Switzerland that are between 90 and 180 days past due but have not been reclassified to stage 3, a one-year period is applied before a transfer back to stage 1 can be triggered.\n\nAdditionally,  based  on  individual  counterparty-specific  indicators,  external  market  indicators  of  credit  risk  or  general economic conditions, counterparties may be moved to a watch list, which is used as a secondary qualitative indicator for an  SICR.  Exception  management  is  further  applied,  allowing  for  individual  and  collective  adjustments  on  exposures sharing the same credit risk characteristics to take account of specific situations that are not otherwise fully reflected.\n\nIn general, the overall SICR determination process does not apply to Lombard loans, securities financing transactions and certain  other  asset-based  lending  transactions,  because  of  the  risk  management  practices  adopted,  including  daily monitoring processes with strict margining. If margin calls are not satisfied, a position is closed out and classified as a stage 3 position. In exceptional cases, an individual adjustment and a transfer into stage 2 may be made to take account of specific facts.\n\nCredit risk officers are responsible for the identification of an SICR, which for accounting purposes is in some respects different  from  internal  credit  risk  management  processes.  This  difference  mainly  arises  because  ECL  accounting requirements are instrument-specific, such that a borrower can have multiple exposures allocated to different stages, and maturing loans in stage 2 will migrate to stage 1 upon renewal irrespective of the actual credit risk at that time. Under a risk-based  approach,  a  holistic  counterparty  credit  assessment  and  the  absolute  level  of  risk  at  any  given  date  will determine what risk-mitigating actions may be warranted.\n\n## \u203a Refer to the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe calculation of ECL requires management to apply significant judgment and make estimates and assumptions that can result in significant changes to the timing and the amount of ECL recognized.\n\n## Determination of a significant increase in credit risk\n\nIFRS 9 does not include a definition of what constitutes an SICR, with UBS AG's assessment considering qualitative and quantitative criteria. An IFRS 9 ECL Management Forum has been established to review and challenge the SICR results.\n\n## Scenarios, scenario weights and macroeconomic variables\n\nECL reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount, which UBS AG determines by evaluating a range of possible outcomes. Management selects forward-looking  scenarios  that  include  relevant  macroeconomic  variables  and  management's  assumptions  around  future  economic  conditions.  IFRS 9 Scenario Sounding Sessions, in addition to the IFRS 9 ECL Management Forum, are in place to derive, review and challenge the scenario selection and weights, and to determine whether any additional post-model adjustments are required that may significantly affect ECL.\n\n## ECL measurement period\n\nLifetime ECL are generally determined based upon the contractual maturity of the transaction, which significantly affects ECL. For credit card limits and Swiss callable master credit facilities, judgment is required, as UBS AG must determine the period over which it is exposed to credit risk. A seven-year period is applied for credit card limits, capped at 12 months for stage 1 positions, and a 12-month period applied for master credit facilities.\n\n## Modeling and post-model adjustments\n\nA number of complex models have been developed or modified to calculate ECL, with additional post-model adjustments required that may significantly affect ECL. The models are governed by UBS AG's model validation controls and approved by the GMGC. The post-model adjustments are approved by the ECL Management Forum and endorsed by the GMGC.\n\nA sensitivity analysis covering key macroeconomic variables, scenario weights and SICR trigger points on ECL measurement is provided in Note 19f.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 19 for more information\n\n## h. Restructured and modified financial assets\n\nWhen payment default is expected, or where default has already occurred, UBS AG may grant concessions to borrowers in financial difficulties that it would not consider in the normal course of its business, such as preferential interest rates, extension of maturity, modifying the schedule of repayments, debt / equity swap, subordination, etc.\n\n## \u203a Refer to the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information\n\nModifications result in an alteration of future contractual cash flows and can occur within UBS AG's normal risk tolerance or as part of a credit restructuring where a counterparty is in financial difficulties. The restructuring or modification of a financial asset could lead to a substantial change in the terms and conditions, resulting in the original financial asset being  derecognized  and  a  new  financial  asset  being  recognized.  Where  the  modification  does  not  result  in  a derecognition, any difference between the modified contractual cash flows discounted at the original EIR and the existing gross carrying amount of the given financial asset is recognized in the income statement as a modification gain or loss.",

        "page_content": "## i. Offsetting\n\nUBS AG presents financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet net if (i) it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized  amounts  and  (ii) it  intends  either  to  settle  on  a  net  basis  or  to  realize  the  asset  and  settle  the  liability simultaneously.  Netted  positions  include,  for  example,  certain  derivatives  and  repurchase  and  reverse  repurchase transactions with various counterparties, exchanges and clearing houses.\n\nIn  assessing  whether  UBS AG  intends  to  either  settle  on  a  net  basis,  or  to  realize  the  asset  and  settle  the  liability simultaneously, emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of operational settlement mechanics in eliminating substantially all credit and liquidity exposure between the counterparties. This condition precludes offsetting on the balance sheet for substantial amounts of UBS AG's financial assets and liabilities, even though they may be subject to enforceable netting arrangements. Repurchase arrangements and securities financing transactions are presented net only to the extent that the settlement mechanism eliminates, or results in insignificant, credit and liquidity risk, and processes the receivables and payables in a single settlement process or cycle.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 21 for more information\n\n## j. Hedge accounting\n\nUBS AG applies hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 where the criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness are met. If a hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued. Voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting is not permitted under IFRS 9.\n\n## Fair value hedges of interest rate risk related to debt instruments and loan assets\n\nThe fair value change of the hedged item attributable to a hedged risk is reflected as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognized in the income statement along with the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.\n\n## Fair value hedges of FX risk related to debt instruments\n\nThe fair value change of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is reflected in the measurement of the hedged item and recognized in the income statement along with the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The foreign currency basis spread of cross-currency swaps designated as hedging derivatives is excluded from the designation and accounted for as a cost of hedging with amounts deferred in Other comprehensive income within Equity .  These amounts are released to the income statement over the term of the hedged item.\n\n## Discontinuation of fair value hedges\n\nDiscontinuations for reasons other than derecognition of the hedged item result in an adjustment to the carrying amount, which is amortized to the income statement over the remaining life of the hedged item using the effective interest method. If the hedged item is derecognized, the unamortized fair value adjustment or deferred cost of hedging amount is recognized immediately in the income statement as part of any derecognition gain or loss.\n\n## Cash flow hedges of forecast transactions\n\nFair value gains or losses associated with the effective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for cash flow repricing risk are recognized initially in Other comprehensive income within Equity and reclassified to Interest income from financial instruments measured at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income or Interest expense from financial instruments measured at amortized cost in  the periods when the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss, including discontinued hedges for which forecast cash flows are expected to occur. If the forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur, the deferred gains or losses are immediately reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## Hedges of net investments in foreign operations\n\nGains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of a hedge are recognized directly in Other comprehensive income within Equity , while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective and / or undesignated portion (for example, the interest element of a forward contract) are recognized in the income statement. Upon disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recognized in Equity associated with the entity is reclassified to Other income .\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nUBS AG continued hedge accounting during the period of uncertainty before existing interest rate benchmarks were replaced with alternative risk-free interest rates. During this period, UBS AG assumed that the current benchmark rates would continue to exist, such that forecast transactions were considered highly probable and hedge relationships remain, with little or no consequential impact on the financial statements. Upon replacement of existing interest rate benchmarks by alternative risk-free interest rates, UBS AG applied the requirements of Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2) , where applicable .\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 25 for more information",

        "page_content": "## 3) Fee and commission income and expenses\n\nUBS AG earns fee income from the diverse range of services it provides to its clients. Fee income can be divided into two broad categories: fees earned from services that are provided over a certain period of time, such as management of clients' assets, custody services and certain advisory services; and fees earned from PIT services, such as underwriting fees, deal-contingent merger and acquisitions fees, and brokerage fees (e.g., securities and derivatives execution and clearing). UBS AG recognizes fees earned from PIT services when it has fully provided the service to the client. Where the contract requires services to be provided over time, income is recognized on a systematic basis over the life of the agreement.\n\nConsideration received is allocated to the separately identifiable performance obligations in a contract. Owing to the nature  of  UBS AG's  business,  contracts  that  include  multiple  performance  obligations  are  typically  those  that  are considered to include a series of similar performance obligations fulfilled over time with the same pattern of transfer to the client, e.g., management of client assets and custodial services. As a consequence, UBS AG is not required to apply significant judgment in allocating the consideration received across the various performance obligations.\n\nPIT services are generally for a fixed price or dependent on deal size, e.g., a fixed number of basis points of trade size, where the amount of revenue is known when the performance obligation is met. Fixed-over-time fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the performance period. Custodial and asset management fees can be variable through reference to  the  size  of  the  customer  portfolio.  However,  they  are  generally  billed  on  a  monthly  or  quarterly  basis  once  the customer's  portfolio  size  is  known  or  known  with  near  certainty  and  therefore  also  recognized  ratably  over  the performance period. UBS AG does not recognize performance fees related to management of clients' assets or fees related to contingencies beyond UBS AG's control until such uncertainties are resolved.\n\nUBS AG's fees are generally earned from short-term contracts. As a result, UBS AG's contracts do not include a financing component or result in the recognition of significant receivables or prepayment assets. Furthermore, due to the shortterm nature of such contracts, UBS AG has not capitalized any material costs to obtain or fulfill a contract or generated any significant contract assets or liabilities.\n\nUBS AG presents expenses primarily in line with their nature in the income statement, differentiating between expenses that are directly attributable to the satisfaction of specific performance obligations associated with the generation of revenues, which are generally presented within Total revenues as Fee and commission expense , and those that are related to  personnel,  general  and  administrative  expenses,  or  depreciation  and  amortization  which  are  presented  within Operating expenses . For derivatives execution and clearing services (where UBS AG acts as an agent), UBS AG only records its specific fees in the income statement, with fees payable to other parties not recognized as an expense but instead directly offset against the associated income collected from the given client.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 4 for more information, including the disaggregation of revenues\n\n## 4) Share-based and other deferred compensation plans\n\nUBS AG recognizes expenses for deferred compensation awards over the period that the employee is required to provide service to become entitled to the award. Where the service period is shortened, for example in the case of employees affected by restructuring programs or mutually agreed termination provisions, recognition of such expense is accelerated to the termination date. Where no future service is required, such as for employees who are eligible for retirement or who  have  met  certain  age  and  length-of-service  criteria,  the  services  are  presumed  to  have  been  received  and compensation expense is recognized over the performance year or, in the case of off-cycle awards, immediately on the grant date.\n\n## Share-based compensation plans\n\nUBS Group AG is the grantor of and maintains the obligation to settle share-based compensation plans that are awarded to employees of UBS AG. As a consequence, UBS AG classifies the awards of UBS Group AG shares as equity-settled share-based payment transactions. UBS AG recognizes the fair value of awards granted to its employees by reference to the fair value of UBS Group AG's equity instruments on the date of grant, taking into account the terms and conditions inherent in the award, including, where relevant, dividend rights, transfer restrictions in effect beyond the vesting date, market conditions, and non-vesting conditions.\n\nFor equity-settled awards, fair value is not remeasured unless the terms of the award are modified such that there is an incremental increase in value. Expenses are recognized, on a per-tranche basis, over the service period based on an estimate of the number of instruments expected to vest and are adjusted to reflect the actual outcomes of service or performance conditions.\n\nFor equity-settled awards, forfeiture events resulting from a breach of a non-vesting condition (i.e., one that does not relate to a service or performance condition) do not result in any adjustment to the share-based compensation expense.\n\nFor cash-settled share-based awards, fair value is remeasured at each reporting date, so that the cumulative expense recognized equals the cash distributed.",

        "page_content": "## Other deferred compensation plans\n\nCompensation expense for other deferred compensation plans is recognized on a per-tranche or straight-line basis, depending on the nature of the plan. The amount recognized is measured based on the present value of the amount expected to be paid under the plan and is remeasured at each reporting date, so that the cumulative expense recognized equals the cash or the fair value of respective financial instruments distributed.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 27 for more information\n\n## 5) Post-employment benefit plans\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nDefined benefit plans specify an amount of benefit that an employee will receive, which usually depends on one or more factors, such as age, years of service and compensation. The defined benefit liability recognized in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation, measured using the projected unit credit method, less the fair value of the plan's assets at the balance sheet date, with changes resulting from remeasurements recorded immediately in Other comprehensive income . If the fair value of the plan's assets is higher than the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the recognition of the resulting net asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Calculation of the net defined benefit obligation or asset takes into account the specific features of each plan, including risk sharing between employee and employer, and is calculated periodically by independent qualified actuaries.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe net defined benefit liability or asset at the balance sheet date and the related personnel expense depend on the expected future benefits to be provided, determined  using  a  number  of  economic  and  demographic  assumptions.  A  range  of  assumptions  could  be  applied,  and  different  assumptions  could significantly alter the defined benefit liability or asset and pension expense recognized. The most significant assumptions include life expectancy, discount rate, expected salary increases, pension increases and interest credits on retirement savings account balances. Sensitivity analysis for reasonable possible movements in each significant assumption for UBS AG's post-employment obligations is provided in Note 26.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 26 for more information\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nA defined contribution plan pays fixed contributions into  a  separate  entity  from  which  post-employment  and  other benefits are paid. UBS AG has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts if the plan does not hold sufficient  assets  to  pay  employees  the  benefits  relating  to  employee  service  in  the  current  and  prior  periods. Compensation expense is recognized when the employees have rendered services in exchange for contributions. This is generally in the year of contribution. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.\n\n## 6) Income taxes\n\nUBS AG is subject to the income tax laws of Switzerland and those of the non-Swiss jurisdictions in which UBS AG has business operations.\n\nUBS AG's provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes represent taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period or previous periods.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  (DTAs)  and  deferred  tax  liabilities  (DTLs)  are  recognized  for  temporary  differences  between  the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in deductible or taxable amounts, respectively in future periods. DTAs may also arise from other sources, including unused tax losses and unused tax credits. DTAs and DTLs are measured using the applicable tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.\n\nDTAs are recognized only to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which these differences can be used. When an entity or tax group has a history of recent losses, DTAs are only recognized to the extent that there are sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilized.\n\nDeferred and current tax assets and liabilities are offset when: (i) they arise in the same tax reporting group; (ii) they relate to the same tax authority; (iii) the legal right to offset exists; and (iv) with respect to current taxes they are intended to be settled net or realized simultaneously.\n\nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement, except for current and deferred taxes recognized in relation to: (i) the acquisition of a subsidiary (for which such amounts would affect the amount of goodwill arising from the acquisition); (ii) unrealized gains or losses on financial instruments that are classified at FVOCI; (iii) changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges; (iv) remeasurements of defined benefit plans; or (v) certain foreign currency translations of foreign operations. Amounts relating to points (ii) through (v) above are recognized in Other comprehensive income within Equity .",

        "page_content": "UBS AG reflects the potential effect of uncertain tax positions for which acceptance by the relevant tax authority is not considered probable by adjusting current or deferred taxes, as applicable, using either the most likely amount or expected value methods, depending on which method is deemed a better predictor of the basis on which, and extent to which, the uncertainty will be resolved.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nTax laws are complex, and judgment and interpretations about the application of such laws are required when accounting for income taxes. UBS AG considers the performance of its businesses and the accuracy of historical forecasts and other factors when evaluating the recoverability of its DTAs, including the remaining tax loss carry-forward period, and its assessment of expected future taxable profits in the forecast period used for recognizing DTAs. Estimating future profitability and business plan forecasts is inherently subjective and is particularly sensitive to future economic, market and other conditions.\n\nForecasts are reviewed annually, but adjustments may be made at other times, if required. If recent losses have been incurred, convincing evidence is required to prove there is sufficient future profitability given that the value of UBS AG's DTAs may be affected, with effects primarily recognized through the income statement.\n\nIn addition, judgment is required to assess the expected value of uncertain tax positions and the related probabilities, including interpretation of tax laws, the resolution of any income tax-related appeals and litigation.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 8 for more information\n\n## 7) Investments in associates\n\nInterests in entities where UBS AG has significant influence over the financial and operating policies of these entities but does  not  have  control  are  classified  as  investments  in  associates  and  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of accounting. Typically, UBS AG has significant influence when it holds, or has the ability to hold, between 20% and 50% of an entity's voting rights. Investments in associates are initially recognized at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased after the date of acquisition to recognize UBS AG's share of the investee's comprehensive income and any impairment losses. The net investment in an associate is impaired if there is objective evidence of a loss event and the carrying amount of the investment in the associate exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 28 for more information\n\n## 8) Property, equipment and software\n\nProperty, equipment and software is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Software development costs are capitalized only when the costs can be measured reliably and it is probable that future economic benefits will  arise.  Depreciation  of  property,  equipment  and  software begins when they are available for use and is calculated on a straight-line basis over an asset's estimated useful life.\n\nProperty, equipment and software are generally tested for impairment at the appropriate cash-generating unit level, alongside goodwill and intangible assets as described in item 9 in this Note. An impairment charge is recognized for such assets  if  the  recoverable  amount  is  below  its  carrying  amount.  The  recoverable  amounts  of  such  assets,  other  than property that has a market price, are generally determined using a replacement cost approach that reflects the amount that would be currently required by a market participant to replace the service capacity of the asset. If such assets are no longer used, they are tested individually for impairment.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 11 for more information\n\n## 9) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration over the fair  value  of  identifiable  assets,  liabilities  and  contingent liabilities acquired that arises in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment at the end of each reporting period, or when indicators of impairment exist. UBS AG tests goodwill for impairment annually, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment.\n\nAn impairment charge is recognized in the income statement if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount of a cash-generating-unit.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nUBS AG's methodology for goodwill impairment testing is based on a model that is most sensitive to the following key assumptions: (i) forecasts of earnings available to shareholders (typically estimated on a discrete basis for years one to three but could extend up to five years, as permitted under IFRS Accounting Standards, in order to reflect facts and circumstances specific to a cash-generating unit); (ii) changes in the discount rates; and (iii) changes in the long-term growth rate.\n\nEarnings available to shareholders are estimated on the basis of forecast results, which are part of the business plan approved by the BoD. The discount rates and growth rates are determined using external information, and also considering inputs from both internal and external analysts and the view of management.\n\nThe key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of each cash-generating unit are tested for sensitivity by applying reasonably possible changes to those assumptions.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Notes 2 and 12 for more information",

        "page_content": "## 10) Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, and are generally recognized in accordance with IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets , when: (i) UBS AG has a present obligation as a result of a past event; (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and (iii) a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.\n\nThe majority  of  UBS AG's  provisions  relate  to  litigation,  regulatory  and  similar  matters,  restructuring,  and  employee benefits.  Restructuring  provisions  are  generally  recognized  as  a  consequence  of  management  agreeing  to  materially change the scope of the business or the manner in which it is conducted, including changes in management structures. Provisions  for  employee  benefits  relate  mainly  to  service  anniversaries  and  sabbatical  leave,  and  are  recognized  in accordance with measurement principles set out in item 4 in this Note. In addition, UBS AG presents expected credit loss allowances within Provisions if they relate to a loan commitment, financial guarantee contract or a revolving revocable credit line.\n\nIAS 37  provisions  are  measured  considering  the  best  estimate  of  the  consideration  required  to  settle  the  present obligation at the balance sheet date.\n\nWhen conditions required to recognize a provision are not met, a contingent liability is disclosed, unless the likelihood of an outflow of resources is remote. Contingent liabilities are also disclosed for possible obligations that arise from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by uncertain future events not wholly within the control of UBS AG.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nRecognition of provisions often involves significant judgment in assessing the existence of an obligation that results from past events and in estimating the probability, the timing and the amount of any outflows of resources. This is particularly the case for litigation, regulatory and similar matters, which, due to their nature, are subject to many uncertainties, making their outcome difficult to predict.\n\nThe amount of any provision recognized is sensitive to the assumptions used, and there could be a wide range of possible outcomes for any particular matter.\n\nManagement regularly reviews all the available information regarding such matters, including legal advice, to assess whether the recognition criteria for provisions have been satisfied and to determine the timing and the amount of any potential outflows.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 17 for more information\n\n## 11) Foreign currency translation\n\nTransactions denominated in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency of the reporting entity at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At the balance sheet date, all monetary assets, including those at FVOCI, and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency using the closing exchange rate. Translation differences are reported in Other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss .\n\nNon-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.\n\nUpon  consolidation,  assets  and  liabilities  of  foreign  operations  are  translated  into  US  dollars,  UBS AG's  presentation currency, at the closing exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and income and expense items and other comprehensive income are translated at the average rate for the period. The resulting foreign currency translation differences are recognized in Equity and reclassified to the income statement when UBS AG disposes of, partially or in its entirety, the foreign operation and UBS AG no longer controls the foreign operation.\n\nShare capital issued and share premium held are translated at the historic average rate, with the difference between the historic average rate and the spot rate realized upon repayment of share capital reported as Share premium. Cumulative amounts recognized in Other comprehensive income in respect of cash flow hedges and financial assets measured at FVOCI are translated at the closing exchange rate as of the balance sheet dates, with any translation effects adjusted through Retained earnings .\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 32 for more information",

The adoption has had no effect on UBS AG's financial statements. UBS AG does not provide insurance services in any market.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes\n\nIn May 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes , in relation to top-up taxes on income under Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules that is imposed under legislation that has been enacted or substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two model rules published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nCertain countries in which UBS AG operates had enacted such legislation by 31 December 2023, including Switzerland, which introduced a tax with effect from 1 January 2024 that is expected to be a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax, and other countries (including Germany, France and Italy) also introduced top-up taxes in respect of a non-domestic UBS AG's worldwide operations with effect from 1 January 2025. Moreover, it is expected that other countries will enact such legislation in 2024.\n\nThe amendments to IAS 12 introduced an exception, whereby deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities should not be  recognized  or  disclosed  in  respect  of top-up taxes,  which  has  been  applied  for  the  purposes  of  these  financial statements.\n\nAn assessment was performed of UBS AG's potential exposure to top-up taxes under legislation that was enacted or substantively  enacted  to  implement  the  Pillar  Two  model  rules  by  31 December  2023,  reflecting  country-by-country reporting and, also, the corporate tax expenses of UBS AG entities for recent years and those expected in future years. This assessment indicated that UBS AG's profits in future years are expected to be almost entirely earned in countries with corporate tax expenses that are at a tax rate of 15% or more and will not, therefore, be subject to top-up taxes. Consequently, UBS AG is not expected to have a material annual exposure to top-up taxes for future years under this legislation.\n\n## c) IFRS Accounting Standards and Interpretations to be adopted in 2024 and later and other changes\n\n## Other amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards\n\nThe IASB has issued a number of minor amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards, effective from 1 January 2024 and later. These amendments are not expected to have a significant effect on UBS AG when they are adopted.",

Group functions is made up of the following major areas: Group Services (which  consists  of  the  Group  Operations  and  Technology  Office,  Corporate  Services,  Compliance,  Regulatory  & Governance, Finance, Risk Control, Human Resources, Communications & Branding, Legal, the Group Integration Office, Group Sustainability and Impact, and Chief Strategy Office) and Group Treasury.\n\nFinancial information about the five business divisions and Group Items is presented separately in internal management reports to the Executive Board, which is considered the 'chief operating decision-maker' pursuant to IFRS 8, Operating Segments .\n\nUBS AG's internal accounting policies, which include management accounting policies and service-level agreements, determine  the  revenues  and  expenses  directly  attributable  to  each  reportable  segment.  Transactions  between  the reportable segments are carried out at internally agreed rates and are reflected in the operating results of the reportable segments.  Revenue-sharing  agreements  are  used  to  allocate  external  client  revenues  to  reportable  segments  where several  reportable  segments  are  involved  in  the  value  creation  chain.  Total  intersegment  revenues  for  UBS AG  are immaterial, as the majority of the revenues are allocated across the segments by means of revenue-sharing agreements. Interest income earned from managing UBS AG's consolidated equity is allocated to the reportable segments based on average attributed equity and currency composition. Assets and liabilities of the reportable segments are funded through and invested with Group functions, and the net interest margin is reflected in the results of each reportable segment.\n\nSegment assets are based on a third-party view and do not include intercompany balances. This view is in line with internal reporting to management. If one operating segment is involved in an external transaction together with another operating segment or Group function, additional criteria are considered to determine the segment that will report the associated  assets.  This  will  include  a  consideration  of  which  segment's  business  needs  are  being  addressed  by  the transaction and which segment is providing the funding and / or resources. Allocation of liabilities follows the same principles.\n\nNon-current assets disclosed for segment reporting purposes represent assets that are expected to be recovered more than 12 months after the reporting date, excluding financial instruments, deferred tax assets and post-employment benefits.",

The allocation of total revenues to these regions reflects, and is consistent with, the basis on which the business is managed and its performance is evaluated. These allocations involve assumptions and judgments that management considers to be reasonable, and may be refined to reflect changes in estimates or management structure. The main principles of the allocation methodology are that client revenues are attributed to the domicile of the given client and trading and portfolio management revenues are attributed to the country where the risk is managed. This revenue attribution is consistent with the mandate of the regional Presidents. Certain revenues, such as those related to Non-core and Legacy Portfolio, are managed at a Group level. These revenues are included in the Global line.\n\nThe geographic analysis of non-current assets is based on the location of the entity in which the given assets are recorded.\n\n## For the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n|                                                        | Total revenues   | Total revenues   | Total non-current assets   | Total non-current assets   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                        | USD bn           | Share %          | USD bn                     | Share %                    |\n| Americas 1                                             | 13.3             | 39               | 8.6                        | 47                         |\n| Asia Pacific                                           | 5.2              | 15               | 1.2                        | 7                          |\n| Europe, Middle East and Africa (excluding Switzerland) | 6.1              | 18               | 2.6                        | 14                         |\n| Switzerland                                            | 9.2              | 27               | 5.9                        | 32                         |\n| Global                                                 | (0.1)            | 0                | 0.0                        | 0                          |\n| Total                                                  | 33.7             | 100              | 18.3                       | 100                        |\n\n## For the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n|                                                        | Total revenues   | Total revenues   | Total non-current assets   | Total non-current assets   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                        | USD bn           | Share %          | USD bn                     | Share %                    |\n| Americas 1                                             | 13.8             | 40               | 9.0                        | 48                         |\n| Asia Pacific                                           | 5.6              | 16               | 1.5                        | 8                          |\n| Europe, Middle East and Africa (excluding Switzerland) | 7.0              | 20               | 2.6                        | 14                         |\n| Switzerland                                            | 7.7              | 22               | 5.6                        | 30                         |\n| Global                                                 | 0.8              | 2                | 0.0                        | 0                          |\n| Total                                                  | 34.9             | 100              | 18.7                       | 100                        |\n\n## For the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n|                                                        | Total revenues   | Total revenues   | Total non-current assets   | Total non-current assets   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                        | USD bn           | Share %          | USD bn                     | Share %                    |\n| Americas 1                                             | 14.5             | 40               | 9.0                        | 47                         |\n| Asia Pacific                                           | 6.5              | 18               | 1.4                        | 7                          |\n| Europe, Middle East and Africa (excluding Switzerland) | 7.0              | 20               | 2.6                        | 13                         |\n| Switzerland                                            | 7.8              | 22               | 6.3                        | 33                         |\n| Global                                                 | 0.1              | 0                | 0.0                        | 0                          |\n| Total                                                  | 35.8             | 100              | 19.3                       | 100                        |\n\n- 1 Predominantly related to the US.",

The valuation allowances reflect DTAs that were not recognized because, as of the last remeasurement period, management did not consider it probable that there would be sufficient future taxable profits available to utilize the related tax loss carry-forwards and deductible temporary differences.\n\nThe recognition of DTAs is supported by forecasts of taxable profits for the entities concerned. In addition, tax planning opportunities are available that would result in additional future taxable income and these would be utilized, if necessary.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized in respect of investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except to the extent that UBS AG can control the timing of the reversal of the associated taxable temporary difference, and it is probable that such will not reverse in the foreseeable future. However, as of 31 December 2023, this exception was not considered to apply to any taxable temporary differences.\n\n| USD m                                                                   | 31.12.23   | 31.12.23            | 31.12.23   | 31.12.22   | 31.12.22            | 31.12.22   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|------------|------------|---------------------|------------|\n| Deferred tax assets 1                                                   | Gross      | Valuation allowance | Recognized | Gross      | Valuation allowance | Recognized |\n| Tax loss carry-forwards                                                 | 11,453     | (8,496)             | 2,957      | 12,708     | (8,720)             | 3,988      |\n| Unused tax credits                                                      | 95         | 0                   | 95         | 0          | 0                   | 0          |\n| Temporary differences                                                   | 6,771      | (579)               | 6,192      | 5,774      | (408)               | 5,365      |\n| of which: related to real estate costs capitalized for US tax  purposes | 2,703      | 0                   | 2,703      | 2,485      | 0                   | 2,485      |\n| of which: related to compensation and benefits                          | 1,457      | (205)               | 1,252      | 1,169      | (175)               | 993        |\n| of which: related to cash flow hedges                                   | 619        | 0                   | 619        | 947        | 0                   | 947        |\n| of which: other                                                         | 1,992      | (374)               | 1,618      | 1,173      | (233)               | 940        |\n| Total deferred tax assets                                               | 18,319     | (9,076)             | 9,244 2    | 18,482     | (9,128)             | 9,354 2    |\n| of which: related to the US                                             |            |                     | 8,505      |            |                     | 8,294      |\n| of which: related to other locations                                    |            |                     | 739        |            |                     | 1,060      |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                                |            |                     |            |            |                     |            |\n| Total deferred tax liabilities                                          |            |                     | 162        |            |                     | 233        |\n\n1 After offset of DTLs, as applicable. 2 As of 31 December 2023, UBS AG recognized DTAs of USD 408m (31 December 2022: USD 471m) in respect of entities that incurred losses in either the current or preceding year.\n\nIn general, US federal tax losses incurred prior to 31 December 2017 can be carried forward for 20 years. US federal tax losses incurred after that date can be carried forward indefinitely, although the utilization of such losses is limited to 80% of the entity's future year taxable profits. UK tax losses can also be carried forward indefinitely; they can shelter up to either 25% or 50% of future year taxable profits, depending on when the tax losses arose. The amounts of US tax loss carry-forwards that are included in the table below are based on their amount for federal tax purposes rather than for state and local tax purposes.\n\n## Unrecognized tax loss carry-forwards\n\n| USD m                                | 31.12.23   | 31.12.22   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Within 1 year                        | 192        | 231        |\n| From 2 to 5 years                    | 10,278     | 2,184      |\n| From 6 to 10 years                   | 2,708      | 11,106     |\n| From 11 to 20 years                  | 1,199      | 1,610      |\n| No expiry                            | 16,252     | 16,960     |\n| Total                                | 30,630     | 32,091     |\n| of which: related to the US  1       | 12,354     | 13,350     |\n| of which: related to the UK          | 14,333     | 14,332     |\n| of which: related to other locations | 3,943      | 4,409      |",

Core loan exposure is defined as the sum of Loans and advances to customers and Loans to financial advisors .\n\nThese ratios are influenced by the following key factors:\n\n- - Lombard loans are generally secured with marketable securities in portfolios that are, as a rule, highly diversified, with strict lending policies that are intended to ensure that credit risk is minimal under most circumstances;\n- - mortgage loans to private clients and real estate financing are controlled by conservative eligibility criteria, including low loan-to-value ratios and strong debt service capabilities;\n- - the amount of unsecured retail lending (including credit cards) is insignificant;\n- - lending in Switzerland includes government-backed COVID-19 loans;\n- - contractual maturities in the loan portfolio, which are a factor in the calculation of ECLs, are generally short, with Lombard lending typically having average contractual maturities of 12 months or less, real estate lending generally between two and three years in Switzerland, with long-dated maturities in the US, and corporate lending between one and two years with related loan commitments up to four years; and\n- - write-offs of ECL allowances against the gross loan balances when all or part of a financial asset is deemed uncollectible or forgiven, reduces the coverage ratios.\n\nThe total combined on- and off-balance sheet coverage ratio was at 22 basis points as of 31 December 2023, 1 basis point higher than on 31 December 2022. The combined stage 1 and 2 ratio of 10 basis points was unchanged compared with 31 December 2022; the stage 3 ratio was 22%, materially unchanged compared with 31 December 2022.\n\n31.12.23\n\n|

Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreement or other recognized local industry-standard master agreements between UBS AG and  its  counterparties.  Terms  are  negotiated  directly  with  counterparties  and  the  contracts  have  industry-standard settlement  mechanisms  prescribed  by  ISDA  or  similar  industry-standard  solutions.  Other  OTC  derivatives  are  cleared through clearing houses, in particular interest rate swaps with LCH, where a settled-to-market method has been generally adopted, under which cash collateral exchanged on a daily basis is considered to legally settle the market value of the derivatives. Regulators in various jurisdictions have introduced rules requiring the payment and collection of initial and variation margins on certain OTC derivative contracts, which may have a bearing on price and other relevant terms.\n\nExchange-traded derivatives (ETD) are standardized in terms of their amounts and settlement dates, and are bought and sold  on  regulated  exchanges.  Exchanges  offer  the  benefits  of  pricing  transparency,  standardized  daily  settlement  of changes in value and, consequently, reduced credit risk.\n\nMost of UBS AG's derivative transactions relate to sales and market-making activity. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Market-making aims to directly support the facilitation and execution of client activity, and involves quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants with the aim of generating revenues based on spread and volume. UBS AG also uses various derivative instruments for hedging purposes.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Notes 15 and 20 for more information about derivative instruments\n- \u203a Refer to Note 25 for more information about derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships",

        "page_content": "## Risks of derivative instruments\n\nThe derivative financial assets shown on the balance sheet can be an important component of UBS AG's credit exposure; however,  the  positive  replacement  values  related  to  a  respective  counterparty  are  rarely  an  adequate  reflection  of UBS AG's credit exposure in its derivatives business with that counterparty. This is generally the case because, on the one hand, replacement values can increase over time (potential future exposure), while, on the other hand, exposure may be mitigated by entering into master netting agreements and bilateral collateral arrangements. Both the exposure measures used internally by UBS AG to control credit risk and the capital requirements imposed by regulators reflect these additional factors.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 21 for more information about derivative financial assets and liabilities after consideration of netting potential permitted under enforceable netting arrangements\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information about the risks arising from derivative instruments\n\n## Derivative instruments\n\n|                                                        |

Given that a significant amount of goodwill in Global Wealth Management relates to the acquisition of PaineWebber Group, Inc. in 2000, which mainly affected the Americas portion of the business, this goodwill remains separately monitored by the Americas, despite the formation of Global Wealth Management in 2018. Therefore, goodwill for Global Wealth Management  is  separately  considered  for  impairment  at  the  level  of  two  CGUs:  Americas;  and  Switzerland  and International (consisting of EMEA, Asia Pacific and Global).\n\nThe impairment test is performed for each CGU to which goodwill is allocated by comparing the recoverable amount with the carrying amount of the respective CGU. UBS AG determines the recoverable amount of the respective CGUs based on their value in use. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.",

        "page_content": "As of 31 December 2023, total goodwill recognized on the balance sheet was USD 6.0bn, of which USD 3.7bn was carried by the Global Wealth Management Americas CGU, USD 1.2bn was carried by the Global Wealth Management Switzerland and International CGU, and USD 1.1bn was carried by Asset Management. Based on the impairment testing methodology described below, UBS AG concluded that the goodwill balances as of 31 December 2023 allocated to these CGUs were not impaired. For each of the CGUs, the recoverable amount substantially exceeded the carrying value as of 31 December  2023  and  there  was  no  indication  of  a  significant  risk  of  goodwill  impairment  based  on  the  testing performed as of 31 December 2023.\n\n## Methodology for goodwill impairment testing\n\nThe recoverable amounts are determined using a discounted cash flow model, which has been adapted to use inputs that consider features of the banking business and its regulatory environment. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the sum of the discounted earnings attributable to shareholders from the first three forecast years and the terminal value, adjusted for the effect of the capital assumed to be needed over the next three years and to support growth beyond that period. The terminal value, which covers all periods beyond the third year, is calculated on the basis of the forecast of the third-year profit, the discount rate and the long-term growth rate, as well as the implied perpetual capital growth. For  the  Global  Wealth  Management Americas CGU, the methodology is consistently applied, however, the forecast period was extended from three to five years (with a terminal value thereafter) in 2023 to provide for the CGU's specific planning assumptions, namely the ongoing investments in the core banking infrastructure in the US to enhance the product capabilities and offerings in this market in the mid term. The extension of the forecast period from three to five years did not trigger, defer or avoid an impairment of goodwill as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThe  carrying  amount  for  each  CGU  is  determined  by  reference  to  UBS's  equity  attribution  framework.  Within  this framework,  UBS  attributes  equity  to  the  businesses  on  the  basis  of  their  risk-weighted  assets  and  leverage  ratio denominator (both metrics include resource allocations from Group Items to the business divisions), their goodwill and their  intangible  assets,  as  well  as  attributed  equity  related  to  certain  common  equity  tier 1  deduction  items.  The framework  is  primarily  used  for  the  purpose  of  measuring  the  performance  of  the  businesses  and  includes  certain management assumptions. Attributed equity is equal to the capital a CGU requires to conduct its business and is currently considered a reasonable approximation of the carrying amount of the CGUs. The attributed equity methodology is also applied in the business planning process, the inputs from which are used in calculating the recoverable amounts of the respective CGU.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nValuation parameters used within UBS AG's impairment test model are linked to external market information, where applicable. The model used to determine the recoverable amount is most sensitive to changes in the forecast earnings available to shareholders in years one to three, to changes in the discount rates and to changes in the long-term growth rate. The applied long-term growth rate is based on long-term economic growth rates for different regions worldwide. Earnings available to shareholders are estimated on the basis of forecast results, which are part of the business plan approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe discount rates are determined by applying a capital asset pricing model-based approach, as well as considering quantitative and qualitative inputs from both internal and external analysts and the view of management. They also take into account regional differences in risk-free rates at the level of the individual CGUs. In line with discount rates, longterm growth rates are determined at the regional level based on nominal GDP growth rate forecasts.\n\nKey  assumptions  used  to  determine  the  recoverable  amounts  of  each  CGU  are  tested  for  sensitivity  by  applying  a reasonably possible change to those assumptions. Forecast earnings available to shareholders were changed by 20%, the  discount  rates  were  changed  by  1.5 percentage  points,  and  the  long-term  growth  rates  were  changed  by 0.75 percentage  points.  Under  all  scenarios,  reasonably  possible  changes  in  key  assumptions  did  not  result  in  an impairment  of  goodwill  or  intangible  assets  reported  by  Global  Wealth  Management  Americas,  Global  Wealth Management Switzerland and International, and Asset Management.\n\nIf the estimated earnings and other assumptions in future periods deviate from the current outlook, the value of goodwill attributable to Global Wealth Management Americas, Global Wealth Management Switzerland and International, and Asset Management may become impaired in the future, giving rise to losses in the income statement. Recognition of any impairment of goodwill would reduce IFRS Accounting Standards equity and net profit. It would not affect cash flows and,  as  goodwill  is  required  to  be  deducted  from  capital  under  the  Basel III  capital  framework,  no  effect  would  be expected on UBS AG's capital ratios.\n\nDiscount and growth rates\n\n|                                                        | Discount rates   | Discount rates   | Growth rates   | Growth rates   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| In %                                                   | 31.12.23         | 31.12.22         | 31.12.23       | 31.12.22       |\n| Global Wealth Management Americas                      | 9.5              | 10.5             | 3.8            | 3.8            |\n| Global Wealth Management Switzerland and International | 9.5              | 9.4              | 3.4            | 3.6            |\n| Asset Management                                       | 9.0              | 9.5              | 3.3            | 3.4            |",

The reclassification had no effect on the income statement. The reclassified Portfolio  is  made  up  of  high-quality  liquid  assets,  primarily  US  government  treasuries  and  US  government  agency mortgage-backed securities, held and separately managed by UBS Bank USA. The accounting reclassification has arisen as a direct result of the transformation of UBS's Global Wealth Management Americas business, which has significantly impacted UBS Bank USA. This includes initiatives approved by the Group Executive Board to significantly grow and extend the business, as disclosed on 1 February 2022 during UBS's fourth quarter 2021 earnings presentation. Over the two years preceding the reclassification date, UBS Bank USA's deposit base grew by more than 100% generating substantial cash balances, with a number of new products being launched, including new deposit types that are longer in duration, additional lending and a broader range of customer segments targeted. Following the commencement of these activities and the announcement made in the first quarter of 2022, the Portfolio is no longer held in a business model to collect the contractual cash flows and sell the assets but is instead solely held to collect the contractual cash flows until the assets mature, requiring a reclassification of the Portfolio in line with IFRS 9 with effect from 1 April 2022.\n\n## b) Other non-financial assets\n\n| USD m                                                                                            | 31.12.23   | 31.12.22   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Precious metals and other physical commodities                                                   | 4,426      | 4,471      |\n| Deposits and collateral provided in connection with litigation, regulatory and similar matters 1 | 1,379      | 2,205      |\n| Prepaid expenses                                                                                 | 1,062      | 709        |\n| VAT, withholding tax and other tax receivables                                                   | 746        | 1,405      |\n| Properties and other non-current assets held for sale                                            | 105        | 279        |\n| Other                                                                                            | 660        | 583        |\n| Total other non-financial assets                                                                 | 8,377      | 9,652      |\n\n## Note 14  Customer deposits, and funding from UBS Group AG\n\n## a) Customer deposits\n\n| USD m                     | 31.12.23   | 31.12.22   |\n|---------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Demand deposits           | 146,163    | 182,307    |\n| Retail savings / deposits | 152,683    | 149,310    |\n| Sweep deposits            | 41,045     | 69,223     |\n| Time deposits 1           | 215,782    | 126,331    |\n| Total customer deposits   | 555,673    | 527,171    |\n\nCustomer deposits increased mainly due to net inflows into time deposit products, and positive foreign currency effects, partly  offset  by  continued  shifts  into  money  market  funds  and  US-government  securities.

Subordinated debt consists of unsecured debt obligations that are contractually subordinated in right of payment to all other present and future non-subordinated obligations of the respective issuing entity. All instruments contributing to TLAC are subordinated since 1.1.2020. 3 UBS AG has also recognized funding from UBS Group AG that is designated at fair value. Refer to Note 18b for more information.\n\nUBS AG uses interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to manage the risks inherent in certain debt instruments held at amortized cost. In some cases, UBS AG applies hedge accounting for interest rate risk as discussed in item 2j in Note 1a and Note 25. As a result of applying hedge accounting, the life-to-date adjustment to the carrying amount of Funding from UBS Group AG measured at amortized cost was a decrease of USD 3.2bn as of 31 December 2023 and a decrease of USD 5.1bn as of 31 December 2022, reflecting changes in fair value due to interest rate movements.\n\nOf the Total funding from UBS Group AG measured at amortized cost outstanding as of 31 December 2023, USD 65.6bn pays a fixed interest rate and USD 1.7bn pays a floating rate of interest.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 23 for maturity information",

In some cases, UBS AG applies hedge accounting for interest rate risk as discussed in item 2j in Note 1a and Note 25. As a result of applying hedge accounting, the life-to-date adjustment to the carrying amount of Debt issued measured at amortized cost was a decrease of USD 0.4bn as of 31 December 2023 and a decrease of USD 1.0bn as of 31 December 2022, reflecting changes in fair value due to interest rate movements.\n\nSubordinated debt consists of unsecured debt obligations that are contractually subordinated in right of payment to all other present and future non-subordinated obligations of the respective issuing entity.

Onerous contracts for property are recognized when UBS AG is committed to pay for non-lease components, such as utilities, service charges, taxes and maintenance,  when  a  property  is  vacated  or  not  fully  recovered  from  sub-tenants.  Personnel-related  restructuring provisions are generally used within a short period of time. The level of personnel-related provisions can change when natural staff attrition reduces the number of people affected by a restructuring event, and therefore results in lower estimated costs.\n\nInformation about provisions and contingent liabilities in respect of litigation, regulatory and similar matters, as a class, is included in Note 17b. There are no material contingent liabilities associated with the other classes of provisions.",

        "page_content": "## b) Litigation, regulatory and similar matters\n\nUBS operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to significant litigation and similar risks arising from disputes and regulatory proceedings. As a result, UBS is involved in various disputes and legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration, and regulatory and criminal investigations. 'UBS,' 'we' and 'our,' for purposes of this Note, refer to UBS AG and / or one or more of its subsidiaries, as applicable.\n\nSuch matters are subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome and the timing of resolution are often difficult to predict, particularly in the earlier stages of a case. There are also situations where UBS may enter into a settlement agreement.  This  may  occur  in  order  to  avoid  the  expense,  management  distraction  or  reputational  implications  of continuing to contest liability, even for those matters for which UBS believes it should be exonerated. The uncertainties inherent in all such matters affect the amount and timing of any potential outflows for both matters with respect to which provisions have been established and other contingent liabilities. UBS makes provisions for such matters brought against it when, in the opinion of management after seeking legal advice, it is more likely than not that UBS has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Where these factors are otherwise satisfied, a provision may be established for claims that have not yet been asserted against UBS, but are nevertheless expected to be, based on UBS's experience with similar asserted claims. If any of those conditions is not met, such matters result in contingent liabilities. If the amount of an obligation cannot be reliably estimated, a liability exists that is not recognized even if an outflow of resources is probable. Accordingly, no provision is established even if the potential outflow of resources with respect to such matters could be significant. Developments relating to a matter that occur after the relevant reporting period, but prior to the issuance of financial statements, which affect management's assessment of the provision for such matter (because, for example, the developments provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period), are adjusting events after the reporting period under IAS 10 and must be recognized in the financial statements for the reporting period.\n\nSpecific  litigation,  regulatory  and  other  matters  are  described  below,  including  all  such  matters  that  management considers to be material and others that management believes to be of significance to UBS due to potential financial, reputational and other effects. The amount of damages claimed, the size of a transaction or other information is provided where available and appropriate in order to assist users in considering the magnitude of potential exposures.\n\nIn the case of certain matters below, we state that we have established a provision, and for the other matters, we make no such statement. When we make this statement and we expect disclosure of the amount of a provision to prejudice seriously our position with other parties in the matter because it would reveal what UBS believes to be the probable and reliably estimable outflow, we do not disclose that amount. In some cases we are subject to confidentiality obligations that preclude such disclosure. With respect to the matters for which we do not state whether we have established a provision, either: (a) we have not established a provision; or (b) we have established a provision but expect disclosure of that fact to prejudice seriously our position with other parties in the matter because it would reveal the fact that UBS believes an outflow of resources to be probable and reliably estimable.\n\nWith respect to certain litigation, regulatory and similar matters for which we have established provisions, we are able to estimate the expected timing of outflows. However, the aggregate amount of the expected outflows for those matters for which we are able to estimate expected timing is immaterial relative to our current and expected levels of liquidity over the relevant time periods.\n\nThe aggregate amount provisioned for litigation, regulatory and similar matters as a class is disclosed in the 'Provisions' table in Note 17a above. It is not practicable to provide an aggregate estimate of liability for our litigation, regulatory and similar matters as a class of contingent liabilities. Doing so would require UBS to provide speculative legal assessments as to claims and proceedings that involve unique fact patterns or novel legal theories, that have not yet been initiated or are at early stages of adjudication, or as to which alleged damages have not been quantified by the claimants. Although UBS therefore cannot provide a numerical estimate of the future losses that could arise from litigation, regulatory and similar matters, UBS believes that the aggregate amount of possible future losses from this class that are more than remote substantially exceeds the level of current provisions.\n\nLitigation, regulatory and similar matters may also result in non-monetary penalties and consequences. A guilty plea to, or conviction of, a crime could have material consequences for UBS. Resolution of regulatory proceedings may require UBS to obtain waivers of regulatory disqualifications to maintain certain operations, may entitle regulatory authorities to limit,  suspend  or  terminate  licenses  and  regulatory  authorizations,  and  may  permit  financial  market  utilities  to  limit, suspend or terminate UBS's participation in such utilities. Failure to obtain such waivers, or any limitation, suspension or termination of licenses, authorizations or participations, could have material consequences for UBS.\n\nThe risk of loss associated with litigation, regulatory and similar matters is a component of operational risk for purposes of determining capital requirements. Information concerning our capital requirements and the calculation of operational risk for this purpose is included in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report.",

Inquiries regarding cross-border wealth management businesses\n\nTax and regulatory authorities in a number of countries have made inquiries, served requests for information or examined employees located in their respective jurisdictions relating to the cross-border wealth management services provided by UBS and other financial institutions.\n\nSince 2013, UBS (France) S.A., UBS AG and certain former employees have been under investigation in France in relation to UBS's cross-border business with French clients. In connection with this investigation, the investigating judges ordered UBS AG to provide bail (' caution ') of EUR 1.1bn.\n\nIn 2019, the court of first instance returned a verdict finding UBS AG guilty of unlawful solicitation of clients on French territory and aggravated laundering of the proceeds of tax fraud, and UBS (France) S.A. guilty of aiding and abetting unlawful solicitation and of laundering the proceeds of tax fraud. The court imposed fines aggregating EUR 3.7bn on UBS AG and UBS (France) S.A. and awarded EUR 800m of civil damages to the French state. A trial in the Paris Court of Appeal took place in March 2021. In December 2021, the Court of Appeal found UBS AG guilty of unlawful solicitation and aggravated laundering of the proceeds of tax fraud. The court ordered a fine of EUR 3.75m, the confiscation of EUR 1bn, and awarded civil damages to the French state of EUR 800m. UBS appealed the decision to the French Supreme Court.  The  Supreme Court rendered its judgment on 15 November 2023. It upheld the Court of Appeal's decision regarding unlawful solicitation and aggravated laundering of the proceeds of tax fraud, but overturned the confiscation of EUR 1bn, the penalty of EUR 3.75m and the EUR 800m of civil damages awarded to the French state. The case has been remanded to the Court of Appeal for a retrial regarding these overturned elements. The French state has reimbursed the EUR 800m of civil damages to UBS AG.\n\nOur balance sheet at 31 December 2023 reflected a provision in an amount that UBS believes to be appropriate under the applicable accounting standard. As in the case of other matters for which we have established provisions, the future outflow  of  resources  in  respect  of  such  matters  cannot  be  determined  with  certainty  based  on  currently  available information and accordingly may ultimately prove to be substantially greater (or may be less) than the provision that we have recognized.\n\n## 2. Madoff\n\nIn relation to the Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) investment fraud, UBS AG, UBS (Luxembourg) S.A. (now UBS Europe SE, Luxembourg branch) and certain other UBS subsidiaries have been subject to inquiries by a number of regulators, including the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier. Those inquiries concerned two third-party funds established under Luxembourg law, substantially all assets of which were with BMIS, as well as certain funds established in offshore jurisdictions with either direct or indirect exposure to BMIS. These funds faced severe losses, and the Luxembourg funds are in liquidation. The documentation  establishing  both  funds  identifies  UBS  entities  in  various  roles,  including  custodian,  administrator, manager, distributor and promoter, and indicates that UBS employees serve as board members.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, the liquidators of the two Luxembourg funds filed claims against UBS entities, non-UBS entities and certain individuals, including current and former UBS employees, seeking amounts totaling approximately EUR 2.1bn, which includes amounts that the funds may be held liable to pay the trustee for the liquidation of BMIS (BMIS Trustee).\n\nA large number of alleged beneficiaries have filed claims against UBS entities (and non-UBS entities) for purported losses relating to the Madoff fraud. The majority of these cases have been filed in Luxembourg, where decisions that the claims in eight test cases were inadmissible have been affirmed by the Luxembourg Court of Appeal, and the Luxembourg Supreme Court has dismissed a further appeal in one of the test cases.",

        "page_content": "In the US, the BMIS Trustee filed claims against UBS entities, among others, in relation to the two Luxembourg funds and one of the offshore funds. The total amount claimed against all defendants in these actions was not less than USD 2bn. In 2014, the US Supreme Court rejected the BMIS Trustee's motion for leave to appeal decisions dismissing all claims except  those  for  the  recovery  of  approximately  USD  125m  of  payments  alleged  to  be  fraudulent  conveyances  and preference payments. In 2016, the bankruptcy court dismissed these claims against the UBS entities. In 2019, the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of the BMIS Trustee's remaining claims, and the US Supreme Court subsequently denied a petition seeking review of the Court of Appeals' decision. The case has been remanded to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings.\n\n## 3. Foreign exchange, LIBOR and benchmark rates, and other trading practices\n\nForeign  exchange-related  regulatory  matters: Beginning  in  2013,  numerous  authorities  commenced  investigations concerning  possible  manipulation  of  foreign  exchange  markets  and  precious  metals  prices.  As  a  result  of  these investigations,  UBS  entered  into  resolutions  with  Swiss,  US  and  United  Kingdom  regulators  and  the  European Commission. UBS was granted conditional immunity by the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and by authorities in other jurisdictions in connection with potential competition law violations relating to foreign exchange and precious metals businesses.\n\nForeign exchange-related civil litigation: Putative class actions have been filed since 2013 in US federal courts and in other jurisdictions against UBS and other banks on behalf of putative classes of persons who engaged in foreign currency transactions with any of the defendant banks. UBS has resolved US federal court class actions relating to foreign currency transactions with the defendant banks and persons who transacted in foreign exchange futures contracts and options on such futures under a settlement agreement that provides for UBS to pay an aggregate of USD 141m and provide cooperation to the settlement classes. Certain class members have excluded themselves from that settlement and have filed individual actions in US and English courts against UBS and other banks, alleging violations of US and European competition laws and unjust enrichment. UBS and the other banks have resolved those individual matters.\n\nIn 2015, a putative class action was filed in federal court against UBS and numerous other banks on behalf of persons and businesses in the US who directly purchased foreign currency from the defendants and alleged co-conspirators for their own end use. In 2022, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for class certification. In March 2023, the court granted defendants' summary judgment motion, dismissing the case. Plaintiffs have appealed.\n\nLIBOR  and  other  benchmark-related  regulatory  matters: Numerous  government  agencies  conducted  investigations regarding potential improper attempts by UBS, among others, to manipulate LIBOR and other benchmark rates at certain times.  UBS  reached  settlements  or  otherwise  concluded  investigations  relating  to  benchmark  interest  rates  with  the investigating  authorities.  UBS  was  granted  conditional  leniency  or  conditional  immunity  from  authorities  in  certain jurisdictions, including the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and the Swiss Competition Commission (WEKO), in connection with potential antitrust or competition law violations related to certain rates. However, UBS has not reached a final settlement with WEKO, as the Secretariat of WEKO has asserted that UBS does not qualify for full immunity.\n\nLIBOR and other benchmark-related civil litigation: A number of putative class actions and other actions are pending in the federal courts in New York against UBS and numerous other banks on behalf of parties who transacted in certain interest rate benchmark-based derivatives. Also pending in the US and in other jurisdictions are a number of other actions asserting losses related to various products whose interest rates were linked to LIBOR and other benchmarks, including adjustable  rate  mortgages,  preferred  and  debt  securities,  bonds  pledged  as  collateral,  loans,  depository  accounts, investments  and  other  interest-bearing  instruments.  The  complaints  allege  manipulation,  through  various  means,  of certain benchmark interest rates, including USD LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR, Yen LIBOR, EURIBOR, CHF LIBOR, GBP LIBOR and seek unspecified compensatory and other damages under varying legal theories.\n\nUSD LIBOR class and individual actions in the US: In 2013 and 2015, the district court in the USD LIBOR actions dismissed, in whole or in part, certain plaintiffs' antitrust claims, federal racketeering claims, Commodity Exchange Act claims, and state common law claims, and again dismissed the antitrust claims in 2016 following an appeal. In 2021, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal in part and reversed in part and remanded to the district court for further proceedings. The Second Circuit, among other things, held that there was personal jurisdiction over UBS and other foreign defendants. Separately, in 2018, the Second Circuit reversed in part the district court's 2015 decision dismissing certain individual plaintiffs' claims and certain of these actions are now proceeding. In 2018, the district court denied plaintiffs' motions for class certification in the USD class actions for claims pending against UBS, and plaintiffs sought permission to appeal that ruling to the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit denied the petition to appeal. In 2020, an individual action was filed in the Northern District of California against UBS and numerous other banks alleging that the defendants conspired to fix the interest rate used as the basis for loans to consumers by jointly setting the USD LIBOR rate  and  monopolized  the  market  for  LIBOR-based  consumer  loans  and  credit  cards.  In  September  2022,  the  court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety, while allowing plaintiffs the opportunity to file an amended complaint. Plaintiffs  filed  an  amended  complaint  in  October  2022,  and  defendants  moved  to  dismiss  the amended complaint. In October 2023, the court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice. In January 2024, plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Defendants filed their response to the appeal in March 2024.",

In 2020, the appeals court reversed the dismissal and, subsequently, plaintiffs in that action filed an amended complaint focused on Yen LIBOR. In 2022, the court granted UBS's motion for reconsideration and dismissed the case against UBS. The dismissal of the case against UBS could be appealed following the disposition of the case against the remaining defendant in the district court.\n\nCHF LIBOR - In 2017, the court dismissed the CHF LIBOR action on standing grounds and failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and the court granted a renewed motion to dismiss in 2019. Plaintiffs appealed. In 2021, the Second Circuit granted the parties' joint motion to vacate the dismissal and remand the case for further proceedings. Plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint in November 2022 and defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint in January 2023.\n\nEURIBOR - In 2017, the court in the EURIBOR lawsuit dismissed the case as to UBS and certain other foreign defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs have appealed.\n\nGBP LIBOR - The court dismissed the GBP LIBOR action in 2019. Plaintiffs have appealed.\n\nGovernment bonds: Putative class actions have been filed since 2015 in US federal courts against UBS and other banks on behalf of persons who participated in markets for US Treasury securities since 2007. A consolidated complaint was filed in 2017 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the banks colluded with respect to, and manipulated prices of, US Treasury securities sold at auction and in the secondary market and asserting claims under the antitrust laws and for unjust enrichment. Defendants' motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint were granted in 2021. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which defendants moved to dismiss later in 2021. In March 2022, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss that complaint, and in February 2024, the Second Circuit affirmed the district  court's  dismissal.  Similar  class  actions  have  been  filed  concerning  European  government  bonds  and  other government bonds.\n\nIn 2021, the European Commission issued a decision finding that UBS and six other banks breached European Union antitrust rules in 2007-2011 relating to European government bonds. The European Commission fined UBS EUR 172m. UBS is appealing the amount of the fine.\n\nWith respect to additional matters and jurisdictions not encompassed by the settlements and orders referred to above, our balance sheet at 31 December 2023 reflected a provision in an amount that UBS believes to be appropriate under the applicable accounting standard. As in the case of other matters for which we have established provisions, the future outflow  of  resources  in  respect  of  such  matters  cannot  be  determined  with  certainty  based  on  currently  available information and accordingly may ultimately prove to be substantially greater (or may be less) than the provision that we have recognized.\n\n## 4. Swiss retrocessions\n\nThe Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland ruled in 2012, in a test case against UBS, that distribution fees paid to a firm for distributing third-party and intra-group investment funds and structured products must be disclosed and surrendered to clients who have entered into a discretionary mandate agreement with the firm, absent a valid waiver. FINMA issued a supervisory note to all Swiss banks in response to the Supreme Court decision. UBS has met the FINMA requirements and has notified all potentially affected clients.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision has resulted, and continues to result, in a number of client requests for UBS to disclose and potentially  surrender  retrocessions.  Client  requests  are  assessed  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Considerations  taken  into account when assessing these cases include, among other things, the existence of a discretionary mandate and whether or not the client documentation contained a valid waiver with respect to distribution fees.\n\nOur balance sheet at 31 December 2023 reflected a provision with respect to matters described in this item 4 in an amount that UBS believes to be appropriate under the applicable accounting standard. The ultimate exposure will depend on client requests and the resolution thereof, factors that are difficult to predict and assess. Hence, as in the case of other matters for which we have established provisions, the future outflow of resources in respect of such matters cannot be determined  with  certainty  based  on  currently  available  information  and  accordingly  may  ultimately  prove  to  be substantially greater (or may be less) than the provision that we have recognized.",

        "page_content": "## Scenario and key input updates\n\nDuring 2023, the scenarios and related macroeconomic factors were updated from those applied at the end of 2022 by considering the prevailing economic and political conditions and uncertainty. The review focused on events that significantly changed the economic outlook during the year: the inflation outlook and economic growth in Europe, and rising global interest rates due to central banks' adoption of more restrictive monetary policies.\n\nBaseline scenario : the projections of the baseline scenario, which are aligned to the economic and market assumptions used for UBS's business planning purposes, are broadly in line with external benchmarks, such as that from Bloomberg Consensus, Oxford Economics and the International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook. The expectation for 2024 is that global growth slows down under the weight of monetary policy tightening and continued pressure on real purchasing power due to high, though falling inflation, and fading fiscal support. Unemployment rates are forecast to increase slightly from their 2023 levels. Interest rates are expected to remain high, given the persistence of inflationary pressures, leading to a less optimistic outlook for house prices worldwide, including in Switzerland.\n\nMild debt crisis scenario : The first hypothetical downside scenario is the mild debt crisis scenario. At the beginning of the second quarter of 2023, UBS replaced the global crisis scenario applied at the end of 2022 and at the end of the first quarter of 2023 with the mild debt crisis scenario. Economic, market and political developments suggested that the scenario suite should be rebalanced by reintroducing a mild downside scenario. The mild debt crisis scenario covers similar risks, but the assumptions are milder than the global crisis scenario. Therefore, the scenario shocks are less severe. It assumes that political, solvency and liquidity concerns cause a sell-off of sovereign debt in emerging markets and the peripheral Eurozone. The global economy and financial markets are negatively affected, and central banks are assumed to ease their monetary policy.\n\nStagflationary geopolitical crisis scenario: The second downside scenario is aligned with the 2024 Group binding stress scenario and was updated in 2023 to reflect expected risks, resulting in minimal changes. Geopolitical tensions cause an escalation of security concerns and undermine globalization. The ensuing economic regionalization leads to a surge in global commodity prices and further disruptions of supply chains, and raises the specter of prolonged stagflation. Central banks are forced to further tighten monetary policy to contain inflationary pressures. The severe interest rate and house price assumptions in the scenario had a substantive impact on model-based ECL allowances for loans secured by mortgages in Switzerland and the US. These effects were partly offset by post-model adjustment releases related to loans secured by mortgages. Refer to the section below on 'Scenario weights and post-model adjustments' for more details.\n\nAsset price inflation scenario: The upside scenario is based on positive developments, such as an easing of geopolitical tensions across the globe and a rebound in Chinese economic growth. A combination of lower commodity prices, effective monetary policies and easing supply chain disruptions helps to reduce inflation. Improved consumer and business sentiment lead to a global economic rebound, enabling central banks to normalize interest rates, which causes asset prices to increase significantly.\n\nThe table below details the key assumptions for the four scenarios applied as of 31 December 2023.\n\n## Scenario weights and post-model adjustments\n\nThe scenario weights did not change during 2023, but the scenario suite was adjusted in the second quarter of 2023 to replace one of the two severe downside scenarios with a mild downside scenario. The mild debt crisis scenario, developed in early 2023, was introduced in the scenario suite with the same weight as the more severe global crisis scenario, i.e., 15%,  to  balance  a  somewhat  more  optimistic  outlook  with  milder  scenario  assumptions.  The  weights  were  kept unchanged for the stagflationary geopolitical crisis, baseline and asset price inflation scenarios, i.e., 25%, 60% and 0%, respectively. The weights are shown in the table below.",

In  the  near  term,  this uncertainty relates primarily to developments in the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts. Models, which are based on supportable statistical information from past experiences regarding interdependencies of macroeconomic factors and their implications for credit risk portfolios, cannot comprehensively reflect such extraordinary events, such as a pandemic or  a  fundamental change in the world political order. Rather than creating multiple additional scenarios to attempt gauging these risks and applying model parameters that lack supportable information and cannot be robustly validated, management continued to also apply post-model adjustments.\n\nTotal  stage 1  and  2  allowances  and  provisions  were  USD 580m  as  of  31 December  2023  and  included  post-model adjustments of USD 133m (31 December 2022: USD 131m). Overlays are to cover for uncertainty levels, including the geopolitical situation.\n\n## Economic scenarios and weights applied\n\n|                                    | Assigned weights in %   |

of factors, such as:\n\n- - the effect of selecting and updating forward-looking scenarios and the respective weights;\n- - origination of new instruments during the period;\n- - the effect of passage of time (lower residual lifetime PD and the effect of discount unwind) as the ECL on an instrument for the remaining lifetime decreases (all other factors remaining the same);\n- - derecognition of instruments in the period;\n- - change in individual asset quality of instruments;\n- - movements from a maximum 12-month ECL to the recognition of lifetime ECL (and vice versa) following transfers between stages 1 and 2;\n- - movements from stages 1 and 2 to stage 3 (credit-impaired status) when default has become certain and PD increases to 100% (or vice versa);\n- - changes in models or updates to model parameters;\n- - write-off; and\n- - foreign exchange translations for assets denominated in foreign currencies.",

instruments (including guarantees and facilities) that were newly originated, purchased or renewed and from the final derecognition of loans or facilities on their maturity date or earlier. 2 Represents the remeasurement between 12-month and lifetime ECL due to stage transfers. 3 Represents the change in allowances and provisions related  to  changes  in  model  inputs  or  assumptions,  including  changes  in  forward-looking  macroeconomic  conditions,  changes  in  the  exposure  profile,  PD  and  LGD  changes,  and  unwinding  of  the  time  value. 4 Represents the change in the allowances and provisions related to changes in models and methodologies. 5 Includes ECL movements from new and derecognized transactions, remeasurement changes, and model and methodology changes. 6 Represents the decrease in allowances and provisions resulting from write-offs of the ECL allowance against the gross carrying amount when all or part of a financial asset is deemed uncollectible or forgiven and movements in foreign exchange rates.\n- Movements with profit or loss impact: Stages 1 and 2 ECL allowances and provisions increased on a net basis by USD 23m: -Net movement from new and derecognized transactions includes USD 27m stage 1 expenses and USD 9m stage 2 releases: Stage 1 expenses are primarily driven by new loans secured by real estate and corporate lending. The residual effect is spread across other lending segments. Stage 2 releases are largely driven by redemption of real estate lending in Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management.\n- -Remeasurements with stage transfers include USD 8m releases in stage 1 and USD 7m expenses in stage 2. This mainly includes the transfer of a few large corporate and real estate financing transactions from stage 1 to 2 (i.e., releases in stage 1 and related but generally higher expenses in stage 2), driven by rating downgrades and scenario effects.\n- -Remeasurements without stage transfers include stage 1 releases of USD 7m and stage 2 releases of USD 14m. These releases of USD 21m relate to large corporate lending (USD 23m) and real estate lending (USD 14m), substantially due to scenario effects, partly offset by expenses to a single sovereign counterparty (USD 15m).\n- -Model changes : refer to Note 19b for more information.\n\nMovements without profit or loss impact : Stages 1 and 2 allowances increased by USD 31m, almost entirely driven by FX. Stage 3 allowances decreased by USD 21m, driven by FX and other movements of USD 48m, partly offset by net write-offs / recoveries of USD 69m.",

financial instruments (including guarantees and facilities) that were newly originated, purchased or renewed and from the final derecognition of loans or facilities on their maturity date or earlier. 2 Represents the remeasurement between 12-month and lifetime ECL due to stage transfers. 3 Represents the change in allowances and provisions related  to  changes  in  model  inputs  or  assumptions,  including  changes  in  forward-looking  macroeconomic  conditions,  changes  in  the  exposure  profile,  PD  and  LGD  changes,  and  unwinding  of  the  time  value. 4 Represents the change in the allowances and provisions related to changes in models and methodologies. 5 Includes ECL movements from new and derecognized transactions, remeasurement changes, and model and methodology changes. 6 Represents the decrease in allowances and provisions resulting from write-offs of the ECL allowance against the gross carrying amount when all or part of a financial asset is deemed uncollectible or forgiven and movements in foreign exchange rates.\n\nAs explained in Note 1a, the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk (an SICR) considers a number of qualitative and quantitative factors to determine whether a stage transfer between stage 1 and stage 2 is required, although the primary assessment considers changes in PD based on rating analyses and economic outlook. Additionally, UBS AG takes into consideration counterparties that have moved to a credit watch list and those with payments that are at least 30 days past due.\n\nECL stage 2 ('significant deterioration in credit risk') allowances / provisions as of 31 December 2023 - classification by trigger\n\n| USD m                                              | Stage 2   | of which:  PD layer   | of which:  watch list   | of which:  \u226530  days  past due   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| On- and off-balance sheet                          | (272)     | (197)                 | (23)                    | (53)                             |\n| of which: Private clients with mortgages           | (89)      | (69)                  | 0                       | (21)                             |\n| of which: Real estate financing                    | (26)      | (21)                  | 0                       | (5)                              |\n| of which: Large corporate clients                  | (66)      | (48)                  | (15)                    | (2)                              |\n| of which: SME clients                              | (38)      | (23)                  | (5)                     | (9)                              |\n| of which: Financial intermediaries and hedge funds | (4)       | (4)                   | 0                       | 0                                |\n| of which: Loans to financial advisors              | (1)       | 0                     | 0                       | (1)                              |\n| of which: Credit cards                             | (13)      |                       |                         | (13)                             |\n| of which: Other                                    | (33)      | (31)                  | (2)                     | (1)                              |\n\n## d) Maximum exposure to credit risk\n\nThe tables below provide UBS AG's maximum exposure to credit risk for financial instruments subject to ECL requirements and  the  respective  collateral  and  other  credit  enhancements  mitigating  credit  risk  for  these  classes  of  financial instruments.",

Where information is available, collateral is presented at fair value. For other collateral, such as real estate, a reasonable alternative value is used. Credit enhancements, such as credit derivative contracts and guarantees, are included at their notional amounts. Both are capped at the maximum exposure to credit risk for which they serve as security. The 'Risk management and control' section of this report describes management's view of credit risk and the related exposures, which can differ in certain respects from the requirements of IFRS

including cash, equity and debt instruments, real estate and other collateral. For the purpose of this disclosure, UBS AG applies a risk-based approach that generally prioritizes collateral according to its liquidity profile. In the case of loan facilities with funded and unfunded elements, the collateral is first allocated to the funded element. 3 Includes but is not limited to life insurance contracts, rights in respect of subscription or capital commitments from fund partners, inventory, mortgage loans, gold and other commodities. 4 Amounts due from banks include amounts held with third-party banks on behalf of clients. The credit risk associated with these balances may be borne by those clients. 5 Included within Cash collateral receivables on derivative instruments are margin balances due from exchanges or clearing houses. Some of these margin balances reflect amounts transferred on behalf of clients who retain the associated credit risk. 6 The amount shown in the 'Netting' column represents the netting potential not recognized on the balance sheet. Refer to Note 21 for more information. 7 Guarantees collateralized by equity and debt instruments include certain overnight repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions where UBS acts as a sponsoring member for eligible clients when clearing through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC). As part of this arrangement, UBS guarantees FICC for prompt and full payment and performance of the clients' respective obligations under the FICC rules. The Group minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the risk of loss is expected to be remote.",

        "page_content": "## f) Sensitivity information\n\nAs outlined in Note 1a, ECL estimates involve significant uncertainties at the time they are made.\n\n## ECL models\n\nThe models applied to determine point-in-time PD and LGD rely on market and statistical data, which has been found to correlate well with historically observed defaults in sufficiently homogeneous segments. The risk sensitivities for each of the ECL reporting segments to such factors are summarized in Note 9.\n\n## Sustainability and climate risk\n\nSustainability  and  climate  risk  may  negatively  affect  clients  or  portfolios  due  to  direct  or  indirect  transition  costs,  or exposure to physical risks in locations likely to be impacted by climate change. Such effects could lead to a deterioration in credit worthiness, which in turn would have an impact on ECLs. While some macroeconomic indicators used in the current PD models could be influenced by climate change, UBS currently does not use a specific sustainability and climate risk scenario in addition to the typically four general economic scenarios applied to derive the weighted-average ECL. The rationale  for  the  approach  at  this  point  in  time  is  the  significance  of  model  risks  and  challenges  in  calibration  and probability weight assessment given the paucity of data.\n\nInstead, UBS AG focuses on the process of vetting clients and business transactions and takes individual actions, where transition risk is deemed to be a significant driver of a counterparty's credit worthiness. This review process may lead to a downward revision of the counterparty's credit rating, or the adoption of risk mitigating actions, and hence affect the individual contribution to ECLs.\n\nAt the portfolio level, UBS has started to use stress loss assumptions to assess the extent to which sustainability and climate risk may affect the quality of the loans extended to small and medium-sized enterprises, large corporate clients and financial institutions. Initial tests were based on a set of assumptions presented by external parties (such as the Bank of England), and complemented by internally derived climate pathway scenarios. Such analysis undertaken during 2022, and reassessed during 2023, concluded that the counterparties are not expected to be significantly impacted by physical or transition risks, mainly as there are no material risk concentrations in high-risk sectors. The analysis of the corporate loan book has also shown that any potential significant impacts from transition costs or physical risks would materialize over  a  time  horizon  that  exceeds  in  most  cases  the  contractual  lifetime  of  the  underlying  assets.  Based  on  current information on regulatory developments, this would also apply to the portfolio of private clients' mortgages and real estate financing, given the long lead times for investments in upgrading the housing stock.\n\nAs a result of the aforementioned factors, it was assessed that the magnitude of any impact of sustainability and climate risk on the weighted-average ECL would not be material as of 31 December 2023. Therefore, no specific post-model adjustment was made in this regard.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'UBS AG consolidated supplemental disclosures required under SEC regulations' for the maturity profile of UBS AG's core loan book\n\n## Forward-looking scenarios\n\nDepending on the scenario selection and related macroeconomic assumptions for the risk factors, the components of the  relevant  weighted-average  ECL  change.  This  is  particularly  relevant  for  interest  rates,  which  can  move  in  both directions under a given growth assumption, e.g., low growth with high interest rates in a stagflation scenario, versus low growth and falling interest rates in a recession. Management generally looks for scenario narratives that reflect the key risk drivers of a given credit portfolio.\n\nAs forecasting models are complex, due to the combination of multiple factors, simple what-if analyses involving a change of individual parameters do not necessarily provide realistic information on the exposure of segments to changes in the macroeconomy. Portfolio-specific analyses based on their key risk factors would also not be meaningful, as potential compensatory effects in other segments would be ignored. The table below indicates some sensitivities to ECLs, if a key macroeconomic variable  for  the  forecasting  period  is  amended  across  all  scenarios  with  all  other  factors  remaining unchanged.",

The  table  above  outlines  favorable  and  unfavorable  effects,  based  on  reasonably  possible alternative changes to the economic conditions for stage 1 and stage 2 positions. The ECL impact is calculated for material portfolios and disclosed for each scenario.\n\nThe forecasting horizon is limited to three years, with a model-based mean reversion of PD and LGD assumed thereafter. Changes to these timelines may have an effect on ECLs: depending on the cycle, a longer or shorter forecasting horizon will lead to different annualized lifetime PD and average LGD estimations. This is currently not deemed to be material for UBS, as a large proportion of loans, including mortgages in Switzerland, have maturities that are within the forecasting horizon.\n\n## Scenario weights

                        |\n\n## Scenario weights\n\nECL is sensitive to changing scenario weights, in particular if narratives and parameters are selected that are not close to the baseline scenario, highlighting the non-linearity of credit losses.\n\nAs shown in the table above, the ECLs for stage 1 and stage 2 positions would have been USD 396m (31 December 2022: USD 329m) instead of USD 580m (31 December 2022: USD 526m) if ECLs had been determined solely on the baseline scenario . The weighted-average ECL therefore amounted to 146% (31 December 2022: 160%) of the baseline value. The effects of weighting each of the four scenarios 100% are shown in the table above.\n\n## Stage allocation and SICR\n\nThe determination of what constitutes an SICR is based on management judgment, as explained in Note 1a. Changing the SICR trigger will have a direct effect on ECLs, as more or fewer positions would be subject to lifetime ECLs under any scenario.\n\nThe relevance of the SICR trigger on overall ECL is demonstrated in the table above with the indication that the ECL allowances and provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 positions would have been USD 1,193m, if all non-impaired positions across the portfolio had been measured for lifetime ECLs irrespective of their actual SICR status. This amount compares with actual stage 1 and 2 allowances and provisions of USD 580m as of 31 December 2023.\n\n## Maturity profile\n\nThe maturity profile is an important driver in ECLs, in particular for transactions in stage 2. A transfer of a transaction into stage 2 may therefore have a significant effect on ECLs. The current maturity profile of most lending books is relatively short.\n\nLending to large corporate clients is generally between one and two years, with related loan commitments up to four years. Real estate lending is generally between two and three years in Switzerland, with long-dated maturities in the US. Lombard-lending  contracts  typically  have  average  contractual  maturities  of  12  months  or  less,  and  include  callable features.\n\nA  significant  portion  of  our  lending  to  SMEs  and  Real  estate  financings  is  documented  under  multi-purpose  credit agreements, which allow for various forms of utilization but are unconditionally cancelable by UBS at any time: (i) for drawings under such agreements with a fixed maturity, the respective term is applied for ECL calculations, or a maximum of 12 months in stage 1; (ii) for unused credit lines and all drawings that have no fixed maturity (e.g., current accounts), UBS generally applies a 12-month maturity from the reporting date, given the credit review policies, which require either continuous monitoring of key indicators and behavioral patterns for smaller positions or an annual formal review for any other limit. The ECLs for these products are sensitive to shortening or extending the maturity assumption.",

        "page_content": "## a) Valuation principles\n\nAll financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value are categorized into one of three fair  value  hierarchy  levels  in  accordance  with  IFRS  Accounting  Standards.  The  fair  value  hierarchy  is  based  on  the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. For disclosure purposes, the level in the hierarchy within which an instrument is classified in its entirety is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the position's fair value measurement:\n\n- - Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\n- - Level 2 - valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are, or are based on, observable market data; or\n- - Level 3 - valuation techniques for which significant inputs are not based on observable market data.\n\nFair values are determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, where available. Where the market for a financial instrument or non-financial asset or liability is not active, fair value is established using a valuation  technique,  including  pricing  models.  Valuation  adjustments  may  be  made  to  allow  for  additional  factors, including model, liquidity, credit and funding risks, which are not explicitly captured within the valuation technique, but which would nevertheless be considered by market participants when establishing a price. The limitations inherent in a particular valuation technique are considered in the determination of the classification of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy. Generally, the unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual instrument, and UBS AG applies valuation adjustments at an individual instrument level, consistent with that unit of account. However, if certain conditions are met, UBS AG may estimate the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and liabilities with substantially similar and offsetting risk exposures on the basis of the net open risks.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 20d for more information\n\n## b) Valuation governance\n\nUBS AG's fair value measurement and model governance framework includes numerous controls and other procedural safeguards that are intended to maximize the quality of fair value measurements reported in the financial statements. New products and valuation techniques must be reviewed and approved by key stakeholders from the risk and finance control functions. Responsibility for the ongoing measurement of financial and non-financial instruments at fair value is with the business divisions.\n\nFair  value  estimates  are  validated  by  the  risk  and  finance  control  functions,  which  are  independent  of  the  business divisions. Independent price verification is performed by Finance through benchmarking the business divisions' fair value estimates  with  observable  market  prices  and  other  independent  sources.  A  governance  framework  and  associated controls are in place in order to monitor the quality of third-party pricing sources where used. For instruments where valuation models are used to determine fair value, independent valuation and model control groups within Finance and Risk Control evaluate UBS AG's models on a regular basis, including valuation and model input parameters, as well as pricing. As a result of the valuation controls employed, valuation adjustments may be made to the business divisions' estimates of fair value to align with independent market data and the relevant accounting standard.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 20d for more information",

The narrative that follows describes valuation techniques used in measuring their fair value of different product types (including significant valuation inputs and assumptions used) and the factors considered in determining their classification within the fair value hierarchy.\n\nDuring 2023, assets and liabilities that were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1, or from Level 1 to Level 2, and were held for the entire reporting period were not material. In the fourth quarter of 2023, UBS AG has prospectively amended its approach to testing for observability as part of an accounting methodology alignment following the acquisition of Credit Suisse. This methodological change enhances UBS AG's assessment of sensitivities to unobservable valuation parameters. Application of the new methodology as of 31 December 2022 would have resulted in USD 1.3bn lower Level 3 liabilities (as of 31 December 2023 the balance of affected liabilities in Level 3 was USD 1.9bn), with an offsetting impact to Level 2 liabilities.\n\nDetermination of fair values from quoted market prices or valuation techniques 1\n\n|

of  financial  and  non-financial instruments that are not actively traded and quoted. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include discounted value of expected cash flows, relative value and option pricing methodologies.\n\nDiscounted value of expected cash flows is a valuation technique that measures fair value using estimated expected future cash flows from assets or liabilities and then discounts these cash flows using a discount rate or discount margin that reflects the credit and / or funding spreads required by the market for instruments with similar risk and liquidity profiles to produce a present value. When using such valuation techniques, expected future cash flows are estimated using an observed or implied market price for the future cash flows or by using industry-standard cash flow projection models.  The  discount  factors  within  the  calculation  are  generated  using  industry-standard  yield  curve  modeling techniques and models.\n\nRelative value models measure fair value based on the market prices of equivalent or comparable assets or liabilities, making adjustments for differences between the characteristics of the observed instrument and the instrument being valued.\n\nOption pricing models incorporate assumptions regarding the behavior of future price movements of an underlying referenced  asset  or  assets  to  generate  a  probability-weighted  future  expected  payoff  for  the  option.  The  resulting probability-weighted expected payoff is then discounted using discount factors generated from industry-standard yield curve modeling techniques and models. The option pricing model may be implemented using a closed-form analytical formula or other mathematical techniques (e.g., binomial tree or Monte Carlo simulation).\n\nWhere available, valuation techniques use market-observable assumptions and inputs. If such data is not available, inputs may be derived by reference to similar assets in active markets, from recent prices for comparable transactions or from other observable market data. In such cases, the inputs selected are based on historical experience and practice for similar or analogous instruments, derivation of input levels based on similar products with observable price levels, and knowledge of current market conditions and valuation approaches.\n\nFor  more  complex  instruments,  fair  values  may  be  estimated  using  a  combination  of  observed  transaction  prices, consensus pricing services and relevant quotes. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotes (e.g., indicative or firm) and the relationship of recently evidenced market activity to the prices provided by consensus pricing services. UBS AG also uses internally developed models, which are typically based on valuation methods and techniques recognized as standard  within  the  industry.  Assumptions  and  inputs  used  in  valuation  techniques  include  benchmark  interest  rate curves, credit and funding spreads used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, equity index prices, foreign exchange rates, levels of market volatility and correlation. Refer to Note 20e for more information. The discount curves used by UBS AG incorporate the funding and credit characteristics of the instruments to which they are applied.",

These collateral arrangements differ across  counterparties  with  respect  to  the  eligible  currency  and  interest  terms  of  the  collateral.  The  majority  of collateralized derivatives are measured using a discount curve based on funding rates derived from overnight interest in the cheapest eligible currency for the respective counterparty collateral agreement.\n\nUncollateralized and partially collateralized derivatives are discounted using the alternative reference rate (the ARR) (or equivalent) curve for the currency of the instrument. As described in Note 20d, the fair value of uncollateralized and partially collateralized derivatives is then adjusted by credit valuation adjustments (CVAs), debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) and funding valuation adjustments (FVAs), as applicable, to reflect an estimation of the effect of counterparty credit risk, UBS AG's own credit risk, and funding costs and benefits.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 10 for more information about derivative instruments\n\n| Derivative product           | Valuation and classification in the fair value hierarchy   | Valuation and classification in the fair value hierarchy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest rate  contracts     | Valuation                                                  | - Interest rate swap contracts are valued by estimating future interest cash flows and discounting those cash  flows using a rate that reflects the appropriate funding rate for the position being measured. The yield  curves used to estimate future index levels and discount rates are generated using market-standard yield  curve models using interest rates associated with current market activity. The key inputs to the models are  interest rate swap rates, forward rate agreement rates, short-term interest rate futures prices, basis swap  spreads and inflation swap rates. - Interest rate option contracts are valued using various market-standard option models, using inputs that  include interest rate yield curves, inflation curves, volatilities and correlations. - When the maturity of an interest rate swap or option contract exceeds the term for which standard market |\n|                              | Fair value  hierarchy                                      | - The majority of interest rate swaps are classified as Level 2, as the standard market contracts that form the  inputs for yield curve models are generally traded in active and observable markets. - Options are generally treated as Level 2, as the calibration process enables the model output to be validated  to active-market levels. Models calibrated in this way are then used to revalue the portfolio of both standard  options and more exotic products. - Interest rate swap or option contracts are classified as Level 3 when the terms exceed standard market- observable quotes. - Exotic options for which appropriate volatility or correlation input levels cannot be implied from observable  market data are classified as Level 3.                                                                                                                                              |\n| Credit derivative  contracts | Valuation                                                  | - Credit derivative contracts are valued using industry-standard models based primarily on market credit  spreads, upfront pricing points and implied recovery rates.

As a result, valuations are adjusted where appropriate and when such factors would be considered by market participants in estimating fair value, to reflect close-out costs, credit exposure, model-driven valuation uncertainty, funding costs and benefits, trading restrictions and other factors.\n\n## Deferred day-1 profit or loss reserves\n\nFor new transactions where the valuation technique used to measure fair value requires significant inputs that are not based on observable market data, the financial instrument is initially recognized at the transaction price. The transaction price may differ from the fair value obtained using a valuation technique, where any such difference is deferred and not initially recognized in the income statement.\n\nDeferred day-1 profit or loss is generally released into Other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss when pricing of equivalent products or the underlying parameters becomes observable or when the transaction is closed out.\n\nThe table below summarizes the changes in deferred day-1 profit or loss reserves during the respective period.",

This  presentation  neither  creates  nor  increases  an  accounting  mismatch  in  the  income statement, as UBS AG does not hedge changes in own credit.\n\nOwn credit is estimated using own credit adjustment (OCA) curves, which incorporate observable market data, including market-observed secondary prices for UBS's debt and debt curves of peers. In the table below, the change in unrealized own credit consists of changes in fair value that are attributable to the change in UBS AG's credit spreads, as well as the effect of changes in fair values attributable to factors other than credit spreads, such as redemptions, effects from time decay and changes in interest and other market rates. Realized own credit is recognized when an instrument with an associated  unrealized  OCA  is  repurchased  prior  to  the  contractual  maturity  date.  Life-to-date  amounts  reflect  the cumulative unrealized change since initial recognition.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 15 for more information about debt issued designated at fair value\n\n## Own credit adjustments on financial liabilities designated at fair value\n\n|                                                                | Included in Other comprehensive income For the year ended   | Included in Other comprehensive income For the year ended   | Included in Other comprehensive income For the year ended   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| USD m                                                          | 31.12.23                                                    | 31.12.22                                                    | 31.12.21                                                    |\n| Recognized during the period:                                  |                                                             |                                                             |                                                             |\n| Realized gain / (loss)                                         | 8                                                           | 1                                                           | (14)                                                        |\n| Unrealized gain / (loss)                                       | (869)                                                       | 866                                                         | 60                                                          |\n| Total gain / (loss), before tax                                | (861)                                                       | 867                                                         | 46                                                          |\n| USD m                                                          | 31.12.23                                                    | 31.12.22                                                    | 31.12.21                                                    |\n| Recognized on the balance sheet as of the end of the period:   |                                                             |                                                             |                                                             |\n| Unrealized life-to-date gain / (loss)                          | (312)                                                       | 556                                                         | (315)                                                       |\n| of which: debt issued designated at fair value                 | (208)                                                       | 289                                                         | (144)                                                       |\n| of which: other financial liabilities designated at fair value | (105)                                                       | 266                                                         | (172)                                                       |\n\n## Credit valuation adjustments\n\nIn  order  to  measure  the  fair  value  of  OTC  derivative  instruments,  including  funded  derivative  instruments  that  are classified as Financial assets at fair value not held for trading, CVAs are needed to reflect the credit risk of the counterparty inherent  in  these  instruments.  This  amount  represents  the  estimated  fair  value  of  protection  required  to  hedge  the counterparty credit risk of such instruments. A CVA is determined for each counterparty, considering all exposures with that counterparty, and is dependent on the expected future value of exposures, default probabilities and recovery rates, applicable collateral or netting arrangements, break clauses, funding spreads, and other contractual factors.\n\n## Funding valuation adjustments\n\nFVAs reflect  the  costs  and  benefits  of  funding  associated  with  uncollateralized  and  partially  collateralized  derivative receivables and payables and are calculated as the valuation effect from moving the discounting of the uncollateralized derivative cash flows from the ARR to OCA using the CVA framework, including the probability of counterparty default. An FVA is also applied to collateralized derivative assets in cases where the collateral cannot be sold or repledged.",

        "page_content": "## Debit valuation adjustments\n\nA DVA is estimated to incorporate own credit in the valuation of derivatives where an FVA is not already recognized. The DVA calculation is effectively consistent with the CVA framework, being determined for each counterparty, considering all exposures with that counterparty and taking into account collateral netting agreements, expected future mark-tomarket movements and UBS AG's credit default spreads.\n\n## Other valuation adjustments\n\nInstruments that are measured as part of a portfolio of combined long and short positions are valued at mid-market levels to ensure consistent valuation of the long- and short-component risks. A liquidity valuation adjustment is then made to the overall net long or short exposure to move the fair value to bid or offer as appropriate, reflecting current levels of market liquidity. The bid-offer spreads used in the calculation of this valuation adjustment are obtained from market transactions and other relevant sources and are updated periodically.\n\nUncertainties associated with the use of model-based valuations are incorporated into the measurement of fair value through the use of model reserves. These reserves reflect the amounts that UBS AG estimates should be deducted from valuations produced directly by models to incorporate uncertainties in the relevant modeling assumptions, in the model and market inputs used, or in the calibration of the model output to adjust for known model deficiencies. In arriving at these estimates, UBS AG considers a range of market practices, including how it believes market participants would assess these uncertainties. Model reserves are reassessed periodically in light of data from market transactions, consensus pricing services and other relevant sources.\n\n## Balance sheet valuation adjustments on financial instruments\n\n|                                         | As of    | As of    |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| USD m                                   | 31.12.23 | 31.12.22 |\n| Credit valuation adjustments 1          | (37)     | (33)     |\n| Funding and debit valuation adjustments | (82)     | (46)     |\n| Other valuation adjustments             | (730)    | (839)    |\n| of which: liquidity                     | (308)    | (311)    |\n| of which: model uncertainty             | (423)    | (529)    |",

Therefore, the range does not reflect the level of uncertainty regarding a particular input or an assessment of the reasonableness of UBS AG's estimates and assumptions, but rather the different underlying characteristics of the relevant assets and liabilities held by UBS AG. The ranges will therefore vary from period to period and parameter to parameter based on characteristics of the instruments held at each balance sheet date. Furthermore, the ranges of unobservable inputs may differ across other financial institutions, reflecting the diversity of the products in each firm's inventory.\n\nValuation techniques and inputs

Factors considered when selecting comparable instruments include credit quality, maturity and industry  of the issuer. Fair value may be measured either by a direct price comparison or by conversion of an instrument price into a  yield (either as an outright yield or as a spread to the relevant benchmark rate).  - For corporate and municipal bonds, the range represents the range of prices from reference issuances used in determining  fair value. Bonds priced at 0 are distressed to the point that no recovery is expected, while prices significantly in excess of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Loan price  equivalent | - Where market prices are not available for a traded loan or a loan commitment, fair value is measured by comparison with  observable pricing data for similar instruments. Factors considered when selecting comparable instruments include industry  segment,  collateral  quality,  maturity  and  issuer-specific  covenants.  Fair  value  may  be  measured  either  by  a  direct  price  comparison or by conversion of an instrument price into a yield. The range represents the range of prices derived from  reference issuances of a similar credit quality used to measure fair value for loans classified as Level 3. Loans priced at 0 are  distressed to the point that no recovery is expected, while a current price of 100 represents a loan that is expected to be                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Discount margin        | in terms of basis points. An increase / (decrease) in credit spread will increase / (decrease) the value of credit protection offered  by credit default swaps and other credit derivative products. The income statement effect from such changes depends on the  nature and direction of the positions held. Credit spreads may be negative where the asset is more creditworthy than the  benchmark against which the spread is calculated. A wider credit spread represents decreasing creditworthiness. The range  represents a diverse set of underlyings, with the lower end of the range representing credits of the highest quality and the  upper end of the range representing greater levels of credit risk. - The discount margin (DM) spread represents the discount rates applied to present value cash flows of an asset to reflect the  market return required for uncertainty in the estimated cash flows. DM spreads are a rate or rates applied on top of a floating |\n| Funding spread         | - Structured financing transactions are valued using synthetic funding curves that best represent the assets that are pledged as  collateral for the transactions. They are not representative of where UBS AG can fund itself on an unsecured basis but provide  an estimate of where UBS AG can source and deploy secured funding with counterparties for a given type of collateral. The  funding spreads are expressed in terms of basis points, and if funding spreads widen, this increases the effect of discounting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                        | - A small proportion of structured debt instruments and non-structured fixed-rate bonds within financial liabilities designated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                        | a higher number reflects a more volatile instrument, for which future price movements are more likely to occur. Volatility is  a key input into option models, where it is used to derive a probability-based distribution of future prices for the underlying  instrument.  The  effect  of  volatility  on  individual  positions  within  the  portfolio  is  driven  primarily  by  whether  the  option  contract is a long or short position. In most cases, the fair value of an option increases as a result of an increase in volatility  and is reduced by a decrease in volatility. Generally, volatility used in the measurement of fair value is derived from active- market option prices (referred to as implied volatility). A key feature of implied volatility is the volatility 'smile' or 'skew,'                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Volatility             | at fair value had an exposure to funding spreads that was longer in duration than the actively traded market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                        | - Volatility measures the variability of future prices for a particular instrument and is generally expressed as a percentage, where                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|                        | which represents the effect of pricing options of different option strikes at different implied volatility levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|                        | may have significantly different implied volatilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|                        | - Volatilities of low interest rates tend to be much higher than volatilities of high interest rates.

The table below does not represent the estimated effect of stress scenarios. Interdependencies between Level 1, 2 and 3 parameters have not been incorporated in the table. Furthermore, direct interrelationships between the Level 3 parameters discussed below are not a significant element of the valuation uncertainty.\n\nSensitivity data is estimated using a number of techniques, including the estimation of price dispersion among different market participants, variation in modeling approaches and reasonably possible changes to assumptions used within the fair value measurement process. The sensitivity ranges are not always symmetrical around the fair values, as the inputs used in valuations are not always precisely in the middle of the favorable and unfavorable range.\n\nSensitivity data is determined at a product or parameter level and then aggregated assuming no diversification benefit. Diversification would incorporate estimated correlations across different sensitivity results and, as such, would result in an overall sensitivity that would be less than the sum of the individual component sensitivities. However, UBS AG believes that the diversification benefit is not significant to this analysis.\n\n## Sensitivity of fair value measurements to changes in unobservable input assumptions 1\n\n|                                                                             | 31.12.23           | 31.12.23             | 31.12.22           | 31.12.22             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| USD m                                                                       | Favorable  changes | Unfavorable  changes | Favorable  changes | Unfavorable  changes |\n| Traded loans, loans measured at fair value, loan commitments and guarantees | 22 2               | (29) 2               | 19                 | (12)                 |\n| Securities financing transactions                                           | 24                 | (24)                 | 33                 | (37)                 |\n| Auction rate securities                                                     | 67                 | (21)                 | 46                 | (46)                 |\n| Asset-backed securities                                                     | 25                 | (22)                 | 27                 | (27)                 |\n| Equity instruments                                                          | 189                | (178)                | 183                | (161)                |\n| Interest rate derivatives, net                                              | 27                 | (18)                 | 18                 | (12)                 |\n| Credit derivatives, net                                                     | 2                  | (5)                  | 3                  | (4)                  |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives, net                                           | 5                  | (4)                  | 10                 | (5)                  |\n| Equity / index derivatives, net                                             | 358                | (285)                | 361                | (330)                |\n| Other                                                                       | 62                 | (62)                 | 39                 | (62)                 |\n| Total                                                                       | 781                | (648)                | 738                | (696)                |\n\n- 1 Sensitivity of issued and over-the-counter debt instruments is reported with the equivalent derivative or Other. 2 Includes refinements applied in estimating valuation uncertainty across various parameters.",

Level 3 assets and liabilities may be hedged with instruments classified as Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, and, as a result, realized and unrealized gains and losses included in the table may not include the effect of related hedging activity. Furthermore, the realized and unrealized gains and losses presented in the table are not limited  solely  to  those  arising  from  Level  3 inputs,  as  valuations  are  generally  derived  from  both  observable  and unobservable parameters. Assets and liabilities  transferred  into  or  out  of  Level 3  are  presented  as  if  those  assets  or liabilities had been transferred at the beginning of the year.\n\n| USD bn

Where information is available, collateral is presented at fair value. For other collateral, such as real estate, a reasonable alternative value is used. Credit enhancements, such as credit derivative contracts and guarantees, are included at their notional amounts. Both are capped at the maximum exposure to credit risk for which they serve as security. The 'Risk management and control' section of this report describes management's view of credit risk and the related exposures, which can differ in certain respects from the requirements of IFRS Accounting Standards.\n\n## Maximum exposure to credit risk\n\n|                                                                 | 31.12.23                        | 31.12.23                 | 31.12.23                                         | 31.12.23               | 31.12.23          | 31.12.23            | 31.12.23                    | 31.12.23                            | 31.12.23                                                             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                 |                                 | Collateral               | Collateral                                       | Collateral             | Collateral        | Credit enhancements | Credit enhancements         | Credit enhancements                 | Credit enhancements                                                  |\n| USD bn                                                          | Maximum exposure to credit risk | Cash collateral received | Collateralized  by equity and  debt  instruments | Secured by real estate | Other  collateral | Netting             | Credit derivative contracts | Guarantees  and sub- participations | Exposure to  credit risk  after collateral  and credit  enhancements |\n| Financial assets measured at  fair value on the balance sheet 1 |                                 |                          |                                                  |                        |                   |                     |                             |                                     |                                                                      |\n| Financial assets at fair value                                  |                                 |                          |                                                  |                        |                   |                     |                             |                                     |                                                                      |\n| held for trading -

The valuation techniques and assumptions described below relate only to the fair value of UBS AG's financial instruments not measured at fair value. Other institutions may use different methods and assumptions for their fair value estimations, and therefore such fair value disclosures cannot necessarily be compared from one financial institution to another. The following principles were applied when determining fair value estimates for financial instruments not measured at fair value.\n\n- - For financial instruments with remaining maturities greater than three months, the fair value was determined from quoted market prices, if available.\n- - Where quoted market prices were not available, the fair values were estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using current market interest rates or appropriate yield curves for instruments with similar credit risk and maturity. These estimates generally include adjustments for counterparty credit risk or UBS AG's own credit.\n- - For short-term financial instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less, the carrying amount, which is net of credit loss allowances, is generally considered a reasonable estimate of fair value.",

These netting agreements and similar arrangements generally enable the counterparties to set  off  liabilities  against  available  assets  received  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  and  /  or  in  the  event  that  the counterparties to the transaction are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations.\n\nThe tables below provide a summary of financial assets and financial liabilities subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting  arrangements  and  similar  agreements,  as  well  as  financial  collateral  received  or  pledged  to  mitigate  credit exposures for these financial instruments.\n\nUBS AG  engages  in  a  variety  of  counterparty  credit  risk  mitigation  strategies  in  addition  to  netting  and  collateral arrangements. Therefore, the net amounts presented in the tables below do not purport to represent their actual credit risk exposure.\n\nFinancial assets subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting

in substance under IAS 32 principles and exchange-traded derivatives that are economically settled on a daily basis. 2 The logic of the table results in amounts presented in the 'Netting with gross liabilities' column corresponding directly to the amounts presented in the 'Netting with gross assets' column in the liabilities table presented below. Netting in this column for reverse repurchase agreements presented within the lines 'Receivables from securities financing transactions measured at amortized cost' and 'Financial assets at fair value not held for trading' taken together corresponds to the amounts presented for repurchase agreements in the 'Payables from securities financing transactions measured at amortized cost' and 'Other financial liabilities designated at fair value' lines in the liabilities table presented below. 3 For the purpose of this disclosure, the amounts of financial instruments and cash collateral presented have been capped so as not to exceed the net amount of financial assets presented on the balance sheet; i.e., over-collateralization, where it exists, is not reflected in the table. 4 Includes assets not subject to enforceable netting arrangements and other out-of-scope items.",

Netting in this column for repurchase agreements presented within the lines 'Payables from securities financing transactions measured at amortized cost' and 'Other financial liabilities designated at fair value' taken together corresponds to the amounts presented for reverse repurchase agreements in the 'Receivables from securities financing transactions measured at amortized cost' and 'Financial assets at fair value not held for trading' lines in the assets table presented above. 3 For the purpose of this disclosure, the amounts of financial instruments and cash collateral presented have been capped so as not to exceed the net amount of financial liabilities presented on the balance sheet; i.e., over-collateralization, where it exists, is not reflected in the table. 4 Includes liabilities not subject to enforceable netting arrangements and other out-of-scope items.",

Of these pledged mortgage loans, approximately USD 2.0bn as of 31 December 2023 could be withdrawn or used for future liabilities or covered bond issuances without breaching existing collateral requirements (31 December 2022: approximately USD 3.1bn). Existing liabilities against Swiss central mortgage institutions and US Federal Home Loan Banks and for existing covered bond issuances were USD 15.4bn as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: USD 9.0bn).\n\nRepurchase and securities  lending  arrangements  are  generally  entered  into  under  standard  market  agreements.  For securities  lending,  the  cash  received  as  collateral  may  be  more  or  less  than  the  fair  value  of  the  securities  loaned, depending on the nature of the transaction. For repurchase agreements, the fair value of the collateral sold under an agreement to repurchase is generally in excess of the cash borrowed.\n\nOther restricted financial assets include assets protected under client asset segregation rules, assets held under unit-linked investment contracts to back related liabilities to the policy holders and assets held in certain jurisdictions to comply with explicit minimum local asset maintenance requirements. The carrying amount of the liabilities associated with these other restricted financial assets is generally equal to the carrying amount of the assets, with the exception of assets held to comply with local asset maintenance requirements, for which the associated liabilities are greater.\n\n## Restricted financial assets\n\n| USD m

Supervisory authorities also may require entities to measure capital and leverage ratios on a stressed basis, such as the Federal Reserve Board's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, which may limit the relevant subsidiaries' ability to make distributions of capital based on the results of those tests.\n\nSupervisory authorities generally have discretion to impose higher requirements or to otherwise limit the activities of subsidiaries.\n\nNon-regulated subsidiaries are generally not subject to such requirements and transfer restrictions.

Repurchase and securities lending arrangements are, for the most part, conducted under standard market agreements and are undertaken with counterparties subject to UBS AG's normal credit risk control processes.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 1a item 2e for more information about repurchase and securities lending agreements\n\nFinancial assets at fair value held for trading that may be sold or repledged by counterparties include securities lending and repurchase agreements in exchange for cash received, securities  lending  agreements  in  exchange  for  securities received and other financial asset transfers.\n\nFor  securities  lending  and  repurchase  agreements,  a  haircut  of  between  0%  and  15%  is  generally  applied  to  the transferred assets, which results in associated liabilities having a carrying amount below the carrying amount of the transferred assets. The counterparties to the associated liabilities included in the table above have full recourse to UBS AG.\n\nIn securities lending arrangements entered into in exchange for the receipt of other securities as collateral, neither the securities received nor the obligation to return them are recognized on UBS AG's balance sheet, as the risks and rewards of  ownership are not transferred to UBS AG. In cases where such financial assets received are subsequently sold or repledged in another transaction, this is not considered to be a transfer of financial assets.\n\nOther financial asset transfers primarily include securities transferred to collateralize derivative transactions, for which the carrying amount of associated liabilities is not included in the table above, because those replacement values are managed on a portfolio basis across counterparties and product types, and therefore there is no direct relationship between the specific collateral pledged and the associated liability.\n\nTransferred financial assets that are not subject to derecognition in full but remain on the balance sheet to the extent of UBS AG's continuing involvement were not material as of 31 December 2023 and as of 31 December 2022.",

The residual contractual maturity of liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures is based on the earliest date on which a third party could require UBS AG to pay.\n\nDerivative financial instruments and financial assets and liabilities at fair value held for trading are presented in the Due within 1 month column; however, the respective contractual maturities may extend over significantly longer periods.\n\nAssets held to hedge unit-linked investment contracts (presented within Financial assets at fair value not held for trading ) are presented in the Due within 1 month column, consistent with the maturity assigned to the related amounts due under unit-linked investment contracts (presented within Other financial liabilities designated at fair value ).\n\nOther financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity, such as equity securities, are presented in the Perpetual / Not applicable column. Undated or perpetual instruments are classified based on the contractual notice period that the counterparty of the instrument is entitled to give. Where there is no contractual notice period, undated or perpetual contracts are presented in the Perpetual / Not applicable column.\n\nNon-financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity are generally included in the Perpetual / Not applicable column.",

        "page_content": "## Note 24  Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nDuring 2023, UBS AG largely completed the transition of the USD London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) contracts. The transition of the largest remaining non-derivative exposure, the US mortgage portfolio of approximately USD 9bn as of 31 December  2022,  was  substantially  completed,  with  these  contracts  automatically  converting  to  term  Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) from their next interest rate reset date following the cessation of the respective USD LIBOR rates, i.e., 30 June 2023. Corporate loans in the Investment Bank have now also been transitioned to alternative rates.\n\nIn August 2022, to facilitate the transition of derivatives linked to the USD LIBOR Swap Rate, UBS AG adhered to the June 2022 Benchmark Module of the ISDA 2021 Fallbacks Protocol on the USD LIBOR Swap Rate. As of 31 December 2023, the transition of these USD LIBOR-linked derivatives had been materially accomplished.\n\nThe  table  below  sets  out  the  contracts  that  remained  as  of  31  December  2022.  No  contracts  are  included  as  of 31 December 2023 given transition has largely completed as noted above.\n\n|                                                        | Measure     | 31.12.22 1 USD LIBOR  benchmark rates   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Carrying value of non-derivative financial instruments |             |                                         |\n| Total non-derivative financial assets                  | USD m       | 14,269 2                                |\n| Total non-derivative financial liabilities             | USD m       | 1,138 3                                 |\n| Trade count of derivative financial instruments        |             |                                         |\n| Total derivative financial instruments                 | Trade count | 32,006 4                                |\n| Off-balance sheet exposures                            |             |                                         |\n| Total irrevocable loan commitments                     | USD m       | 4,606 5                                 |\n\nIn addition, as of 31 December 2023 UBS AG had approximately USD 2bn equivalent of yen- and US dollar-denominated funding from UBS Group AG that, per current contractual terms, if not called on their respective call dates, would reset based directly  on  JPY  LIBOR  and  USD  LIBOR.  Furthermore,  several  contracts  providing  funding  from  UBS  Group AG reference rates indirectly derived from IBORs, if they are not called on their respective call dates. These contracts have robust IBOR fallback language, and the confirmation of interest rate calculation mechanics will be communicated in advance of any rate resets.\n\n## Note 25  Hedge accounting\n\n## Derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships\n\nUBS AG applies hedge accounting to interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, including structural foreign exchange risk related to net investments in foreign operations.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Market risk' in the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information about how risks arise and how they are managed by UBS AG\n\n## Hedging instruments and hedged risk\n\nInterest rate swaps are designated in fair value hedges or cash flow hedges of interest rate risk arising solely from changes in benchmark interest rates. Fair value changes arising from such risk are usually the largest component of the overall change in the fair value of the hedged position in transaction currency.\n\nCross-currency swaps are designated as fair value hedges of foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange swaps are mainly designated as hedges of structural foreign exchange risk related to net investments in foreign operations. In both cases the hedged risk arises solely from changes in the spot foreign exchange rate.\n\nThe notional of the designated hedging instruments matches the notional of the hedged items, except when the interest rate  swaps  are  designated  in  cash  flow  hedges  after  the  trade  date,  in  which  case  the  hedge  ratio  designated  is determined based on the swap sensitivity.",

        "page_content": "## Hedged items and hedge designation\n\n## Fair value hedges of interest rate risk related to debt instruments and loan assets\n\nFair value hedges of interest rate risk related to debt instruments and loan assets involve swapping fixed cash flows associated with the loans to customers (including long-term fixed-rate mortgage loans in Swiss francs), debt securities held, customer deposits, funding from UBS Group AG, debt issued to floating cash flows by entering into interest rate swaps that either pay fixed and receive floating cash flows or that receive fixed and pay floating cash flows. The floating future cash flows are based on the following benchmark rates: Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR), Swiss Average Rate Overnight (SARON), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Euro Short-Term Rate (ESTR), Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA), AUD London Interbank Offered Rate (AUD LIBOR), Tokyo Overnight Average Rate (TONA) and Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA).\n\n## Cash flow hedges of forecast transactions\n\nUBS AG hedges forecast cash flows on non-trading financial assets and liabilities that bear interest at variable rates or are expected to be refinanced or reinvested in the future, due to movements in future market rates. The amounts and timing of future cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected on the basis of contractual terms and  other  relevant  factors,  including  estimates  of  prepayments  and  defaults.  The  aggregate  principal  balances  and interest  cash  flows  across  all  portfolios  over  time  form  the  basis  for  identifying  the  non-trading  interest  rate  risk  of UBS AG, which is hedged with interest rate swaps, the maximum maturity of which is 15 years. Cash flow forecasts and risk exposures are monitored and adjusted on an ongoing basis, and consequently additional hedging instruments are traded and designated, or are terminated resulting in a hedge discontinuance.\n\n## Fair value hedges of foreign exchange risk related to issued debt instruments\n\nDebt instruments denominated in currencies other than the US dollar are designated in fair value hedges of spot foreign exchange  risk,  in  addition  to  and  separate  from  the  fair  value  hedges  of  interest  rate  risk.  Cross-currency  swaps economically convert debt instruments denominated in currencies other than the US dollar to US dollars. The hedge designations also involve intragroup debt instruments which are eliminated upon consolidation but FX gains and losses impact consolidated profit or loss.\n\n## Hedges of net investments in foreign operations\n\nUBS AG applies hedge accounting for certain net investments in foreign operations, which include subsidiaries, branches and associates. Upon maturity of hedging instruments, typically one to three months, the hedge relationship is terminated and new designations are made to reflect any changes in the net investments in foreign operations.\n\n## Economic relationship between hedged item and hedging instrument\n\nThe economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is determined based on a qualitative analysis  of  their  critical  terms.  In  cases  where  hedge  designation  takes  place  after  the  trade  date  of  the  hedging instrument, a quantitative analysis of the possible behavior of the hedging derivative and the hedged item during their respective terms is also performed.\n\n## Sources of hedge ineffectiveness\n\nIn hedges of interest rate risk, hedge ineffectiveness can arise from mismatches of critical terms and / or the use of different curves to discount the hedged item and instrument, or from entering into a hedge relationship after the trade date of the hedging derivative.\n\nIn hedges of foreign exchange risk related to debt issued, hedge ineffectiveness can arise due to the discounting of the hedging instruments and undesignated risk components and lack of such discounting and risk components in the hedged items.\n\nIn hedges of net investments in foreign operations, ineffectiveness is unlikely unless the hedged net assets fall below the designated hedged amount. The exceptions are hedges where the hedging currency is not the same as the currency of the foreign operation, where the currency basis may cause ineffectiveness.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss is recognized in Other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships\n\nNon-hedge-accounted derivatives are mandatorily held for trading with all fair value movements taken to Other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss , even when held as an economic hedge or to facilitate client clearing. The one exception relates to forward points on certain short- and long-duration foreign exchange contracts acting as economic hedges, which are reported in Net interest income.",

rate (ARR) designations in May 2023 and June 2023, respectively. The transition of fair value hedges took place following the IBOR transition for swaps with LCH (formerly the London Clearing House), with hedge relationships continuing in accordance with Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16) . Cash flow hedge relationships were discontinued and replaced with new ARR designations in May 2023.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, there were no hedge relationships where the designated risk is LIBOR and maturing after the cessation date of the applicable interest rate benchmarks.

        "page_content": "## a) Defined benefit plans\n\nUBS AG has established defined benefit plans for its employees in various jurisdictions in accordance with local regulations and practices. The major plans are located in Switzerland, the UK, the US and Germany. The level of benefits depends on the specific plan rules. UBS AG has not been involved in the major Credit Suisse defined benefit plans.\n\n## Swiss pension plan\n\nIn 2017, a significant number of employees were transferred from UBS AG to UBS Business Solutions AG, which is a directly held subsidiary of UBS Group AG. There continues to be one pooled UBS Swiss pension plan in Switzerland covering the employees of UBS AG and those transferred to UBS Business Solutions AG. UBS AG and UBS Business Solutions AG both are legal sponsors of the UBS Swiss pension plan. Since the date of the employee transfer, UBS AG and UBS Business Solutions AG apply proportionate defined benefit accounting, i.e., the net pension cost and the net pension asset / liability of the UBS Swiss pension plan are allocated proportionally between UBS AG and UBS Business Solutions AG based on the aggregated net pension cost and defined benefit obligations related to their employees. The UBS Swiss pension plan offers retirement, disability and survivor benefits and is governed by a Pension Foundation Board. The responsibilities of this board are defined by Swiss pension law and the plan rules. The UBS Swiss pension plan exceeds the minimum benefit requirements under Swiss pension law.\n\nSavings contributions to the UBS Swiss pension plan are paid by both the employer and the employee. Depending on the age of the employee, UBS AG pays a savings contribution that ranges between 6.5% and 27.5% of the contributory base salary and between 2.8% and 9% of the contributory variable compensation. Employees can choose the level of savings contributions paid by them, which vary between 2.5% and 13.5% of the contributory base salary and between 0% and 9% of the contributory variable compensation, depending on age and choice of savings contribution category. UBS AG also pays risk contributions that are used to fund disability and survivor benefits.\n\nThe plan offers to members at the normal retirement age of 65 a choice between a lifetime pension and a partial or full lump sum payment. Participants can choose to draw early retirement benefits starting from the age of 58, but they can also continue employment and remain active members of the plan until the age of 70. Employees can make additional purchases of benefits to fund early retirement benefits.\n\nThe pension amount payable to a participant is calculated by applying a conversion rate to the accumulated balance of the participant's retirement savings account at the retirement date. The balance is based on credited vested benefits transferred  from  previous  employers,  purchases  of  benefits,  employee  and  employer  contributions  made  to  the participant's  retirement  savings  account,  and  interest  accrued.  The  annual  interest  rate  credited  to  participants  is determined by the Pension Foundation Board at the end of each year.\n\nAlthough the UBS Swiss pension plan is based on a defined contribution promise under Swiss pension law, it is accounted for as a defined benefit plan under IFRS Accounting Standards, primarily because of the obligation to accrue interest on the participants' retirement savings accounts and the payment of lifetime pension benefits.\n\nAn actuarial valuation in accordance with Swiss pension law is performed regularly. Should an underfunded situation on this basis occur, the Pension Foundation Board is required to take the necessary measures to ensure that full funding can be  expected  to  be  restored  within  a  maximum  period  of  10  years.  If  a  Swiss  plan  were  to  become  significantly underfunded on a Swiss pension law basis, additional employer and employee contributions could be required. In this situation, the risk is shared between employer and employees, and the employer is not legally obliged to cover more than 50% of the additional contributions required. As of 31 December 2023, the UBS Swiss pension plan had a technical funding ratio in accordance with Swiss pension law of 119.2% (31 December 2022: 119.0%).\n\nThe  investment  strategy  of  the  UBS  Swiss  pension  plan  complies  with  Swiss  pension  law,  including  the  rules  and regulations relating to diversification of plan assets, and is derived from the risk budget defined by the Pension Foundation Board based on regularly performed asset and liability management analyses. The Pension Foundation Board strives for a medium- and long-term balance between assets and liabilities.\n\nAs  of  31 December  2023,  the  UBS  Swiss  pension  plan  was  in  a  surplus  situation  on  an  IFRS  Accounting  Standards measurement basis, as the fair value of the plan's assets exceeded the defined benefit obligation (DBO) by USD 3,585m (31 December 2022: USD 4,418m). However, a surplus is only recognized on the balance sheet to the extent that it does not  exceed  the  estimated  future  economic  benefit,  which  equals  the  difference  between  the  present  value  of  the estimated future net service cost and the present value of the estimated future employer contributions. As of both 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the estimated future economic benefit was zero and hence no net defined benefit asset was recognized on the balance sheet.\n\nThe regular employer contributions to the UBS Swiss pension plan in 2024 are estimated at USD 315m.",

        "page_content": "## UK pension plan\n\nThe UBS UK pension plan is a career-average revalued earnings scheme, and benefits increase automatically based on UK price inflation, subject to defined caps. The normal retirement age for most participants is 60 or 65. The plan provides guaranteed lifetime pension benefits to participants upon retirement. The UK plan has been closed to new entrants for more than 20 years and participants are no longer accruing benefits for current or future service. Instead, employees participate in the UBS UK defined contribution plan.\n\nThe governance responsibility for the UBS UK plan lies jointly with the UBS UK Pension Trustee Board and UBS AG. The plan assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of financial assets, which include longevity swaps to hedge the risk between expected and actual longevity.\n\nIn  2019,  UBS AG  and  the  UBS  UK  Pension  Trustee  Board  entered  an  arrangement  whereby  a  collateral  pool  was established to provide security for the UBS UK pension fund. The value of the collateral pool as of 31 December 2023 was USD 260m (31 December 2022: USD 292m) and includes corporate bonds, government-related debt instruments and other financial assets. The arrangement provides the Pension Trustee Board dedicated access to a pool of assets in the event of UBS AG's insolvency or not paying a required funding contribution.\n\nIn 2023, UBS AG made funding contributions of USD 19m to the UBS UK pension plan (2022: USD 5m). The employer contributions to the UBS UK pension plan in 2024 are estimated at USD 19m, subject to regular funding reviews during the year.\n\n## US defined benefit plans\n\nThere are two main UBS US pension plans, with a normal retirement age of 65. Both plans were closed to new entrants more than 20 years ago. Since they closed, new employees have participated in a UBS defined contribution plan.\n\nOne of the UBS defined benefit plans is a contribution-based plan in which each participant accrues a percentage of salary in a retirement savings account. The retirement savings account is credited annually with interest based on a rate that is linked to the average yield on one-year US government bonds. For the other UBS defined benefit plan, retirement benefits accrue based on the career-average earnings of each individual plan participant. Former employees with vested benefits can take a lump sum payment or a lifetime annuity.\n\nAs required under applicable pension laws, both plans have fiduciaries who, together with UBS AG, are responsible for the governance of the plans.\n\nEach plan's fiduciaries are responsible for the investment decisions with respect to the plan assets. The plan assets of both plans are invested in diversified portfolios of financial assets.\n\nThe employer contributions to the UBS US defined benefit plans in 2024 are estimated at USD 12m.\n\n## German pension plans\n\nThere are two major unfunded UBS defined benefit plans in Germany. The normal retirement age is 65 and benefits are paid directly by UBS AG. In the larger of the two plans each participant accrues a percentage of salary in a retirement savings account. The accumulated account balance of the participant is credited on an annual basis with guaranteed interest at a rate of 5%. The plan has been closed to new entrants, and all participants younger than the age of 55 as of June 2021 no longer accrue benefits. In the other plan, amounts are accrued annually based on employee elections related to variable compensation. For this plan, the accumulated account balance is credited on an annual basis with a guaranteed interest rate of 6% for amounts accrued before 2010, of 4% for amounts accrued from 2010 to 2017 and of 0.9% for amounts accrued after 2017. Both plans are subject to German pension law, whereby the responsibility to pay pension benefits when they are due resides entirely with UBS AG. A portion of the pension payments is directly increased in line with price inflation.",

The plan was implemented retrospectively for new hires since June 2018 and for all eligible active participants younger than 55 from July 2021. Each participant accrues a percentage of salary in a retirement savings account.\n\nThe employer contributions to the UBS German defined benefit plans in 2024 are estimated at USD 14m.\n\n## Financial

Changes in the defined benefit obligation are most sensitive to changes in the discount rate. The discount rate is based on the yield of high-quality corporate bonds quoted in an active market in the currency  of  the  respective  plan.  A  decrease  in  the  discount  curve  increases  the  DBO.  UBS AG  regularly  reviews  the actuarial assumptions used in calculating the DBO to determine their continuing relevance.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 1a item 5 for a description of the accounting policy for defined benefit plans\n\nThe tables below show the significant actuarial assumptions used in calculating the DBO at the end of the year.\n\n## Significant actuarial assumptions of defined benefit plans\n\n|                                               | Swiss plan   | Swiss plan   | UK plan   | UK plan   | US plans   | US plans   | German plans   | German plans   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|----------------|----------------|\n| In %                                          | 31.12.23     | 31.12.22     | 31.12.23  | 31.12.22  | 31.12.23   | 31.12.22   | 31.12.23       | 31.12.22       |\n| Discount rate                                 | 1.48         | 2.34         | 4.79      | 5.02      | 4.72 1     | 4.92 1     | 3.28           | 3.81           |\n| Rate of pension increase                      | 0.00         | 0.00         | 3.00      | 3.08      | 0.00       | 0.00       | 2.10           | 2.20           |\n| Rate of interest credit on retirement savings | 2.48         | 3.39         | 0.00      | 0.00      | 6.28 2     | 5.73 2     | 0.00           | 0.00           |\n\n## Mortality tables and life expectancies for major plans\n\n|             |                                        | Life expectancy at age 65 for a male member currently   | Life expectancy at age 65 for a male member currently   | Life expectancy at age 65 for a male member currently   | Life expectancy at age 65 for a male member currently   |\n|-------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|             |                                        | aged 65                                                 | aged 65                                                 | aged 45                                                 | aged 45                                                 |\n| Country     | Mortality table                        | 31.12.23                                                | 31.12.22                                                | 31.12.23                                                | 31.12.22                                                |\n| Switzerland | BVG 2020 G with CMI 2022 projections 1 | 21.8                                                    | 21.7                                                    | 23.5                                                    | 23.4                                                    |\n| UK          | S3PA with CMI 2022 projections 2       | 22.2                                                    | 23.5                                                    | 23.4                                                    | 24.6                                                    |\n| USA         | Pri-2012 with MP-2021 projection scale | 22.0                                                    | 22.0                                                    | 23.4                                                    | 23.3                                                    |\n| Germany     | Dr. K.

Unforeseen circumstances may arise, which could result in variations that are outside the range of alternatives deemed  reasonably  possible.  Caution  should  be  used  in  extrapolating  the  sensitivities  below  on  the  DBO,  as  the sensitivities may not be linear.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of significant actuarial assumptions 1\n\n| Increase / (decrease) in defined benefit obligation   | Swiss plan   | Swiss plan   | UK plan   | UK plan   | US and German plans   | US and German plans   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| USD m                                                 | 31.12.23     | 31.12.22     | 31.12.23  | 31.12.22  | 31.12.23              | 31.12.22              |\n| Discount rate                                         |              |              |           |           |                       |                       |\n| Increase by 50 basis points                           | (857)        | (641)        | (164)     | (141)     | (50)                  | (51)                  |\n| Decrease by 50 basis points                           | 973          | 723          | 183       | 157       | 54                    | 55                    |\n| Rate of pension increase                              |              |              |           |           |                       |                       |\n| Increase by 50 basis points                           | 639          | 487          | 137       | 127       | 4                     | 4                     |\n| Decrease by 50 basis points                           | - 2          | - 2          | (129)     | (118)     | (4)                   | (3)                   |\n| Rate of interest credit on retirement savings         |              |              |           |           |                       |                       |\n| Increase by 50 basis points                           | 144          | 106          | - 3       | - 3       | 9                     | 9                     |\n| Decrease by 50 basis points                           | (144)        | (106)        | - 3       | - 3       | (8)                   | (8)                   |\n| Life expectancy                                       |              |              |           |           |                       |                       |\n| Increase in longevity by one additional year          | 416          | 304          | 78        | 65        | 39                    | 39                    |",

UBS AG's obligation is limited to its contributions made in accordance with each plan, which may include direct contributions and matching contributions. Employer contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense and were USD 320m in 2023 and USD 299m in 2022.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 6 for more information\n\n## c) Related-party disclosure\n\nUBS AG is the principal provider of banking services for the pension fund of UBS AG in Switzerland. In this capacity, UBS AG is engaged to execute most of the pension fund's banking activities. These activities can include, but are not limited to, trading, securities lending and borrowing and derivative transactions. The non-Swiss UBS AG pension funds do not have a similar banking relationship with UBS AG. During 2023, UBS AG received USD 20m in fees for banking services from the major post-employment benefit plans (2022: USD 20m). As of 31 December 2023, the major postemployment benefit plans held USD 396m in UBS Group AG shares (31 December 2022: USD 253m).\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Composition and fair value of plan assets' table in Note 26a for more information about fair value of investments in UBS AG and UBS Group AG instruments held by the Swiss pension fund\n\n## Note 27  Employee benefits: variable compensation\n\n## a) Plans offered\n\nUBS has several share-based and other deferred compensation plans that align the interests of Group Executive Board (GEB) members and other employees with the interests of investors.\n\nShare-based awards are granted in the form of notional shares and, where permitted, carry a dividend equivalent that may be paid in notional shares or cash. Awards are settled by delivering UBS shares at vesting, except in jurisdictions where this is not permitted for legal or tax reasons.\n\nDeferred compensation awards are generally forfeitable upon, among other circumstances, voluntary termination of employment with UBS. These compensation plans are also designed to meet regulatory requirements and include special provisions  for  regulated  employees.  For  the  majority  of  variable  compensation  awards  granted  under  such  plans  to employees of UBS AG, the grantor entity is UBS Group AG. Expenses associated with these awards are charged by UBS Group AG to UBS AG. For the purpose of this Note, references to shares refer to UBS Group AG shares.\n\nThe most significant deferred compensation plans are described below.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 1a item 4 for a description of the accounting policy related to share-based and other deferred compensation plans\n\n## Mandatory deferred compensation plans\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nThe Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is a mandatory deferred share-based compensation plan for senior leaders of the Group (i.e., GEB members and selected senior management).\n\nThe number of notional shares delivered at vesting depends on two equally weighted performance metrics over a threeyear performance period: return on common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and relative total shareholder return, which compares the total shareholder return (TSR) of UBS with the TSR of an index consisting of listed Global Systemically Important Banks as determined by the Financial Stability Board (excluding UBS). The final number of shares vest over three years following the performance period for GEB members, and cliff-vest in the year following the performance period for selected senior management.\n\n## Equity Ownership Plan / Fund Ownership Plan\n\nThe Equity Ownership Plan (EOP) is the deferred share-based compensation plan for employees outside of the GEB that are subject to deferral requirements. EOP awards generally vest over three years.\n\nCertain Asset Management employees receive some or all of their EOP in the form of notional funds (Fund Ownership Plan or FOP, previously named AM EOP). This plan is generally delivered in cash and vests over three years. The amount delivered depends on the value of the underlying investment funds at the time of vesting.",

        "page_content": "## Deferred Contingent Capital Plan\n\nThe Deferred Contingent Capital Plan (DCCP) is a deferred compensation plan for all employees who are subject to deferral requirements. Such employees are awarded notional additional tier 1 (AT1) capital instruments, which, at the discretion of UBS, can be settled in cash or a perpetual, marketable AT1 capital instrument. DCCP awards generally bear notional interest  paid  annually  (except  for  certain  regulated  employees)  and  vest  in  full  after  five  years.  Awards  are forfeited if a viability event occurs (i.e., if FINMA notifies the firm that the DCCP awards must be written down to mitigate the risk of insolvency, bankruptcy or failure of UBS) or if the firm receives a commitment of extraordinary support from the public sector that is necessary to prevent such an event. DCCP awards are also written down if the Group's CET1 capital ratio falls below a defined threshold. In addition, GEB members forfeit 20% of DCCP awards for each loss-making year during the vesting period.\n\n## Financial advisor variable compensation\n\nIn line with market practice for US wealth management businesses, the compensation for US financial advisors in Global Wealth Management consists of cash compensation and deferred compensation awards, determined using a formulaic approach based on production.\n\nCash  compensation  reflects  a  percentage  of  the  compensable  production  that  each  financial  advisor  generates. Compensable production is generally based on transaction revenue and investment advisory fees and may reflect further adjustments. The percentage rate generally varies based on the level of the production and firm tenure.\n\nFinancial  advisors  may  also  be  granted  annual  deferred  compensation.  These  amounts generally vest over a six-year period. The annual deferred compensation amount reflects the overall percentage rate and production.\n\nCash compensation and deferred compensation awards may be reduced for, among other things, errors, negligence or carelessness, or failure to comply with the firm's rules, standards, practices and / or policies, and / or applicable laws and regulations.\n\nFinancial advisors may also participate in additional programs to support promoting and developing their business or supporting the transition of client relationships where appropriate. Financial advisor compensation also includes expenses related to compensation commitments with financial advisors entered into at the time of recruitment that are subject to vesting requirements.",

Actual amounts to be expensed in future periods may vary; e.g., due to forfeiture of awards. 2 Financial advisor compensation consists of cash and deferred compensation awards and is based on compensable revenues and firm tenure using a formulaic approach. It also includes expenses related to compensation commitments with financial advisors entered into at the time of recruitment that are subject to vesting requirements. 3 Consists of replacement payments, forfeiture credits, severance payments, retention plan payments and interest expense related to the Deferred Contingent Capital Plan. 4 Includes USD 680m in expenses related to share-based compensation (performance awards: USD 457m; other variable compensation: USD 56m; financial advisor compensation: USD 166m).

The fair value of the share awards subject to post-vesting sale and hedge restrictions is discounted on the basis of the duration of the post-vesting restriction and is referenced to the cost of purchasing an at-the-money European put option for the term of the transfer restriction. The grant date fair value of notional shares without dividend entitlements also includes a deduction for the present value of future expected dividends to be paid between the grant date and distribution.\n\n## Note 28  Interests in subsidiaries and other entities\n\n## a) Interests in subsidiaries\n\nUBS AG defines its significant subsidiaries as those entities that, either individually or in aggregate, contribute significantly to UBS AG's financial position or results of operations, based on a number of criteria, including the subsidiaries' equity and contribution to UBS AG's total assets and profit or loss before tax, in accordance with the requirements set by IFRS 12, Swiss regulations and the rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).\n\n## Individually significant subsidiaries\n\nThe table below lists UBS AG's individually significant subsidiaries as of 31 December 2023. Unless otherwise stated, the subsidiaries listed below have share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares held entirely by UBS AG and the proportion of ownership interest held is equal to the voting rights held by UBS AG.\n\nThe country where the respective registered office is located is also the principal place of business. UBS AG operates through a global branch network and a significant proportion of its business activity is conducted outside Switzerland, including in the UK, the US, Singapore, the Hong Kong SAR and other countries. UBS Europe SE has branches and offices in a number of EU Member States, including Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, France and Spain. Share capital is provided in the currency of the legally registered office.",

In addition, UBS AG did not provide support, financial or otherwise, to a consolidated SE when UBS AG was not contractually obligated to do so, nor does UBS AG currently have any intention to do so in the future. Furthermore, UBS AG did not provide support, financial or otherwise, to a previously unconsolidated SE that resulted in UBS AG controlling the SE during the reporting period.",

During 2023, UBS AG sponsored the creation of various SEs and interacted with a number of non-sponsored SEs, including securitization vehicles, client vehicles and certain investment funds, that UBS AG did not consolidate as of 31 December 2023 because it did not control them.\n\n## Interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe table below presents UBS AG's interests in and maximum exposure to loss from unconsolidated SEs, as well as the total assets held by the SEs in which UBS had an interest as of year-end, except for investment funds sponsored by third parties, for which the carrying amount of UBS's interest as of year-end has been disclosed.\n\nAs a consequence of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group and the resulting increase in interests in structured entities, interests in client vehicles sponsored by UBS are presented separately to other vehicles sponsored by third parties, to  clearly  distinguish  the  different  types  of  entities  that  UBS  is  involved  with.  Further,  bonds  issued  by  US government-sponsored entities included within Group Treasury's HQLA portfolio have been excluded given UBS does not absorb significant risk and third-party funding vehicles of large multi-nationals have been excluded as they are no longer considered structured entities. Prior periods have been restated to reflect these changes. As a consequence of these changes, UBS AG does not disclose any interest in other vehicles sponsored by third parties.\n\n## Sponsored unconsolidated structured entities in which UBS did not have an interest at year-end\n\nDuring 2023 and 2022, UBS AG did not earn material income from sponsored unconsolidated SEs in which UBS did not have an interest at year-end.\n\nDuring 2023 and 2022, UBS AG and third parties did not transfer any assets into sponsored securitization vehicles created in the year. UBS AG and third parties transferred assets, alongside deposits and debt issuances (which are assets from the perspective of the vehicle), of USD 0.5bn and USD 0.5bn, respectively, into sponsored client vehicles created in 2023 (2022:  USD 1bn  and  USD 3bn,  respectively).  For  sponsored  investment  funds,  transfers  arose  during  the  period  as investors invested and redeemed positions, thereby changing the overall size of the funds, which, when combined with market movements, resulted in a total closing net asset value of USD 44bn (31 December 2022: USD 38bn).",

Guarantees,  letters  of  credit  and  credit  derivatives  are  an  exception,  with  the  given  contract's notional amount, adjusted for losses already incurred, representing the maximum loss that UBS AG is exposed to.\n\nThe  maximum exposure to loss  disclosed  in  the  table  above  does  not  reflect  UBS  AG's  risk  management  activities, including  effects  from  financial  instruments  that  may  be  used  to  economically  hedge  risks  inherent  in  the  given unconsolidated SE or risk-reducing effects of collateral or other credit enhancements.\n\nIn  2023  and  2022,  UBS  AG  did  not  provide  support,  financial  or  otherwise,  to  any  unconsolidated  SE  when  not contractually obligated to do so, nor does UBS AG currently have any intention to do so in the future.\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, income and expenses from interests in unconsolidated SEs primarily resulted from mark-to-market movements recognized in Other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss , which were generally hedged with other financial instruments, as well as fee and commission income received from UBSsponsored funds.\n\n## Interests in securitization vehicles\n\nAs  of  31 December  2023  and  31 December  2022,  UBS  AG  held  interests,  both  retained  and  acquired,  in  various securitization vehicles that relate to financing, underwriting, secondary market and derivative trading activities.",

Such vehicles may enter into derivative agreements, with UBS or a third party, to align the cash flows of the entity with the investor's intended investment objective, or to introduce other desired risk exposures.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, UBS AG retained interests in client vehicles sponsored by UBS that relate to financing, secondary market and derivative trading activities, and to hedge structured product offerings.\n\n## Interests in investment funds\n\nInvestment funds have a collective investment objective, and are either passively managed, so that any decision-making does not have a substantive effect on variability, or are actively managed and investors or their governing bodies do not have substantive voting or similar rights.\n\nUBS AG holds interests in a number of investment funds, primarily resulting from seed investments or in order to hedge structured product offerings. In addition to the interests disclosed in the table above, UBS AG manages the assets of various pooled investment funds and receives fees based, in whole or in part, on the net asset value of the fund and / or the performance of the fund. The specific fee structure is determined based on various market factors and considers the fund's nature and the jurisdiction of incorporation, as well as fee schedules negotiated with clients. These fee contracts represent an interest in the fund, as they align UBS AG's exposure with investors, providing a variable return based on the performance of the entity. Depending on the structure of the fund, these fees may be collected directly from the fund's assets and / or from the investors. Any amounts due are collected on a regular basis and are generally backed by the fund's assets. Therefore, interest in such funds is not represented by the on-balance sheet fee receivable but rather by  the  future  exposure  to  variable  fees.  The  total  assets  of  such  funds  were  USD 356bn  and  USD 336bn  as  of 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, respectively, and have been excluded from the table above. UBS AG did not have any material exposure to loss from these interests as of 31 December 2023 or as of 31 December 2022.\n\n## Note 29  Changes in organization and acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries and businesses\n\n## Disposals of subsidiaries and businesses\n\n## Sale of UBS Hana Asset Management Co., Ltd.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, UBS AG completed the sale of its 51% stake in UBS Hana Asset Management Co., Ltd. to Hana Securities. Upon completion of the sale, UBS AG recorded a pre-tax gain of USD 23m (net of a foreign currency translation loss) in Asset Management which was recognized in Other income .\n\n## Changes in organization\n\n## Legal structure integration\n\nIn December 2023, the Board of Directors of UBS Group AG approved the merger of UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG, and both entities entered into a definitive merger agreement. The completion of the merger is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to occur by the end of the second quarter of 2024.\n\nUBS also expects to complete the transition to a single US intermediate holding company in the second quarter of 2024 and the planned merger of UBS Switzerland AG and Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG in the third quarter of 2024.",

Invested assets include managed fund assets, managed institutional assets, discretionary and advisory wealth management portfolios, fiduciary deposits, time deposits, savings accounts, and wealth management securities or brokerage accounts. All assets held  for  purely  transactional  purposes  and  custody-only  assets,  including  corporate  client  assets  held  for  cash management and transactional purposes, are excluded from invested assets, as UBS AG only administers the assets and does not offer advice on how they should be invested. Also excluded are non-bankable assets (e.g., art collections) and deposits from third-party banks for funding or trading purposes.\n\nDiscretionary assets are defined as client assets that UBS AG decides how to invest. Other invested assets are those where the client ultimately decides how the assets are invested. When a single product is created in one business division and sold in another, it is counted in both the business division managing the investment and the one distributing it. This results in double counting within UBS AG's total invested assets and net new money, as both business divisions are independently providing a service to their respective clients, and both add value and generate revenue.\n\n## Net new money\n\nNet new money in a reporting period is the amount of invested assets entrusted to UBS AG by new and existing clients, less those withdrawn by existing clients and clients who terminated relationships with UBS AG.\n\nNet new money is calculated using the direct method, under which inflows and outflows to / from invested assets are determined at the client level, based on transactions. Interest and dividend income from invested assets are not counted as net new money inflows. Market and currency movements, as well as fees, commissions and interest on loans charged, are excluded from net new money, as are effects resulting from any acquisition or divestment of a UBS subsidiary or business. Reclassifications  between  invested  assets  and  custody-only  assets  as  a  result  of  a  change  in  service  level  delivered  are generally treated as net new money flows. However, where the change in service level directly results from an externally imposed regulation or a strategic decision by UBS AG to exit a market or specific service offering, the one-time net effect is reported as Other effects .\n\nThe Investment Bank does not track invested assets and net new money. However, when a client is transferred from the Investment Bank to another business division, this may produce net new money even though the client's assets were already with UBS AG.\n\nIn 2023 UBS AG has changed its accounting policy for net new money and invested assets to include its share of net new money and invested assets from associates, to better reflect the business strategy and aligned with the equity method accounting applied to these entities. Comparative figures in the tables below have been restated to reflect this change, resulting in an increase to invested assets as of 31 December 2022 of USD 24bn and an increase to net new money for 2022 of USD 8bn, all relating to Asset Management.",

The Swiss Financial  Market  Supervisory  Authority  (FINMA)  requires  financial  groups  presenting  financial  statements  under  IFRS Accounting Standards to provide a narrative explanation of the main differences between IFRS Accounting Standards and Swiss generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) (the FINMA Accounting Ordinance, FINMA Circular 2020/1 'Accounting - banks' and the Banking Ordinance (the BO)). Included in this Note are the significant differences in the recognition and measurement between IFRS Accounting Standards and the provisions of the BO and the guidelines of FINMA governing true and fair view financial statement reporting pursuant to Art. 25 to Art. 42 of the BO.\n\n## 1. Consolidation\n\nUnder IFRS Accounting Standards, all entities that are controlled by the holding entity are consolidated. Under Swiss GAAP controlled entities deemed immaterial to a group or those held only temporarily are exempt from consolidation, but  instead  are  recorded  as  participations  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of  accounting  or  as  financial investments measured at the lower of cost or market value.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nUnder  IFRS  Accounting  Standards,  debt  instruments  are  measured  at  amortized  cost,  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), depending on the nature of the business model within which the particular asset is held and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the asset. Equity instruments are accounted for at FVTPL by UBS. Under Swiss GAAP, trading assets and derivatives are measured at FVTPL, in line with IFRS Accounting Standards. However, non-trading debt instruments are generally measured at amortized cost, even when the assets are managed on a fair value basis. In addition, the measurement of financial assets in the form of securities depends on the nature of the asset: debt instruments not held to maturity, i.e., instruments available for sale, and equity instruments with no permanent holding intent, are classified as Financial investments and measured at the lower of (amortized) cost or market value. Market value adjustments up to the original cost amount and realized gains or losses upon disposal of the investment are recorded in the income statement as Other income from ordinary activities. Equity  instruments  with  a  permanent  holding  intent  are  classified  as  participations  in Non-consolidated investments in subsidiaries and other participations and are measured at cost less impairment. Impairment losses are recorded in the income statement as Impairment of investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participations. Reversals of impairments up to the original cost amount and realized gains or losses upon disposal of the investment are recorded as Extraordinary income / Extraordinary expenses .\n\n## 3. Fair value option applied to financial liabilities\n\nUnder IFRS Accounting Standards, UBS applies the fair value option to certain financial liabilities not held for trading. Instruments for which the fair value option is applied are accounted for at FVTPL. The amount of change in the fair value attributable to changes in UBS's own credit is presented in Other comprehensive income directly within Retained earnings . The fair value option is applied primarily to issued structured debt instruments, certain non-structured debt instruments, certain payables under repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities lending agreements, amounts due under unit-linked investment contracts, and brokerage payables.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, the fair value option can only be applied to structured debt instruments consisting of a debt host contract and one or more embedded derivatives that do not relate to own equity. Furthermore, unrealized changes in fair value attributable to changes in UBS's own credit are not recognized, whereas realized own credit is recognized in Net trading income .\n\n## 4. Allowances and provisions for credit losses\n\nSwiss GAAP permit use of IFRS Accounting Standards for accounting for allowances and provisions for credit losses based on an expected credit loss (ECL) model. UBS has chosen to apply the IFRS 9 ECL approach to those exposures that are in the ECL scope of both frameworks, IFRS Accounting Standards and Swiss GAAP.\n\nFor the small residual exposures within the scope of Swiss GAAP ECL requirements, which are not subject to ECL under IFRS Accounting Standards due to classification differences, UBS applies alternative approaches.\n\n- - For exposures for which Pillar 1 internal ratings-based models are applied to measure credit risk, ECL is determined by the regulatory expected loss (EL), with an add-on for scaling up to the residual maturity of exposures maturing beyond the next 12 months, as appropriate. For detailed information on regulatory EL, refer to the 'Risk management and control' section of this report.\n- - For exposures for which the Pillar 1 standardized approach is used to measure credit risk, ECL is determined using a portfolio approach that derives a conservative probability of default (PD) and a conservative loss given default (LGD) for the entire portfolio.\n\n## 5. Hedge accounting\n\nUnder IFRS Accounting Standards, when cash flow hedge accounting is applied, the fair value gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is recognized initially in equity and reclassified to the income statement when certain conditions are met. When fair value hedge accounting is applied, the fair value change of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is reflected in the measurement of the hedged item and is recognized in the income statement along with the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative. Under Swiss GAAP, the effective portion of the fair value change of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow or as a fair value hedge is deferred on the balance sheet as Other assets or Other liabilities . The carrying amount of the hedged item designated in fair value hedges is not adjusted for fair value changes attributable to the hedged risk.",

        "page_content": "## 6. Goodwill and intangible assets\n\nUnder IFRS Accounting Standards, goodwill acquired in a business combination is not amortized but tested annually for impairment. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are also not amortized but tested annually for impairment. Under Swiss GAAP, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are amortized over a period not exceeding five years, unless a longer useful life, which may not exceed 10 years, can be justified. In addition, these assets are tested annually for impairment.\n\n## 7. Post-employment benefit plans\n\nSwiss GAAP permit the use of IFRS Accounting Standards or Swiss accounting standards for post-employment benefit plans, with the election made on a plan-by-plan basis.\n\nUBS has elected to apply IAS 19 for the non-Swiss defined benefit plans in the UBS AG standalone financial statements and Swiss GAAP (FER 16) for the Swiss pension plan in the UBS AG and the UBS Switzerland AG standalone financial statements. The requirements of Swiss GAAP are better aligned with the specific nature of Swiss pension plans, which are hybrid in that they combine elements of defined contribution and defined benefit plans, but are treated as defined benefit plans under IFRS Accounting Standards. Key differences between Swiss GAAP and IFRS Accounting Standards include the treatment of dynamic elements, such as future salary increases and future interest credits on retirement savings, which are not considered under the static method used in accordance with Swiss GAAP. Also, the discount rate used to determine the defined benefit obligation in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards is based on the yield of high-quality corporate bonds of the market in the respective pension plan country. The discount rate used in accordance with Swiss GAAP (i.e., the technical interest rate) is determined by the Pension Foundation Board based on the expected returns of the Board's investment strategy.\n\nFor defined benefit plans, IFRS Accounting Standards require the full defined benefit obligation net of the plan assets to be  recorded  on  the  balance  sheet  subject  to  the  asset  ceiling  rules,  with  changes  resulting  from  remeasurements recognized directly in equity. However, for non-Swiss defined benefit plans for which IFRS Accounting Standards are elected, changes due to remeasurements are recognized in the income statement of UBS AG standalone under Swiss GAAP.\n\nSwiss GAAP require employer contributions to the pension fund to be recognized as personnel expenses in the income statement. Swiss GAAP also require an assessment of whether, based on the pension fund's financial statements prepared in accordance with Swiss accounting standards (FER 26), an economic benefit to, or obligation of, the employer arises from the pension fund that is recognized in the balance sheet when conditions are met. Conditions for recording a pension asset or liability would be met if, for example, an employer contribution reserve is available or the employer is required to contribute to the reduction of a pension deficit (on an FER 26 basis).\n\n## 8. Leasing\n\nUnder IFRS Accounting Standards, a single lease accounting model applies that requires UBS to record a right-of-use (RoU) asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet when UBS is a lessee in a lease arrangement. The RoU asset and the lease liability are recognized when UBS acquires control of the physical use of the asset. The lease liability  is  measured  based  on  the  present  value  of  the  lease  payments  over  the  lease  term,  discounted  using  UBS's unsecured borrowing rate. The RoU asset is recorded at an amount equal to the lease liability but is adjusted for rent prepayments, initial direct costs, any costs to refurbish the leased asset and / or lease incentives received. The RoU asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset.\n\nUnder  Swiss  GAAP,  leases  that  transfer  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards,  but  not  necessarily  legal  title  in  the underlying assets, are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Whereas finance leases are recognized on the balance sheet and measured in line with IFRS Accounting Standards, operating leases are not recognized on the balance sheet, with payments recognized as General and administrative expenses on a straightline basis over the lease term, which commences with control of the physical use of the asset. Lease incentives are treated as a reduction of rental expense and recognized on a consistent basis over the lease term.\n\n## 9. Netting of derivative assets and liabilities\n\nUnder IFRS Accounting Standards, derivative assets, derivative liabilities and related cash collateral not settled to market are  reported  on  a  gross  basis  unless  the  restrictive  netting  requirements  under  IFRS  Accounting  Standards  are  met: (i) existence  of  master  netting  agreements  and  related  collateral  arrangements  that  are  unconditional  and  legally enforceable, in both the normal course of business and the event of default, bankruptcy or insolvency of UBS and its counterparties;  and  (ii) UBS's  intention  to  either  settle  on  a  net  basis  or  to  realize  the  asset  and  settle  the  liability simultaneously. Under Swiss GAAP, derivative assets, derivative liabilities and related cash collateral not settled to market are  generally  reported  on  a  net  basis,  provided  the  master  netting  and  the  related  collateral  agreements  are  legally enforceable in the event of default, bankruptcy or insolvency of UBS's counterparties.",

        "page_content": "## 10. Negative interest\n\nUnder IFRS Accounting Standards, negative interest income arising on a financial asset does not meet the definition of interest  income  and,  therefore,  negative  interest  on  financial  assets  and  negative  interest  on  financial  liabilities  are presented within interest expense and interest income, respectively. Under Swiss GAAP, negative interest on financial assets is presented within interest income and negative interest on financial liabilities is presented within interest expense.\n\n## 11. Extraordinary income and expense\n\nCertain non-recurring and non-operating income and expense items, such as realized gains or losses from the disposal of participations, fixed and intangible assets, and reversals of impairments of participations and fixed assets, are classified as extraordinary items under Swiss GAAP. This distinction is not available under IFRS Accounting Standards. \uf070\n\n## Note 34  Supplemental guarantor information required under SEC regulations\n\n## Joint liability of UBS Switzerland AG\n\nIn 2015, the Personal & Corporate Banking and Wealth Management businesses booked in Switzerland were transferred from UBS AG to UBS Switzerland AG through an asset transfer in accordance with the Swiss Merger Act. Under the terms of the asset transfer agreement, UBS Switzerland AG assumed joint liability for contractual obligations of UBS AG existing on the asset transfer date, including the full and unconditional guarantee of certain registered debt securities issued by UBS AG. To reflect this joint liability, UBS Switzerland AG is presented in a separate column as a subsidiary coguarantor.\n\nThe joint  liability  of  UBS  Switzerland AG  for  contractual  obligations  of  UBS AG  decreased  in  2023  by  USD 1.0bn  to USD 3.3bn as of 31 December 2023. The decrease substantially relates to a combination of contractual maturities, early extinguishments, fair value movements and foreign currency effects.\n\n## Supplemental guarantor consolidated

under IFRS Accounting Standards. 2 Includes financial liabilities at fair value held for trading, other financial liabilities designated at fair value and brokerage payables designated at fair value. 3 For the purpose of this disclosure, negative interest expense on liabilities is presented as a reduction to interest expense, while in the consolidated income statement negative interest income on liabilities is presented as interest income. Refer to 'Note 3 Net interest income and other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information. 4 Mainly includes derivative financial instruments, equity instruments at fair value held for trading and financial liabilities related to unit-linked investment contracts.\n\nThe percentage of total average interest-earning assets attributable to foreign activities was 61% for 2023 (2022: 61%; 2021: 60%). The percentage of total average interest-bearing liabilities attributable to foreign activities was 61% for 2023 (2022: 60%; 2021: 59%). All assets and liabilities are translated into US dollars at uniform month-end rates. Interest income and expense are translated at monthly average rates.\n\nAverage rates earned and paid on assets and liabilities can change from period to period based on the changes in interest rates in general, but are also affected by changes in the currency mix included in the assets and liabilities. Tax-exempt income is not recorded on a tax-equivalent basis. For all three years presented, tax-exempt income is considered to be insignificant, and the effect from such income is therefore negligible.",

The change in average volume represents the change in the current average balance compared with the average balance from the prior year with respect to the average rate of the prior year. The change in average rate represents the difference between the net change in interest income and expense and the change in average volume.\n\n|

Uninsured deposits are deposits that are in excess of local deposit insurance or protection scheme limits in the key locations in which UBS AG operates, calculated based on the respective local regulations, as well as deposits in uninsured accounts. The main deposit insurance  schemes  applicable  to  UBS  AG  deposits  are  the  Swiss  depositor  protection  scheme  in  Switzerland  (which protects  applicable  deposits  up  to  a  maximum  of  CHF 100,000  per  client  and  per  bank  or  securities  firm),  the Compensation Scheme of German Banks in combination with the Deposit Protection Fund of the Association of German Banks in Germany (which protects applicable deposits up to a maximum of EUR 5m per client and EUR 50m per business) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) scheme in the Americas (which protects applicable deposits up to a maximum of USD 250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category).\n\nThe table below presents the maturity of estimated uninsured time deposits as of 31 December 2023. Where a depositor holds multiple accounts, which in aggregate are in excess of a deposit insurance or protection limit, the insured amount is first allocated to the account with the shortest time to maturity.\n\n| USD m                                                | Uninsured time deposits 1   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Within 3 months                                      | 141,142                     |\n| 3 to 6 months                                        | 23,182                      |\n| 6 to 12 months                                       | 21,263                      |\n| Over 12 months                                       | 13,704                      |\n| Total uninsured time deposits as of 31 December 2023 | 199,292                     |",

A number of APMs are reported in the discussion of the financial and operating performance of the external reports (annual, quarterly and other reports). APMs are used to provide a more complete picture of operating performance and to reflect management's view of the fundamental drivers of the business results.  A  definition  of  each  APM,  the  method  used  to  calculate  it  and  the  information  content  are  presented  in alphabetical order in the table below.

        "page_content": "Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements | This report contains statements that constitute 'forward-looking statements,' including but not limited to management's outlook for UBS's financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS's  business  and  future  development  and  goals  or  intentions  to  achieve  climate,  sustainability  and  other  social  objectives.  While  these  forward-looking statements represent UBS's judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS's expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia-Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth. In  addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia-Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS's acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed our outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS's clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS's credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding  requirements,  heightened  operational  resilience  requirements,  incremental  tax  requirements,  additional  levies,  limitations  on  permitted  activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS's business activities; (vii) UBS's ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS's ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil;
