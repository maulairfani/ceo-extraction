The Group has its origins in the Ministry for Mail, Telegraphs and Telephone. It was renamed France Telecom in 1991 and became a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme (limited company) on December 31, 1996. In October 1997, France Telecom shares were listed on the Paris and New York stock exchanges, allowing the French government the disposal of 25% of its shares to the public and Group employees. Subsequently, the public sector gradually reduced its holding to 53%. Between 2004 and 2008 the public sector sold a further 26% of the capital, and then again 4% in 2014 and 2015. On December 31, 2023, the French State retained 22.95% of the share capital, held either directly or jointly with Bpifrance Participations.\n\nFrance Telecom's area of activity and its regulatory and competitive environment have undergone significant changes since the 1990s. In a context of increased deregulation and competition, the Group has, over that period, undertaken several strategic investments, in particular the acquisition of the mobile operator Orange Plc and its brand created in 1994, and the acquisition of a controlling stake in Poland's incumbent operator, Telekomunikacja Polska.\n\nSince 2005, the Group has expanded strategically in Spain by acquiring the mobile operator Amena, then in 2015 the fixed-line operator Jazztel.\n\nThe  Group  is  pursuing  a  policy  of  selective,  value-creating acquisitions by concentrating on the markets in which it is already present. In the emerging markets of Africa and the Middle East where the Group is historically present (in particular Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Jordan, Mali and Senegal), this strategy was implemented through the acquisition of Mobinil in Egypt (2010) and of M\u00e9ditel in Morocco (2015) and more recently by the acquisition of a number of African operators (in Liberia, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) (2016).\n\nIt also resulted in the joint venture with Deutsche Telekom that combined UK activities under the EE brand (2010) followed by the disposal of EE in 2016, as well as the disposal of Orange Switzerland (2012), Orange Dominicana (2014), Orange Armenia (2015) and Telkom Kenya (2016).\n\nIn  Europe  where  Orange  implements  a  convergence  strategy, this  policy  resulted  in  the  takeover  of  Telekom  Romania Communications,in the strengthening of the majority shareholding in Orange Belgium (2021), in the takeover of the Belgian operator VOO (2023) and in the merger agreement signed on March 21, 2024 with the Romanian State defining the terms of the merger by absorption of Orange Romania Communications by Orange Romania, the Romanian State keeping a stake in the combined entity. In 2022,\n\nOrange and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil signed an agreement to consolidate their activities in Spain (excluding Totem Spain and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil Portugal) which was completed on March 26, 2024, after authorisation from the European Commission on February 20, 2024 and agreement of the Spanish Government on the control of foreign investments on March12, 2024. This merger, which combines the activities of Orange Espagne and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil, takes the form of a 50/50 joint venture jointly controlled by Orange and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil's shareholders with equal governance rights in the combined entity, and results in its equity method (see section 3.2 Recent events and note 3.2 to the consolidated accounts).\n\nAs part of its corporate services and since the acquisition of Equant in 2000, Orange has been pursuing its strategy of becoming a global player in digital transformation and has accelerated its shift to services through a number of targeted acquisitions, notably in the fields of Cloud services and cybersecurity, such as those of  Business  &  Decision  and  Basefarm  (2018)  and  SecureLink and  SecureData  (2019),  Expertime  (2023),  a  service  company specializing in Microsoft technologies, and the launch of Bleu, a future 'Trusted Cloud' platform in a 50/50 joint venture with Capgemini and in partnership with Microsoft (2023-2024). In 2023, Enovacom, a health subsidiary of Orange Business and French leader in medical data interoperability, acquired NEHS Digital and Xperis, two French companies specializing in the development of solutions for healthcare professionals. (see Sections 1.3 Significant events and 3.1.1.3 Significant Events).\n\nOrange  aims  to  optimize,  develop  and  enhance  the  value  of its fixed and mobile infrastructure while retaining control of its strategic assets. In 2021, to support its development in fiber, the Group partnered with long-term investors to create two FiberCos in Europe. It also launched Totem, its European TowerCo, to pool its mobile towers in order to enhance their value and optimize their management.\n\nIn 2006, Orange became the Group's main brand for Internet, television and mobile telephony services in the majority of countries where it operated. In 2013, the Company adopted the Orange name, offering the full range of its telephony services in France under the Orange brand. This policy continued with the gradual adoption of the Orange brand by most of the Group's subsidiaries in Europe and Africa. Corporate services in the world are offered primarily under the Orange Business brand.\n\nIn February 2023, the Group presented its strategic plan Lead the future (see Section 1.2 Business model, market and strategy). In line with this plan that refocuses Orange on its core business,\n\n## Cross-cutting functions\n\n- / Communication\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- / Corporate Social Responsibility\n- / Finance, Performance and Development\n- / General  Secretariat\n- / Human  Resources\n- / Strategy\n- / Technology and Innovation",

At the end of these negotiation, Orange announced, at the end of February 2024, that it had selected BNP Paribas to offer a banking\n\ncontinuity solution for its customers (subject to eligibility conditions) in France and Spain. Orange and BNP Paribas signed a number of agreements in February 2024 in relation to this partnership, which is part of Orange's wider intention to progressively withdraw Orange Bank from the retail banking market in France and Spain. In January 2024, the Group sold all of OCS and Orange Studio's titles to the Canal+ Group (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant Events).\n\n## 1.2 Business model, market and strategy\n\n## 1.2.1 Business  model\n\nBuilding, rolling out and\n\nproviding mutualized solutions\n\nfor digital infrastructure\n\nOffering connectivity,\n\nfinancial, IT and\n\ncybersecurity services\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.2.1.1 'Integrated' business model\n\nOrange,  France's  incumbent  telecoms  operator,  is  a  leading digital company globally.

Orange must report to the public authorities about these obligations throughout the period of validity of these authorizations and licenses. Then, depending on geographical location and market, Orange either operates its own fixed and mobile infrastructure, or uses the networks of third-party operators  under  the  technical,  financial  and  regulatory conditions that apply locally;\n- -the roll-out and maintenance of physical infrastructure networks, such as antennas, cables and switches, to guarantee extensive coverage and the best quality of service to meet customer expectations; the equipment required for these roll-outs, as well as the purchase of the devices needed to provide the service, are largely sourced from very large, globalized suppliers that are common to the various operators. Orange relies on its own workforce, employed in each of the countries where it operates, as well as entire workforce of companies acting locally on its behalf;\n- -the roll-out of software infrastructure via IT platforms that allow for proactive, real-time management of our networks, facilitating the control of physical infrastructure, customer service and data collection. Orange relies on its own solutions as well as those of international players, in compliance with the interoperability rules and standards developed by the international institutions to which Orange contributes.\n\nThe second pillar of our value chain focuses on marketing digital services. This stage is fundamental to maintaining our position as a major telecommunications player, and includes several key elements:\n\n- -product development: Orange must constantly innovate by developing new products and services to meet its customers' needs.  These  offers  can  include  mobile,  fixed,  Internet, television and Cloud services. Orange has its own research and development resources and favors an Open Innovation approach. Its experts and researchers work with an ecosystem of  partners,  companies,  start-ups,  and  public  and  private laboratories in France and abroad;\n- -the sale and distribution of Orange services and Orange or partner equipment; Orange caters to all customers, with specific offers to meet the needs of businesses through a dedicated entity with a global scope of activity (Orange Business). For B2C, small business and professional customers, Orange has its own distribution channels, both physical (stores, technical sales specialists, etc.) and digital (call centers, website, apps), in every country where it operates. It also relies on indirect distribution channels ranging from large groups to independent retailers;\n- -after-sales service: after-sales service completes this value chain,  resolving  technical  issues  and  providing  continuity of  service;  after-sales  service  relies  partially  on  Orange's own resources and partially on a network of external service providers or subcontractors, whether global or local.\n\nRecovery and end-of-life of products: Orange's commitment to sustainability is reflected in its involvement in the recovery and recycling of products at end of life, thus helping to reduce the environmental impact of its activities. Product recovery relies on the Orange network, as well as partnerships with associations specializing in the social and solidarity economy. The recycling of customer equipment (mobile phones, set-top boxes, etc.) takes place through partnerships with specialized companies.",

        "page_content": "## 1.2.2 Key changes in the telecom services market\n\nThe telecoms services market as a whole is characterized by the following major trends. Specific market trends in the business segments are described in Section 1.4 Operating activities, while regulatory trends in national markets are described in Section 1.7 Regulation of telecommunication activities.\n\nAs the need for connectivity and digital services continues to grow worldwide, operators must transform themselves amidst a turbulent geopolitical, economic and regulatory environment marked by instability in conflict zones in Europe and Africa & Middle East, demographic variations and migration particularly affecting Africa & Middle East, climate disasters, the general economic slowdown due to the energy crisis and material shortages, inflation, intensifying competition between telecommunication operators and also with new non-telecommunication competitors, cyber threats, and changes in European regulations seeking to regulate markets in the face of security, sovereignty and sustainability issues.\n\n## Growth in usage and new customer expectations\n\nThe increased capacity of existing networks and the multiplicity of screens available (computers, smartphones, tablets, connected TVs, augmented reality glasses and headsets) are driving growth in  usage.  The  development  of  5G  technology  has  prompted the  emergence  of  new  uses  for  businesses  (optimization of production  time,  remote  machine  operation,  predictive maintenance, etc.), and for B2C customers (connected devices, immersive  videos,  Web  3.0,  Cloud  gaming, etc.).  Immersive technologies (metaverse), Web 3.0, and generative AI create the opportunity for new customer experiences. The rise in Internet traffic is driven by the increased digitization of essential services: education, health, finance, leisure, etc. The need for connectivity has become vital for individuals and businesses alike (teleworking, e-commerce, digitization of services, apps, etc.), with demand for digital services and content growing both in Europe and in Africa & Middle East, where the population is very young ('digital natives'). For businesses, better connectivity and services mean greater productivity and competitiveness. The need for coverage and continuity in the customer experience, as well as secure, on-demand connectivity (based on the number of users and their usage patterns), is growing. The digital transformation of companies exposes them to new cyber threats. Cybersecurity has become a need for individuals, businesses, and governments alike. More than ever, customers count on networks being reliable and resilient and on the protection of their personal data, highlighting the importance of a relationship of trust with their operator. To reduce inequalities in digital access, customers expect offers that are accessible to the most disadvantaged, as well as support for first-time users.\n\n## Network development\n\nTo face the increasingly steady growth of uses, operators must continue to invest in tomorrow's very high-speed broadband (fiber, 5G, satellite), to increase their capacity and make them more efficient. This is made possible by the virtualization of network functions  and  automation,  the  emergence  of  'as  a  service' connectivity  solutions  that  can  be  controlled  and  configured on demand, and the use of data and AI. As organizations are stepping up their digital transformation, app and data integration\n\nsolutions are becoming critical elements for AI applications and roll-outs.  Telecommunication  operators  are  transforming  their networks through an open platform approach and by integrating AI into their model. Digital technology is a growing challenge of sovereignty, leading economic players to implement sovereign telecommunication  solutions  through  key  technologies:  Cloud &  Edge,  cybersecurity,  satellite  constellations  (broadband connectivity solution resilient to climate and security disasters), AI. The growing digitization, complexity and interdependence of information systems are increasing the risk of cyber attacks, which are increasing in scale and intensity. Damage to property (following storms, floods, heat waves, cable theft, etc.) is multiplying, requiring immediate action to restore connectivity. Operators need to invest in the reliability of their networks and the resilience of their business processes in order to ensure business continuity. Storing a growing volume of data requires investment in Cloud infrastructure and datacenters.\n\nIn Europe, network investments are focused on very high-speed broadband access, with the development of fiber (supplemented by a satellite offer for remote areas), improved performance of 4G mobile networks and the roll-out of 5G. In Africa & Middle East, Internet access networks are developing primarily through the roll-out of 4G and 5G mobile networks, as well as fiber in targeted areas of large cities.\n\n## Transformation of the telecoms industry\n\nRegulatory  constraints  (imposed  rates,  complex  mergers, consolidation remedies) and competition (low cost, price wars) are still very intense in Europe. Competition is intensifying between telecommunication  operators,  as  well  as  with  disruptive  new entrants like GAFAM (1) and other digital stakeholders (Starlink, start-ups and fintechs like Wave in Africa). More than 50% of network capacity in Europe is used by GAFAM 1 , which raises the question of fair value sharing. Smartphone manufacturers and digital service providers are challenging the operators' ability to differentiate themselves. Over-The-Top (OTT) service providers are focusing on voice substitution in business to business (B2B) and in international wholesale. The major digital market players are also speeding up the development of their proprietary infrastructure by building new datacenters and international networks that they are promoting in the B2B and wholesale markets. At the same time, Chinese network and smartphone providers are increasingly being bypassed due to security and sovereignty risks.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the transformation of the telecoms industry is gathering pace.\n\nFor telecommunication operators, AI makes networks smarter and  therefore  more  efficient.  The  emergence  of  generative  AI represents a real revolution, as it can change professional practices by improving operational efficiency and the customer experience.\n\nIn terms of recruitment, there is high demand for multi-skilled and  more  software-development  than  physical-infrastructuremanagement  oriented  employees.  To  build  team  loyalty  and to develop the digital skills required for the new technological revolution, operators are investing in employee training and seeking to increase their attractiveness.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nRising energy prices has put pressure on costs, while inflation has complicated the economic equation. To face the challenges of profitability, operators are seeking to raise rates, under both regulatory and competitive constraints. They have to decommission 2G, 3G and copper networks, and are seeking to pool and share their networks; some are even transferring all or part of their infrastructure  to  financial  funds  or  infrastructure  companies (TowerCos). 'Coopetition' initiatives are on the rise, with alliances between  telecommunications  companies  (APIs,  Telco  Cloud) and a growing number of RAN sharing projects (passive/active infrastructure). These have led to transformation and consolidation plans, particularly in Europe.\n\n## Working toward responsible digital technology\n\nTo reconcile growth in usage with the challenges of sustainability, operators have a role to play in guiding consumers toward more sustainable practices and transforming their ecosystems. They need to double down on their efforts to reach their Net Zero Carbon targets, limit the use of scarce resources, think strategically about access to critical materials (due to their limited availability and geopolitical risks), and preserve biodiversity. Levers for reducing greenhouse  gas  emissions  include  the  use  of  energy-saving solutions, renewable energies and the development of the circular economy.  The  regulatory  environment  is  becoming  tougher, sustainable finance is shaping strategic guidelines, and CSR criteria are playing an increasingly important role in the choice of a supplier or product.\n\nThe digital sector also has a unique ability to help reduce CO 2 emissions.  Thanks  to  their  network  infrastructure  and  service platforms,  operators  are  particularly  well  positioned  to  create solutions dedicated to better resource management (energy, rare metals, etc.) for businesses and governments. They also have a role to play from a social and societal standpoint: they have to make networks and practices accessible to everyone (people living in rural areas, people with disabilities, senior citizens, etc.), but also support their various audiences in adopting new technologies, developing trust by ensuring data protection and preventing social risks (harassment, dependency, etc.) that become more intense with innovations.\n\n## Changes in digital technology regulations\n\nAgainst this backdrop of profound change, European regulations are evolving to support the digital transformation (see Section 1.7 Regulation of telecommunication activities).\n\nThe Digital Services Act (DSA) update to the e-Commerce Directive amends the obligations of intermediaries connecting consumers\n\n## 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy\n\nLaunched in February 2023, the strategic plan Lead the Future aims to generate value from the Group's recognized excellence in its core business and to grow sustainably in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Orange also intends to re-position its Enterprise activities in next generation connectivity solutions and accelerate in cybersecurity.\n\nThis plan was designed to project Orange into the future and capitalize on its unique strengths in the telecoms sector. The quality of its core assets combined with a solid financial position allow it to address the many structural and economic challenges facing the industry. The explosion of digital uses is accompanied by ever-increasing customer demands, notably in terms of resilience, making the telecoms sector essential for years to come.\n\nLead the Future aims to respond to these challenges and focus Orange on its core business. This ambitious and pragmatic plan aims to build on the Group's strengths to create value. Orange, a pioneer in fiber, continues to deploy, innovate and invest in the best technologies to respond to its customers' needs for reliability,\n\nwith goods, services and content to prevent illegal and harmful activities online, as well as the spread of misinformation. The DSA only provides for limited changes for electronic communications operators.\n\nThe Digital Market Act of September 14, 2022, applicable gradually from May 2, 2023, provides a framework for the economic activity of  major  digital  platforms  in  the  European  Union,  and  should help establish fair relations between platforms and businesses. Telecommunication  operators  are  outside  the  scope  of  the regulation.\n\nThe  European  Network  and  Information  Security  2  (NIS  2) Directive, published in the Official Journal of the European Union in December 2022, succeeds the 2016 Directive by expanding it scope both in terms of sectors and entities covered, and by reinforcing sanctions.  It  also  establishes  CyCLONe,  a  network  bringing together the French information systems security agency (Agence Nationale de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 des Syst\u00e8mes d'Information - ANSSI) and its European counterparts for coordinated responses in the event of a crisis. Member States must transpose these provisions into national law by October 2024.\n\nThe  draft  European  Gigabit  Infrastructure  Act,  which  aims  to improve the effectiveness of Directive 2014/61/EU to facilitate the roll-out of very high-speed broadband networks by reducing the associated costs and simplifying the administrative framework, was submitted in December 2023 and agreed upon on February 6, 2024. The provisional agreement, which has not yet been published, must still be submitted to the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament for formal adoption.\n\nThe Recommendation on Gigabit Connectivity was published on February 6, 2024. It updates two recommendations from 2010 and 2013, which dealt with the remedies that could be imposed on SMP operators (those with significant market power) during market analyses, particularly in the context of the transition from copper to fiber.\n\nLastly, on December 9, 2023, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on AI legislation that harmonizes the rules on AI systems, ensuring that they are safe and respect the fundamental rights and values of the European Union. Once the final text of the law has been formally adopted by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, the AI legislation will come into force gradually until 3 years after its publication. In order to facilitate the transition to the new regulatory framework, the European Commission has launched the AI Pact, an initiative that aims to support implementation and invites AI developers to comply in advance with the main obligations of the AI legislation.\n\nsecurity and resilience. In addition, Orange consolidates its strong position in cybersecurity and re-positions its B2B activities to better meet the expectations of its customers. Finally, this plan is expected to allow the Group to strengthen its position in Africa and the Middle East, a region of high growth.\n\nLead the Future is built on four pillars:\n\n- 1. Capitalizing on Orange's core business to reinforce excellence and quality of service;\n- 2. Capitalizing on infrastructure in all the countries where the Group is active;\n- 3. Transforming Orange Business to accelerate growth in the Enterprise  segment  and  strengthen  Orange's  position  in cybersecurity;\n- 4. Continuing to grow in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nAccompanying the 2025 plan is a new company model.",

        "page_content": "## Capitalizing on the core business to reinforce excellence and quality of service\n\n## Standing out for the quality of networks and service\n\nThe quality of Orange's networks and the excellence of its customer service in Europe are widely recognized, as evidenced by the net promoter score (NPS). The power of the Orange brand, ranked the second most-valued telecoms brand in Europe in 2023, has thus been strengthened. As the leader in fiber optic deployment in Europe with nearly 48 million Fiber to the Home (FTTH) connections deployed by the Group by the end of 2023, Orange now has considerable technology assets. The excellence of the network, following significant investments, is expected to enable the Group to strengthen its leadership in terms of customer experience. Orange will continue to develop digital channels to seek to treat 70% of customer support requests in Europe by 2025 (compared with around 50% in 2022 and 66% in 2023).\n\n## Using Data and AI to offer customers a customized experience\n\nOrange intends to develop its use of Data and AI to offer customers a customized and seamless experience across its digital and physical channels. The Group thus aims to continue to increase the share of digital technology in sales and in customer support. By leveraging AI, it intends to improve its ability to predict customer expectations, focusing on services that are secure (through network-integrated cybersecurity), transparent (offering customized, modular, seamless connectivity on-the-go) and 'green' with, for example, repaired and refurbished devices.\n\n## Capitalizing on roll-out progress and leadership in networks\n\nIn addition to fiber, 5G and '4G Home' which are already widely available, Orange enhanced its satellite offer in 2023 by launching, in partnership with Eutelsat, a commercial offer in mainland France (see Section 1.5.1 Access networks).\n\nIn Spain, the combination with M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil endows the created entity with the financial capacity and scale necessary to continue to invest and contribute to the development of competition through infrastructure, for the benefit of consumers and businesses.\n\nThrough this leadership in networks, customer satisfaction and enriched offers, Orange intends to improve average revenue per offer  (ARPO)  despite  difficult  macroeconomic  conditions  and intense competition.\n\nThe exceptional customer experience guided by the quality of its networks and of its digital interactions with customers has allowed the  Group  to  implement  its  value-oriented  strategy  (a  recent example of which is the targeted price increase) and convergence based on fiber and 5G networks. The consolidation of fixed and mobile services in Romania, Belgium and Spain will allow the Group's convergent customer base, which reached 11.9 million at end-2023. Orange has set itself the target of becoming the leader or on par - in customer satisfaction (NPS) in two-thirds (66%) of its geographical regions by 2025. In 2023, 60% of the branded Orange countries were NPS leaders or on par.\n\nLastly, with its sights firmly set on the usages of tomorrow, Lead the Future has capitalized on the expertise of researchers and other employees dedicated to innovation to build new services and applications such as Edge computing, virtualization of network operations, on-demand enterprise networks, the Wi-Fi of the future for the home, and services using generative AI.\n\n## Capitalizing on infrastructure in all the countries where the Group is active\n\n## Continuing the extension of very high-speed fixed and mobile broadband and increasing the value of Totem\n\nThe Group intends to continue to invest in the development of fixed and mobile networks within a responsible financial framework. To do so, Orange will continue to engage in strategic partnerships (radio access network (RAN) sharing and joint entities) to share financial costs and secure investments.\n\nAcross the fixed-line network, Orange continues to deploy, operate, and market fiber connections; by 2025, it plans to deploy five million additional  fiber  connections  compared  to  2022  in  Europe, where peak investment has already been reached, and 2 million connections in Africa & Middle East. Across the mobile network, Orange  has  increased  the  value  generated  from  its  passive infrastructure by aiming to achieve, in 2026, a third-party operator hosting rate of 1.5 for pylons owned by Totem, the Group's European TowerCo. Totem, a wholly owned Orange subsidiary, has all the strengths needed to be a key player in European consolidation.\n\nThe Group continues to modernize its fixed and mobile networks moving to very high-speed broadband with the decommissioning of the copper network in France and 2G and 3G networks in all its European countries by 2030. In Africa & Middle East, the Group's entities own a portfolio of nearly 30,000 towers over which they have long-term control, and which represent significant potential for value enhancement in the coming years. Orange continues to roll out fixed and mobile networks (4G and 5G), to enable solid growth in its results and to support the African continent's economic and social development.\n\n## Rolling out Network Integration Factories\n\nOrange intends to enhance the value of its infrastructures through technology and strengthen the use of data and AI to put in place a new industrial model for the management of its network: more effective,  more  resilient,  and  higher  performing.  Group-wide Network Integration Factories will also accelerate the automation and virtualization of network operations. They will also make it possible to offer new on-demand network services operating in 'Network-as-a-Service'  mode  (available  via  app  programming interfaces),  thus  creating  new  business  opportunities.  Lastly, they will increase the resilience and security of networks thanks to considerably faster operations of network restoration, security updates  or  anomaly  detection.  This  transformation  is  already contributing to optimizing capital and operating expenditure and reducing network electricity consumption by up to 20% (AI-assisted equipment standby, use of solar power at sites). (See Section 1.5.4 Network Integration Factory).\n\n## Transforming Orange Business to accelerate growth in the Enterprise segment and strengthen Orange's position in cybersecurity\n\n## Positioning Orange Business as the leader for next generation connectivity solutions\n\nThe  Internet,  the  Cloud  and  collaborative  software  have  all revolutionized companies' digital usage, for example through the shift away from fixed line telephony and private networks. These developments call into question the traditional B2B Telco operator model. With Lead the Future, Orange is profoundly transforming its model to adapt to the new realities of a market where the boundaries between networks and digital services are disappearing. Orange will  therefore  capitalize  on  its  unique  mastery  of  connectivity, security and resilience challenges.\n\nOrange Business will position itself as the leader for next generation connectivity  solutions.  This  ambition  is  rooted  in  its  globally recognized expertise in secure and trusted connectivity solutions which provide the foundation for companies' digital transformation. It will also rest on a re-focusing of the range of services it offers, the\n\n- 1\n\n1",

A large-scale employee training program supports this transformation.\n\nThis ambitious and demanding transformation plan is expected to enable Orange Business to return to growth in profitability (EBITDAaL) by 2025 at the latest.\n\n## Continuing the growth of Orange Cyberdefense to open up to new markets (B2C/micro-businesses)\n\nIn the cybersecurity sector, where the market is growing strongly, Orange has set itself the objective of becoming a European leader and is targeting revenues of 1.3 billion euros by 2025. Driven by the growing needs of both individuals and large businesses, the market is expected to experience double-digit growth over the coming years and the Group has already demonstrated its ability to outperform the market. With revenues of 1.1 billion euros at end-2023, an increase of 12.9% on a historical basis or 10.9% on a comparable basis, Orange Cyberdefense intends to continue with its organic growth and its strategy of targeted acquisitions, accelerate its push into the professional/ small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) segment, and enter new markets such as business to consumer (B2C).\n\n## Continuing to grow in Africa and the Middle East\n\n## Maintaining growth in the Africa & Middle East region\n\nThe Africa and Middle East region has been a growth driver for the Group for many years and remains at the heart of its strategy. There  is  significant  potential  in  this  region,  linked  to  strong demographics, the adoption of the Internet and increasing usage, the capture of which is made possible by the roll-out of networks and infrastructure. As the telecoms operator serving one in ten Africans, Orange intends to continue to invest in the deployment of its networks to further strengthen its position as a digital partner of reference in Africa and the Middle East. The Group has set the ambition of achieving average annual revenue growth above 7% between 2022 and 2025 as well as a significant increase in profitability over the same period.\n\n## Accelerating the transformation of Orange Money\n\nOn these solid foundations, the Group plans to accelerate the provision of services in the financial field (Orange Money, Orange Bank), content, energy, e-agriculture, health and B2B. Orange is thus accelerating the transformation of Orange Money toward a digital platform model that will offer other services in addition to transfers and payments. This will be offered to all consumers, whether or not they are Orange customers, across all the countries in which the Group is present. Following the success of its My Orange and Orange Money apps, Orange has launched its super-app Max it, which combines the telecommunications, financial services and e-commerce worlds, seeking to facilitate the everyday needs of its users. Developed by Orange teams in Africa for African customers, this new app was launched in 2023 in five countries. Since the end of 2022, Orange Money's revenues has returned to growth, driven by the increase in its customer base to more than 34 million active users and by the volume of transactions made using Orange Money's platforms, which exceeded 130 billion euros in value during the year.\n\n## Strengthening the Group's foothold\n\nOrange's  resilience  in  Africa  &  Middle  East,  fostered  by  the diversity of the countries in which it operates, its local ties and local management, demonstrates the Group's ability to operate in complex geographical regions and deal with geopolitical and macroeconomic issues. A local partner in Africa and the Middle East through a dedicated subsidiary, Orange will continue to invest in infrastructure and work to promote digital inclusion across the African continent. In line with its digital inclusion policy - from the provision of offers at attractive prices to digital training - the Group will strengthen its local ties and its position as a multi-service\n\noperator, in particular by continuing to roll out its 'Orange Digital Centers' and expanding Max it to the twelve other countries where Orange is present in Africa & Middle East.\n\n## A new company model guided by responsibility and efficiency\n\nThe  Group's  environment  is  undergoing  profound  changes and  Orange  is  therefore  facing  major  challenges  in  terms  of transformation. To overcome these challenges, Lead the Future will put in place a new company model guided by an ambitious policy of social and environmental responsibility.\n\n## Social and environmental responsibility\n\nEnvironmental and social issues profoundly change the way Orange manages its activities. Its achievements are already recognized by high ESG scores. Orange now aims to transform itself and develop a more efficient and resilient company model. This sustainable transformation is underpinned by three major areas of commitment: Environment, Trust and Digital Inclusion.\n\nIn terms of the environment, the Group faces multiple challenges: climate emergencies as well as structural changes, such as access to natural resources, legislation and regulations, and society's expectations. The long-term objective of being Net Zero Carbon in 2040 remains unchanged. The Group's main source of energy consumption comes from networks and information system (85% of the Group's energy consumption and 80% of its CO 2 emissions across scopes 1 and 2 in 2023). In 2023, the Green ITN program saved  nearly  1,150 GWh  of  electricity  and  99 million  liters  of fuel. At a time when the fight against global warming is a major concern for everyone, the Group intends to be a driving force in the environmental transition and has continued its program to reduce CO 2 emissions. At end-2023, Orange had already achieved its target (initially set for 2025) of reducing its scopes 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 30% compared with 2015, thanks to an increased share of renewable energies in its energy mix (notably through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and efforts to use solar power at its sites). The next steps toward achieving the Group's goal of being Net Zero Carbon in 2040 are to reduce scope 3 emissions by 14% in 2025 (compared to 2018), and to reduce emissions from all three scopes by 45% in 2030 (compared to 2020). Orange will also step up the roll-out of its European mobile device recycling program to reach 30% by 2025. The Group is also putting the eco-design of its products and services at the center of its decisions with the aim of reducing their environmental footprint from start to finish and promoting a circular economy in its processes and with its partners.\n\nThe Group's second area of commitment is to work toward building a society of trust, to aim to become the leader in cybersecurity in Europe and a key player in digital trust. To achieve this, the Group intends to develop Orange Cyberdefense, reaffirm its policy of protecting customers' personal data, promote the ethical use of AI and data (Code of Ethics, Positive AI initiative in France), raise awareness of responsible digital technology, and fight against cyberbullying.  The  Group  has  set  itself  the  target  of  offering cybersecurity services in every country in which it operates in 2030.\n\nLastly, convinced that digital technology is a powerful tool for inclusion, the Group has made it its third area of commitment. Its promise of digital inclusion and empowerment focuses on three areas: access to networks and services; accessibility of offers; and the development of digital skills. It has set itself the target of reaching 2.5 million beneficiaries of free digital training programs between 2021 and 2025, and 6 million cumulatively by 2030.\n\nGovernance and social and environmental responsibility, which are at the heart of all the Group's processes, are driven by the commitment of the Group's management team, part of whose compensation is linked to non-financial performance indicators. Orange is also continuing to align its financing policy with its environmental, social and governance commitments by introducing sustainable  financing  indexed  to  environmental  and/or  social performance indicators.",

        "page_content": "## A new company model\n\nThe success of Lead the Future is also linked to the development of the Group's company model: simpler, faster, more efficient. People, organizational agility and the simplification of processes are at the heart of this transformation. The objective is to improve operational efficiency at Group level and accentuate its industrial approach geared towards excellence.\n\nIn a world of disruptive technologies, the Group is investing in training and has proactive skills management based on anticipating needs. The Group facilitates employee development toward new roles in data, Cloud Computing, cybersecurity and AI.\n\nLastly, the Group continues to closely manage its costs. Orange has set itself the target of saving an additional 600 million euros by 2025, on a cost base of around 12 billion euros after the integration of VOO in Belgium. Cost savings of 300 million euros by 2023 demonstrate that the Group is on track to meet its target in 2025.\n\nHaving reached a peak, Orange is aiming to reduce investments (eCAPEX) from 18% of revenues to around 15% from 2023 and for the duration of the plan. This reduction is particularly centered on France and Europe, where most of the investments in fiber have already been made. All the same, Orange will continue to invest to further strengthen its network leadership.\n\nWithin the framework of Lead the Future, the Group has set its financial ambitions for 2025. These ambitions are based on clear objectives for return on investment and long-term value creation, with a view to ROCE growth of 100 to 150 basis points by 2025 compared to end-2022, with an increase of 80 basis points in 2023. Orange intends to rigorously manage its asset portfolio, pursue\n\n## 1.3 Significant  events\n\nSignificant  financial  events,  in  particular  changes  in  the  asset portfolio, are presented in Chapter 3 Financial performance, in Sections 3.1.1.3 Significant events and 3.2 Recent events.\n\n## Governance\n\nOn March 24, 2023, C\u00e9line Fornaro was appointed by ministerial decree as a member of the Orange Board of Directors to represent the French government, replacing St\u00e9phanie Besnier.\n\nOn May 23, 2023, the Orange Shareholders' Meeting approved the appointment of two new directors: Momar Nguer, replacing Jean-Michel  Severino,  and  Gilles  Grapinet,  replacing  Bernard Ramanantsoa (see Section 5.1.1 Board of Directors).\n\nIn February 2023, Orange presented Lead the future, its new strategic plan which aims to generate value from the recognized excellence of its core business and to grow sustainably in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Orange also confirms the repositioning of its Enterprise activities in next generation connectivity solutions and the acceleration in cybersecurity. Accompanying the plan is an ambitious new company model placing, at its heart, social and environmental responsibility and operational excellence. (see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy).\n\n- 1\n\nits carefully considered strategy in respect of acquisitions and partnerships, and maintain self-discipline in terms of managing its debt and its balance sheet.\n\n## 2025 financial objectives\n\nExcluding  ongoing  or  future  acquisitions,  the  Group's  2025 objectives include:\n\n- -low single digit growth in EBITDAaL (CAGR 2022-2025);\n- -discipline in eCAPEX;\n- -continued growth of organic cash flow from telecom activities to reach 4 billion euros in 2025;\n- -a ratio of net debt to EBITDAaL unchanged at 2x in the medium term;\n- -an increase in the ROCE in 2025 versus 2022.\n\nIn line with the solid growth in its organic cash flow, the Group expects to increase its dividend to 72 cents in respect of the 2023 fiscal year (payable in 2024), and to reach 75 cents in respect of the 2024 fiscal year (payable in 2025). This remains subject to the approval of the Shareholder Meeting.\n\nFor fiscal year 2025, in addition to the objectives presented at the Capital Markets Day, Orange has set a dividend floor of 0.75 euros per share.\n\nThe deconsolidation of Spain does not change the objectives of slight growth in EBITDAaL and discipline in eCAPEX. Organic cash flow, excluding Orange Espagne, will continue to grow by more than 300 million euros between 2023 (1) and 2025, reaching 3.3 billion euros in 2024 and 3.5 billion euros in 2025.\n\nTo  accelerate  the  Group's  transformation  and  development, Christel Heydemann has made changes to part of her management team  (see  Section 5.1.3  Executive  Committee).  And  as  part of  the  implementation  of  the  'New  Company  Model'  project, which is the core of the Lead the Future strategy, the Group's committee structure was reviewed with an eye to simplification and streamlining. The Group's governance is now supported by 11 key committees. (See Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees).\n\n## Capitalizing on the core business\n\n## Fixed-access networks\n\n## Partnership with Networth for the 'All Fibre' offer\n\nIn  March 2023  and  in  partnership  with  Networth,  Orange Wholesale France (OWF) - the Orange entity dedicated to the telecommunication  operator  market  in  France  -  launched  a complete voice over internet protocol (VoIP) telephony and fiber Internet connectivity offering called All Fibre. This offer is a turnkey solution  for  operators  without  a  network  or  service  platform operating in the professionals and very small businesses markets. It offers extensive national coverage and is simple, convenient, time-saving and cost-effective for telecommunication operators.\n\n1",

Thanks to Wi-Fi 6E, several devices can be connected simultaneously on one of the three spectrum bands available, for an ultra-high-performance connection with improved l atency. Livebox 7 is part of the eco-design approach recognized by Bureau Veritas's 'Footprint Progress' certification, a first for an Orange box in France. Bureau Veritas an internationally recognized certification body, focusing on the product's life cycle. Livebox 7 is designed to be easily repairable, with a 100% recycled and recyclable shell, and offers a standby mode option to reduce energy consumption.\n\n## Widespread roll-out of fiber optic by 2025\n\nIn  France ,  the  roll-out  of  the  FTTH  network  continued  at  a steady pace, and Orange consolidated its leadership with a total of 37.4 million households connectable to Orange fiber optic and 8.2 million customers at end-2023.\n\nOrange and the French government announced on November 7, 2023 that they had reached a tentative new agreement on the widespread deployment of fiber optic by 2025. In the AMII (Appel \u00e0 Manifestation d'Intention d'Investissement - call for expression of investment interest) zone, this new roll-out commitment will replace the 2022 milestone of the L. 33-13 commitments (i.e. the second milestone of the commitments made in 2018). This proposal is based on the following elements:\n\n- -by 2025, 1,120,000 premises in the entire AMII zone will be made connectable (which would represent 98.5% of connectable premises, including cases of blockage/refusal);\n- -by 2024, 140,000 premises within the perimeter of 55 intermunicipality cooperation zones with the lowest FTTH coverage.\n\nAlthough this agreement is based on new commitments, it extends the deadline for Orange to meet its commitments. The agreement has been submitted to Arcep and the French government has accepted the commitments taken in Orange's proposal by decision dated March 14, 2024.\n\nIn addition, a government order incorporating the terms of Orange's commitment could be published following an advisory opinion from Arcep (Autorit\u00e9 de R\u00e9gulation des Communications Electroniques, des Postes et de la Distribution de la Presse - the French Electronic Communications, Postal and Print Media Distribution Regulatory Authority), and may entail additional obligations.\n\nThe  roll-out  of  FTTH  networks  is  also  continuing in  Europe (excluding France), where Orange had more than 30.2 million households connected at end-2023 (including 16.8 million in Spain and 8.0 million in Poland) and 6.0 million customers (including 3.6 million in Spain and 1.3 million in Poland).\n\nIn Africa & Middle East , at end-2023, the Group had connected 4.1 million homes to FTTH in Morocco, Jordan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Guinea. Orange has stepped up its fiber roll-out and had 1.2 million customers at end-December 2023.\n\n## 2024 -2028 Framework for the regulation of fixed networks in France\n\nOn December 18, 2023 in France, Arcep published the framework for the regulation of fixed networks for the years 2024 to 2028, aimed in particular at defining the framework for unbundling and civil engineering access rates. On this occasion, Orange obtained an increase in its rates.\n\n## Mobile-access networks\n\nOrange's 5G is now marketed in a non-standalone (NSA) version (in other words based on a 5G spectrum but using a 4G core and an additional 4G anchor frequency band) in six countries in Europe (France, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain). It is initially being rolled out in urban areas where 4G is in high demand, and in areas with high levels of economic activity, as a complement to the other networks. In 2023, Spain and Belgium launched their 5G standalone (SA) network . The other four European countries that  have  already  rolled  out  5G  NSA  will  commission  5G SA between 2024 and 2025.\n\nIn Africa & Middle East, Orange is pursuing a 4G roll-out strategy and is investing in all countries to upgrade and extend their access networks. The first 5G roll-outs took place in 2022, continued in 2023, and Orange is seeking to accelerate to cover almost the entire region by 2025.\n\nIn March 2023, Orange borrowed 500 million euros from the European Investment Bank (EIB) to help finance in France the rollout of its 5G mobile network and the reinforcement of its 4G mobile network capacity in rural areas. This financing is part of the roadmap of Orange's new strategic plan, which aims, among other things, to capitalize on the Group's infrastructure in order to consolidate Orange's leading position in terms of quality of service and networks.\n\nIn October 2023, the results of Arcep's annual survey on the quality of the mobile services of French telecoms operators confirmed for  the  thirteenth  consecutive  year  that  Orange  remains  the leader in voice, SMS and data, coming in first or tied for first in all 278 performance criteria measured. These results are a testament to the expertise and ongoing commitment of the teams to more efficient and more responsible networks.\n\n## Satellites\n\nIn March 2023, Orange announced that it had signed a distribution agreement with OneWeb (a low earth orbit satellite communications company) aimed at improving and expanding the Group's global connectivity, particularly in rural and remote areas of Europe, Latin America and Africa. Thanks to this partnership, Orange will be able to offer telecommunication operators and businesses an enhanced connectivity offer incorporating OneWeb's LEO (Low Earth Orbit) solution, making it possible to connect, with improved latency, hard-to-reach areas that could not be served until now. Other benefits of this partnership include increased resilience and geographical coverage of B2B and backhaul solutions in these remote areas.\n\nIn November 2023, Orange launched its Satellite offer, expanding its range of very high-speed broadband connectivity solutions to include satellite in its technological mix, in addition to fiber, ADSL, 4G Home and 5G Home. This new offer, marketed through Orange distribution channels, is operated by Nordnet, a Group subsidiary that has specialized in satellite Internet for 15 years. It is part of the French government's Coh\u00e9sion Num\u00e9rique des Territoires (Digital Regional Cohesion) program, and meets the government's objective of guaranteeing very high-speed broadband access for everyone by 2025. It relies on the Eutelsat Konnect VHTS satellite, designed by Thal\u00e8s Alenia Space and launched in September 2022 by Ariane 5. This offer allows its most remotely located B2C and business customers to benefit from a very high-speed broadband experience (theoretically up to 200 Mbit/s downstream and 15 Mbit/s upstream) for the price of a fiber-optic offer.\n\nIn 2023, Orange was selected to participate in the IRIS (1) industrial consortium  for  the  sovereign  European  satellite  constellation project, which will contribute to the objectives of the European Union's  digital  policy  and  Global Gateway  strategy.  The  main objective  is  to  provide  European  Union  member  states  with guaranteed access to secure, sovereign connectivity services on a global scale, and to offer a commercial infrastructure that allows for seamless broadband connectivity.",

        "page_content": "## Submarine cable\n\nThe Group continued to make substantial investments in international connectivity projects. In April 2023, Orange announced the roll-out of a new submarine cable linking Tunisia and France, co-financed by the European Commission as part of the 'Connecting Europe Facility' (CEF) mechanism. The 1,050-kilometer cable is due to be commissioned at the end of 2025. Named Via Tunisia, this cable is part of the Medusa submarine cable system in the Mediterranean Sea. The entry into force of the construction contract for Via Tunisia was announced in July 2023.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Dunant  mega-submarine  cable,  which  was commissioned in January 2021, the Amiti\u00e9 transatlantic submarine cable between New York and Europe, commissioned at the end of 2023, allows Orange to offer a unique, robust, ultra-low-latency transatlantic  solution  between  the  two  continents.  In  France, Orange is in charge of operating and maintaining the system's landing point, and also provides all Amiti\u00e9 cable partners with the  terrestrial  infrastructure  required  for  its  smooth  operation, from the limit of French territorial waters to the new Equinix data center in Bordeaux. Orange also offers its wholesale and business customers  connectivity  from  the  United  States  to  European hotspots thanks to the density of its European network, either in dark fiber or via its state-of-the-art WDM optical transport network, and in particular the main European hubs: Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid, Amsterdam,  and  London.  The  routes  between  Bordeaux  and Marseille have been strengthened, to offer the most direct and efficient solution for connecting Africa & Middle East and Asia directly to the United States. From its design to its construction, the Amiti\u00e9 cable incorporates stringent environmental protection requirements. Lastly, by rolling out the latest optical fiber and transport technologies, the energy cost per megabit transported has been significantly reduced.\n\nIn September 2023  in  La  Seyne-sur-Mer,  Orange  Marine inaugurated the Sophie Germain, its new cable-laying ship. By investing in the construction of a state-of-the-art ship, Orange Marine is strengthening its position as a major player in submarine cable surveying, laying, repair and maintenance activities worldwide. Submarine  cables  play  a  major  role  in  telecommunications, as they enable the transit of 99% of intercontinental telephone communications and data transfers. This investment is a testament to the Group's determination to play a major role in long-distance network  infrastructure,  with  guaranteed  global  connectivity  as its compass. The ship's modern, high-performance design and equipment allow it to operate more efficiently at sea and reduce its environmental footprint.\n\n## Capitalizing on infrastructure\n\nIn February 2023, Orange and Vodafone announced that they would cooperate to build and share an Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) in rural areas of Europe where both operators have mobile networks. In mid-2023, Orange activated its first 4G (and soon 2G) Open RAN sites via a commercial network pilot in a rural area of Romania, sharing a network with Vodafone. This agreement, which is a first in Europe, demonstrates the two operators' commitment to rolling out this technology for future mobile networks in Europe and also to supporting the European Commission's goal of rolling out 5G to all populated areas by 2030. Thanks to this new operating model based on the integration of multi-provider equipment and software, Orange and Vodafone each benefit from greater agility when adding new radio sites or upgrading existing ones, while minimizing costs and energy consumption.\n\n- 1\n\nIn April 2023, Totem, Orange's European TowerCo, announced the roll-out of a next-generation 5G network within the Orange V\u00e9lodrome stadium in Marseille, to meet the expectations of the public, organizers and media for various sporting events. The four French telecommunication operators have been able to connect their equipment to the antenna infrastructure rolled out by Totem. Next-generation antennas have been developed for these locations with high mobile usage density, offering consistent high-quality network coverage and high energy efficiency.\n\nOrange implemented its technological expertise and capacity for innovation to connect the planet to the Rugby World Cup 2023. Working  hard  for  over  two-and-a-half  years,  Orange  teams provided  all  the  connectivity  required  for  the  tournament,  in particular through a secure very high-speed broadband image transport network (Broadcast Contribution Network), and offered immersive augmented reality experiences thanks to highly realistic 3D modeling. In order to minimize the environmental footprint of the network infrastructure rolled out for the competition, all installations will be reused for other events or left permanently. Precious metals from over 206,000 telephones were recycled to produce the nearly 1,500 recycled medals given to players.\n\nIn 2023, Orange was appointed coordinator of the FranceQCI consortium, which includes Airbus, CNRS, Cryptonext Security, France's Directorate General for Civil Aviation, Orange, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris, Thales, Thales Alenia Space, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur, Veriqloud and Welinq. As part of the Digital Europe program, this project represents a significant contribution in France to the objective of rolling out a secure quantum communication infrastructure for the EU (EuroQCI), and paves the way for the future European Quantum Information Network (QIN).\n\n## Transforming Orange Business and strengthening cybersecurity\n\n## Orange Business transformation plan\n\nIn  March 2023,  Orange  Business  presented  the  operational implementation  of  its  strategic  priorities  to  the  employee representative  bodies.  This  plan  carries  a  strong  ambition  to transform  and  simplify  Orange  Business,  whose  market  is undergoing profound changes, toward a Digital Services Company (DSC) model. The simplification of the Orange Business product portfolio is on track to halve the number of products and services marketed in the first quarter of 2024. The training and retraining plan  for  key  digital  professions  (virtualization,  Cloud,  data,  AI and  cybersecurity)  resulted  in  11,408 certifications  out  of  the 20,000 targeted by 2025. Lastly, a provision was booked in the 2023 financial statements for the voluntary departure plan, to be implemented in 2024. (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events and Note 5.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Digital transformation of the business customer and cybersecurity solutions\n\nTo meet the expectations of businesses, particularly those related to the refocusing of their needs, Orange Business combines the expertise of a network operator with that of a DSC. With this in mind, and drawing on its secure, digitized infrastructure, Orange Business is focusing its expertise on five value propositions offering end-to-end solutions and combining networks, Cloud, security, data and AI.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\n## Partnership with Palo Alto Networks\n\nTo this end, in June 2023 Orange Business, Orange Cyberdefense and Palo Alto Networks, a global leader in cybersecurity services, announced a new collaboration to deliver a managed Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solution that seeks to meet business requirements for network and security, high performance, simplicity and Zero Trust 2.0 network access.This product seeks to meet the needs of businesses looking for agility and whose infrastructure is oriented toward the Cloud, while providing a high level of security.\n\n## Launch of the Mobile Private Network hybrid solution\n\nIn  July 2023,  Orange  unveiled  its  first  hybrid  private  mobile network, allowing businesses to access both private and public networks simultaneously. The Mobile Private Network hybrid is a two-in-one solution: it provides simultaneous access to both a private network and a public network, Orange France's commercial mobile network. Relying on 5G Stand-Alone (5G SA) technology and utilizing Network Slicing, Edge Computing and Local Break Out functionalities, the solution proposed by Orange Business allows companies to benefit from the advantages of a private network (performance, low and stable latencies, enhanced data security) and the support of existing operator infrastructure.\n\n## Launch of the Flexible SD-WAN solution integrated into Evolution Platform\n\nIn November 2023,  Orange  Business  announced  it  was strengthening its partnership with VMware by launching the Flexible SD-WAN solution integrated into Evolution Platform. The platform allows companies to define their own combination of services to meet their different needs, while benefiting from Orange Business's top-notch infrastructure and expertise. The platform's automation and service chaining simplify digital infrastructure management, guaranteeing secure user-to-Cloud and Cloud-to-Cloud connectivity, and better integration with unified communications services.\n\n## Commercial launch of Bleu, the future trust Cloud platform\n\nAfter  receiving  approval  from  the  European  Commission  in June 2023,  in  mid-January 2024  Orange  and  Capgemini announced the commercial launch of Bleu in strategic partnership with Microsoft. The platform is expected to be launched at the end of 2024 or later on a set of geographically distributed datacenters in France, meeting the most demanding requirements in terms of resilience and availability. The trust Cloud (1) platform project aims to meet the specific needs of the French government, local authorities, hospitals and healthcare facilities, and public or private entities recognized as Operators of Vital Importance (Op\u00e9rateurs d'Importance  Vitale,  OIV)  or  Operators  of  Essential  Services (Op\u00e9rateurs de Services Essentiels, OSE), allowing them to use Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Azure services. Bleu is aiming for SecNumCloud 3.2 qualification for its services in 2025.\n\nFor Orange Business acquisitions , see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events - Changes in the asset portfolio.\n\n## Pursuing growth in Africa & Middle East countries\n\n## Strategic partnerships\n\nIn June 2023, Orange Africa & Middle East and Digital Africa signed  a  strategic  partnership  to  strengthen  the  support  and growth of African start-ups in the 'Orange Digital Centers' network. Selected start-ups can access a range of resources, including mentoring programs, technical assistance, funding, and networking\n\nopportunities through the Orange Digital Center (ODC) and the Digital Africa community.\n\nIn October 2023, Orange entered into a strategic partnership with start-up Koolboks to bring freezing and refrigeration solutions to 12 African countries through a single piece of equipment. This partnership falls within the scope of its new Orange Energies business, whose ambition is to make digital technology a lever for  energy  inclusion.  With  its  Orange  Smart  Energies  digital platform, Orange Energies allows households not connected to electricity to use its pay-as-you-go service to acquire solar energy solutions; and with the Orange Money service, these households can pay for and become owners of solar installations and the equipment connected to them. In this way, Orange contributes to the development of income-generating activities (IGA) in rural areas through clean electrification solutions, in line with the United Nations' 7th Sustainable Development Goal.\n\n## Launch of the Max it app\n\nAt the end of November 2023, Orange launched an app designed to be a true mobile services portal, making life and the digital experience easier for all users on the continent, whether Orange customers or not. Max it brings together three essential service offers  in  a  single  smartphone  interface:  telecoms  features  for managing mobile and fixed lines; Orange Money, with all local and  international  money  transfer  services,  payments  to  billing and merchant partners, credit and savings; and an e-commerce universe offering digital content services (online games, music, TV, videos, news, etc.) as well as innovative digital ticketing. The app has already been downloaded 10 million times. Developed by Orange teams in Africa for African customers, this new app is being launched in five countries (Cameroon, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Botswana) and will be expanded in 2024 to the 12 other countries where Orange is present in Africa & Middle East.\n\n## A responsible and efficient business model\n\n## Implementation of the new business model\n\n## AI at the heart of innovation to accelerate transformation\n\nOrange is placing AI at the heart of its innovation model to support the company's growth as well as its social and environmental objectives,  focusing  on  three  major  areas:  making  networks smarter,  improving  operational  efficiency  and  reinventing  the customer experience. Automation with AI not only reduces energy consumption, but also optimizes network planning and investment decisions, and allows for faster analysis of the causes of incidents, thus improving preventive maintenance. Orange also uses AI to fine-tune marketing forecasts and anticipate the relevance of offers for customers, making revenue forecasts more reliable. In 2023, the Innovation teams developed an in-house Generative AI tool that incorporates the best AI models available, allowing employees to use it in their daily activities. In order to develop key skills around AI within all the Group's business lines, Orange offers its employees a comprehensive range of training courses (see Sections 1.5 Orange networks and 1.6 Research and Development).\n\n## A new brand signature: 'Orange is there'\n\nIn early January 2024, the Orange group launched a new brand signature to better reflect its commitment to being a trusted partner that is there for its customers at every stage of their journey and in any circumstance. This new approach underscores the importance the Group places on the quality of customer relations and meeting their  needs.  It  also  highlights  the  commitment  of  Orange's employees. These three words express the Group's commitment to greater proximity, accessibility and simplicity.",

        "page_content": "## Orange's sustainability commitment\n\n## Sustainable finance\n\nIn June 2023, Orange SA published its first sustainable financing charter  indexed  to  environmental  and/or  CSR  performance indicators, known  as  the  Sustainability-Linked  Financing Framework. In this way, Orange is continuing to align its financing policy with its environmental, social and governance commitments, as it has reaffirmed in the new Lead the Future strategic plan. Orange is further committed to reducing the impact of its activities on climate change and resource depletion, to supporting a more inclusive society where digital technology is a powerful driver of economic and social development, and to gender equality.\n\nIn September 2023, Orange successfully completed its inaugural sustainability-linked  bond  issuance,  for  a  nominal  amount  of 500 million euros. The bonds are linked to the Group's target of a 45% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2030 (compared to 2020) and its commitment to provide digital support and training to external beneficiaries (6 million beneficiaries cumulatively between 2021 and 2030). This enables Orange to extend the maturity of its debt and diversify its sources of financing on optimal terms. With an oversubscription of five times, this bond issue was very well received by the markets, demonstrating their confidence in the Group's financial strength, strategy and ability to achieve its ESG goals.\n\n## Achieving sustainability targets\n\nIn terms of the environment, the Group has exceeded its target of reducing its scopes 1 and 2 CO 2 emissions by 30% in 2025 compared to 2015, two years ahead of schedule, with a 37.4% decrease in emissions in 2023 thanks to the increased share of\n\n## 1.4 Operating  activities\n\nOrange  provides  B2C  and  B2B  customers  and  other telecommunication operators with a wide range of connectivity services,  such  as  fixed  and  mobile  telecommunications,  data transmission and other value-added services, including Mobile Financial  Services.  The  Group  is  present  as  an  operator  in 26 countries. In addition to its role as a supplier of connectivity, the Group provides enterprise services, primarily solutions in the fields of digital work, security and improving business line processes. As part of its global approach to development, it also offers access to  some  services  (financial,  energy,  health,  education)  aiming at covering the essential needs of populations by leveraging its connectivity offer (see Section 4.3.3.4.5 Offering inclusive services that complement connectivity).\n\n- 1\n\nrenewable  energies  in  its  energy  mix  (notably  through  Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and efforts to use solar power at its sites). In 2023, the Green ITN program saved nearly 1,150 GWh of electricity and 99 million liters of fuel. The program to recover devices from customers has already reached its 2025 target of 30% in France, and is set to accelerate in Europe.\n\nIn terms of digital inclusion, the number of beneficiaries of the free  training  programs  offered  by  Orange  to  develop  digital skills increased by 45% in 2023. With 1.8 million people trained cumulatively by the end of 2023, the Group is on track to achieve its target of 2.5 million people trained between 2021 and 2025.\n\nIn terms of diversity, the proportion of women in the management network rose by 1 point to 34.1%.\n\n## Integrating sustainability into the business model\n\nOrange  has  chosen  to  produce  its  2023  Statement  of  NonFinancial  Performance  by  adopting  early  the  structure  of  the future sustainability report required under the European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), in order to prepare for this new framework which will be applicable to Orange in 2025 for the 2024 report. For Orange, the rationale for using this approach was  not  to  try  to  comply  with  ESRS  (European  Sustainability Reporting Standards), nor to adapt its data collection and internal control processes to future requirements, but to prepare for them.\n\nOrange  has  redefined  its  business  model  to  incorporate sustainability issues (see Sections 1.2.1.1 Integrated business model and 1.2.1.2 Value creation model) and has described its value chain (see Section 1.2.1.4 Description of the value chain). The analysis of non-financial performance has thus been redefined and developed (see Chapter 4 Consolidated sustainability information).\n\nFor consistency with the segment information in the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group's activities are presented below by business segment (or group of segments): France, Europe, Africa & Middle East, Orange Business, Totem (1) , International Carriers & Shared Services, and Mobile Financial Services.\n\nThe results of Orange's activities in 2023 and its principal operating indicators in its various business segments are set out in Section 3.1 Review of the Group's financial position and results. Information on the business segments' performance and objectives is also available in Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the market shares indicated in this chapter relate to market shares in terms of volume, and the data related to customers does not include SIM cards dedicated to connected devices (Machine to Machine - M2M).\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\n## 1.4.1 France\n\nOrange  is  France's  incumbent  telecommunication  operator (see Section 1.1.3 History). The bulk of its business is carried by Orange SA, which is also the parent company of the Orange group.\n\nThe  France  business  segment  includes  all  fixed  and  mobile communication services to individuals and companies with fewer than 50 employees (1) in France (2) as well as wholesale services. Activities developed for companies with more than 50 employees, content activities and Mobile Financial Services are covered in Sections 1.4.4, 1.4.6 and 1.4.7 of this document.\n\nIn 2023, the France business segment generated 38.5% of the Group's consolidated revenues.\n\n## The market\n\nIn the first nine months of 2023, telecommunication operators' revenues on the retail market rose by +2.2% on an annual basis (source: Arcep, third quarter 2023). In volume terms, however, market growth is decelerating.\n\nWhile  fixed  narrowband  telephony  revenues  continued  their downward trend as a result of the steady decline in the number of  copper  network  lines,  fixed  broadband  telephony  revenues continued to grow due to the increasing number of accesses. This growth was driven by the rapid development of FTTH. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, 20.6 million customer accesses were connected to FTTH, which represents year-on-year growth of 3.4 million, compared with year-on-year growth of 3.7 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022 (source: Arcep, third quarter 2023).\n\nAt September 30, 2023, revenues from mobile services on the retail market had also risen by 3.0% in the first nine months (source: Arcep, third quarter 2023).\n\nThe French broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet market is dominated by four main operators, which account for over 96% of broadband customers. Orange's market share was virtually stable in 2023, at 39.0% in the third quarter of 2023, and Orange remains the leader on this market, ahead of Free, Altice-SFR and Bouygues Telecom (ranked second, third and fourth, respectively, by number of customers) (Source: Orange estimates).\n\nThe French mobile market is dominated by the same four operators as the fixed market, which account for 93% of mobile customers. With a market share estimated at 33.1% in the third quarter of 2023, Orange has maintained its position and remains the leader on this segment as well, ahead of competitors Altice-SFR, Bouygues Telecom and Free (ranked second, third and fourth, respectively, by number of mobile customers) and all MVNOs (Source: Orange estimates).\n\n## Orange's business activities\n\nOrange France's core business involves the provision of fixed telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet and mobile telephony services for the B2C and Pro-SME markets. Its strategy is based on greater bandwidth in fixed (fiber) and mobile (4G and 5G) networks, promoting the take-up of new services and conquering new areas of growth, while continuing to transform its Customer Relations (see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy).\n\n## Mobile\n\nIn the B2C mobile market, Orange segments its offers into several ranges covering all customers, from those looking for just the essentials in terms of communications or Internet connectivity to those wanting the best smartphones and who have very intense connectivity uses in France and internationally. The Orange brand has six offers for the mobile market, four of which are compatible with 5G technology.\n\nOrange  is  present  on  all  market  segments,  including  on  the entry-level  market.  In  addition  to  the  Orange  brand,  Orange France also proposes under the Sosh brand several types of mobile subscriptions at attractive prices, only available online, with no commitment and no handset. Since June 2023, 5G has been marketed on Sosh. At the end of December 2023, Sosh had 4.8 million mobile customers.\n\nSince 2015, all the offers sold by Orange are at least 4G compatible, including entry-level market offers. Since 2020, some of these offers are also 5G compatible. Orange is continuing its family focused strategy with the development of multi-line plans through its flagship I+M (Open) offer. I+M (Open) mobile offers are available in the same ranges as conventional mobile offers and include the same levels of service.\n\nSegmenting offers on the B2C and Pro-SME markets allows Orange to continue to grow its subscriber base while the decline in prepaid services continues (see Section 3.1.3.1.5 Additional information France). At the same time, the MVNO customer base hosted on the Orange network reached more than 1 million customers at endDecember 2023, down slightly from end-2022 due to the acquisition of two MVNOs by Bouygues T\u00e9l\u00e9com and SFR.\n\n## Fixed telephony and Internet\n\nIn the B2C broadband Internet market, Orange segments its offers into three main categories: Livebox, aimed at customers looking for Internet and TV essentials; Livebox Up, which meets the needs of those wanting the best speeds and a premium TV experience; and, lastly, Livebox Max, which adds in a premium WiFi service. In October 2023, Orange updated this offer with Livebox 7, a new box compatible with Wi-Fi 6E and with speeds of 5 Gbit/s. Livebox 6 and Wi-Fi 6E are now part of the Livebox Up offer.\n\nSosh has also been present on the broadband Internet market since 2018, with affordable offers, available exclusively online and with no commitment.\n\nThe  Orange  and  Sosh  broadband  Internet  access  offers  are marketed using FTTH technology in eligible areas, or otherwise ADSL. Orange is the market leader in terms of the number of FTTH accesses sold, with a total of more than 8.2 million subscribers at end-2023 over a scope including B2C, professionals and small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nWith the steady growth in full unbundling, as well as wholesale subscriptions and naked ADSL access to third-party Internet service providers, the decline in revenues generated by the conventional telephony service business continues.\n\nSince  November 27,  2020,  Orange  is  no  longer  the  operator responsible for providing universal services including connection to a fixed network and telephony service (see Section 1.7.2.3 Regulation of fixed telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet).",

In  turn,  it  purchases  these  services  from third-party operators for Orange France and its end-customers. The Group is the leader on this market in France. Its main rivals are other network operators as well as infrastructure operators, such as Altitude and Axione.\n\nThe OWF business includes the interconnection of competitive operators, wholesale subscription and traffic services (ADSL and fiber) regulated by Arcep (see Section 1.7.2.3 Regulation of fixed telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet) and the construction and marketing of very high-speed broadband fiber optic networks.\n\nThe unbundling of access to the copper network is a structurally declining business due to the gradual closure of this network (see The network section below). The fiber network is marketed to rival operators according to two methods: leasing or co-financing of lines. Co-financing requires a basic investment for third-party operators, plus recurring maintenance fees. After having increased significantly  in  2020,  revenues  from  co-financing  have  been decreasing since 2021 as the fiber roll-out reached maturity. The timing of co-financing payments to be received by Orange is highly dependent on the purchasing strategies of third-party operators in connection with the development of fiber and the policies of investment funds.\n\nOn December 18, 2023, Arcep published the regulatory framework for fixed networks for 2024 to 2028, aimed at defining the framework for unbundling rates and access to civil engineering, while enabling Orange to increase its rates.\n\nLastly, since 2011, Orange has been providing Free Mobile with a nationwide roaming service on its 2G and 3G networks. That service was extended until the end of 2025. See Section 1.7.2.2 Regulation of mobile telephony - Infrastructure sharing.\n\n## Distribution\n\nSince 2020 and the Covid-19 health crisis, the sales channel mix has been deeply disrupted.\n\nOrange France is pressing ahead with its digital development strategy, with a fully digital customer experience in Orange online stores (available on Orange.fr) and Sosh (via Sosh.fr), with Sosh offers only available on the digital channel. In 2023, the number of sales made through the digital channel decreased by 0.3% compared to 2022, mainly due to changes in consumer habits. They account for one-third of all sales.\n\nThe dedicated customer call centers based on the type of services marketed account for 18% of sales. Their number decreased by 10% compared to the same period in 2022.\n\nThe network of retail stores across France consisted of more than 500 stores at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. Retail stores accounted for 44% of sales year on year. The volume of sales made through this channel fell by 2% compared to 2022.\n\nLastly, the number of sales made through other channels, such as direct marketing, door-to-door and the multi-operator network, decreased by 10% compared to 2022. They account for 5% of overall sales volumes.\n\n## The network\n\nOrange's commercial leadership is built partly on its leadership in fixed and mobile networks.\n\nOrange continued to roll out its fiber optic network at a steady pace in 2023. In France, the Group gave nearly 3.9 million additional premises access to Orange FTTH during the year (after nearly 5 million in 2022). At end-2023, just under 37.4 million premises were connectable to Orange fiber, a number that includes fiber rolled out to Orange's own networks and third-party networks. According to the observatory report on subscriptions and the roll-out of high-speed and very high-speed broadband (Observatoire des abonnements et d\u00e9ploiements du haut et tr\u00e8s haut d\u00e9bit) (source: Arcep, third quarter 2023), more than 18 million (i.e. nearly 49%) of the total connectable premises in France owe their connectability to Orange as an infrastructure operator (own infrastructure). This data does not take into account the networks built and operated by Orange Concessions in Public Initiative Networks (PIN) regions (see below).\n\nOn  January 31,  2022,  Orange  submitted  a  copper  network switch-off plan to Arcep. Arcep published the plan for public consultation from February 7 to April 4, 2022, and then on July 29, 2022  published  a  Q&A  document  with  the  clarifications  and adjustments Orange had made to the plan. The plan states that, during the first phase of the transition, which began in 2020 and will continue until the fiber network roll-out is completed in 2025, copper connection sales will be discontinued on a case by case basis insofar as the four telecom operators have rolled out fiber up to the base point. At the end of 2022, sales had been discontinued on nearly 20 million copper connections. This phase also includes switch-off experiments on a few hundred thousand premises. The first batch of switch-offs was thus launched on December 13, 2022, with the actual shut-off expected in January 2025. From 2026, Orange will no longer sell new ADSL subscriptions and the large-scale switch-off of the copper network will begin. By 2030, it will concern the entire network.\n\nFor the mobile network, the roll-out of 4G continued, with an unchanged coverage rate of 99% of the French population, still the best 4G rate in the country (source: Orange estimates). At January 1, 2024, Orange had 31,916 authorized 4G sites in France (1) (source: Observatoire ANFr (French national spectrum agency observatory), January 1, 2024).\n\nFor the thirteenth consecutive time, Orange's mobile network was ranked number one by Arcep in 2023 (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nOn  the  5G  side,  at  January 1,  2024,  France  had  43,673 5G sites authorized by ANFr, of which 21,295 sites were technically operational in the 3.5 GHz spectrum. Orange operates 8,711 of these sites (source: Observatoire ANFr (French national spectrum agency observatory), January 1, 2024). Since November 2016, the spectrum managers of the European Union Member States have recommended the use of the 3.5 GHz band as the primary band for the introduction of 5G.\n\nIn March 2022, Orange announced the phasing out of its 2G and 3G mobile networks by 2030 in all countries where the Group is present in the European Union.\n\n## Orange Concessions\n\nIn 2021, to continue to roll out fiber in rural areas and enhance its  infrastructure,  Orange  consolidated  the  24 Public  Initiative Networks  (PINs)  governed  by  contracts  with  local  authorities, in mainland France and in French Overseas Territories, into one entity, Orange Concessions. For this project, it joined forces with long-term, well-known investors in both infrastructure and local development. Orange Concessions is 50/50 owned by Orange and the HIN consortium comprising La Banque des Territoires (Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations), CNP Assurances and EDF Invest.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

Assisting local authorities in the digital planning of their territory, it oversees the design, construction and operation of fiber networks, relying on Orange as the leading industrial partner, and handles the marketing to all commercial operators (ISP) in order to offer fiber\n\n## 1.4.2 Europe\n\nOutside France, the Group operates in seven countries in Europe, where it is implementing its convergence strategy based on the local context and drawing on the strengths of its subsidiaries:\n\n- -in Spain, where the Group is number two in the fixed and mobile markets, and where it created a joint venture with M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil to combine their Spanish activities;\n- -in Poland, where the Group is the incumbent operator, leader in fixed-line and number two in mobile;\n- -in Belgium and Luxembourg, where the Group launched its convergent offers via partnerships and acquired 75% minus one share in VOO SA; and\n- -in  other  Central  European  countries  (Romania,  Slovakia and Moldova), where the Group, as the leader in the mobile segment, is a convergent player through the roll-out of fiber and its partnerships or acquisitions.\n\nIn 2023, the Europe segment represented 25.9% of the Group's consolidated revenues.\n\n## 1.4.2.1 Spain\n\nThe Group has been present in Spain since the deregulation of the telecommunication market in 1998. Initially operating in the fixed telephony market, it acquired mobile telephony operator Amena in 2005 before adopting the Orange brand in 2006. The acquisition of fixed telephony operator Jazztel in 2015 enabled Orange to consolidate its position in terms of convergence, thanks to Jazztel's fiber coverage. In 2021, Orange Espagne consolidated its brand portfolio to focus on Orange, Jazztel and Simyo. In 2022, Orange and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil signed an agreement to combine their activities in Spain. In February 2024, the European Commission approved the Orange and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil joint venture project. This favorable decision takes into account the specific features of the highly competitive Spanish market and provides balanced remedies for an existing operator. The agreement allowed the creation in March 2024 of a company controlled equally by Orange and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil, with equal governance rights at the level of the combined entity, which will have the financial capacity to continue to invest in the development of Spanish telecom infrastructure.\n\nIn 2023, the Group generated 10.5% of its consolidated revenues in Spain.\n\n## The market\n\nSince the consolidation that began in 2014, four operators have dominated the telecom market: Telef\u00f3nica, the incumbent operator, which acquired D+ in 2014 and operates under the Movistar brand; Orange; Vodafone, which acquired ONO in 2014; and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil Ibercom, initially an MVNO, which acquired Yoigo in 2016 and then signed a commercial agreement for access to Orange's fixed and mobile networks, before acquiring Euskaltel in 2021.\n\nto their end-customers. Orange Concessions continues to roll out fiber in rural areas in France while sharing the investment effort with its shareholders.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Orange Concessions had made 3.4 million households  connectable  to  fiber  and  had  nearly  1.5 million connected customers. By 2026, the joint venture is expected to be operating nearly 4.6 million FTTH accesses, which will make it the leading infrastructure operator on Public Initiative Networks.\n\nIn addition to competing in the B2B and B2C segments through their main brands, these four operators also compete via other brands in the low-cost market: Orange with Jazztel and Simyo; Telef\u00f3nica with Tuenti and O2; Vodafone with Lowi; and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil with Pepephone and Euskaltel.\n\nTogether, the four convergent operators have a combined market share of over 90%, with Telef\u00f3nica ranked first, followed by Orange (whose market share in the second quarter 2023 reached 19.6% for broadband Internet and 24.2% for mobile), then Vodafone (source: CNMC).\n\nIn 2023, the Spanish market was marked by continued growth in the low-cost offer market segment.\n\n## Orange's activities in Spain\n\nIn a particularly competitive Spanish market, Orange Espagne's priority in 2023 was to build on its growth by focusing on value management and a disciplined promotions policy. Its fixed and mobile networks have been major differentiators, for example due to the launch in February of 5G+ (5G SA network), already rolled out in 51 towns and cities.\n\nIn this market, where volume growth is mainly in the low-cost segment, Orange Espagne has continued to create value with full market coverage. This is particularly true of the Orange brand in the premium segment (5G, soccer), where Orange is Movistar's only significant competitor. Orange is also expanding in the entry-level and mid-range segments, owing to its fixed and mobile networks and its ability to adapt its cost structure.\n\nIn  2023,  Orange  Espagne  launched  the  'Servicio  impecable' program to significantly enhance the customer experience. It also continued to improve and simplify its IT systems and tools. Orange is a pioneer in Spain in the use of virtual robots, particularly in the context of improving its customer processes. In December 2023, Orange also launched a new channel on WhatsApp to share its offers and news more widely with the country's population, irrespective of whether they are existing customers.\n\nOrange Espagne has also accelerated its growth in B2B, particularly in the key accounts segment, with the addition of Adif, Port de Barcelona,  Ayuntamiento  de  Madrid,  Junta  de  Extremadura, Bosch, ING, Decathlon, Ibercaja, Iberdrola and Pelayo. Orange has continued to innovate for its B2B customers, for example through the use of its 5G SA network and a partnership with Ericsson enabling the creation of private 5G networks.\n\nOngoing efforts in customer satisfaction and network quality have helped reduce churn, with initiatives such as 'HIT Wi-Fi AR,' an augmented reality app developed by Orange, which allows its engineers to optimize Wi-Fi coverage throughout its customers' premises.",

        "page_content": "## The network\n\nIn 2023, Orange continued to roll out its fiber optic network by connecting 0.3 million additional households to FTTH over one year. At the end of 2023, Orange was able to offer an FTTH connection to 17.1 million Spanish households.\n\nOrange also focused on the speed of its fixed network, accelerating the  roll-out  of  XGSPON,  reaching  1.5 million  connectable households with a speed of more than 10 Gbps.\n\nOrange Espagne completed the optimization of the 5G spectrum it had acquired at various auctions, enabling it to increase speeds by 60%. The network can now reach up to 1.5 Gbps. At the end of 2023, 5G population coverage reached 84%, beyond the coverage goal of 50%. Orange Espagne also continued to expand its 4G network, reaching coverage of 99% of the population at the end of 2023.\n\n## 1.4.2.2 Poland\n\nThe Group has been present in Poland since 2000, when it acquired an interest in the incumbent operator, Telekomunikacja Polska (renamed Orange Polska). In 2006, Orange became the single brand for mobile activities and, in 2012, for all the fixed telephony services offered by the Group in Poland. Orange owns 50.67% of the shares of Orange Polska, which is listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 2023, the Group generated 6.4% of its consolidated revenues in Poland.\n\nPoland has four main mobile telephony operators: Orange, T-Mobile (owned by Deutsche Telekom), Polkomtel (operating under the Plus brand, owned by the Cyfrowy Polsat group) and P4 (owned by Iliad since end-2020, operating under the Play brand). At the end of 2023, these four mobile telephony operators accounted for 98% of the total number of SIM cards in Poland, and Orange was the leading operator, with market share of 28% (Source: Orange estimates).\n\nOrange ranks first in the broadband Internet market, with market share of 27% at end-2023 (Source: Orange estimates). Its principal competition comes from cable TV operators (mainly UPC Polska and Vectra), as well as from Netia (part of the Cyfrowy Polsat group), a conventional telecommunication operator.\n\nThe Polish telecommunication market is highly competitive and relatively fragmented. Convergence has become a key element in new residential customer acquisitions. This environment has caused market consolidation to accelerate, in particular among fixed and mobile players. The Cyfrowy Polsat group acquired Netia in 2018. In 2020, Vectra acquired Multimedia Polska, creating the country's leader in the cable market, Play completed the acquisition of Virgin Mobile, Poland's biggest MVNO, and Iliad completed the acquisition of Play. In 2022, Iliad closed the acquisition of UPC Polska, the largest cable operator in Poland. This transaction made Iliad a convergent player in its own right on the Polish market. In the first half of 2023, Play transferred UPC's infrastructure to a new company (Polski \u015a wiat\u0142ow\u00f3d Otwarty (P \u015a O)) and then sold 50% of PSO's shares to InfraVia, a French investment fund. P \u015a O provides wholesale Internet access services to Play and has communicated its intention to open this network to other operators.\n\nIn 2021, Play and Polsat Plus Group also both sold their mobile infrastructure to Cellnex, a Spanish-based infrastructure investor. These transactions facilitated the arrival of a new player, who thus took a significant share of the mobile infrastructure market in Poland.\n\nIn 2021, Orange Polska completed the disposal of 50% of its FiberCo to the APG Group.\n\n## Orange's activities in Poland\n\nIn 2023, Orange Polska continued to implement its strategic plan,. Grow, for the 2021-2024 period. Despite the many challenges posed  by  the  macroeconomic  environment  and  heightened competition, Orange Polska remains in line with its financial and operational ambitions.\n\nConvergence remains a key growth driver, enabling the Group to gain and maintain customer trust and loyalty. In 2023, Orange Polska continued to focus its efforts on its Love convergent offers. Love is a package that includes both fixed and mobile services in its basic formula at an affordable price. It can be extended for higher fixed broadband speed, additional SIM cards, enhanced TV content and other value-added services.\n\nThe number of convergent customers continued to rise in 2023, reaching 1.70 million and now accounting for 71% of the total number of fixed broadband accesses. This growth was supported by strong sales for the fiber offer, with fiber customers accounting for 48% of the customer base at end-2023, an increase of six points compared with end-2022. Orange Polska now has more Internet customers on fiber than on copper, which is an important symbol of its technological transformation. This good performance was driven by strong demand for fixed broadband, as well as the continued growth of its presence in fiber, mainly due to partnerships with other fiber infrastructure providers. Orange Polska has been limiting the roll-out of its own fiber since it sold 50% of its shares in its FiberCo i n 2021.\n\nFor several years, Orange Polska's business strategy has focused on creating value by adjusting the price of its main online services according  to  the  'more  for  more'  principle.  Orange  Polska maintained this approach in 2023, taking high inflation into account as well, and thus increased the rates for its fixed and convergent offers.\n\nIn the B2B market, Orange Polska continued to strengthen its position as the preferred partner for the digital transformation of its customers. IT and Integration Services continued to enjoy robust growth, with a 14% increase in revenues compared with 2022 (on a comparable basis).\n\n## The network\n\nOrange Polska continued the growth of its FTTH coverage in 2023, reaching almost 8 million connectable households at the end of the year.\n\nIn 2021, Orange Polska sold 50% of the capital of its \u015a wiat\u0142ow\u00f3d Inwestycje  subsidiary  (the  Polish  FiberCo)  to  the  APG  group. Orange and APG jointly control the Polish FiberCo, which is now recognized under associates and joint ventures in the Group's financial statements (see Note 3.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The  FiberCo  expects  to  connect  approximately 1.7 million Polish households to fiber, mainly in areas with limited fixed broadband infrastructure. As a result of the creation of its FiberCo, future growth in Orange Polska's fiber coverage will be achieved mainly through access to the FiberCo's network, as well as the networks of other fixed infrastructure players.\n\nIn October 2023, Orange Polska acquired a 100 MHz spectrum block in the 3,400-3,800 MHz band ('C-band') for 15 years. The acquisition is expected to significantly boost the capacity of its mobile network, providing the necessary resources for the growth in traffic, as well as better quality of service. In the medium term, this spectrum should also open up opportunities for B2B customers.\n\nOrange  Polska  is  continuing  to  systematically  modernize  its radio network. As part of this project, active equipment is being replaced by more energy-efficient equipment that meets the latest technology standards.\n\nIn 2023, Orange Polska continued to operate its new 5G Lab, a place to develop and test solutions that use 5G, collaborate with start-ups, and present innovative solutions to businesses using the same 5G spectrum as the future Polish 5G network.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

Orange Belgium is listed on the Brussels Stock Exchange. Following a takeover bid, completed on May 4, 2021, the Orange group now holds 78.32% of the capital of Orange Belgium. A long-standing player in the mobile segment in Belgium, in 2016 Orange launched convergent offers across the entire country based on the regulation of  wholesale  access  to  cable.  In  June 2023,  in  line  with  its convergence strategy, Orange Belgium finalized the acquisition of 75% minus one share of VOO, a cable and MVNO player in south Brussels and Wallonia.\n\nIn  2023,  Orange  Belgium  generated  3.9%  of  the  Group's consolidated revenues.\n\n## Belgium\n\nOrange has two main competitors in the mobile telephony market: Proximus (the incumbent operator, 53.5% owned by the Belgian State) and Telenet (100% owned by the Liberty Global Group, since the public takeover bid in October 2023), which acquired Base in 2016. With a market share of 30.9% in the third quarter of 2023, Orange ranks second behind Proximus (Source: Orange estimates).\n\nThe competitive structure of the fixed telephony market changed drastically in 2023, with three major events:\n\n- -in January 2023, Orange Belgium and Telenet signed two commercial wholesale agreements providing mutual access to their respective fixed networks;\n- -in June 2023, Orange Belgium finalized the acquisition of VOO. The transaction gives Orange Belgium 75% minus one share of VOO, with the rest of the capital still held by Nethys;\n- -In July 2023, Telenet and Fluvius created Wyre, their new 'NetCo,' which became the owner of their respective networks. The new joint venture will roll out a fiber network in Flanders.\n\n## Orange's activities in Belgium\n\nThroughout  2023,  Orange  continued  its  value  and  innovation strategy for its customers by introducing new offers on the market. In particular, the company:\n\n- -strengthened the Hey! brand by launching a new competitively priced fixed Internet subscription and doubling the volume of data in its mobile offers;\n- -launched new gigabit fiber offers, among a complete set of fixed Internet packages, with a choice of speeds ranging from 150 Mbps and 400 Mbps to 1 Gbps.\n\nIn 2023, taking advantage of the acquisition of VOO, and in line with its Lead The Future strategy, Orange Belgium became the first Belgian telecom operator to have a national gigabit offer, enabling the country's inhabitants to benefit from high speeds of up to 1 Gbps on its high-performance cable network.\n\nOrange  Belgium  also  continued  to  focus  on  its  5G  network, renowned for its speed - Opensignal has rated its 5G download speed as the best in Belgium - and its ability to come up with innovative applications. As a result, the Belgian federal government has chosen Orange Belgium to run 11 different 5G pilot projects.\n\n## Luxembourg\n\nOrange started its operations in Luxembourg in 2007, via the acquisition of Voxmobile. The company adopted the Orange brand in 2009.\n\nIn the mobile segment, Orange Communications Luxembourg, with market share of approximately 15%, ranks third behind incumbent operator  Post  Luxembourg,  the  market  leader,  and  Proximus Luxembourg, a subsidiary of Belgian operator Proximus, with its Tango brand (source: ILR, June 2023). Post Luxembourg also has the largest market share in the fixed-line and Internet market.\n\nIn 2023, Orange continued to adapt its portfolio, in line with its position as a challenger, while taking advantage of the 5G launched in 2020. The company is focusing on innovation and customer experience via the launch of its Livebox. It has also introduced new, comprehensive fiber offers in a simpler format, allowing it to meet its customers' needs at an attractive price point.\n\n## 1.4.2.4\n\n## Central  Europe\n\n## Romania\n\nOrange Romania was founded in 1997 and adopted the Orange brand in 2002. A long-standing player in the mobile segment, Orange launched its satellite TV offers in 2013, then its fiber offer in 2016, following a wholesale agreement with Telekom. In 2021, in line with its convergent ambitions in Romania, Orange acquired 54% of fixed telephony operator Telekom Romania Communications (TKR, now Orange Romania Communications - OROC), the remaining 46% still being held by the Romanian government.\n\nIn 2023, the Group generated 3.5% of its consolidated revenues in Romania.\n\nThe Romanian telecommunication market is dominated by four operators, three of which provide convergent services, namely Orange, Vodafone, and RCS&RDS (operating under the Digi brand, owned by Digi Communications), and one mobile operator, Telekom (owned by OTE, itself jointly controlled by Deutsche Telekom and the Greek government).\n\nOn November 21, OTE announced that negotiations were under way for the sale of Telekom Romania Mobile to Quantum Projects Group, a company controlled by the owner of the Romanian media group Clever Media. According to a press release, an agreement has been signed and the deal has been submitted to the relevant authorities for approval.\n\nIn  the  mobile  telephony  market,  Orange's  market  share  was estimated at 36% at the end of the first half of 2023. Orange has maintained its leading position, followed by Vodafone, Telekom and Digi (source: Ancom, first half 2023).\n\nWith the acquisition of OROC and the launch of its own fiber network, Orange has strengthened its position on the fixed market, which is nonetheless still dominated by Digi.\n\n## Orange's activities in Romania\n\nIn 2023, Orange reached new milestones following the acquisition of  OROC,  successfully  migrating  OROC  MVNO  customers  to the  Orange  network  and  finalizing  the  satellite  migration.  On December 29, Orange and the Romanian government announced an agreement to merge Orange Romania and Orange Romania Communications. The two shareholders confirmed their intention to create a fully converged telecommunication operator via the absorption of OROC by ORO. The deal was finalized with the merger agreement signed on March 21, 2024 with the Romanian State defining the terms of the merger by absorption of Orange Romania Communications by Orange Romania, the Romanian State keeping a stake in the combined entity.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2023,  Orange  Romania  had  9.5 million  mobile customers, 1.1 million fixed Internet customers and 1.1 million television customers. Customers are counted by 'RGUs' (revenue generating units).",

In addition, according to Ancom, Orange has had the highest average mobile and fixed speeds over the past six years. Meanwhile, independent auditor LCC International considers Orange Romania to be the best Romanian mobile network on account of the performance of its Voice and Data mobile services, both in urban and rural areas.\n\nAs  the  Group's  first  country  to  market  5G,  Orange  Romania continued to roll out its 5G network, available in 38 cities at end-2023, and launched 5G+, with speeds reaching up to 1.5 Gbps. The second Orange 5G Lab opened in Iasi. Six new start-ups joined the Orange Fab program following a call for projects dedicated to 5G. Orange also announced its participation in six international consortia under the Horizon Europe program. This will contribute to the sustainable development of 5G and pave the way for 6G.\n\nOrange Romania also came up with innovative new offers. For example, during the second half of 2023, 5G and eSIM technologies were rolled out for prepaid customers. In addition, Orange Romania launched Fibra 2300, the fastest fiber subscription in the country, with a download speed of up to 2,100 Mbps and an upload speed of 1,000 Mbps, as well as high-performance equipment such as the Wi-Fi 6 router and Mesh Ultra Wi-Fi 6 technology, which boosts Wi-Fi coverage.\n\nIn 2023, as part of its CO 2 emissions reduction program, Orange Romania installed rooftop solar panels at two additional Data centers, in Brasov and Timisoara. Orange Romania also signed a contract with ENGIE for the virtual purchase of long-term renewable energy. Under this contract, Orange Romania will generate 30 GWh of its annual electricity needs from solar panels over the next six years. Orange Foundation Romania opened its new training facility, the Orange Digital Center, with the aim of bridging the digital divide.\n\nIn  August 2023,  Orange  announced  that  it  had  reached  an agreement on the transfer of Orange Money's retail business to Alpha Bank Romania.\n\n## Slovakia\n\nOrange Slovensko started operating in 1996 and adopted the Orange  brand  in  2002.  A  long-standing  player  in  the  mobile segment, Orange Slovensko strengthened its position in convergent offers thanks to its own fiber roll-out program and the launch of fixed solutions via LTE in 2017.\n\nIn 2023, the Group generated 1.3% of its consolidated revenues in Slovakia.\n\nSlovakia's fixed broadband market is dominated by the incumbent operator, Slovak Telekom (owned by the Deutsche Telekom group), which  has  infrastructure  covering  the  entire  country.  Orange Slovensko ranks second, with a market share of 17.6% (source: Orange estimates). Nevertheless, the roll-out of its proprietary fiber optic network and regulated access to Slovak Telekom's fixed network allow Orange Slovensko to provide fixed broadband services to the largest number of potential customers.\n\nOrange  Slovensko  has  three  main  competitors  in  the  mobile telephony market: O2 (owned by Emirates Telecommunication Group Company), Slovak Telekom (owned by Deutsche Telekom) and Swan (national operator, operating under the 4ka brand). 4ka began offering mobile services in October 2015, but remains a marginal player. With a market share of 31.7% (source: Orange estimates), Orange Slovensko remains the market leader. In 2022, O2 moved into second place on this market, followed closely by Slovak Telecom.\n\n## Orange's activities in Slovakia\n\nIn 2023, Orange Slovensko continued to implement its strategy, which consists of strengthening its position in the convergence market,  backed  up  by  its  substantial  market  share  in  mobile telephony combined with growing market share in fixed telephony and TV.\n\nOrange  Slovensko  markets  a  number  of  innovative  offers, particularly its Love convergent services. In 2023, Orange Slovensko focused on streamlining its portfolio of fixed and mobile offers and making them more attractive, while enhancing its customer loyalty program and adding security services. In the B2B segment, Orange Slovensko has entered a new era of enterprise services thanks to 5G, while continuing to develop AI and IoT solutions with a focus on cybersecurity.\n\nAlongside the improvement in its portfolio of offers and the customer experience, Orange Slovensko has demonstrated its commitment to climate action through an ambitious program to roll out solar panels to its mobile antennas. At the end of 2023, 470 had already been equipped. Orange is the only Slovak operator to implement such a large-scale program. Every base station that is equipped with solar panels prevents the emission of several hundreds of kilos of CO 2 per year.\n\nIn 2023, Orange Slovensko continued its partnerships with the Slovak University of Technology and the University of Zilina to develop 5G solutions for Slovak industry. This partnership aims to improve students' access to 5G technologies and create a space to develop 5G solutions for Industry 4.0.\n\nOrange  Slovensko  also  continued  to  invest  in  its  network infrastructure. The 5G network, launched in 2021 in Bratislava and Banska Bystrica, reached 65.6% of the population at the end of 2023. The Orange mobile network was recognized as the best in Slovakia for the fourth consecutive year by Commsquare (formerly 'Systemics PAB'). Orange also expanded its own FTTH network, reaching more than 585,000 connectable households at end-2023, and  can  provide  fiber  services  to  nearly  600,000 additional households through network partnerships.\n\n## Moldova\n\nOrange  Moldova  started  operating  in  1998  and  adopted  the Orange  brand  in  2007,  celebrating  its  25th anniversary  in October 2023. During this time, Orange Moldova has become the telecommunications market leader and a key player in the country's economy. A long-standing player in the mobile segment, Orange Moldova launched its fixed and convergent telephony services in 2017, following the 2016 acquisition of SUN Communications, Moldova's main cable operator. In 2023, Orange Moldova merged with Sun Communications to streamline its organizational structure.\n\nIn 2023, the Group generated 0.4% of its consolidated revenues in Moldova.\n\nMoldova's  main  telecommunication  operators  are  Orange Moldova, Moldcell (part of a Nepal-based conglomerate since 2020) and Moldtelecom. Moldtelecom is the incumbent operator; its infrastructure provides both fixed and mobile services. It is the leader in Internet and fixed telephony. In 2023, with a market share of 50.1%, Orange maintained its number one position in the mobile telephony market, followed by Moldcell and Moldtelecom (source: Anrceti Report, third quarter 2023).\n\n## Orange's activities in Moldova\n\nIn 2023, Orange Moldova continued to pursue its strategic goals, despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical uncertainty due to the armed conflict in neighboring Ukraine.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nIn 2023, in line with its ambition to bolster its position in fixed broadband and become the country's first fully convergent operator, Orange Moldova rolled out fiber in more than 20 new locations and expanded coverage in the country's two largest cities. Orange Moldova also successfully completed its fiber migration project, migrating all its cable customers to the new fiber technology. As a result of this project, it has been able to improve the customer experience and decommission its cable network.\n\nAchieving a leadership position in the mobile segment remains a priority for Orange Moldova, which reached 2.3 million mobile lines at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Amid persistent inflation in 2023 and to promote revenue growth, Orange Moldova revised the price of its plans with a 'more for more' approach. It also launched a more expensive prepaid kit. To boost value creation, a new portfolio of plans was unveiled in the fourth quarter of 2023. This included the flagship 'Roam like Home' offer, a premium plan available in Europe from December 21.\n\n## 1.4.3 Africa & Middle East\n\nThe Orange group is present in 18 countries in Africa & Middle East, including 16 where it has controlling interests and two (Tunisia and Mauritius) where it has minority interests. Part of the activities are structured into sub-groups (Sonatel and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). Orange operates in both the mobile and fixed markets.\n\nThe mobile markets are mainly prepaid markets, largely driven by the accelerated development of data and digital uses. Orange is pursuing a 4G roll-out strategy and is investing in all countries to upgrade and extend their access networks. The first 5G roll-outs took place in 2022, continued in 2023, and will accelerate to cover almost the entire region by 2025.\n\nDespite  increasingly  intense  competition,  the  Group  also  saw rapid development in multi-services, particularly Mobile Financial Services with its Orange Money offer and digital services with the mobile super-app Max it. Given the arrival of a new competitor in four countries in the region (Senegal, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Mali and Burkina Faso) in 2021, Orange changed the business model for its offer and accelerated its digitization, but was still significantly impacted in 2021 and 2022. By fostering a collective response, the Group was able to bounce back in its various geographical regions (with the exception of Senegal, where its leadership remains contested at this stage). At the same time, Orange Money reported revenue growth of 25.8% and an increase of 17.1 million in its customer base in 2023 (up 22.5% from 2022). It now has 92.9 million customers, 34.1 million of whom are active customers using the service each month (for more information, see Section 4.3.3.4.5.1 Access to online financial services).\n\nIn digital services, Orange aims to become the benchmark digital operator in Africa & Middle East. The sector has been a growth driver for the Group for many years and remains a key component of its strategy (see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy). The digital strategy is spearheaded by the mobile super-app 'Max it,' initially launched in five countries in November 2023 (Cameroon, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Botswana). It will be rolled out across the sector by the third quarter of 2024. This is a perfect example of the Group's strategy to diversify services in response to the needs of local communities. More than just an app, it is a services portal that everyone can access, designed to make day-to-day life easier and satisfy a wide variety of needs. It brings together three essential service offers in a single smartphone interface: telecom capabilities, mobile payment and money transfer solutions with Orange Money, and an e-commerce universe offering digital content as well as innovative digital ticketing. The service universe will be completed over  the  course  of  2024  and  2025  through  Orange  Energy, Healthcare, Insurance and Education in particular.\n\nIn the B2B segment, Orange Moldova focused on IT&IS growth, differentiating itself and increasing its market share by expanding its portfolio of offers, with new services such as mobile PBX, customer satisfaction scoring and cybersecurity solutions.\n\nThe company doubled down on its CSR commitments by opening its Orange Digital Center, a digital training hub, and launching its 'RE' platform, an umbrella for its circular economy projects (in-store recovery of unwanted phones, sale of refurbished devices). It also unveiled new initiatives in 2023, including the launch of the 'Trade-in' program and the first 'RE' space in an Orange store.\n\nOrange  Moldova  also  continued  to  invest  in  the  country's infrastructure. The company operates the most extensive and fastest 2G/3G/4G network, with 4G population coverage of 99%. For the eleventh consecutive year, Orange Moldova's network was rated 'Best Moldovan mobile network in the test' by Polish company Systemics PAB.\n\nIn the fixed broadband market, Orange is speeding up the roll-out, particularly of fiber; it had 1.2 million customers at end-2023.\n\nBesides a challenging geopolitical situation, countries in the Africa & Middle East business segment are tending to see tighter regulations on quality of service and compliance with environmental standards, as well as a high tax burden.\n\nIn 2023, the Africa & Middle East segment accounted for 15.8% of the Group's consolidated revenues, versus 15.5% in 2022.\n\n## 1.4.3.1 Sonatel  sub-group\n\nThe Sonatel sub-group operates under the Orange brand in five countries. With operations in Senegal dating back to 1997, it began its international development in Mali in 2002. It also operates in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau (operations launched in 2007) and Sierra Leone, where it acquired Airtel Sierra Leone in 2016. In 2023, it generated  5.5%  of  the  Group's  consolidated  revenues.  The Orange group owns 42.33% of the Sonatel sub-group and has control based on a shareholders' agreement (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Sonatel is listed on the West Africa Regional Stock Exchange (Bourse R\u00e9gionale des Valeurs Mobili\u00e8res - BRVM).\n\nWith mobile market volume shares of 57.7% in Senegal, 69.3% in Guinea, 55.6% in Mali, 63.5% in Guinea-Bissau and 53.4% in Sierra Leone (source: Orange estimates, fourth quarter of 2023), Orange is the leader in all its geographical areas.\n\nValue market share is as follows: 84.4% in Guinea, 68.8% in Mali, 76.8% in Senegal and 80% in Bissau.\n\nDepending on the country, the Group has two or three competitors: Free (whose brand was launched in October 2019 to replace Tigo) and Expresso (Sudatel group) in Senegal; Sotelma/Malitel (Maroc Telecom  group)  and  Alpha  Telecom  (Planor-Monaco  Telecom International consortium) in Mali; MTN and Cellcom in Guinea; MTN in Guinea-Bissau; and (the incumbent operator), Africell and QCell in Sierra Leone.\n\nThe Sonatel sub-group continues to develop very high-speed fixed and mobile broadband based on 4G/4G+ (and tests for 5G), FDD/TDD and fiber, as well as mobile data. In 2023, data services achieved double-digit growth in all sub-group countries.",

        "page_content": "The multi-services business gathered pace in 2023, both in relation to the Orange Money service - which continued to see overall growth in its active customer base and total annual transaction value - and in relation to digital multi-services with the launch of the mobile super-app Max it in Senegal and Mali.\n\nDespite  increasing  competition,  often  unfavorable  regulatory decisions and political instability in some countries, the Sonatel Group was able to maintain its financial equilibrium in 2023 owing to steady growth and increased profitability.\n\nThe Sonatel group is a key player in the economic development of all the countries where it operates through digital, financial and energy inclusion (see Section 4.3.3.4.5 Offering inclusive services that complement connectivity). It also helps support health care, education, local entrepreneurship and the development of a true digital ecosystem.\n\n## 1.4.3.2 C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-group\n\nThe C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-group operates under the Orange brand in three countries. The activity covers C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, where the Group has operated since 1996, and Burkina Faso and Liberia, where it acquired Cellcom Liberia and Airtel Burkina Faso in 2016. This represents an area with a population of more than 56 million. In 2023, it generated 3.4% of the Group's revenues. The Orange group owns 72.5% of the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-group.\n\nOrange is the leader in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Liberia. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, it has a 47.5% market share (source: Artci, third quarter 2023). In Burkina Faso, Orange holds a market share of 45.9% of mobile subscribers (source: Arcep BF, third quarter 2023). In Liberia, Orange strengthened its leadership position with a market share of 54.6% (source: GSMA, third quarter 2023).\n\nThe three entities each face the following main competitors in their geographical region: MTN and Moov Africa in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire; Moov Africa and Telecel in Burkina Faso; and MTN in Liberia.\n\nOrange is also the market leader in Mobile Financial Services in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso. In light of the intense competitive pressure tied to Wave's arrival in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, the response plan implemented by Orange Money helped accelerate growth in uses and value in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the sub-group's activity was affected by widespread inflation in the countries in the region, stiff competition and a challenging  security  situation  in  Burkina  Faso.  In  Liberia,  the year saw a sharp depreciation of the Liberian dollar, presidential elections and the accession to power of a new President.\n\nFTTH development became one of the sub-group's most powerful growth drivers. At end-2023, Orange had close to 220,000 customers in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. In Burkina Faso, Orange launched the FTTH service in June 2021 and had over 23,000 customers at the end of 2023.\n\nThe C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-group ensures that its strategy, investments and innovation create lasting value for all stakeholders. Digital equality  and  environmental  footprint  reduction  are  central  to the  CSR  strategy  of  the  sub-group,  which  has  consistently strengthened its social impact through various initiatives based around entrepreneurship, financial inclusion (see Section 4.3.3.4.5 Offering inclusive services that complement connectivity) and the environmental transition. For the second consecutive year, the sub-group published its Social Report, aimed at all stakeholders, in which it presented its achievements and ambitions.\n\nIn December 2022, the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-group reached a major milestone in its development strategy with its initial public offering\n\non the BRVM through the sale of nearly 15 million shares owned by the Ivoirian government, equivalent to 9.95% of the capital.\n\n## 1.4.3.3 Countries in North Africa and the Middle East\n\n## Egypt\n\nThe  Orange  group  entered  the  Egyptian  telecommunication market in 1998 through a partnership in the operator, Mobinil, with Orascom and Motorola. It gradually increased its stake following the withdrawal of Motorola in 2000 and Orascom in 2015. Since 2016, all services have been marketed under the Orange brand. In 2018, Orange Egypt was delisted from the Egyptian Exchange. In 2023, the Group generated 1.7% of its consolidated revenues in Egypt.\n\nAfter a period of considerable market slowdown in 2017 and 2018 following the introduction of a tax on mobile subscriptions, and the impact of the health crisis in 2020, the pace of the increase in the number of mobile subscriptions that began in 2021 continued in 2023.\n\nWith a share of the mobile market of 26.25% (source: GSMA, third quarter 2023), Orange ranks second in the market, behind Vodafone but ahead of Etisalat and WE (T\u00e9l\u00e9com Egypt).\n\nIn 2023, Orange Egypt recorded double-digit revenue growth, exceeding  its  growth  in  2022  despite  an  unstable  economic environment, significantly affected by high inflation and a series of sharp devaluations of the Egyptian pound from March 2022. The company continued to implement its transformation plan to increase its profitability.\n\n## Morocco\n\nThe  Orange  group  entered  the  Moroccan  telecommunication market in 2010 through a partnership with M\u00e9di Telecom. The company, which was operating under the M\u00e9ditel brand, became a consolidated subsidiary of the Group in July 2015, after Orange increased its interest to 49% of the capital. Since the end of 2016, all services have been marketed under the Orange brand. In 2023, the Group generated 1.6% of its consolidated revenues in Morocco.\n\nWith  32.5%  of  the  mobile  market,  Orange  is  the  country's second-largest mobile operator (behind the incumbent operator, Maroc  Telecom,  and  ahead  of  Inwi)  (source:  ANRT  (Agence Nationale de Regulations des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications  -  National Telecommunications Regulatory Agency) - fourth quarter 2023).\n\nIn a Moroccan market where growth remains below GDP, Orange Maroc continued to grow in mobile telephony and to pursue its development in fixed telephony, particularly in fiber. At the end of 2023 it passed the 300,000 customer mark, equivalent to a 38% market share (source: ANRT - third quarter 2023).\n\nA powerful earthquake hit the country in September 2023. The resilience of the network and the rapid response of Orange Maroc's employees, particularly its technical teams, allowed connectivity to be restored in less than 48 hours in most of the affected areas, providing support to the authorities and public.\n\n## Jordan\n\nThe  Orange  group  entered  the  Jordanian  telecommunication market in 2000, through a partnership with the incumbent operator, Jordan Telecom. The company became a consolidated subsidiary of the Group in 2006, after Orange increased its interest to 51% of the capital. Since the end of 2007, all services have been marketed under the Orange brand. In 2023, the Group generated 1.0% of its consolidated revenues in Jordan.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

(see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy).\n\nOrange  Business  leverages  the  standards  expected  of  it  as an operator in terms of reliability and performance to drive its expansion in IT services through an ambitious acquisitions policy in Cloud Computing and data. This led to the acquisition of Business & Decision and Basefarm in 2018, of Exelus in 2022 and of Expertime, a services company specializing in Microsoft technology, in 2023. It was followed in early 2024 by the launch of Bleu, a future 'trust Cloud' platform set up as a 50/50 joint venture with Capgemini, in partnership with Microsoft. In 2023, Enovacom, a healthcare subsidiary of Orange Business and the French market leader in medical data interoperability, acquired NEHS Digital and Xperis, two French companies specializing in the development of solutions for healthcare professionals, a sector in which the Group plans to accelerate its service provision. (see Sections 1.3 Significant events and 3.1.1.3 Significant events).\n\nIn 2018, Orange merged its cybersecurity activities into Orange Cyberdefense to ensure a high level of internal cybersecurity and simultaneously  develop  Orange's  commercial  activities  in  this strategic area. Orange Cyberdefense combines the legacy security expertise and infrastructure of Orange with those of Atheos and Lexsi, acquired in 2014 and 2016, respectively, of SecureData and SecureLink, both acquired in 2019, and of the Swiss companies SCRT and Telsys, acquired in 2022. These acquisitions give Orange Cyberdefense a presence in nine European countries.\n\nIn 2023, the Orange Business sector generated 17.2% of the Group's consolidated revenues.\n\n- 1\n\nOne of the main growth drivers for Mauritius Telecom is content, with, in particular, a strategy of investing in premium content, enabling the company to strengthen its position as market leader.\n\nMauritius Telekom also offers international connectivity via fiber optic submarine cables.\n\n## The market\n\nThe  health  crisis  accelerated  the  digital  transformation  of businesses  (cloudification  and  softwarization  of  networks  and services, digitization of customer relations, cybersecurity), but also had a significant impact on conventional telecom services (voice and connectivity) which have come under increased pressure due to the acceleration of new ways of working as well as the adoption of Cloud-based collaboration and connectivity solutions. The global economy is proving more resilient than expected, slowly recovering from the long-term effects of the Covid pandemic, the inflation crisis and the conflict in Ukraine. The disruptions in the energy and food markets caused by the war and the tightening of global monetary conditions to control historically high inflation have led to a further slowdown in global GDP growth. Global inflation was estimated at around 6.9% in October 2023, versus 8.7% a year earlier. It is forecast to be 5.8% in 2024 (source: FMI, October 2023). However, the prospects for improvement could be overshadowed by the emergence of new conflicts, especially in the Middle East, with human and commercial implications (for example, disruptions to logistics in the Red Sea).\n\nThe  global  communication  services  and  IT  services  market corresponding to Orange Business's activities stood at 1,571 billion euros in 2023, up 6% compared to 2022 (1,478 billion euros in 2022). This breaks down into 489 billion euros for communication services  and  1,082 billion  euros  for  IT  services.  The  global communication  services  market  is  nevertheless  expected  to experience an average annual growth of 1.2% between 2023 and 2027. This unexpected growth was mainly due to the slowing decline of certain sub-segments, such as enterprise networks using MPLS technology, a market that is expected to decrease sharply over the period (6.3% in 2023, vs. an 8.3% decrease in 2022). The strong momentum in IT services is expected to continue, with 10.2% average annual growth between 2023 and 2027 (sources: Gartner, third quarter 2023/PAC, February & September 2022/ IDC, November 2021 for IoT and September 2022 for Fixed Voice in France).\n\nFaced with a highly competitive and fragmented telecommunication services  and  IT  enterprise  services  market,  encompassing numerous players such as telecommunication operators, network integrators, IT service providers, or even players from the Internet, digital or cybersecurity worlds, Orange Business has positioned itself as a leading European network and digital integrator. On the IT services market, Orange Business was ranked third in France with a 4.6% market share (source: Teknowlogy Group/PAC - May 2023 survey).\n\nIn the specific cybersecurity services market, Orange ranks as a major player, with one of the broadest footprints in Europe. Orange has the critical mass needed in this consolidating market, and the ability to support its customers locally in all their geographies. With 1.1 billion euros in revenues in 2023, Orange has set a target of becoming a cybersecurity leader in Europe on this fast-growing market and is aiming for 1.3 billion euros in revenues by 2025.\n\n1",

Orange Business has positioned itself as an integrator capable of orchestrating and building on the various application building blocks of its customers, including the most critical ones - end-to-end in a multi-cloud environment - for both the public or private Cloud. Beyond its own infrastructure (70 Data centers) and its 2,500 experts, Orange is developing a strategy of alliance with major industry players, such as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services,\n- -Digital & Data solutions, including the Business & Decision subsidiary and its 3,700 experts in data intelligence and digital solutions, comprise the integration and provision of systems, business apps and application programming interfaces (API), as well as the design of digital solutions for customers in Big Data, data analytics and artificial intelligence.  Through  its  Enovacom  subsidiary,  Orange also offers healthcare players tailored solutions to meet the challenges of digital transformation,\n- -Cybersecurity solutions cover infrastructure and users, in managed and integrated or Cloud mode (safe work  environments  and  infrastructure,  cybersecurity, management  and  governance),  and  are  supervised from a security operations center. Thanks to its 2,800+ experts and 32 detection centers, Orange Cyberdefense, which also has at its disposal multiple Orange Business locations around the world, leverages Orange's 30 years of experience in making at-risk infrastructure secure, whether for SMEs, local authorities or multinational corporations around the world,\n- -Smart  mobility  solutions,  based  not  only  on  mobile technologies, but also on the IoT (Internet of Things),\n- -unified  communication  and  collaboration  services, including interoperability between telephony, messaging and video conference solutions, in triple or quadruple play,\n- -lastly, advice and services to customers, including needs analysis,  solution  architecture,  support  from  roll-out to  implementation,  user  training  and  administration  of services and solutions in a range of areas: transition to\n\nall-IP, adopting Machine to Machine and the Internet of Things,  supervising  and  managing  quality  of  service, switching to Cloud infrastructure solutions, and the digital transformation of companies.\n\nThese services are also used to develop cross-sector business solutions (finance, transport, energy, government and public sector, geolocation and fleet management, etc.).\n\nAs regards its core business as an operator, Orange relies on local and international partners to supplement its offer and geographical coverage in areas where its customers operate and where its presence does not provide a comprehensive solution. The Group is strengthening this type of partnership in the most developed markets, both on points of presence to optimally manage customer traffic, as with Equinix, and with leading operators in the geographic regions concerned, such as AT&T or NTT Communications.\n\nOrange  also  works  in  close  collaboration  with  an  ecosystem of international technological partners, who are leaders in their respective fields of connectivity, unified communication, contact centers, Cloud infrastructure, effective data use and cybersecurity. In parallel with the digital transformation of enterprises, Orange strengthened various aspects of its solutions in 2023:\n\n- -development of a managed, secure connectivity offer. This solution, which contributes to the gradual shift in customer practices,  especially  toward  the  Cloud,  also  balances  the continuity of existing practices via SD-WAN, SASE and SSE type solutions. In 2023, Orange developed and strengthened its  ecosystem  with  new  signings  such  as  Cisco,  Fortinet, Netskope, Palo Alto, VMware and Zscaler, among others;\n- -innovation  around  the  Cloud.  Since  2020,  Orange  has established strategic partnerships with the main hyperscalers (Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, GCP) around data services, artificial intelligence, the Cloud, edge computing, mobile private networks and digital transformation. Furthermore, with sovereignty becoming a major topic of the digital  transformation  for  businesses,  Orange  Business  is pursuing two complementary development vectors: the first through an independent company named Bleu, a joint venture with Capgemini and in partnership with Microsoft as technology provider; and the second through its Cloud Avenue offering, developed in partnership with HPE and WMware.\n\nOrange is developing partnerships with service players to enhance the operational performance of French manufacturers: for example, the  partnership  with  Siemens  in  the  Industry  4.0 segment  in automation and digital transformation solutions, in order to allow French industrial groups to fully maximize the potential of digitization. In this perspective, the partnership proposes end-to-end support, ranging from consulting to integration and analysis.\n\nLastly, with regard to the Group's CSR commitments, Orange is taking an increasingly green approach with its partners, particularly Apple (recycled mobiles) and Cisco (network equipment).\n\nIn 2023, Orange Business signed major contracts to support its customers worldwide, including Lucid Motors, the US electric vehicle manufacturer, to orchestrate the manufacturer's customer experience  in  Europe  via  approved  and  tested  electronic communication services (ECS) for Internet access services, as well as IoT; and with Stolt-Nielsen, the global expert in liquid product management and sustainable aquaculture, to provide it with a SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) solution combining SD-WAN connectivity with SSE (Security Service Edge) services to secure and optimize the connectivity of its teleworkers around the world.",

        "page_content": "## 1.4.5 Totem\n\nTotem, Orange's European TowerCo, was created on November 1, 2021. Orange has transferred all the key assets of its passive mobile infrastructure in France and Spain to this subsidiary. The creation of this independently managed entity allows Orange to strengthen its position as a manager and operator of mobile infrastructure and to benefit from new growth drivers. Totem manages close to 27,300 masts, flat rooftops and other mobile sites in its geographies, and aims to become a leading player in the European TowerCo market.\n\nTotem offers infrastructure-sharing solutions to mobile operators, businesses and institutions; responds to requests to build new sites; and markets mobile coverage solutions to improve connectivity in dense and enclosed environments, such as stadiums, subways, shopping malls, offices, etc.\n\nTotem has chosen a strong brand name that embodies its vision: mobile infrastructure is the totem of our digital civilization, offering connectivity  solutions  to  everyone,  everywhere,  in  both  rural and urban areas. Totem's mission is to unite all stakeholders operators, local authorities, institutions, businesses and lessors on its infrastructure to meet the growing need for connectivity.\n\nFollowing the increase in the cost of debt (with the rise in interest rates), the leading TowerCos have prioritized operational efficiency over acquisitions, which dominated in previous years. The European leader Cellnex sold 49% of its subsidiaries in Denmark and Sweden and  put  its  subsidiaries  in  Ireland  and  Austria  up  for  sale  to accelerate its deleveraging. American Tower sold its subsidiary in Poland to focus on its subsidiaries in Spain, Germany and France. In Western Europe, there were few transactions with low site volumes (Phoenix Towers: 2,400 sites in France; 200 sites in Germany; sale of 16.6% of Cornerstone (i.e. 15,000 sites) in the United Kingdom). The majority of transactions took place in Eastern Europe: E& (a UAE-based group) took control of five subsidiaries of the PPE group (10,000 sites), while Saudi TowerCo TAWAL took over 5,000 sites from United Group. In addition, the Austrian group Austria Telekom (A1) floated its 13,000 towers on the stock exchange.\n\n- 1\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, Totem remained the fifth-ranking European  TowerCo  by  number  of  sites,  behind  Cellnex (107,000 sites), Vantage Towers (46,000 sites), GD Towers/Deutsche Funkturm (41,000 sites) and ATC Europe (31,000 sites). It is the only company controlled by a mobile telecommunication operator.\n\nTotem is positioned to support the surging need for connectivity and to offer solutions to meet the emerging needs of operators who are looking for industrial partners. Its momentum is illustrated by the signing of new commercial contracts for the roll-out of 5G in the Orange V\u00e9lodrome, the construction of nearly 450 new sites in France to meet the connectivity needs of operators and the roll-out of small cell solutions in Spain and support for the 5G needs of operators in the country.\n\nTotem is therefore positioned as a leading industrial TowerCo within the TowerCo ecosystem. Totem leverages its recognized strengths:\n\n- -an exceptional portfolio, in terms of both the density of its network and the quality of its mostly fiber optic sites;\n- -the expertise of its teams, who come mostly from the operator world and have extensive knowledge of customer expectations;\n- -the ongoing optimization of its industrial model;\n- -a 100% renewable energy supply in Spain where Totem is an energy supplier;\n- -sound CSR fundamentals.\n\nIn 2023, Totem earned revenues of 686 million euros, with growth in revenues from hosting and reconfiguration, partially offset by the decrease in revenues from re-invoicing energy costs, which have fallen. At end-2023, 16.7% of hosting revenues came from external customers. The tenancy ratio stood at 1.40 co-tenants per site, an increase of 3 basis points compared with its level at the end of 2022, in line with the target of 1.5 co-tenants per site by 2026.\n\nIn  2023,  Totem  generated  0.3%  of  the  Group's  consolidated revenues.\n\n## 1.4.6 International Carriers & Shared Services\n\nThe operating activities of the International Carriers & Shared Services segment include:\n\n- -international  Carrier  activities  undertaken  by  the  Orange Wholesale Division: roll-out of the international and long-haul network,  sales  of  international  telephony  and  international wholesale  services,  and  installation  and  maintenance  of submarine cable;\n- -the content activities of OCS and Orange Studio.\n\nThe services marketed to operators in France are presented in Section 1.4.1 France. The content distribution activities are briefly presented below, but their revenues are included in the revenues for the France, Europe and Africa & Middle East segments.\n\nThe segment also includes other cross-cutting activities of the Group, in particular research and innovation (see Section 1.6), lease property restructuring, and support and shared activities, including corporate functions at the operational head office.\n\nThe operating activities of the segment accounted for 2.2% of the Group's consolidated revenues in 2023.\n\n## 1.4.6.1 International Carrier activities\n\nThe International Carrier activities include sales of international telephony and services to international carriers, the negotiation and conclusion of roaming agreements, the roll-out of the international and long-distance network and the installation and maintenance of submarine cables.\n\nThe wholesale operator market comprises three categories of players: global wholesalers, multinational retail operators (including Orange) and regional or specialist players.\n\nThe wholesale market's customer base comprises voice market specialists (call shops, prepaid cards), fixed and mobile domestic retail carriers (including MVNOs), Internet service and content providers and OTT (Over-The-Top) players. International Carriers also sell wholesale traffic to each other.\n\nOrange  Wholesale  offers  a  broad  range  of  solutions  on  the international market. Its business is structured on an extensive infrastructure of long-haul networks. Its presence in both the retail and wholesale markets means the Group can develop solutions that are particularly well adapted to the needs of retail operators.\n\n1",

The  Group  defines  and  supplies  this  international infrastructure and is involved in building the networks and services from the design phase to their operation, as well as in fraud and cyberattack protection. It makes every effort to anticipate developments and adapt its networks to new technologies and emerging needs, using increasingly agile and flexible solutions.\n\nThese networks serve both retail and operator customers.\n\nChanges in uses, technological changes and customers' rising expectations for faster speeds and higher quality have put pressure on the Group to accelerate the development of all of its networks.\n\nOrange  is  notable  for  being  heavily  involved  in  the  design, construction and operation of submarine cable. With its ownership or co-ownership of several cable systems, Orange ranks among the world's largest owners of submarine links. This has enabled it to respond to the increase in transatlantic traffic.\n\nThe Group's wholesale activity is based on:\n\n- -a seamless global network and an IPX protocol network (see Section 7.2.2 Glossary of technical terms) supporting voice and data with points of presence throughout the world;\n- -a global network of dedicated IP routes with end-users in 177 countries, connections to more than 200 Internet service providers, and connectivity in over 100 countries in a single IP network hop;\n- -99.99% network  availability and  centralized network supervision, 24/7.\n\nIn 2023, IP data traffic increased by 31 %.\n\nOther highlights of 2023 included the announcement in December that the transatlantic submarine cable Amiti\u00e9 between New York and Europe was ready for operation, and the launch in April of the construction of the new submarine cable linking Tunisia and France, in partnership with the operator Medusa Submarine Cable System and with the backing of the European Commission.\n\n## Orange Marine\n\nA wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, Orange Marine has a fleet of six cable-laying ships, one vessel that researches new routes for submarine cable installation, and four marine bases. Its ships have laid more than 287,000 kilometers of cable since the 19th century and have made more than 890 repairs to submarine links, some at a depth of nearly 6,000 meters.\n\nIts know-how, from project engineering to the installation and maintenance of submarine cables, is recognized worldwide. This allows it to play a major and strategic role at the global level, at a time when more efficient next-generation cables are being installed across all oceans.\n\nOverall,  2023  was  a  busy  year,  with  several  flagship  projects successfully completed:\n\n- -ANJANA: cable between Santander and Myrtle Beach (USA); project awarded by NEC on behalf of its client Meta;\n- -T3: cable between Mauritius and South Africa on behalf of Mauritius Telecom, as a co-contractor with ASN;\n- -turnkey project for the customer Infratel, an Italian state-owned organization in charge of the roll-out of telecom infrastructure; Orange Marine connected 21 small islands with 31 landing points;\n\n- -DEEP BLUE 1: project signed with Digicel for laying a cable in the Caribbean;\n- -the Sophie Germain, a new cable-laying ship, joined the fleet.\n\nFor further information on the Group's networks, see Section 1.5 Orange's networks.\n\n## Orange Wholesale International Networks' offers\n\n## Voice services\n\nVoice service solutions enable operators worldwide to transit their customers' calls internationally to over 1,200 destinations with 24/7 technical support. Orange is the leader in this market.\n\n## Global roaming services\n\nWith mobile services solutions, Orange offers global roaming thanks to direct connections with over 200 mobile operators, as well as broad connectivity that enables it to offer messaging services.\n\n## Messaging services\n\nOrange is the trusted partner for mobile operators, brands and aggregators to safely deliver and charge for A2P (app to person) and P2P (person to person) text messages throughout the world.\n\n## Internet and transmission services\n\nOrange's data and IP network includes terrestrial, submarine and satellite systems which combine to create a vast global network. With its Internet network, Orange offers adjustable solutions to meet the needs of Internet service or content providers.\n\n## Convergence services\n\nOrange provides operators with a multi-service offer to enable them to manage their voice and mobile data services over a single connection.\n\n## Security and anti-fraud services\n\nTo protect the value of its customers' business, Orange Wholesale offers solutions covering the protection of identity and privacy and the protection of networks, mobile traffic and voice traffic.\n\nThe portfolio of anti-fraud and security services relies on voice, Internet and mobile service solutions. These offers include audit, detection and protection functions as well as the provision of analysis  reports.  The  portfolio  also  contains  offers  that  focus specifically  on  combating  the  dangers  of  cybercrime.  Orange Wholesale's customers can resell some of these offers to their own customers.\n\n## 1.4.6.2 Content  activities\n\nIn January 2023, Orange and the Canal+ Group announced that they had signed a memorandum of understanding for the Canal+ Group's acquisition of Orange's entire stake in the OCS pay-TV package and in Orange Studio, the film and TV co-production subsidiary. Orange Studio has more than 200 co-productions to its credit, as well as a catalog of nearly 1,800 audiovisual works and films. The leading film and TV studio in Europe, StudioCanal has many assets to promote this catalog. Since their founding in 2007 and 2008 respectively, competition in the audiovisual sector, particularly for OCS, has continued to intensify with the emergence of powerful international platforms. Through this agreement with the Canal+ Group, Orange's longstanding partner and a recognized European player in the creation and distribution of content, the Group aimed to sustain the long-term development of these two subsidiaries, while preserving jobs and the pre-financing of content. Canal+ has been a shareholder of OCS since 2012 (33.33% at the end of 2023) and is its leading distributor. On January 12, 2024, the French Competition Authority gave its approval for the transaction, which was finalized at the end of January. Following this transaction, the Canal+ Group is the sole shareholder of both companies.",

Its content strategy will continue to be based primarily on developing partnerships with rights holders and service publishers.\n\nIn Europe, Orange aggregates the best entertainment services, offering them to its 12.5 million TV customers via its very high-speed broadband networks. Throughout 2023, Orange strengthened and developed its offers by integrating services tailored to its customers' various  needs,  distributing  new  offers  with  advertising  from Netflix (France) and the sports streaming service DAZN (France).

Orange Money's business continues to be driven by geographical segments, particularly in Africa & Middle East (see Section 1.4.3 Africa & Middle East).\n\n## The banking market\n\nThe professional body for French fintech, insurtech and regtech companies (France FinTech) presented its 2023 annual ecosystem report. France FinTech players cover all areas of innovative finance, including banking and insurance services, asset management, payments,  cryptoassets,  regtech,  enterprise  services, etc.  An analysis  of  fintech  activity  reveals  that  939 million  euros  had been raised as of December 13, 2023, down nearly 70% from 2022, mainly due to a sharp decline in the participation of leading international investors.\n\nAccording to France FinTech, France is the second-largest market in Europe after the UK (just over 2 billion euros raised). Fintech companies have made more significant use of debt as a result of wider finance options and crowdfunding.\n\nFour key trends emerged during the year:\n\n- -the increasing involvement of fintech companies in impact investing (green finance, ESG, etc.);\n- -the growing use of technology such as artificial intelligence and tokenization;\n- -the  cooperation  between  fintech  companies  and  large corporations, which has always been a feature of the French ecosystem; and\n- -the burgeoning social role of fintech companies, at a time of resurgent inflation and pressure on purchasing power.\n\nAccording to France FinTech, the outlook for 2024 is as follows:\n\n- -the tight market conditions look set to continue for several quarters;\n- -fundraising is likely to remain below 2021 and 2022 levels;\n- -the overall level of activity should remain buoyant;\n- -some sectors could accelerate, such as ESG, enterprise offers, tokenization or insurtech;\n\nPremier League (Romania), the Champions League & Liga (Spain) and BeTV (Belgium).\n\nIn Africa & Middle East, content activities are at the heart of the multi-service strategy and help to cement Orange as a responsible local operator. In 2023, Orange broadened its offers with flagship regional  services  such  as  OSN  (Tunisia,  Jordan),  BeIN  TOD (Morocco)  and  MBC  Shahid  (Tunisia,  Morocco).  Orange  also entered into an exclusive partnership with Spotify to offer Orange customers access via the Group's data offers to the world's leading music streaming service. Lastly, in late November 2023, the Max it app was launched in five Africa & Middle East countries where Orange operates. In addition to Orange Money services and tools for managing its mobile and fixed lines, the app offers a range of content (online games, music, TV, videos, news, tickets, etc.).\n\n- -recruitment and internationalization are expected to gather pace,  the  latter  already  involving  30%  of  French  fintech companies;\n- -the various regulatory changes (PSD3, MiCA, AI Act, etc.) will have a significant impact on how the sector is structured.\n\n## Mobile Financial Services activities\n\n## Orange Bank\n\nLaunched  in  November 2017,  Orange  Bank,  a  wholly  owned subsidiary of the Orange group, provides cutting-edge banking services natively designed based on the mobile uses of customers, in strong synergy with Telecom activities.\n\nAccessible to everyone, the offer available in France requires no conditions in terms of income, savings or minimum balance. There are no bank charges attached to accounts and the associated bank cards (subject to certain terms and conditions of use). All basic banking services are offered: bank account, standard and premium bank card, checkbook, savings passbook, \u00e0 la carte insurance and personal loans. In 2020, the bank expanded its range with the launch of the Premium Pack, the first offer on the market intended for parents and up to five children, from age ten.\n\nThe Orange Bank app offers innovative features, relying heavily on telecom uses. It enables customers to make contactless payments with bank cards or via mobile handsets using Apple Pay and Google Pay, immediately access their bank account balance, temporarily block and unblock their bank card, request and send money by text message, change their bank card code at any time, or add funds to their account by bank transfer or bank card. Customers can perform all their banking transactions on a mobile handset. Customer Relations are managed by a virtual advisor, available 24/7, with the option of using the customer relationship center in France.\n\nTo open a bank account, customers have access to a network of more than 395 Orange stores approved as IOBSPs (1) . A specific type of loan that allows customers to finance the purchase of products available in the store (mobile phones, accessories, etc.) is also offered across the Orange network.\n\nAfter the acquisition of Orange Courtage in 2020, which enabled the bank to reach a new milestone in its cross-selling policy with Orange by becoming an insurance broker, and that of neobank Anytime, in January 2021, which specializes in business banking, Orange Bank launched Pr\u00eat Express (express loan) in 2022. The product of a partnership with Next 40 Younited's fintech, the offer incorporates the latest generation of technology solutions with concrete benefits for customers: loans accessible to customers and non-customers of the bank, high approval rates, and faster and more streamlined processes.

This number includes customers who had opened an account with Orange Bank, as well as customers of credit and mobile insurance offers.\n\n## Disposal of Orange Bank and agreements with BNP Paribas\n\nAs part of its strategic asset review, Orange, after having started a search for a partner for its banking subsidiary, announced at the end of June 2023 the entry into exclusive negotiations in order to define a referencing partnership concerning Orange Bank's client portfolio in France, develop financing solutions for mobile devices and discuss the modalities of a possible takeover of Orange Bank's business in Spain. At the end of this negotiation, Orange announced at the end of February 2024 a partnership with BNP Paribas to offer a banking continuity solution for its clients in France and Spain. This partnership resulted in the signing of several agreements:\n\n- -an SEO agreement in France whereby Hello bank!, the BNP Paribas mobile bank, offers Orange Bank customers in France an exclusive offer (subject to eligibility conditions); and\n- -a commercial agreement to ensure a continuity solution for Orange Bank clients (subject to eligibility conditions) in Spain via the Spanish subsidiary of BNP Paribas Personal Finance, Banco Cetelem.\n\nIn  parallel,  Orange  and  BNP  Paribas  Personal  Finance  are collaborating on the implementation of a new credit solution for the financing of mobile devices.\n\nThis partnership is part of the intention of Orange's wider intention to progressively withdraw Orange Bank from the retail banking\n\n## 1.5 Orange's  networks\n\nFor the Orange group, the networks are a strategic asset and, as such, are subject to constant supervision, maintenance and upgrades.  Launched  in  2023,  Orange's  strategic  plan,  Lead the future, is based on four key pillars, including capitalizing on infrastructure in all the countries where the Group is present (see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy).\n\nAt end-2023, the Orange group operated networks in 26 countries in Europe, Africa & Middle East to serve its B2C customers; its business networks are among the most extensive in the world. Orange intends to continue to roll out, innovate and invest in the best technologies to meet the challenges of reliability, security and resilience for its customers in all its locations.\n\nThe Group's investments in its networks, other than to maintain their quality (replacement of poles, cables and masts, and other\n\nmarket in France and Spain by the end of 2025. and the negotiation of a plan to safeguard employment for more than 600 jobs in France. In 2023, Orange Bank initiated an information-consultation with its employee representative bodies to cease its activities, and the negotiation of a plan to safeguard employment for more than 600 positions in France. Orange Bank has a solid balance sheet and will continue to meet all its regulatory obligations until its future withdrawal from the market. Orange Bank continues to offer a highquality service.\n\n## Orange Bank Africa\n\nIn  partnership  with  NSIA,  a  leading  bancassurance  provider, Orange  launched  Orange  Bank  Africa's  business  activities  in July 2020 in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire after obtaining a banking license from the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) in 2019. For populations still excluded from the conventional banking system, Orange Bank Africa has quickly become one of the most efficient ways of accessing credit and savings 24/7 from the Orange Money mobile account. In September 2023, the Banking Commission of the WAMU (West African Monetary Union) gave its approval for Orange Bank Africa to open a branch in Senegal.\n\nOrange Bank Africa offers a fully digital microcredit and savings solution,  allowing  users  to  borrow  smaller  amounts  instantly, from 5,000 CFA francs (around 8 euros), with an easy-to-use and innovative service which uses a scoring tool designed to accelerate decision-making and a dedicated artificial intelligence algorithm. It is accessible to everyone, regardless of location, time and mobile phone generation. In 2022, the offer was supplemented by a direct bank offer that includes consumer loans, business loans and a prepaid card offer. In 2023, the direct bank offer was supplemented by a real estate loan offer.\n\nOrange  Bank  Africa  had  1.3 million  customers  at  the  end  of December 2023, with its pico-credit, micro-credit and savings offers via Orange Money and its direct bank offers (consumer loans, business loans, real estate loans, prepaid cards). In 2023, 1.3 million loans were granted for a total amount of 185.2 billion CFA francs, thereby contributing to the economic and social development of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\n\nOrange Bank Africa enables the Group to participate more fully in the economic activity of its host countries and is thus completely in keeping with the regional financial inclusion strategy promoted by the BCEAO.\n\nequipment that has reached the end of its life) are designed to improve these networks in a number of respects:\n\n- -the  development  of  very  high-speed  fixed  and  mobile broadband (FTTH and 4G/5G), increased data transfer volumes and reduced connection latency. These investments concern all networks, from the mobile radio network and household Internet connectivity to satellite and submarine cables;\n- -the migration of uses from old technologies (analog telephony, copper networks, 2G and 3G) to new technologies;\n- -gradual virtualization of network control functions ('programmability' and 'softwarization' of networks so that they can be adapted more quickly to new services and uses);",

        "page_content": "- -automation of network operation, which improves the quality of service for customers.\n\nThe networks are very extensive. In each country, they break down into (i)  access networks (fixed and/or mobile), (ii) IP transmission and transport networks and (iii) control and service networks, supplemented by (v) international networks.\n\nAccess  networks  connect  each  customer  -  individuals  or businesses - and provide a first level of customer data aggregation. IP transmission and transport networks connect access networks with each other and with the networks of other operators in the relevant country, as well as with international networks. Control and service networks, which drive access, transmission and IP transport networks, provide the connection between people and manage the services (voice, TV, Internet access and data). International\n\n## 1.5.1 Access  networks\n\n## Fixed-access networks\n\n## Analog access and ADSL/vDSL broadband access\n\nCopper accesses comprise a pair of copper wires that connect individual  customers  to  a  concentration  point  and  give  them access, via the distribution and transport network, to a local switch. It is used to deliver analog voice services and broadband access services.\n\nOrange operates copper access networks in France and Poland, and in various countries in Africa & Middle East (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Jordan and Senegal), to provide analog voice access services and data in the B2C, B2B and wholesale markets.\n\nTo supplement its coverage, Orange also uses the networks of third-party operators to provide these same services (Belgium, Slovakia, etc.).\n\nNetworks and services based on copper accesses are used less and less as users move to very high-speed broadband. They are constantly being optimized to deal with this decrease in usage while maintaining quality service. In France, a timetable has been established for the gradual closure of services (telephony and Internet) on the copper network (for more information, see also Section 1.4.1 Operating activities - France):\n\n- -since the end of 2018: end of the marketing of new analog voice telephony lines;\n- -since 2020: end of the marketing of Internet services on copper to B2C customers where fiber is available;\n- -starting in 2026: complete discontinuation of the marketing of copper services;\n- -gradual phase-out and complete shutdown of the copper access network starting at the end of 2022 by geographic areas with an estimated completion in 2030.\n\n## Very high-speed broadband fiber optic access\n\nOrange has been rolling out FTTH access networks for over ten years,  using  a  point-to-multipoint  network  architecture  known as Passive Optical Network (PON). This architecture, based on passive fiber optic, has the advantage of being able to pool several technologies and several very high-speed broadband accesses on the same fiber.\n\n- 1\n\nterrestrial and submarine networks provide global connectivity for all services, voice and data, for which servers are often located on a different continent.\n\nA glossary defining several of the technical terms used in this section can be found in Section 7.2.2 at the end of this Registration Document.\n\nA common feature of all these networks is the continual increase in their capacity. Uses continue to expand, and traffic volumes are increasing across all Group networks. To anticipate this growth, which will continue over the coming years, the Group is investing in its networks to increase their capacity and performance while controlling their energy efficiency and reducing their environmental impact.\n\nThese  FTTH  access  networks  make  it  possible  to  offer  very high-speed broadband services: up to 2 Gbit/s using G-PON technology (1) and 10 Gbit/s using XGS-PON technology (2) .\n\nMost offers currently use G-PON technology, and offers using XGSPON technology are available in Spain (since 2022) and France (since 2023).\n\nCompared with other fixed access technologies, FTTH access networks  offer  improved  performance  in  terms  of  bandwidth, response times and energy efficiency.\n\nOrange offers FTTH connectivity in 17 countries and is the European leader in the number of accesses rolled-oud:\n\n- -in France, the roll-out of the FTTH network started in 2007. In 2011 and 2012, Orange signed sharing arrangements with other telecom operators to speed up the roll-out. In 2023, it continued  at  a  steady  pace,  and  Orange  consolidated  its leadership with a total of 37.4 million households connectable to Orange fiber optic at end-2023;\n- -the roll-out of FTTH networks is also continuing in Europe (excluding France), where by the end of 2023 Orange had more than 30.2 million connectable households, including 16.8 million in Spain and 8.0 million in Poland;\n- -in Africa & Middle East, by the end of 2023, the Group had connected 4.1 million homes to FTTH in Morocco, Jordan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Guinea.\n\nOrange shares its fixed-access network in its three main countries - France, Spain and Poland - and plans to share some future FTTH roll-outs with other operators via FiberCos, involving third parties. In 2021, Orange joined forces with long-term investors to create Orange Concession. France's leading operator of FTTH networks rolled out and operated on behalf of local authorities, Orange Concessions operates 24 Public Initiative Networks (PINs) representing 3.4 million homes connectable to fiber and nearly 1.5 million customers connected at end-2023, and nearly 4.6 million FTTH connections by 2025 (see Section 1.4.1 Operating activities - France). In Poland, Orange has created a 50%-owned FiberCo, whose objective is to roll out 1.7 million lines over the next five years to reach 2.4 million lines (see Section 1.4.2 Operating activities Europe).\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\n## Radio and satellite fixed access\n\nIn  certain  European  and  African  countries,  fixed  services  are provided through 4G/LTE and now 5G, in addition to copper and fiber optic networks.\n\nIn addition to copper, fiber and radio accesses, fixed residential accesses and satellite television services are marketed via space capacity rental.\n\nSince 2023, Orange has been offering a satellite service in mainland France through the Eutelsat Konnect VHTS satellite. This offer allows its most remotely located B2C and business customers to benefit from a very high-speed broadband experience (theoretically up to 200 Mbit/s downstream and 15 Mbit/s upstream) for the price of a fiber-optic offer.\n\n## Mobile-access networks\n\nThe GSM (2G), UMTS (3G), LTE (4G) and 5G access networks support voice and data communication services that reach average speeds of several tens of Mbit/s and up to several hundred in optimal conditions, allowing to easily send and receive voluminous content (audio, photo and video). The Group operates a mobile network in each of the countries where it offers B2C telecommunication services. The network supports GSM, UMTS and LTE technologies in all countries; in Europe, it also supports 5G. Between 2025 and 2030, the Group will gradually phase out its 2G and 3G networks in France and in all European Union countries where it operates. The phasing out of 2G and 3G will allow Orange to optimize the management of its networks and move them toward more secure, resilient, economical and energy-efficient technologies, such as 4G and 5G. Radio frequencies currently used for 2G and 3G will be re-used to improve the capacity and coverage of 4G and 5G networks in both urban and rural areas.\n\n5G technology improves connection speed to mobile services, with average speeds three to four times faster than 4G, thanks to smart antennae installed on existing 4G sites. Orange's 5G is now marketed in an NSA version (non-standalone, in other words based on a 5G spectrum but using a 4G core and an additional 4G anchor frequency band) in six countries in Europe (France, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain). It is initially being rolled out in urban areas where 4G is in high demand, and in areas with high levels of economic activity, as a complement to the other networks. On the African continent, Botswana and Jordan have commercially launched 5G NSA. 5G roll-outs are planned in all 17 countries in the very near future.\n\n5G SA  (standalone,  in  other  words,  operating  completely independently of 4G and having its own core network) makes it possible to improve latency but also to adapt the network and the quality of service according to the user needs by using network slicing technology: This technology consists of virtually dividing the network into several slices operating independently and thus offering different levels of mobile network performance according to customer needs (B2C, businesses, industrial campuses, etc.).\n\nIn 2023, Spain and Belgium launched their 5G SA network. The other four European countries that have already rolled out 5G NSA will commission 5G SA between 2024 and 2025.\n\nTo reduce its environmental impact and operating costs, Orange shares more than 65% of its radio sites with a partner or TowerCo. Sharing can be either 'passive' (confined to masts/rooftops only), or 'active' (masts/rooftops and active equipment). Sharing of this nature, which previously concerned 2G/3G/4G technologies, now includes 5G. Passive sharing is in place in almost all of the Group's host countries. Active sharing, which is more efficient, has mainly been adopted in the following countries:\n\n- -Poland, for nearly all of the mobile access network;\n- -Spain, where the mobile-access network is shared outside major cities;\n- -France, for 4G coverage of dead zones, including the 2,000 new sites of the New Deal program;\n- -Belgium,  where  an  active  mobile-access  network  sharing agreement was signed in 2019. Work to consolidate the two networks started at the end of 2021 and will take place over several years;\n- -Romania, for sites in rural areas and expanded to sites in urban areas.\n\nFor  several  years  now,  Orange  has  been  moving  its  RAN toward Open RAN and softwarization. As early as 2020, the first Cloud-native network was tested in France, then also in Spain, with the Pikeo initiative, which demonstrated some of the benefits of Open RAN: on the one hand, open interfaces make it possible to  combine  radio  transmitters  and  processors  from  different vendors; on the other hand, disaggregation between hardware and software makes it possible to roll out virtualized RAN functions on unified servers. Orange was thus able to illustrate the benefits of automation and the CI/CD and 'zero touch network' concepts, speeding up network management processes such as SW roll-out and upgrades, which will reduce operating expenses ('OPEX'). In mid-2023, Orange activated its first 4G (and soon 2G) Open RAN sites via a commercial network pilot in a rural area of, sharing a network with Vodafone in a world first. Open RAN is paving the way for more flexible network sharing, with independent vRAN software per operator, potentially from different vendors, on the same shared Cloud infrastructure. Initial results seem to confirm Open RAN's ability to rival traditional RAN in terms of performance and functional parity. These experiments are preparing Orange for large-scale roll-outs from 2025.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Group created a European TowerCo, Totem, which has a passive mobile infrastructure portfolio of nearly 27,300 sites in France and Spain. (See Section 1.4.5 Operating activities - Totem).\n\n## Energy savings\n\nIn 2023, the Group stepped up its Energy action plan to limit energy consumption and the associated CO 2 emissions (scope 2) against a backdrop of increasing traffic and significant coverage, to achieve the objectives set by the Lead the future strategic program. To do so, it committed to the following actions:\n\n- -maximizing the use of energy-saving features to minimize the consumption of mobile and fixed network equipment when traffic is low;\n- -maximizing the use of renewable energies via ESCos (Energy Services Companies) and solar farms in Africa & Middle East, PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements) and solar on grid solutions in Europe;\n- -stepping  up  the  decommissioning  of  legacy  technologies (e.g. copper, 2G, 3G) and migrating to more energy-efficient technologies;\n- -measuring and optimizing energy consumption at Data centers and strategic sites;\n- -rolling out a data collection solution for the technical environment and using a tool based on artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to optimize overall site consumption;\n- -maximizing passive and active infrastructure sharing.",

        "page_content": "## 1.5.2 National transmission and IP transport and control networks\n\nIn each country where it has B2C customers, Orange operates a network that is layered as follows:\n\n## Transmission network\n\nThe  transmission  network  primarily  consists  of  terrestrial  and submarine  fiber  optic,  as  well  as  radio  relay  systems  rolled out mainly in Africa & Middle East countries. These networks support voice and data traffic, for fixed and mobile B2C, B2B and wholesale services. The technologies proposed by the equipment manufacturers selected by Orange on optical links make it possible to achieve speeds of up to 800 Gbits/s per wavelength, and Dense Wavelength  Division  Multiplexing  (DWDM)  technology  allows capacities of 50 Tbits/s per fiber. Orange is one of the world leaders in the use of advanced optical functions to obtain more flexible and programmable transport networks.\n\n## IP transport network\n\nThe IP network consists of routers connected to the transmission network. In France, an IP network dedicated to businesses is also in operation, in addition to the network managing data for B2C customers. The main purpose of this network is to connect businesses' French sites for internal data exchange on a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and provide them with Internet connectivity. It also provides Voice over IP transport to businesses.\n\n## 1.5.3 International  networks\n\n## Terrestrial network\n\nThe international terrestrial network comprises four main networks, connected via submarine cable:\n\n- -the European network, whose roll-out began in April 2012 in France, and which has been extended to include services in Frankfurt, London, Barcelona and Madrid, as well as submarine cable stations;\n- -the North American network, one of Europe's most strategic routes.  According  to  Telegeography,  'with  571 Tbps  of international bandwidth used, the transatlantic remains by far the largest intercontinental route. It is twice as busy as the transpacific route, the second busiest in the world.' (Source: TeleGeography's Transport Networks - Transatlantic 2023);\n- -the Asian backbone in Singapore, served by the SEA-ME-WE3, SEA-ME-WE4 and SEA-ME-WEA 5 submarine cable; and\n- -Djoliba,  the  first  pan-African  backbone,  commissioned  in November 2020. This infrastructure is based on a terrestrial fiber optic network coupled with submarine cable, thereby offering secure international connectivity from West Africa. The new backbone covers eight countries: Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal.\n\nIn 2023, Orange was appointed coordinator of the FranceQCI consortium, which includes Airbus, CNRS, Cryptonext Security, France's Directorate General for Civil Aviation, Orange, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris, Thales, Thales Alenia Space, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur, Veriqloud and Welinq. As part of the Digital Europe program, this project represents a significant contribution in France to the objective of rolling out a secure quantum communication infrastructure for the EU (EuroQCI), and paves the way for the future European Quantum Information Network (QIN).\n\n## Control network\n\nThe control network (also known as the signaling network) manages calls and data connections, updates of location data for mobile phones, roaming and SMS. This network is being upgraded to new standards, for example to manage 5G.\n\n## Voice services network\n\nIn the countries in which it has fixed operations, Orange operates a  switched  telephone  network  (PSTN)  to  deliver  analog  voice and ISDN digital services. These networks are continually being optimized because of declining uses. In France, Orange stopped marketing  its  analog  voice  services  at  the  end  of  2018  and announced the first zones where voice services will only be available using IP technology from the end of 2023.\n\nOrange has also rolled out fixed VoIP networks using IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) technology in many countries for B2C and B2B uses.\n\nUntil 2015, all mobile voice traffic was managed in switched mode by the mobile network in each country. In 2015, Orange rolled out mobile IMS infrastructure in European countries to offer VoLTE (VoIP over LTE) and VoWiFi (mobile Voice over WiFi) services. At end-2021, VoLTE and VoWiFi had been rolled out in all of the Group's European networks and are being rolled out in some countries in the MEA region.\n\n## Satellites\n\nOrange  uses  satellite  communications  to  provide  VSAT  (Very Small Aperture Terminal) services to Orange Business's terrestrial or maritime B2B customers, to connect isolated mobile sites in Africa and to provide IP or voice connections to other operators. To provide these services, Orange uses space capacity rented from satellite operators (Eutelsat, Intelsat, SES and Arabsat). Orange is also forging partnerships with new players in the industry. In 2023, Orange announced a partnership with One Web and its low-Earth orbit constellation, which will improve and expand Orange's global connectivity, particularly in rural and remote areas of Europe, Latin America and Africa, strengthen its leading position in the mobile backhaul market in hard-to-reach areas such as certain African countries, and enhance Orange Business's offer for large, small and medium-sized businesses by providing resilient and low-latency broadband solutions.\n\nIn 2023, Orange was also selected to participate in the IRIS (1) industrial  consortium  for  the  sovereign  European  satellite constellation  project.  The  program  is  linked  to  the  European Commission's proposal on the EU's Global Gateway Strategy. It will enable the provision of affordable Internet access everywhere in Europe and will provide secure connectivity over geographical areas of strategic interest, such as the Arctic region and Africa.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

Due to the high cost of the investments required to construct a cable, these investments are carried out with the various players involved (operators, private companies and GAFAM) and in various forms (consortiums, purchase of user rights, transmission capacity rental, etc.).\n\nOrange is an investor in more than 40 submarine cables and consortiums covering various routes: North Atlantic, Caribbean, Europe-Asia and Europe-Africa.\n\nThe year 2023 was marked by the announcements in April that Orange had begun construction on the new submarine cable linking Tunisia and France as part of its association with the operator Medusa Submarine Cable System, with the support of the European Commission;  and  in  December  that  the  Amiti\u00e9  transatlantic submarine  cable  between  New  York  and  Europe  had  been commissioned. For more information about the announcements, see Section 1.3 Significant events.\n\nIn addition, over the course of 2023, the 2Africa consortium, of which Orange is a member, continued the gradual roll-out of the cable, with several landings in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia) and Africa (Kenya, South Africa, Madagascar, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Senegal, etc.). More than 45,000 kilometers long, its full commissioning is scheduled for the end of 2024 and will connect 33 countries in Africa, Asia and Europe. The cable, rated\n\nup to 180 TBps in key parts of the system, will increase capacity and improve Internet reliability and performance across much of Africa, and supplement rapidly growing capacity demand in the Middle East.\n\nLastly, the roll-out of two new submarine cables continued in 2023:\n\n- -Orange welcomed Digicel's Deep Blue One cable to Cayenne in December. The roll-out of the cable will continue in early 2024, with commissioning scheduled for the second quarter of 2024. This will allow Orange to improve connectivity in French Guiana by linking the territory to Trinidad;\n- -the SEA-ME-WE 6 consortium, in which Orange is heavily involved, is continuing construction of the 21,000-kilometer submarine cable that will link Singapore and Marseille in 2025. This will be connected to a cable serving four countries in the Middle East (Oman, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain).\n\n## International service control networks\n\nOrange operates an international control network to manage the signaling associated with the voice, roaming and text message traffic of its mobile networks and those of its operator customers. This network is evolving to handle new standards such as 5G.\n\nOrange also operates a network for the supply of voice services for international businesses, based on the international IP MPLS network.\n\nIn  addition,  several  centralized  platforms  were  rolled  out  on international  transit  points  to  provide  value-added  services  to mobile operators.\n\n## 1.5.4 Network Integration Factory\n\nIn 2023, the Network Integration Factory developed an industrial product to implement an automation chain for the integration and deployment of network functions. This automation chain is shared with all Orange subsidiaries and used by all manufacturers. It was deployed in Belgium and Spain in 2023, and is currently being rolled out in 2024 in France, Slovakia, Romania and Poland.\n\nThe first deployment in Belgium demonstrated that Orange is capable of automating the network functions of the 5G mobile core (SIG ORACLE) in 'GitOps' mode, enabling deployment in a matter of hours compared with the several weeks required when these evolutions are carried out manually. The aim now is to capitalize on these developments to replicate these automated deployments in the Group's other countries using this function.\n\n## 1.5.5 Network  resilience\n\nNetwork resilience ensuring continuity of services is an essential element of Orange's purpose as a trusted operator. Orange's network resilience approach focuses on:\n\n- -anticipation, by choosing the architectures most likely to resist hazards. This includes anticipating future climate conditions and the weather events they will produce;\n- -assessing the system's ability to anticipate and absorb potential disruptions, to develop ways to adapt to changes in the system itself (such as the introduction of a new technology, or external changes), and to enhance its ability to withstand disruptions and recover as quickly as possible after a shock.\n\nOrange's network resilience is built on:\n\nAutomation work began or continued over the year on network functions in the fixed access, transport and RAN domains, with a view to generalizing the model and enriching the number of network functions in the Network Integration Factory's catalog of services. The Network Integration Factory has also supplied Orange France with automated switch testing solutions for B2B and wholesale requirements, to reduce the time taken to complete validation campaigns from 4 days to 30 minutes. Work has also begun with Orange Marine to limit the downtime of its fleet of ships at sea by reducing the time taken to repair fibers whose measurements are automated.\n\n- -transmission and transport networks structured in loops in order to ensure a minimum service in the event of a branch outage;\n- -redundancy at various levels (sites, energy chains, equipment and servers) in order to compensate for failures of individual units;\n- -anticipation and prevention capabilities to detect and implement the first redundancy and diversity mechanisms. Historically, these capabilities referred to the robustness of the network;\n- -absorption capabilities with defense mechanisms, including congestion or overload control mechanisms;",

In\n\n2023, the Group devoted 613 million euros (i.e. 1.4% of its revenues) to furthering its research and innovation activities. This amount includes staff costs and operating and capital expenditure related to research and innovation in new products and services.\n\n## 1.6.1 Research and innovation\n\nOrange is a leading private player involved in digital research in France. The Group aims to be a committed player in current and future transformations including connectivity, especially with fiber, the networks of the future, responsible artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things on a large scale, and trusted digital technology with low environmental impact that meets the need for sovereignty. Orange aims to use research to improve daily life for everyone and to respond to major social challenges through innovative and responsible uses of new digital technologies. Bringing together its activities around the creation of strategic innovation, research and the implementation of technical and data policies for the Group, Orange  Innovation  is  the  driving  force  behind  this  innovation. Against the backdrop of rapid changes in its customers' uses and expectations, Orange Innovation is building competitive and value-creating assets for the Group.\n\nOrange is convinced that using data and AI in a responsible, useful and accessible way will open up new prospects for individuals, society and the planet. Orange is placing AI at the heart of its innovation model to support the company's growth as well as its social and environmental objectives, focusing on three major areas: making networks smarter, improving operational efficiency and reinventing the customer experience. Orange established its Data and AI Ethics Council in 2021 with this in mind, and in 2022 it signed an Ethics and Responsibility Charter (1) in order to specify its values. To facilitate access to reliable, high-quality data, a 'data democracy' strategy has been launched as part of a secure, controlled approach. It relies on the adoption of cutting-edge AI and data tools and a change in operating methods. Moreover, against  a  technological  backdrop  that  has  been  profoundly transformed by the emergence of generative AI, Orange seeks to develop its use and step up its dissemination within the company itself to create more value in all its business lines, networks and interactions with customers. In order to develop key skills around AI within all the Group's business lines, Orange offers its employees a comprehensive range of training courses, covering topics such as acculturation (in particular to generative AI) and technical training for business lines and experts. The Group has also enhanced its range of upskilling and professional retraining courses for its employees, as well as two Data Analyst and Data Scientist courses as part of the Orange Apprentice Training Center.\n\nSupplying its customers with the best connectivity is key to Orange's strategy. Several innovations are currently being developed or tested which are likely to provide solutions in the coming years to improve connectivity, achieve the 'Net Zero Carbon by 2040' commitment, develop new services and improve the quality of service provided to its customers.\n\nThus, 5G technology improves connection speed to mobile services, with average speeds three to four times faster than 4G, thanks to 5G smart antennae installed on existing 4G sites. 5G is also more energy efficient than 4G, making it a significant lever for the Group to achieve its commitment to be Net Zero Carbon by 2040. In 2022, an important stage of preparing, testing and rolling out new 5G Stand Alone (SA) network cores was initiated in the European countries in which Orange operates. In 2023, Spain and Belgium launched their 5G SA networks. Other European countries that have already rolled out 5G NSA will commission 5G SA between 2024 and 2025. 5G SA brings increased performance in terms of upload speed for the end user and lower latency. With network slicing, which consists of virtually cutting the 5G network into slices, it will be possible to specialize certain slices to cover critical uses or specific needs and offer different levels of quality and security. 5G SA and network slicing will allow Orange to develop its range of mobile private network solutions. Through the Orange 5G Lab initiative launched in 2021, Orange is proposing a real network of 19 sites worldwide to help economic players better understand the opportunities, value and utility of 5G. Nearly 3,700 businesses, start-ups or local authorities have gone through an Orange 5G Lab since their launch, among which 275 businesses have been supported in testing use cases, particularly in environments benefiting from advanced private 5G network and/or edge computing features.\n\nTo optimize the management of its networks and move them toward more secure, resilient, energy-efficient and modern technologies such as 4G and 5G, Orange has announced the phasing out of 2G and 3G networks between 2025 and 2030 in all the European Union countries in which it is present. Radio frequencies currently used for 2G and 3G will be used to improve the capacity and coverage of 4G and 5G networks in both urban and rural areas. The customer experience on mobile will be improved with better voice quality via VoLTE, higher throughput, lower latency and enhanced security, with no major impact on almost every offer.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nIn order to best meet the connectivity needs of customers, Orange has carried out the first NB-IoT and 5G SA roll-outs in addition to the networks already rolled out in Europe. In the B2C market, since 2021 Orange has offered 'Protected Home' remote surveillance in France, and has also marketed a service in Spain that allows users to monitor their homes themselves using a high-resolution WiFi camera and a mobile app. In the B2B market, Orange also provides two turnkey solutions, 'smart operations' and 'smart eco energy,' in order to continue to support businesses and local authorities in the democratization of IoT uses. Also in response to customers' connectivity needs, Orange confirmed its commitment to the IoT market and the LoRaWAN standard at Sido 2023, the Internet of Things trade show. This technology is renowned for its efficiency in both static and mobile environments, guaranteeing optimized energy consumption for connected devices.\n\nSince 2021, Orange has launched several initiatives to realize its vision for the future of the networks. This vision is that of ambient connectivity. It relies on networks that are more versatile, secure, powerful, resilient and designed to limit their environmental impact. Increasingly mature key technologies such as software networks, edge computing, virtualization and AI are enabling a new era of connectivity  capable  of  better  meeting  customer  needs  and adapting to services and breakdowns in real time, automatically and autonomously. For example, the work carried out in 2023 on Open RAN in Romania with Vodafone seems to confirm the ability of Open RAN to rival traditional RAN, allowing Orange to plan larger-scale roll-outs from 2025 onward. Orange is also involved in several initiatives with other operators and the telecoms industry to promote the emergence of open and interoperable European Open RAN and Telco Cloud solutions.\n\nIn terms of the environment, Orange is continuing to reduce the impact of its activities and those of its customers. Orange has continued to work on the energy efficiency of its infrastructure (networks and Data centers). The Green ITN program has already reduced the Group's energy consumption linked to network and information  system  operations  (see  Section 4.2.4.1  Orange's energy consumption and scopes 1, 2 and 3 CO 2 emissions). It relies in particular on the energy efficiency of new equipment and next-generation Data centers designed to use air conditioning as little as possible, as well as the use of AI to further reduce energy consumption from networks. Since 2022, an app has enabled Orange  subsidiaries  to  visualize  the  reduction  in  their  energy consumption and the associated carbon emissions, in connection with  the  actions  implemented.  Orange  has  also  continued  to solarize mobile sites in Europe and particularly in the MEA region (Madagascar and Senegal). It has also worked to solarize Data centers in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso. In addition, Orange continues to expand its supply of renewable energy in Europe through long-term contracts with local suppliers. This has been the case in France, Spain and Poland in particular. Orange has also developed 2030 carbon trajectory models for use in assessing different  emission  reduction  scenarios  aiming  to  achieve  the emission reduction targets set by the Group for 2030. Several 2030 trajectory models have already been implemented: mobile devices, home equipment, network infrastructure and Data centers. These models have been tested and validated in Orange France and will be rolled out to the Group's other regions in 2024, so that each country can fine-tune the levers to be applied. In 2023, Orange Innovation created a guide to assess the carbon footprint of a digital service from concept to end of life. The guide identifies the main sources of carbon emissions and helps to implement actions\n\nto reduce them. Since 2022, Orange has been making it easier to calculate the carbon footprint of its Enterprise offers thanks to a tool made available to its sales force; in 2023, the tool was enhanced with new services. Orange aims to systematize the eco-design of its products and services in order to help reduce their environmental impact. A methodological framework and training course are now available to project managers, product managers, experts and project contributors for Group entities. Following the launch of Livebox 6 in France in 2022, Orange launched Livebox 7, whose eco-design approach has been awarded the 'Footprint Progress' certification by Bureau Veritas. Livebox 7 is also designed to take full advantage of the latest generation of fiber, anticipating the uses that will expand in the years to come, as well as network capacities.\n\nOrange  wishes  to  advance  the  consideration  of  social  and environmental  expectations  in  relation  to  technology.  After presenting its vision of 6G in a white paper published in 2022, the Group became a member of the Chaire 6G Durable with Centrale Sup\u00e9lec, the University of Paris Saclay and the CNRS. Involved in  several  major  initiatives  around  this  technology,  Orange  is coordinating a working group within the European research project Hexa-X-II, tasked with reflecting on the use cases and target characteristics of a 6G network, and establishing a dialogue with representatives of society with a view to co-designing what 6G will be like upstream of its specification.\n\nOrange's research and innovation activities are conducted within the framework of an Open Innovation strategy to capture trends, find original solutions and benefit from the Group's partners' skills and contributions.\n\nThis is reflected in a number of developments:\n\n- -Orange signed and launched nearly 92 partnership contracts with  the  world's  top  University  research  centers  between 2020 and 2023, and has also set up four joint laboratories: one with INRIA on the virtualization of network functions; one on antennas with the University of Nice; and one with the University of Grenoble-Alpes on health, and with Lab'Optic on fiber measurements and bench testing. It is also involved in the b<>com Institut de Recherche Technologique, and is contributing to 77 national and European cooperative projects, including through its involvement in seven competitiveness clusters (including the chair of the Images & R\u00e9seaux cluster) as part of a network of more than 150 industrial and academic stakeholders.  Orange  also  funds  seven  research  chairs, including one with Centrale Sup\u00e9lec on sustainable 6G;\n- -Orange is also involved in several research projects in France (Quantum@UCA, ParisRegionQCI, France QCI) and in Europe (EuroQCI,  Prometheus)  around  quantum  communication networks with numerous academic, industrial and start-up partners;\n- -many start-ups benefit from Orange's support through a number of initiatives, including the Orange Fab program, which offers programs to accelerate and internationalize start-up businesses in 21 countries. The Group also supports female start-up creators with #FemmesEntrepreuses and Women Start, as well as the best positive-impact technology projects in Africa & Middle East, with the Orange Prize for Social Entrepreneurship in Africa & Middle East (known by its French acronym, POESAM - Prix Orange de l'Entrepreneur Social en Afrique et au MoyenOrient). It is also part of various global networks and events, including the Business France and French Tech networks;",

Business leaders, experts,\n\n- 1\n\ninstitutions, research centers, academics, and journalists were presented a collection of the latest innovations and research work from all the Group's entities through over 60 demonstrations and 20 mini-conferences. Several themes were highlighted: New retail connectivity, Cybersecurity, Telco as a platform and Customer experience. With its firm belief that the visibility of its innovations can generate opportunities and synergies, Orange Innovation has become a catalyst for innovation.\n\n## 1.6.2 Intellectual Property and Licensing\n\nThe  Intellectual  Property  and  Licensing  Department  protects, manages and adds value to Orange's patent portfolio, which is one of the Group's intangible assets; it also derives value from software. It is an asset that sets Orange apart from its academic and industry partners. Its role is also to defend the Group's interests in the event of disputes involving intellectual property:\n\n- -at December 31, 2023, the Orange group had a portfolio of more than 10,500 patents or patent applications in France and abroad protecting its innovations. To maximize their value, some patents are licensed through patent pools for patents pertaining\n\n## 1.6.3 Capital  investment\n\nAs a keen major financer of innovation in information technology, the Orange group has made financial commitments to this area via two key complementary investment channels: Orange Ventures and Orange Digital Investment . As well as generating a profit, these investments aim to sustain the Group's innovation, forge strategic, technological  and/or  commercial  partnerships,  and  enhance the Group's image within the innovation ecosystem and with its customers and other stakeholders:\n\n- -Orange Ventures , wholly owned by the Group: at the end of 2020, Orange strengthened its venture capital activity by creating Orange Ventures, a new company with a budget of 350 million euros. Orange Ventures invests in fast-growing companies in Orange's established business areas such as connectivity, cybersecurity, data AI, the digital enterprise or innovative financial services. Orange Ventures also invests in innovative companies in the fields of e-health, climate and the circular economy, in line with the Group's inclusion and carbon footprint reduction targets.\n\nOrange  Ventures  supports  start-ups  at  all  stages  of  their development, from the seed stage in Africa & Middle East, to more mature phases in Europe and the United States, with unit investments of up to 20 million euros per round of fundraising.\n\nOrange Ventures serves to promote the emergence of future technological champions, helping drive the transition to an increasingly digital and responsible world in the service of the greatest number in order to share their innovation capabilities,\n\nto industry standards (e.g. NFC, MPEG Audio, WiFi, HEVC, 5G, neural coding, VVC, VP9-AV1, etc.). Value maximization also concerns software such as engineering tools for the mobile network;\n\n- -in 2023, 212 new inventions were patented, including major technical  contributions  to  standardization  (5G,  coding, video, etc.). These inventions mainly come from the Group's Innovation Research Centers in France and abroad;\n- -in France, Orange is ranked twelfth in the INPI 2022 ranking (source: INPI 2022 ranking, March 2023).\n\nfor the Group's customers or within operations, and the creation of synergies between Orange and start-ups;\n\n- -investment  funds  run  by  management  companies  outside Orange. They have also helped respond to new challenges, particularly  Orange's  commitment  to  achieving  Net  Zero Carbon by 2040. Over the last 20 years, the Group has made investment commitments of 350 million euros as follows:\n- -the Iris Venture IV and Iris Next funds and the three Orange Publicis Ventures funds (Growth, Global and Early Stage), created within the framework of a partnership with the Publicis group,\n- -the Raise Investissement, Raise Ventures and Raise Seed for Good funds,\n- -several  'thematic'  funds,  including  Robolution  Capital, \u00c9comobilit\u00e9 Ventures focused on digital and sustainable mobility, Digital Health 2 focused on digital health, and Venture Reality Fund 2 focused on augmented reality,\n- -two funds focused mainly on investments in Africa: Partech Africa, managed by Partech Partners, and the FrenchAfrican Fund (AfricInvest),\n- -two  investment  funds,  Paris-Saclay  Seed  Fund  and Seedcamp IV, investing in start-ups in the seed capital phase.\n\nThe Group is also committed to two natural capital funds whose purpose  is  to  finance  environmental  carbon  sequestration projects, with compensation in carbon credits (see Section 4.2.1.4 Implementation of the carbon sequestration program).\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\n## 1.7 Regulation of telecommunication activities\n\nIn the countries where it operates, the Orange group has to comply with various regulatory obligations governing the provision of its electronic communications products and services, primarily relating to obtaining and renewing telecommunication licenses, as well as oversight by the relevant regulatory authorities seeking to maintain\n\neffective  competition  in  electronic  communications  markets. Orange is also subject to specific regulatory constraints in some countries due to its dominant position in the relevant markets. The risks related to the regulation of the electronic communications sector are described in Section 2.1.2 Legal risks.\n\n## 1.7.1 European  Union\n\n## 1.7.1.1 Legal and regulatory framework\n\nThe European Union has laid down a common legal framework in order to harmonize the regulation of electronic communications. It is binding on the Member States and must be implemented by the National Regulatory Authorities.\n\nThe general legal framework of the European Union has been amended by the European Electronic Communications Code, which came into force on December 20, 2018. It revises and combines four main directives deriving from the 2002 Telecoms Package on:\n\n- -a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services;\n- -the authorization of electronic communications networks and services;\n- -access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities;\n- -universal  service  and  users'  rights  relating  to  electronic communications networks and services.\n\nFurthermore,  Regulation  (EC)  1211/2009  of  November 25, 2009, canceled and replaced by Regulation (EU) 2018/1971 of December 11, 2018, established the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC).\n\nThis  legal  framework  is  supplemented  by  sector-based  texts (international roaming, open Internet, etc.), as well as broader texts aimed at the European digital ecosystem (protection of privacy, etc.).\n\n## 1.7.1.2 Main community texts in force\n\n## The European Electronic Communications Code\n\nThe European Electronic Communications Code (Directive (EU) 2018/1972) came into force on December 20, 2018. The Member States  then  had  24 months  to  transpose  it  into  national  law. However, due to the health crisis, the transposition has not yet been fully completed in certain countries, particularly in some countries within Orange's European area.\n\nThe Code includes a regulatory objective to support the roll-out and adoption of very high-connectivity networks, in line with Orange's aim of seeing regulatory objectives redirected toward support for investment.\n\nIn  addition,  the  rules  governing access  obligations imposed on operators with significant market power have been positively adjusted in relation to the previous framework:\n\n- -access obligations should better target only the relevant fixed access infrastructure so as to address competition issues in the retail market;\n\n- -the Code promotes co-investment in very high-connectivity networks.  If  an  operator  in  a  dominant  position  makes  a co-investment offer that complies with certain provisions, it could be exempted from remedies related to its dominant status. Only co-investors will have access to the full capacity of these networks. The other operators will be able to enjoy the same quality of wholesale access as they did before the roll-out of the networks. National regulators will need to secure approval from the European Commission for such measures;\n- -the Code also favors the wholesale operator model - not present in the retail market - by exempting it from certain remedies, even in cases of market dominance.\n\nIn  addition,  access  obligations  for  fixed-access  infrastructure serving subscribers may be imposed symmetrically on all operators when it is not technically feasible or economically reasonable to replicate such infrastructure. These obligations are subject to a joint veto by the European Commission and BEREC.\n\nConcerning  the allocation  of  radio  spectrum needed  for mobile services, the Code reinforces European rules designed to improve harmonization and cooperation between Member States, including the minimum 20-year visibility of spectrum licenses. The implementation and in particular the allocation of spectrum capacity remains a national matter, with only light oversight by Europe. Provisions facilitating the roll-out of 'small-area wireless access points' and the availability schedule of the 5G spectrum were also adopted.\n\nWith  respect  to  the regulation  of  communication  services , most of the obligations intended to protect end-users are for Internet access service and services using public numbering plan resources, independently of the service provider. Other services, such as interpersonal communication services independent of the numbering plan and signal transport services, are only subject to a limited number of obligations.\n\nHowever, regulation of the competitive markets for intra-European calls  and  SMS  has  been  introduced  through  Regulation  (EU) 2018/1971 of December 11, 2018, imposing a cap of 19 euro cents per minute and 6 euro cents per SMS, applicable since May 15, 2019.\n\nConcerning universal service obligations , the Code abandons the principle of telephone service provision and calls on Member States to ensure the availability of an affordable Internet access service, upholding the principle of potential designation should Member States consider that the market does not provide such services under said conditions, but increasing the burden of proof for Member States. The financing system for the universal service remains in the hands of the Member States, with coverage from public funds or from a fund financed by the sector. In addition, the Code opens the door to an extension of universal service obligations to include the supply of affordable mobile services.",

        "page_content": "The Code and its associated regulation on changes in BEREC's responsibilities and governance do not create a European regulator. However, the Code does adopt the principle of full standardization of the rights of end-users, subject to exceptions, and strengthens the control exercised by the European Commission over access regulation and over the spectrum.\n\n## Harmonization of analyses of relevant markets\n\nOn December 18, 2020, the European Commission published a new recommendation identifying two relevant product and service markets for which National Regulatory Authorities should carry out market analyses that may lead to the implementation of ex-ante regulation:\n\n- -market 1: wholesale provision of local access at a fixed location (formerly market 3a/2014 of Recommendation 2014/710/EC);\n- -market 2: wholesale provision of high-quality access at a fixed location (formerly market 4/2014 of Recommendation 2014/710/ EC).\n\n## Call termination rates\n\nThe Code provides that fixed and mobile call termination rates will cease to be determined by National Regulatory Authorities but will be determined by the European Commission for all countries in the European Economic Area. This provision concerns European operators for calls terminating in a European country.\n\nThe new Regulation:\n\n- -sets new wholesale roaming price caps:\n- -Voice: 0.022 euros per minute from July 1, 2022 to the end of 2024 and 0.019 euros per minute starting in 2025,\n- -SMS: 0.004 euros per SMS message from July 1, 2022 to the end of 2024, and 0.003 euros per SMS message starting in 2025,\n- -data:\n\n| 2022       | 2023         | 2024          | 2025         | 2026         | Starting  in 2027   |\n|------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|\n| 2 euros/Gb | 1.8 euros/Gb | 1.55 euros/Gb | 1.3 euros/Gb | 1.1 euros/Gb | 1 euro/Gb           |\n\n- -requires that, if the same conditions are available in the country visited, the quality of service provided on roaming is identical to that offered on the domestic market (unless technically impossible);\n- -provides for the creation by BEREC of databases on means of accessing emergency services and value-added services;\n- -requires greater transparency vis-\u00e0-vis customers, in particular about rates, the risks of high rates, and the means to access emergency services.\n\nBEREC has revised its guidelines to include the changes introduced by the new Roaming Regulation, in particular the rules related to the quality of service to be provided while roaming. In addition, the new guidelines recognize the principle of gradual transition to new generations of technologies and gradual updates of roaming agreements  to  provide  conditions  equivalent  to  those  of  the Member State of origin.\n\nIn addition, on December 6, 2022, a coalition of operators signed, under the aegis of the European Commission, a joint press release aimed at voluntarily implementing lower rates for data roaming with the Western Balkan countries starting in the summer of 2023.\n\n## Regulation of the open Internet\n\nThe TSM Regulation has introduced rules to ensure an open Internet within the European Union. Article 3.3 of the TSM Regulation states that in the provision of Internet access services, providers shall treat traffic equally and without discrimination, restriction or interference,\n\nirrespective of sender and recipient, the content consulted or broadcast, the apps or services used or provided, and the handset equipment used. It is up to the Member States to adapt their national law to comply with this provision.\n\nOn April 30, 2019, the European Commission published a report on the implementation of the net neutrality component of the TSM Regulation. The Commission, in the light of market developments, concluded that the principles of the Regulation are appropriate and that they effectively protect end-users by promoting the Internet as a driver of innovation. The Commission pointed out that operators have correctly applied the regulation governing net neutrality and that national regulators have imposed very few fines. It does not propose any amendments to this Regulation.\n\nOn the basis of that report, BEREC published a new version of its guidelines in June 2020, clarifying certain points:\n\n- -the scope of the regulation is limited to the part between the interconnection and the customer-side network termination point, thus leaving the terminal equipment outside the scope when it is located beyond that termination point;\n- -the possible compatibility of 5G slicing technologies with the regulation.\n\nOn June 15, 2022, BEREC published an update to its guidelines clarifying, following rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Union, that zero-rating practices do not comply with the Open Internet Regulation.\n\n- 1\n\nIn  this  context,  on  April 22,  2021,  the  European  Commission published Delegated Act 2021/654 determining call termination rates:\n\n- -the fixed call termination rate is set at 0.07 euro cents per minute;\n- -the mobile call termination rate is set at 0.2 euro cents per minute. However, a glide path is planned until the end of 2023: the maximum call termination rate for countries with rates above 0.2 euro cents per minute was 0.55 euro cents per minute in 2022 and then 0.4 euro cents per minute in 2023.\n\nThe Delegated Act entered into force on July 1, 2021.\n\n## International roaming\n\nRegulation  (EU)  2015/2120  of  November 25,  2015  (Telecom Single Market or TSM), which aims to eliminate surcharges for international roaming within the European Union, and Regulation (EU) 2017/920 of May 17, 2017, which lays down the rules for wholesale roaming markets, expired on June 30, 2022. The new Regulation (EU) 2022/612 on international roaming was adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council of the European Union on April 6, 2022 and came into force on July 1, 2022 for a period of 10 years.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nOn  April 28,  2023,  the  European  Commission  published  its assessment of the rules on Open Internet access. According to this report (1) , the Commission found that the Regulation continues to guarantee the essential balance between the protection of end-users' rights and the support of a competitive environment in the EU's Digital Single Market.\n\n## Personal data protection\n\nThe  European  Commission  wishes  to  replace  the  sectoral Directive 2002/58/EC of July 12, 2002 on privacy and electronic communications, known as the e-Privacy Directive. The project, which dates from 2017, establishes rules to protect the privacy of online communications and the use of electronic communications data (metadata). It introduces a level of fines that is aligned with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in 2018 (2) , and maintains the regulatory asymmetry between telecommunication  operators  and  digital  actors  (OTT  service providers) regarding metadata collection.\n\nHowever, the e-Privacy regulation project is made less urgent by the fact that the Code has extended the scope of application of the confidentiality of communications to OTT services, and that the GDPR has strengthened the methods used to collect consent and the regime of sanctions to which the 2002 Directive refers. Moreover, the lack of political agreement on the new text makes its approval uncertain.\n\n## Digital Services Act and Digital Market Act\n\nAt the end of 2020, the European Commission published two pieces of legislation: an update of the e-Commerce Directive (3) , known as the Digital Services Act (DSA), and a Regulation to combat the role of large online platforms, known as the Digital Market Act (DMA).\n\nThe DSA amends and updates the obligations of intermediaries connecting  consumers  with  goods,  services  and  content.  Its main aim is to prevent illegal and harmful activities online, as well as the spread of disinformation. However, as far as electronic communications operators are concerned, the DSA only makes limited changes compared with the Electronic Commerce Directive.\n\nThe DSA (4) , published in the Official Journal on October 27, 2022, entered into force on November 16, 2022. However, it will be implemented in stages:\n\n- -platforms and search engines had until February 17, 2023 to report their number of users, which is used to designate the main platforms and Internet search engines provided for by the text, for which specific obligations exist;\n- -since the end of August 2023, the new rules have therefore applied to the main platforms and engines. Of these, 17 are very large online platforms (VLOP) and 2 are very large online search engines (VLOSE), with more than 45 million users in the EU;\n- -from  February 17,  2024,  the  DSA  rules  will  apply  to  all intermediaries.\n\nFor its part, the DMA ushers in an ex-ante regulatory framework for  online  platforms  acting  as  gatekeepers,  and  also  gives the  European  Commission  broad  powers  to  conduct  market investigations. Telecommunication operators are outside the scope of the regulation. The DMA (5) was published in the Official Journal on October 12, 2022, entered into force on November 1, 2022, and became applicable from May 2, 2023. On September 5, 2023, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft were the first gatekeepers designated by the European Commission under the DMA. These companies will have to comply with their new obligations by early March 2024.\n\n## Access Recommendation (Gigabit Connectivity)\n\nOn  February  6, 2024,  the  European  Commission  adopted the  recommendation  on  the  regulatory  promotion  of  Gigabit connectivity.  It  replaces  the  2010  Recommendation  on  Next Generation Access (NGA) and the 2013 Recommendation on NonDiscrimination  and  Pricing  Methodologies  (NDCM),  collectively referred to as 'Access Recommendations'. It aims to update and align the Recommendation with the European Code of Electronic Communications (EECC), with particular emphasis on promoting access and adopting very high capacity networks (VHCN).\n\nThis  Recommendation (6) aims  to  create  regulatory  incentives and generate the necessary investments to achieve connectivity objectives at EU level. In particular, it defines a common approach to promote 'consistent and effective implementation' of access obligations imposed by National Regulatory Authorities on operators with significant market power under market analyses. In order to ensure fair competition, it intends to promote the deployment of gigabit networks by ensuring that all operators can have access to existing network infrastructures regulated under market analysis (especially in the context of the copper network shutdown).\n\nAdopted by the European Commission on February 6, 2024, the text entered into force three days after its publication in the Official Journal on February 19, 2024.\n\nThis text is a non-binding act for National Regulatory Authorities, but will be applied by the European Commission when it receives an opinion from a regulatory authority on a draft market analysis under the procedure provided for in the European Code for Electronic Communications.\n\n## 'Gigabit Infrastructure Act' (GIA) Regulation\n\nThis text will replace the current 2014 Broadband Cost Reduction Directive  (BCRD).  It  follows  the  conclusions  of  the  European Commission  in  2018  which  pointed  to  inconsistencies  in implementation in the EU and inefficiencies.\n\nThe GIA, which focuses solely on Very High Connectivity Networks (VHCN)  aims  to  align  the  rules  for  achieving  the  EU's  2030 connectivity targets. It intends to promote the deployment of 5G and fibre optic networks within the European Union by harmonizing the systems in force (including simplification, harmonisation and acceleration of administrative authorisations, thus reducing the administrative burden and costs of deploying fibre and 5G).\n\nThe  provisional  agreement  reached  on  this  text  on  February 6, 2024 was validated by the European Council. It is expected to be formally adopted by the European Parliament plenary by the end of April 2024 and then formally adopted by the European Council. The regulation will enter into force 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the EU and will be directly applicable in all Member States 18 months after its entry into force (no transposition into national law is required, but flexibility in the application of the text is granted to Member States on certain provisions).\n\nThe main measures finally adopted are:\n\n- -extension of the scope of the regulation, covering a large number of owners (not telecoms operators) of physical infrastructures that can be mobilized for the deployment of fixed and mobile networks, including the addition of public sector infrastructures;\n- -details of pricing arrangements when telecom operators access regulated  infrastructure.  These  tariff  obligations  (imposed through 'fair and reasonable' conditions) still do not guarantee the recovery of all costs incurred, while not actually preventing excessive prices;",

It has powers to sanction non-compliant operators and can rule, in particular, on disputes between operators over technical and pricing conditions for network access and interconnection. Arcep also allocates spectrum and numbering resources. Finally, it determines the size of contributions to fund universal service obligations and oversees the mechanisms for delivering this funding.\n\nThe French Competition Authority is an independent administrative authority responsible for ensuring open market competition and compliance with public economic policy. It has jurisdiction over all  business  sectors,  including  electronic  communications.  It has powers to sanction anti-competitive practices, as well as consultative powers. It is also responsible for overseeing mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe ANFr (Agence nationale des fr\u00e9quences - French national spectrum  agency)  is  responsible  for  planning,  managing  and controlling  the  usage  of  radio  spectrum  and  for  coordinating the  establishment  of  certain  radio  transmission  facilities.  The frequency spectrum is divided between 11 controlling authorities: public authorities, Arcep and ARCOM (Autorit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gulation de la communication audiovisuelle et num\u00e9rique - French Regulatory Authority for Audiovisual and Digital Communication).

The obligations and commitments made by the operators beyond 2021 were incorporated into the new authorizations granted in December 2018 (Decision 2018-1392) for ten years from the expiration of the previous authorizations.\n\n## 5G\n\n## 3.4-3.8 GHz band in mainland France\n\nAt the end of the procedure for the allocation of 5G spectrum in the 3,490-3,800 MHz band, the spectrum use authorizations issued by Arcep came into effect on November 18, 2020. The spectrum allocated to Orange is in the 3,710-3,800 MHz band, i.e. a block of 90 MHz in time-division duplexing (TDD) mode. The spectrum is allocated for 15 years, with the possibility of a five-year extension if the licensee agrees to the terms of the extension. The total price of the spectrum allocated to Orange is 854 million euros. The payment of this sum is spread over 15 years (350 million euros for the 50 MHz block obtained at the reserve price in return for optional commitments), and over four years (504 million euros for the 40 MHz block obtained during the main auction phase). In the Official Journal of November 11, 2023, the government published a decree (1) deferring payment of the remaining fixed share of fees due for the use by operators of the 3.5 GHz band in mainland France. It alters the payment schedule for the remaining fixed share as follows:\n\n- -the balance of 280 million euros due for the 50 MHz block obtained at the reserve price is divided into 8 equal installments over 8 years, payable annually from November 1, 2028;\n- -the balance of 126 million euros due for the 40 MHz block obtained during the main auction phase is divided into 3 equal installments  over  3 years,  payable  on  January 1,  2026, January 1, 2027 and January 1, 2028.\n\n## The obligations are as follows:\n\n- -for the roll-out of sites using spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band (i.e. 3,000 sites at end-2022, 8,000 sites at end-2024 and 10,500 sites at end-2025): 25% of the sites rolled out by the end of 2024 and the end of 2025 must be located in rural areas and industrial areas outside very densely populated areas;\n- -widespread availability of a 5G service at all sites by the end of 2030, an obligation that may be met either with the 3.4-3.8 GHz band or another band;\n- -provision of a speed of at least 240 Mbits/s from 75% of sites by the end of 2022, 85% of sites by the end of 2024, 90% of sites by the end of 2025, and 100% of sites by the end of 2030;\n- -coverage of the main highways (approximately 17,000 km) by the end of 2025 and major roadways (approximately 55,000 km) by the end of 2027, for moving vehicles, with 5G service and a download speed of 100 Mbit/s for these two types of roads;\n- -the provision of differentiated services, i.e. the coexistence of several different services in terms of performance or quality of service on the same mobile network, by the end of 2023;\n- -the activation of the IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) network protocol from December 31, 2020.\n\nIn addition, Orange made commitments (which became obligations in the authorization issued) to obtain a 50 MHz block at the reserve price:\n\n- -from the end of 2023, Orange must provide a fixed Internet access service on its mobile network with sites using the 3.5 GHz band;\n- -Orange must provide a very high-speed fixed wireless access offer and a very high-speed fixed wholesale access offer to provide an alternative solution to local users who receive fixed Internet access services from fixed-access radio networks for which the authorization expires no later than July 2026;\n- -from  the  introduction  of  differentiated  commercial  service offers, Orange must respond to reasonable requests for the provision of services from 'verticals' (2) who are end-users of electronic communications services;",

In this context, Orange carried out experiments to explore the technical and service prospects of this band. Arcep has maintained the experimental framework to learn more about this 'millimetric' band, whose use cases and ecosystem are still to be established.\n\n## 3.8-4.2 GHz  band\n\nIn October 2021, the government commissioned a report from Philippe  Herbert  on  industrial  5G.  The  report,  published  in March 2022, outlines recommendations for the development of industrial 5G in France. It led to the opening of an experimental window by the government and Arcep, giving access to the 3.84 GHz band for industrial players in any sector (including mobile operators) from March 2022. This was replicated in 2023.\n\nOrange  has  several  experimental  authorizations.  It  should  be noted that the entire 3.8-4.2 GHz band is currently allocated to satellite fixed stations. This is undergoing technical harmonization at the European level to establish a technical framework for the coexistence of satellite systems and 5G radio systems.\n\n## Allocations overseas\n\n## Departments of R\u00e9union and Mayotte:\n\nOn May 24, 2022, following the auction for the allocation of 5G spectrum for the territories of R\u00e9union and Mayotte, Arcep issued Orange authorizations for 10 MHz frequencies in the 700 MHz band and 100 MHz in the 3.5 GHz band for R\u00e9union, and 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band for Mayotte, for a period of 15 years, i.e. until May 23, 2037, with the possibility of a five-year extension. Orange must comply with the obligations under these authorizations, namely:\n\n- -coverage of seven predefined areas before May 1, 2025 and two sites at locations made available (roll-out for these two sites within 18 months, on a case-by-case basis);\n- -supply, using the spectrum in the 700 MHz band, of very high-speed broadband mobile access from at least 50% of mobile network sites and, in any event, from at least 10 sites, as of May 24, 2027;\n- -introduction of voice and SMS options over Wi-Fi, applicable to all its offers with a compatible device, no later than May 23, 2024 (in R\u00e9union) and May 23, 2025 (in Mayotte), with the aim of providing indoor coverage;\n- -provision of a fixed Internet access service on the mobile network  no  later  than  November 23,  2022,  in  the  areas identified and made public in accordance with the provisions of Arcep Decision 2018-0169 of February 22, 2018 (1) , particularly for premises without fixed access to an Internet service with a download speed of at least 8 Mbit/s;\n\n- 1\n\n- -lastly, Orange will also have to provide, using spectrum in the 3.4-3.8 GHz band, mobile access from at least 50% of sites with a power greater than 5 W and, in any case, at least 50 sites as of May 24, 2027.\n\n## West Indies - Guyana area\n\nAt the end of September 2022, the government launched procedures for allocating 5G spectrum in Guyana and in the northern islands (Saint-Martin and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy) by publishing decrees on the terms and conditions for the allocation of authorizations:\n\n- -for Guyana, the allocations concern the 700 MHz bands (for the entire territory) and the 3.4-3.8 GHz band only for the coastal municipalities with the exception of Regina and Ouanari;\n- -in  Saint-Martin  and  Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy,  they  concern  the 700 MHz and the 3.4-3.8 GHz bands for each territory, and the 900 MHz and 2.1 GHz bands in Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy.\n\nThe allocation procedures were completed in July 2023. Arcep granted the successful candidates spectrum licenses for these bands on July 25, 2023.\n\nOrange received the following authorization:\n\n- -Guyana: 10 MHz duplex in the 700 MHz band and 60 MHz in the 3.5 GHz band for a period of 15 years, i.e. until July 24, 2038, with the option of a 5-year extension;\n- -Saint-Martin  and  Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy:  10 MHz  duplex  in  the 700 MHz band and 100MHz in the 3.5 GHz band for a period of 15 years, i.e. until July 24, 2038, with the option of a 5-year extension;\n- -Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy: 5 MHz duplex in the 2.1 GHz band, until April 30, 2025.\n\nIn Guyana, Orange must comply with the following obligations under its authorization:\n\n- -coverage obligation for six pre-identified zones and four zones at the locations made available;\n- -supply, using the spectrum in the 700 MHz band, of very high-speed broadband mobile access from at least 50% of mobile network sites and, in any event, from at least 5 sites, as of July 24, 2028;\n- -provision of a fixed Internet access service on the mobile network no later than January 24, 2024, in the areas identified and made public in accordance with the provisions of Arcep Decision 2018-0169 of February 22, 2018 (2) , particularly for premises without fixed access to an Internet service with a download speed of at least 8 Mbit/s;\n- -roll-out of a network providing mobile access in the 3.4-3.8 GHz band, allowing a theoretical maximum download speed of at least 100 Mbit/s per block of 10 MHz simplex with a latency of 5 ms or less, from at least 40% of mobile network sites and, in any event, from at least 15 sites, from July 24, 2028;\n- -introduction of voice and SMS options over Wi-Fi, applicable to all its offers with a compatible device, to provide indoor coverage no later than January 24, 2026.\n\nFor Saint-Martin and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy ('the northern islands'), Orange  must  comply  with  the  following  obligations  under  its authorization:\n\n- -coverage obligation for five pre-identified zones in Saint-Martin and three zones in Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy;\n- -supply, using the spectrum in the 700 MHz band, of very high-speed broadband mobile access from at least 50% of mobile network sites and, in any event, from at least 2 sites, as of July 24, 2028;\n\n1",

More recently, it held a public consultation from October 27 to December 12, 2023 on how to allocate spectrum in the 900 MHz, 700 MHz and 3.4-3.8 GHz bands in Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nAn allocation procedure is due to be launched in the first half of 2024.\n\n## Mobile coverage\n\n## The New Deal\n\nUnder the New Deal, operators are committed to:\n\n- -expanding coverage in mainland France by way of the 'targeted coverage' scheme, making it possible for each operator to cover 5,000 new areas (most of which are shared between operators), replacing the existing programs ('town center dead zones,' '800 strategic sites' and the 'France Mobile' program), which will now be fully paid for by the operators;\n- -generalizing  access  to  very  high-speed  broadband  by introducing 4G with a power rating in excess of 5W to all their own mobile sites by the end of 2020, and to 75% of the sites in the 'town center dead zones' program by the end of 2020, upping this to 100% by the end of 2022;\n- -accelerating the coverage of transport routes, so that the main highway and rail routes have 4G coverage. The agreement also includes provisions on coverage in regional trains;\n- -improving coverage inside buildings, with two components: progressive availability of voice and SMS services via WiFi with the goal of enabling 80% of our customers who own a compatible handset to benefit from these services by the end of 2019; and marketing of an offering allowing public companies and individuals who so request to obtain improved multi-operator indoor coverage of their buildings at a reasonable rate;\n- -improving  reception  quality  throughout  the  country,  and particularly in rural areas. The new performance standard applied to operator obligations will be that of 'good coverage,' defined as the 'ability to be able to call and exchange SMS outside of buildings in most cases and within buildings in some cases'.\n\nThese obligations were written into their current authorizations and in the newly allocated 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2.1 GHz band authorizations for ten years.",

The procedure is ongoing, with regular roll-out status reports sent to the regulator (Arcep).\n\nAt end-December 2023, Orange's 4G coverage was 99.8% of the population and 95.1% of the country, compared to 99.7% and 94.1% respectively at end-2022. (source: Orange estimates October 2023)\n\n## Infrastructure sharing\n\nThe New Deal agreement contains clauses relating to the sharing of networks, including active sharing where all four operators are present on a site as part of the targeted coverage arrangements. A mobile site sharing contract was signed in July 2019 between the four network operators for the roll-out of 4G on sites destined for active sharing. This agreement is gradually being implemented for the sites of the 'town center dead zones' program and the new sites to be rolled out as part of the New Deal's targeted coverage scheme.\n\nArcep has issued an opinion validating an amendment to the roaming agreement between Free Mobile and Orange in mainland France, which extends the national roaming termination period until December 31, 2025, while maintaining the maximum upload and download rates that roaming customers can reach at 384 Kbps.\n\n## 1.7. 2 . 3\n\nRegulation of fixed telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet\n\n## Regulatory framework\n\n## Broadband and very high-speed fixed broadband market analyses for the 2024-2028 period\n\nOn December 18, 2023, Arcep adopted new Decisions within the framework of analyses of the fixed broadband and very high-speed fixed broadband markets for the 2024-2028 period.\n\nThey define the asymmetric regulation (1) of the fixed broadband and very high-speed fixed broadband markets:\n\n- -a separate civil engineering market;\n- -market '1' for passive services (formerly market 3a);\n- -market '2' for specific activated B2B services (formerly market 4).\n\nLastly, by Decision 2023-2804, in order to take into account the European Commission's observations, Arcep is extending for one year the current market analysis decision for activated mass market services (formerly 'market 3b' - DSL bitstream offers). It will continue its work in 2024 to take into account ongoing developments in this market. Arcep did not see the need to maintain a comparable price framework to the one provided for in Decision 2020-1493. In the absence of a price framework, the price changes will be assessed on the basis of market 1 offer rates.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nArcep has not altered the framework for symmetrical fiber regulation adopted in 2020 and applicable to all operators with FTTH networks.\n\nThe regulatory changes focus on three key objectives:\n\n- -to support the switch from the legacy copper network to fiber;\n- -to  continue  pro-investment  regulation  to  make  the  FTTH network the new benchmark for fixed infrastructure;\n- -to boost the B2B market.\n\n## Current regulatory framework for the regulation of wholesale services for the 2024-2028 period\n\n'Civil engineering' market analysis Decision 2023-2801 defines a new relevant market covering all civil engineering infrastructure for the deployment of networks and designates Orange as the operator  exercising  significant  influence.  Accordingly,  Orange must grant reasonable requests for access to its civil engineering infrastructure (Civil Engineering for Optical Loops and Links) and associated resources and services (subscriber connection node/ optical connection node hosting offer and LFO offer). (1)\n\n'1' market analysis Decision 2023-2802 redefines the relevant market for access to copper and fiber local loop networks (to take into account the new 'civil engineering' market) and designates Orange as the operator exercising significant influence. As such, Orange must grant reasonable requests for access to its copper local loop network and the associated resources and services (unbundling offer).\n\n'2' market analysis Decision 2023-2803 maintains the relevant market  for  high-quality  activated  access  to  copper  and  fiber networks  for  the  B2B  market  and  designates  Orange  as  the operator exercising significant influence. Accordingly, Orange must grant reasonable requests for high-quality activated access to its copper and fiber networks (Business DSL/FTTO offers). (2)\n\nThese Decisions impose on Orange obligations of transparency, non-discrimination, service quality publication of reference offers, price control and accounting separation.\n\n## Other regulatory provisions relating to fixed broadband and very high-speed networks\n\nBouygues  Telecom  has  filed  a  complaint  with  Arcep  for  the settlement of a dispute against Orange in October 2021 regarding refunds  of  contributions  to  the  costs  of  commissioning  CCF (c\u00e2blage client final - end customer cabling) connections.\n\nBouygues Telecom challenged the mechanism in force in Orange's FTTH offer, where the contribution for a given CCF connection is refunded to the commercial operator selling it when the line is taken over by a new commercial operator. Bouygues Telecom has asked Arcep to change the payment-triggering event, so that from now on the contribution is refunded when the line is terminated. Bouygues Telecom also requested that the formula for calculating the refund amount be modified. In its dispute settlement decision 2022-0682 adopted on March 29, 2022, Arcep ruled in favor of granted Bouygues Telecom's initial request for a change in the triggering event for the payment of refunds. However, Arcep did not agree to the specific calculation formula requested by Bouygues Telecom.\n\nIn execution of this decision, on June 1, 2022 Orange offered Bouygues Telecom a contract for modified access to FTTH lines in very densely populated areas and entered into negotiations with Bouygues Telecom. To date, the contract has not been accepted by Bouygues Telecom.\n\nOn June 2, 2022, Orange appealed Arcep's decision before the Paris Court of Appeal and requested that the decision be annulled.\n\n## Management of FTTH roll-outs\n\n## Commitments made by Orange in the AMII zone under Article L. 33-13\n\nIn  early  2018,  Orange  formalized  its  proposed  FTTH  roll-out commitments in nearly 3,000 municipalities under Article L. 33-13 of the CPCE. Orange proposed to ensure that, for its FTTH roll-out in the AMII (Appel \u00e0 Manifestation d'Intention d'Investissement - Call for Investment Intentions) zone:\n\n- -(i) at  end-2020,  100%  of  homes  and  business  premises would be connectable or connectable on demand (including a  maximum  of  8%  of  premises  connectable  on  demand), excluding refusals by third parties;\n- -(ii) at end-2022, 100% of homes and business premises would be made connectable (excluding refusals by third parties). These commitment proposals took into account the agreement reached at the end of May 2018 between Orange and SFR, which led to Orange withdrawing from 236 municipalities in favor of SFR.\n\nThe commitments proposed by Orange (and by SFR) were accepted by the French government on July 26, 2018 (3) . In March 2022, as part of a sanctions procedure opened in 2019, Arcep gave Orange formal notice to meet the first milestone of its L. 33-13 commitments by the end of September 2022 at the latest.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, Orange appealed against this formal notice decision before the litigation division of the French Council of State, challenging the calculation basis now used by Arcep (i.e. enhanced prior information files, or files exchanged between operators for access to FTTH networks) to assess commitments under Article L. 33-13 (commitments made in 2018 by Orange on the basis of INSEE housing data). As part of this dispute, Orange also filed a QPC (Question Prioritaire de Constitutionnalit\u00e9 - Priority Question of Constitutionality) on February 3, 2023, contesting the constitutional basis of Article L. 33-13 and Arcep's actual authority.\n\nThe French Council of State decided not to refer the QPC to the Constitutional Council. In April 2023, it upheld Arcep's formal notice under Article L. 33-13 by rejecting Orange's complaints on the merits. On November 8, 2023, Arcep's restricted committee ordered Orange to pay a sanction of 26 million euros for failing to meet the 2020 milestone for its FTTH roll-out commitments. Orange contested this decision by filing an appeal with the French Council of State on January 5, 2024. It argued that the sanction was unjustified and disproportionate, and had been imposed on the operator that had invested the most in the roll-out of fiber in France.\n\nIn parallel, the government indicated on November 7 that Orange had proposed a new roll-out commitment in its AMII zone to replace the 2022 milestone for its commitments under Article L. 33-13 (see second milestone of the commitments made in 2018). A government order  incorporating  the  terms  of  Orange's  commitment  could therefore be published following an advisory opinion from Arcep. The proposed commitment is based on the following elements:\n\n- -by  2025,  1,120,000 premises  in  the  entire  AMII  zone  will be made connectable (representing 98.5% of connectable premises, including cases of blockage/refusal);\n- -by  2024,  140,000 premises  within  the  perimeter  of 55 inter-municipality cooperation zones with the lowest FTTH coverage will be made connectable;",

        "page_content": "- -within three months, all remaining buildings will be declared connectable on demand, excluding refusals and unless there are exceptional construction difficulties;\n- -within six months, propose a retail offer to process on-demand connection requests from Orange customers before the copper network is switched off.\n\nThis  commitment  under  Article  L. 33-13,  once  accepted,  will supersede the 2022 milestone of the 2018 L.33-13 commitment.\n\nThe sanctions procedure for the 2022 milestone will continue to apply until the government has formally approved the new commitments.\n\n## AMEL (Appels \u00e0 manifestation d'engagements locaux - Calls for Local Commitments) and 'equity' roll-outs\n\nIn December 2017, the Government announced the launch of a Call for Local Commitments (AMEL) through which to identify operators wishing to roll out privately funded FTTH connections beyond the current AMII zone.\n\nOrange proposed making commitments with respect to Article L. 33-13 as part of AMEL procedures for the French departments of Lot-et-Garonne, Vienne, Deux-S\u00e8vres and Haute-Vienne. Arcep has issued a favorable opinion on Orange's proposed commitments in these four departments.\n\n## Completeness of FTTH networks\n\nUnder  the  obligation  of  completeness  imposed  in  Decision 2010-1312, all infrastructure operators must have made connectable (except in the event of refusal) all housing and professional premises in the rear area of a shared access point within a reasonable period of time (between two and five years depending on the reasons for the Decision) from the roll-out of the shared access point.\n\nOn several occasions, Arcep has given Orange formal notice to comply with the obligation of completeness, each time with a list of shared access points (which had been in service for more than five years and which had not reached the required completeness rate) to be brought into compliance within one year.\n\n## Price framework for access to the copper local loop\n\nOn December 14, 2023, Arcep adopted Decision 2023-2821, which defines a price framework for full unbundling for the years 2024 and 2025. This decision sets rate caps, which are no longer based on costs derived from Orange's regulatory accounting but instead are based on the bottom-up cost model of a shared local optical loop network:\n\n- -for fully unbundled access, the monthly recurring rate is capped at 9.20 euros from 2024 and 2025 excluding IFER;\n- -the rate including IFER is 11.27 euros as of January 1, 2024;\n- -the rate including IFER 2025 will reflect changes in taxation.\n\nMarket 1 analysis decision 2023-2821 also sets out the price control arrangements for the copper local loop. Arcep decided that, in view of the fiber roll-out and the retirement of the copper network, keeping the cost orientation remedy may no longer be justified in some parts of the territory for the 2024-2028 round. Arcep has therefore identified three access categories for the current round:\n\n- -access for which cost orientation is maintained, with prices set by Decision 2023-2821;\n- -access reflecting changes in competitive conditions, and for which:\n- -either maintaining a price control obligation for access to the copper local loop is no longer justified,\n- -or keeping the cost-oriented obligation is no longer justified but, in view of the level of competition identified, it seems appropriate  to  impose  an  obligation  of  non-excessive pricing.\n\n- 1\n\nFor prices in the 'non-excessive' zone, Orange set out its price proposal in a letter to Arcep's Chairwoman on June 23, 2023. The proposal was then put to a public consultation with all stakeholders. Orange proposed a monthly recurring access rate (excluding IFER) of 9.95 euros/month in 2024 and 10.70 euros/month in 2025.\n\nOrange is free to set prices in zones where price obligations have been lifted. However, Arcep is planning to conduct a price replicability test if Orange charges a higher price than in the 'non-excessive' zone.\n\n## Economic conditions for access to Orange's civil engineering infrastructure: amendment of Decision 2017-1488\n\nOn  December 18,  2023,  Arcep  adopted  Decision  2023-2820 which defines the economic conditions for access to Orange's civil engineering infrastructure.\n\nThis decision changes the reference year for the copper and fiber access numbers used for pricing access to Orange's civil engineering infrastructure. For the prices in a given year Y, the calculation will now use the provisional access for year Y, and not the access recorded at the end of year Y-2, once the prices are set for 2024. However, smoothing over time is planned so that for operators who take up the offer, prices increase gradually over two years. Thus, for 2024 and 2025, the prices of the reference offer for access to local loop civil engineering are calculated so as to recover the local loop civil engineering costs allocated to the local optical loops for those two years and:\n\n- -for 2024, the prices only take into account at most three quarters of the price increase resulting from the change in reference year provided for in Article 1 of the decision;\n- -for 2025, the prices take into account all the projected costs for 2025 and the share of projected costs for 2024 that could not be recovered from 2024 prices by applying the previous indent.\n\n## Closure of the copper network\n\nIn accordance with the framework defined by the market analysis decisions of December 2020, in January 2022 Orange submitted its draft copper network closure plan to Arcep, which put it to a public consultation from February 7 to April 4, 2022.\n\nOn July 29, 2022, Arcep published a question-and-answer type document with clarifications and adjustments made by Orange to its copper closure plan. Adjustments to the regulatory framework relating to Orange's copper network closure plan are planned under market 1 analysis decision 2023-2802. These include the relaxation of commercial switch-off criteria and a reduced notice period for the commercial switch-off in areas that are 95% connectable to FTTH. The decision also provides a framework for data-sharing obligations.\n\nThe first batch of switch-offs was launched on December 13, 2022, with the commercial switch-off due to take effect on January 31, 2024 and the technical switch-off in January 2025.\n\nA trial was carried out in six towns where the commercial switch-off took place on March 31, 2022 and the technical switch-off on March 31, 2023. The outcomes were presented in October 2023.\n\nThe second batch of switch-offs was launched on June 28, 2023, with the commercial switch-off scheduled for January 27, 2025 and the technical switch-off for January 27, 2026.\n\nSince the end of the 1Q 2023, a trial has been taking place in a very densely populated area (the towns of Vanves and Rennes). The commercial switch-off is due to take place on March 31, 2024 and the technical switch-off on March 31, 2025.\n\n1",

Some provisions will apply 12 months later (June 30, 2023).\n\nOn June 9, 2022, Parliament approved an amendment to the law  governing  the  telecommunication  sector,  in  application  of various national plans including the plan for connectivity, digital infrastructure and the promotion of 5G technology. One of the notable provisions concerns the obligation to provide 100 Mbps connectivity to 100% of the population within 12 months.\n\nThe telecommunication sector is also covered by Law 15-2007 of July 3, 2007 relating to the implementation of competition rules.\n\n## 1.7. 3 . 2 Regulation of mobile telephony\n\n## Spectrum\n\n## / Summary of national spectrum allocated to Orange and expiration year\n\n| 700 MHz       | 800 MHz       | 900 MHz       | 1,800 MHz     | 2.1 GHz       | 2.6 GHz       | 3.5 GHz       | 26 GHz   |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------|\n| 10 MHz duplex | 10 MHz duplex | 10 MHz duplex | 20 MHz duplex | 15 MHz duplex | 20 MHz duplex | 40 MHz duplex | 400 MHz  |\n| (2041)        | (2031)        | (2030)        | (2030)        | +5 MHz        | (2030)        | (2030)        | (2042)   |\n\nInternal source.\n\n## Mobile termination market\n\nIn  its  public  consultation  launched  on  September 26,  2022, considering that the mobile call termination service is now provided in an environment of effective competition following the adoption of Delegated Act (EU) 2021/654 (3) , the CNMC proposed abolishing the obligations imposed on mobile operators and deregulating this market. On March 14, 2023, finding that this market does not meet the three-criteria test and is moving toward effective competition, the European Commission agreed to the abolition of the obligations. The final decision was published on May 5, 2023 and the obligations were lifted six months after the decision.\n\n## 5G\n\nAs part of the spectrum auction in the 700 MHz band organized in  July 2021  by  the  Ministry  of  the  Economy  and  the  Digital Transformation,  Orange  acquired  2 blocks  of  2x5  MHz  for 350 million euros. These authorizations have a term of 20 years, with a possible extension of 20 years. The coverage obligations extend from December 2022 to June 2025.\n\nTo allow the more efficient use of 5G, the government has proposed the reorganization of the spectrum obtained by operators in the\n\n3.4-3.8 GHz band, so that each has a continuous block. On November 4, 2021, the CNMC issued a favorable opinion on the government's draft resolution, based on an agreement reached between Telef\u00f3nica, Orange, Vodafone and M\u00e1sm\u00f3vil in July 2021. The reorganization of this band was concluded in August 2022; the spectrum band allocated to Orange is 3,600-3,710 MHz.\n\nIn  addition,  on  December 1,  2021,  the  Spanish  government presented a plan for connectivity, digital infrastructure and the promotion of 5G technology, with a public investment of 4.32 billion euros by 2025, of which 883 million euros are included in the 2021 budget. The connectivity plan includes measures to encourage the roll-out of very high-speed broadband in urban centers and unpopulated areas, so that by 2025, 100 Mbps speed will be achieved for 100% of the population. The 5G promotion plan includes  measures  to  support  network  roll-out,  with  the  goal of covering 75% of the Spanish population with 5G, as well as uninterrupted 5G coverage by 2025 on major roads, on railways and in airports.\n\nfor its wholesale FTTH offers from the start of 2023, in particular for offers with enhanced quality of service for businesses.\n\n## Regulation of fixed telephony\n\n## Universal telephony service\n\nOrange  has  not  been  a  Universal  Service  Operator  since November 27, 2020, when the last three-year designation period expired.\n\nIn its Decision 2021-0644 of April 13, 2021, Arcep set the definitive assessment of the net cost of universal service and operators' contributions for 2020.\n\nThe CNMC (National Commission for Markets and Competition), established  by  Law  3-2013  of  June 4,  2013,  brings  together regulatory authorities from different economic sectors, including telecommunications, and the antitrust authority. It is responsible for the numbering plan and the settlement of disputes between operators.\n\nThe Ministry of the Economy and the Digital Transition (2) is in charge of managing authorizations, spectrum allocation, approval of the cost of universal service, service quality and the settlement of disputes between consumers and operators that do not hold a dominant position.",

        "page_content": "On October 26, 2022, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation (Mineco) launched a public consultation on an auction in the 26 GHz band. The order submitted for consultation provides  for  the  auctioning  of  12 government  licenses  in  a 2,400 MHz band and 38 regional concessions in a 400 MHz band, in blocks of 200 MHz. The consultation ended on October 27, 2022 and the auction took place on December 21, 2022. Orange obtained 400 MHz. Licenses are valid for 20 years and renewable for an additional 20 years.\n\n## 1.7.3.3 Regulation of fixed telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet\n\n## Wholesale broadband access markets\n\nThe CNMC adopted on October 6, and published on October 15, 2021, its Decision to analyze the markets for wholesale provision of local access and central access at a fixed location, corresponding to the 1/2020 (formerly 3a/2014) and 3b/2014 markets, whereby it decided:\n\n- -regarding market 1/2020:\n- -to  retain  the  copper  network  unbundling  obligations introduced in the previous 2016 market analysis and to retain access to Telef\u00f3nica's civil engineering infrastructure,\n- -not  to  impose  ex-ante  asymmetrical  obligations  on Telef\u00f3nica  for  the  fiber  network  in  696 municipalities considered  effectively competitive  (compared  with 66 municipalities in the 2016 market analysis), i.e., 70% of the Spanish population, given that a virtual unbundling of local access (VULA) offer must be made available for the rest of Spain at a rate that satisfies the economic replicability test; This deregulation of access to fiber came into force six months after the publication of the decision;\n- -regarding market 3b/2014:\n- -to  deregulate  bitstream  access  in  the  area  declared non-competitive for copper and NGA (1) and to impose a NEBA fiber (bitstream) offer at rates that satisfy the economic replicability test (ERT) with no time limit.\n\n## 1.7.4 Poland\n\n## 1.7.4.1 Legal and regulatory framework\n\nOrange's business activities are governed by several laws:\n\n- -the Law of July 16, 2004 relating to telecommunications which transposes into national law the 2002 Telecoms Package on electronic communications;\n- -the Law of February 16, 2007 on competition and consumer protection;\n- -the Law of December 2012, transposing EU directives issued in 2009, which came into force on January 21, 2013;\n- -the Law of May 7, 2010, on developing telecommunication networks and services, which provides access to telecommunication and other technical infrastructure financed through public funds. This law was revised and amended on August 30,  2019,  by  transposing  Directive  2014/61/EU  on broadband cost reduction.\n\nSince July 2020, Poland has been working on transposing the Code with a new law on electronic communications. The legislative work is still ongoing.\n\n- 1\n\nRegarding the 2/2020 market (formerly the 4/2014 market), the CNMC launched a consultation in December 2020, proposing to maintain most of the obligations on Telef\u00f3nica. After accepting the draft decision on March 21, 2022, it published the final decision on March 29, 2022.\n\nFurthermore, the spin-off of Telef\u00f3nica's copper network does not lead to a change in Telef\u00f3nica's regulatory obligations, nor in the conditions for Orange's access to its network.\n\n## NEBA reference offers (bitstream)\n\nOn April 27, 2023, the CNMC revised downward (by 10% per year on average) the new prices that operators will have to pay over the next two years for the indirect access point (PAI) capacity of the NEBA wholesale broadband service. The current price (2023) of PAI capacity has dropped from 1.97 euros/Mbps to 1.75 euros/Mbps (down 11.17%). For 2024, the accepted price is 1.61 euros/Mbps (down 8%).\n\nThe change is due to the updated cost model, irrespective of the decrease in the number of lines and accesses in Telef\u00f3nica's network.\n\nSince 2018, the CNMC has been revising the economic replicability test (ERT) of Telef\u00f3nica's services, with a view to setting the wholesale price of fiber. This test consists of verifying whether the prices of Telef\u00f3nica's fiber optic wholesale offers (NEBA-local and NEBA-fiber) allow alternative operators to replicate the main fiber services of the incumbent operator.\n\nOn August 17, 2023, after Telef\u00f3nica passed the fifth revision of the ERT, the CNMC announced that it was not necessary to change the wholesale prices.\n\nFollowing a CNMC consultation on the cost of capital (closed on September 19, 2022 and notified to the European Commission on November 18, 2022), the latter issued a favorable opinion on December 16, 2022 concerning the increase in the cost of capital from 4.82% to 5.20%.\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Digitization,  created  in  November 2015,  then incorporated into the Prime Minister's Office on November 6, 2020 as a result of the government reshuffle, became a separate entity again on April 20, 2023.\n\nThe Office of Electronic Communications (UKE) is responsible, in  particular,  for  telecommunication  regulation  and  spectrum management, as well as certain functions related to broadcasting services. In May 2021, the government introduced changes to the Telecommunications Act that concern the appointment and removal of the UKE President. However, in September 2021, the European Commission referred Poland to the EU Court of Justice for infringing the freedom of the national regulator.\n\nThe Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) is responsible for the application of competition law, M&A control and consumer protection.\n\n1",

This process is under way in six departments and will be completed in 2025. In 2023, only 2.5% of traffic on Orange Poland's network used 3G technology.\n\n## 5G\n\n3.4-3.8 GHz  frequency  band :  on  December 20,  2022,  the regulator  launched  a  consultation  on  the  documentation  for auctions of C-band spectrum. The UKE wanted to auction 4 blocks (4x80 MHz) in the 3,480-3,800 MHz band for a period of 15 years. The starting price was set at 450 million zlotys (96 million euros). Since the auction is reserved for operators already holding another spectrum band (in 800, 900, 1,800, 2,100 or 2,600 MHz), it was not open to new entrants. The UKE wanted to impose bandwidth and coverage obligations ranging from 85% to 95% after 84 months. On October 18, 2023 Orange secured 100 MHz for 487 million zlotys (around 110 million euros), i.e. 8.2% above the minimum bid price.\n\n700 MHz band : as part of the deregulation of 700 MHz spectrum for mobile networks, the UKE has initiated a coordination process with neighboring countries, including Russia. On January 11, 2019, Poland asked the European Commission to extend the deadline to  June 2022  due  to  spectrum  coordination  problems  at  its borders. In addition, a draft law on cybersecurity, introduced by the government, currently provides for the creation of a State-owned strategic security network using the 700 MHz band to provide telecommunication and cybersecurity services in the areas of defense, national security and public safety. However, the work is still in progress and the draft law has not yet been adopted by Parliament. As a result, the allocation of spectrum in the 700 MHz band was postponed to 2024.\n\n## Infrastructure sharing\n\nThe  network  sharing  agreement  between  Orange  Polska  and T-Mobile Polska, which dates from 2011, was extended to 4G in December 2016. On May 22, 2018, Orange and T-Mobile Polska decided to end spectrum sharing in the 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz bands.\n\n## 1.7.4. 3 Regulation of fixed telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet\n\nThe ex-ante regulation of Orange's fixed services, for the areas defined as non-competitive, relates solely to wholesale services.\n\n## Analysis of the wholesale very high-speed broadband market (markets 3a/2014 and 3b/2014)\n\nOn October 22, 2019, the UKE published the Decisions relating to markets 3a/2014 and 3b/2014.\n\nAccording to the regulator, market development and increasing competition justify further market deregulation. As a result, UKE decided to increase the number of deregulated zones:\n\n- -in market 3a/2014, to 51 municipalities;\n- -in market 3b/2014, to 151 municipalities.\n\nUnder  these  new  Decisions,  out  of  a  total  of  approximately 14.6 million  households,  around  6 million  households  are deregulated for bitstream access, of which around 2.3 million households are deregulated for unbundling.\n\nThe regulator has started collecting data as well as considering the next review of the very high-speed broadband markets. The draft decision is expected in 2024.\n\n## Reference offer for fixed markets\n\nThe reference offer relates to all wholesale fixed services: call origination and termination, wholesale subscription, partial and total unbundling, and bitstream access.\n\nFollowing  the  approval  by  the  European  Commission  of  the modifications  to  Orange's  reference  offer  concerning  the  new fiber connection speed options, the decision was published on October 23, 2022.\n\nIn addition, on February 15, 2022, the UKE notified the changes to Orange's reference offers concerning service access fees. After approval by the European Commission, the UKE published the decision on July 8, 2022.\n\n## 1.7.5 Other EU countries where the Orange group operates\n\n## 1.7. 5 .1 Belgium\n\n## Spectrum\n\n## / Summary of spectrum allocated to Orange and expiration year\n\n| 700 MHz       | 800 MHz       | 900 MHz       | 1400 MHz   | 1,800 MHz     | 2.1 GHz       | 2.6 GHz       | 3.6 GHz   |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|\n| 10 MHz duplex | 10 MHz duplex | 10 MHz duplex | 30 MHz     | 15 MHz duplex | 15 MHz duplex | 20 MHz duplex | 100 MHz   |\n| (2042)        | (2033)        | (2022)        | (2040)     | (2022)        | (2042)        | (2027)        | (2040)    |\n\nInternal source.",

        "page_content": "On January 14, 2022, the regulator BIPT (Belgian Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications) launched calls for applications as part of the procedure for allocating spectrum in the 700 MHz, 1,400 MHz and 3,600 MHz bands for 5G and existing 2G and 3G spectrum (900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz). On June 21, 2022, BIPT closed the main phase of the auction.\n\nOrange obtained 2x10 MHz in the 700 MHz frequency band, 100 MHz in the 3.6 GHz frequency band, 2x10 MHz in the 900 MHz frequency band, 2x15 MHz in the 1,800 MHz frequency band and 2x15 MHz in the 2,100 MHz frequency band, for a total of 322 million euros. The positioning of the different spectrum blocks was finalized between the operators without requiring auctions. The rights of use are valid for a period of 20 years, with the exception of the 3.6 GHz band spectrum, which will expire in May 2040. The start date for the 700 MHz and 3.6 GHz licenses was September 1, 2022. The start date for the new 900, 1,800 and 2,100 MHz licenses is January 1, 2023. The existing licenses for this spectrum were extended until December 31, 2022, allowing operators to implement the new spectrum positions following the outcomes of the auctions.\n\nOn July 20, 2022, the supplemental auction to allocate 90 MHz of spectrum in the 5G 1,400 MHz frequency band for a 20-year term ended. Orange obtained 30 MHz for a price of 70 million euros. This license took effect in July 2023.\n\nBIPT approved the reorganization of the spectrum for Orange on the 905 MHz-915 MHz/950 MHz-960 MHz bands and for Proximus on the 895 MHz-905 MHz/940 MHz-950 MHz bands, as of November 21, 2022. During the transition period, the quantity of spectrum used by Orange and Proximus on each base station could not exceed 2x11.6 MHz and 2x12.5 MHz respectively. This reorganization freed the 885 MHz-890 MHz/930 MHz-935 MHz band for use by the new entrant Citymesh Mobile. Reserving some spectrum for a new entrant has led to the entry of new stakeholders: Citymesh formed an alliance with DIGI, obtained the spectrum reserved for a new entrant (2x5 MHz in 700, 2x5 MHz in 900, 2x15 MHz in 1,800 MHz and 2x5 MHz in 2,100 MHz), as well as 50 MHz in the 3.6 GHz band. In turn, the company NRB obtained 20 MHz of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz band.\n\nOn September 26, 2023, BIPT approved a spectrum lease between Network Research Belgium and e-BO (20 MHz of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz band in 12 urban areas). Since e-BO has no spectrum, BIPT does not consider this a spectrum sharing agreement, or that there are any competitive constraints given their market positions.\n\nOn September 1, 2023, BIPT relaunched a consultation to assess the existence of demand for the 26 GHz band in the Belgian market. During the previous consultation in April 2019, market participants had not expressed an interest in using this band to offer future 5G services. The new consultation ended on November 4, 2023.\n\n## Infrastructure sharing\n\n## Mobile\n\nOn November 22, 2019, Orange Belgium and Proximus signed a mobile-access network sharing agreement providing for the creation of a 50/50 joint venture co-owned by each party for the planning, roll-out and management of their mobile networks. This agreement covers 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G mobile technologies at the national level. The operators share active and passive infrastructure but not their spectrum. This agreement optimizes the network, decreases energy consumption and reduces roll-out costs. It accelerates the roll-out of 5G in Belgium, but was challenged on November 19, 2019 by Telenet before the Belgian Competition Authority (BCA). Finally, on December 23, 2022, the BCA rejected Telenet's request on the grounds that the agreement between Orange and Proximus does not have a negative effect on competition.\n\n## Fixed\n\nOn January 30, 2023, Orange Belgium and Telenet signed two commercial wholesale agreements for fixed services. Their entry into force was subject to the completion of the transaction relating to the acquisition of 75% minus one share of VOO by Orange Belgium. The agreements provide access to the other party's fixed networks for a period of 15 years and cover both current hybrid fiber-coaxial technologies and future fiber-to-the-home technologies in both network areas. In addition, Orange Belgium provides Telenet with wholesale access to the hybrid fiber-coaxial network of VOO and Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 and its future fiber-to-the-home network in the Wallonia and Brussels-Capital regions. Telenet has thus become a wholesale customer, which increases network penetration and the return on modernization investments.\n\n## Cable wholesale broadband markets\n\nAs  part  of  the  review  of  the  wholesale  cable  broadband markets launched in July 2017 by the Conference of Electronic Communications  Regulators  (CRC) (1) ,  the  new  Decision  was published by the CRC on June 29, 2018. Various reference offer Decisions  have  been  made  by  BIPT  or  the  CRC  concerning regulated access to cable networks and regulated access to the Proximus fiber network.\n\nRegarding regulated access to cable networks:\n\n- -the Decision adopted on May 26, 2020 defined the monthly rates for wholesale access to cable operators' networks;\n- -the June 24, 2021 Decision defined the one-time charges and the monthly rental charge 'SLA Pro Repair';\n- -the March 25, 2021 Decisions concerning the approval of the reference offers of Telenet, Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 and Nethys/Brut\u00e9l\u00e9 for access to the TV offer and for access to the broadband offer, define the technical and operational framework of regulated wholesale access.\n\nRegarding the reference offer 'Bitstream Fiber GPON' for regulated access to the Proximus fiber network, the Decision of April 28, 2020 concerns the obligation imposed on Proximus regarding the compensation system for the 'Basic SLA' and the adjustment of the parameters of the 'Basic SLA Repair,' and the Decision of March 9, 2021 on monthly rates.\n\nOther  products  or  services  that  are  the  subject  of  ongoing consultations include wholesale fiber prices, which are based on 'cost plus,' and one-time rates such as activation and installation rates for fiber and cable.\n\nMoreover, the CRC launched the new review of the broadband and broadcasting markets on April 1, 2021. This work will be linked in particular with the procedure under way for Orange Belgium to acquire the operator VOO, which operates in Wallonia and the Brussels region, and with the Telnet and Fluvius cooperation procedure in the north of the country. Furthermore, within this framework, BIPT has launched a project with a view to a future symmetrical fiber regulation.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of VOO by Orange (June 2, 2023), BIPT is preparing a new market study to reflect the new competitive landscape in the market. The first draft decision is expected in 2024.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

BIPT is therefore open to FTTH co-investment initiatives, provided they meet the following characteristics:\n\n## 1.7. 5 . 2 Romania\n\nSpectrum\n\n## / Summary of spectrum allocated to Orange and expiration year\n\n| 700 MHz       | 800 MHz       | 900 MHz       | 1500 MHz      | 1,800 MHz     | 2.1 GHz       | 2.6 GHz       | 3.4 -3.8 GHz   |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|\n| 10 MHz duplex | 10 MHz duplex | 10 MHz duplex | 40 MHz (2048) | 20 MHz duplex | 15 MHz duplex | 20 MHz duplex | 25 MHz duplex  |\n| (2048)        | (2029)        | (2029)        |               | (2029)        | +5 MHz (2031) | (2029)        | 10 MHz duplex  |\n| 10 MHz duplex |               |               |               |               |               |               | +45 MHz (2025) |\n| 10 MHz duplex |               |               |               |               |               |               | +160 MHz       |\n| 10 MHz duplex |               |               |               |               |               |               | (2029)         |\n| 10 MHz duplex |               |               |               |               |               |               |                |\n\nInternal source.\n\nOrange won additional spectrum on August 14, 2018, at a private auction organized by 2K Telecom for the allocation until 2025 of 2x10 MHz blocks in the 3.5 GHz band for 3.35 million euros.\n\nOn September 19, 2022, Ancom launched the spectrum allocation process for 5G, which covers 555 MHz in the 700 MHz, 1,500 MHz, 2,600 MHz and 3,400-3,800 MHz bands.\n\nOn November 15, 2022, Ancom allocated Orange Romania two blocks of 2x5 MHz in the 700 MHz band, all eight blocks of 5 MHz in the 1,500 MHz band, as well as 16 blocks of 10 MHz in the 3,400-3,800 MHz band, for a price of 264.6 million euros. In the 700 MHz and 1,500 MHz bands, licenses are valid for 25 years from January 1, 2023, and in the 3,400-3,800 MHz band, for 22 years from January 1, 2026. In the 2,600 MHz band, licenses are valid for the period from January 1, 2023 to April 5, 2029. The operator must cover with broadband services at least 70% of the country's population,  most  urban  areas,  highways,  international  airports and modernized railways, as well as 240 localities identified as not covered or poorly covered by mobile communication services.\n\n## 1.7.5.3 Slovakia\n\n## Spectrum\n\n## / Summary of spectrum allocated to Orange and expiration year\n\n| 700 MHz              | 800 MHz       | 900 MHz       | 1,800 MHz            | 2.1 GHz       | 2.6 GHz       | 3.4 -3.8 GHz     |\n|----------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|\n| 10 MHz duplex (2040) | 10 MHz duplex | 10 MHz duplex | 15 MHz duplex        | 20 MHz duplex | 30 MHz duplex | 40 MHz duplex    |\n| 10 MHz duplex (2040) | (2028)        | (2025)        | (2025)               | +5 MHz        | (2028)        | (2025)           |\n| 10 MHz duplex (2040) |               |               | +5 MHz duplex (2026) | (2026)        |               | +100 MHz  (2045) |\n\nInternal source.\n\n## 1,800 MHz band\n\nBetween February and June 2022, all mobile telephony operators in Slovakia completed a reorganization of the 1,800 MHz spectrum band in order to obtain a continuous spectrum block and improve spectrum efficiency. This is the result of commercial agreements between  the  parties,  backed  by  the  regulator.  For  spectrum re-arrangement, the country has been divided into four regions. Each operator now has 2x20 MHz of spectrum in three regions of the country and 2x15 MHz in the fourth region.\n\n## 900-2,100 MHz band\n\nThe regulator is preparing the auction of the 900-2,100 MHz spectrum band. It held public consultations between August 21, 2023 and September 21, 2023 to canvass the views of candidates on the regulatory conditions to be applied and the incentives to be offered to new entrants. The auction will take place in 2024 and successful candidates will be able to use the spectrum bands from September 8, 2026. The licenses will be valid until December 31, 2045.\n\n## Wholesale broadband markets\n\nIn the context of its third round of analysis of the 3a and 3b markets, on October 19, 2020, Ancom confirmed that the retail broadband market is effectively competitive, and that, as a consequence, no obligation should be imposed on the two wholesale markets. The European Commission approved the conclusions, while suggesting that the market be monitored. On July 26, 2022, Ancom launched the public consultation on the high-quality access market (market 4/1014 - market 2/2020). The consultation proposes to extend the deregulation of this market. Ancom has included the review of market 3a/2014 - now market 1/2020 - in its 2023 work program. Data collection began in late 2023 and the final decision is expected in third quarter 2024.\n\n## Call termination markets\n\nOn  September 25,  2023,  Ancom  launched  a  consultation  on the withdrawal of regulatory obligations for voice call termination services in fixed and mobile networks. At the end of this consultation, which ended on October 23, 2023, the regulator concluded that the market was sufficiently competitive and that prices fell under a delegated act on single European rates. On January 30, 2024, Ancom submitted its draft decision to the European Commission, which accepted it on February 22, 2024.\n\n- -are open to third parties (in terms of equipment or wholesale offers);\n- -comply with the principle of non-discrimination;\n- -allow for effective competition (including on prices) between operators;\n- -guarantee rapid national coverage.",

Participants will bid for an abstract block of spectrum.\n\nIn the 900 MHz band, the regulator is offering:\n\n- -4 blocks of 2x5 MHz at a starting price of 16 million euros per block; and\n- -3 blocks of 2x5 MHz at a starting price of 12 million euros per block.\n\nIn the 2,100 MHz band, there will be 12 blocks of 2x5 MHz at a starting price of 2.4 million euros.\n\n## 3.4-3.6 GHz  band\n\nIn  August 2019,  Orange  acquired  a  total  of  40 MHz  from Slovanet in two 20 MHz coupled-spectrum blocks (3,470 MHz3,490 MHz/3,570 MHz-3,590 MHz), with licenses valid until 2025.\n\n## 5G\n\nOn November 23, 2020, the Slovak regulator (RU) announced the results of the auction for the 5G spectrum in the 700 MHz and 900 MHz bands.\n\nA total of 82.4 MHz was offered at auction, consisting of 2x30 MHz in the 700 MHz band, 2x4.2 MHz in the 900 MHz band, and 2x9 MHz in the 1,800 MHz band. Licenses in the 700 MHz band are valid for 20 years, until December 31, 2040. Licenses in the 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz band are valid until December 31, 2025. In this context, Orange acquired 2x10 MHz in the 700 MHz frequency band for 33.6 million euros.\n\n- 1\n\nIn the 3.4-3.8 GHz band, on March 1, 2022, the RU launched a tender for licenses for a period of use between 2025 and 2045. On May 6, 2022, the RU published the outcomes of the auction: Orange SK obtained 100 MHz for a price of 16 million euros. The licenses are valid from September 1, 2025 to December 31, 2045.\n\n## Wholesale broadband and very high-speed fixed broadband markets\n\nThe Slovakian regulator completed its third round of analysis of the 3a, 3b and 4/2014 markets and published its Decisions on markets 3a and 3b on January 19, 2018, and on market 4 on November 7, 2016. The regulator eased regulations:\n\n- -in market 3a, by excluding unbundling of the local sub-loop, while maintaining unbundling in the copper local loop, and by limiting the regulatory obligations of NGA offers to the economic replicability test and to a technical equivalence of inputs;\n- -in market 3b, by imposing a replicability test of 2P services and multicast IPTV wholesale access, instead of regulated prices;\n- -in  market  4,  by  eliminating  the  sector-based  regulatory obligations, because of the competitive nature of the market.\n\nThe  RU  published  rate  caps  for  access  to  fixed  physical infrastructure (civil engineering) on October 17, 2018. The maximum monthly fees are as follows: access to ducts (0.257 euros/month/ meter),  HDPE  tube  (0.128 euros/month/meter)  and  micro-tube (0.116 euros/month/meter). This is a significant decrease in the access rates for the infrastructure.\n\nThe regulator intends to start the market revision this year however, the exact timing remains unknown.\n\n## 1.7.6 Other non-EU countries where the Orange group operates\n\n## Moldova\n\n## Spectrum\n\n## / Summary of spectrum allocated to Orange Moldova and expiration year\n\n| 800 MHz   | 900 MHz   | 900 MHz (e-GSM)   | 1,800 MHz   | 2.1 GHz   | 2,600 MHz   |\n|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|\n| (2029)    | (2029)    | (2029)            | (2029)      | (2023)    | (2027)      |\n\nInternal source.\n\n2,100 MHz : on December 8, 2023, ANRCETI extended the current mobile licenses in the 2,100 MHz band for Orange Moldova (1,9401,960/2,130-2,150 MHz in FDD mode) and for two other mobile operators: Moldtelecom and Moldcell. Each operator will get 2x20 MHz in FDD mode, instead of 2x14.8 MHz in FDD mode and 1x5 MHz in TDD mode. The licenses are valid for six years from December 9, 2023, the aim being to synchronize the expiration dates of the other spectrums held by the operators (800, 900, 1,800).\n\nThe 2,100 MHz spectrum licenses were reallocated at the reserve price. Following the extension of the standard license term, the reserve price initially set for a 15-year term now applies to a 25-year term. Orange Moldova will therefore have to pay around 1.5 million euros for a license in two equal installments by March 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. The terms of the license require operators to cover almost all national highways and expressways with a download speed of at least 2 Mbps with a 95% probability by October 2029. These obligations are divided into three parts: the majority by 2026, and the remainder by 2028 and October 2029. In addition, operators will need to provide an average download speed of 50 Mbps across their network by 2026. They may use any technology and spectrum for this purpose.\n\n1",

Orange's view at the date of the Universal Registration Document is that these riskscould have a material adverse effect (i) on its business, financial position, earnings, reputation or outlook, or (ii) on its stakeholders. In addition, other risks and uncertainties, as yet unidentified or, at the date of this Universal Registration Document, not currently considered to be material by Orange, could have similar adverse effects. Investors could lose all or part of their investment if these risks were to materialize.\n\nThe assessment of the materiality of these risks is based on criteria that are stable over time. They take into account the results of mitigation policies implemented by Orange. Only the risks still deemed material at Group level, despite these policies, are set out  below.  See  Section 2.2.1  Group Audit, Control and Risk Management.\n\nRisks are presented in this section in four categories:\n\n- -for  Orange:\n- -operational risks relating to Orange's business activities (see Section 2.1.1),\n- -risks of a legal nature (see Section 2.1.2),\n- -financial risks (see Section 2.1.3),\n- -and for Orange and its stakeholders: the main 'non-financial' risks  associated  with  the  employee-related,  social  and environmental consequences of Orange's business activities, and the effects of those activities in terms of respect for human rights,  anti-corruption  measures  and  tax  avoidance  (see Section 2.1.4).\n\nThese  categories  are  not  presented  in  order  of  importance. However,  within  each  category,  risk  factors  are  presented  in descending order of importance as determined by Orange at the date of this Universal Registration Document. Orange may change its view of their relative importance at any time, notably in the event of external or internal developments.\n\n## 2.1.1 Operational  risks\n\nOrange's broad geographic footprint and the scope of its activities expose it to geopolitical, macroeconomic, security and operational risks.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nThe proliferation of national and international crises and conflicts affects the general business climate and the conduct of the Group's activities. In that sense, the population movements following the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East put pressure on the operations of Orange's subsidiaries bordering the conflict areas.\n\nIn  addition,  Orange  has  a  large  presence  in  countries  and geographical areas marked by political or economic instability. This instability exposes Orange to decisions by governmental or judicial authorities contrary to its interests, sometimes combined with heightened tax or regulatory pressure. While certain additional\n\nSeveral other sections of this Universal Registration Document also discuss risks in some detail:\n\n- -with respect to risks relating to the global telecommunication services market, Orange's overall strategy and its business model, see Section 1.2;\n- -with  respect  to  risks  relating  to  regulation  and  regulatory pressure,  see  Section 1.2.2  Key  changes in the telecom services market and Note 18 Litigation to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Section 3.3);\n- -with respect to risks relating to litigation involving the Group, see also Note 10 Taxes and Note 18 Litigation to the Consolidated Financial Statements;\n- -with respect to risks relating to the Group's environmental and social responsibility, see Chapter 4 and, in particular, the double-materiality matrix;\n- -with respect to financial risks, see:\n- -note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of the main activities and specific risk factors that may affect this amount,\n- -notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for asset impairment,\n- -note 13.8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for derivatives,\n- -note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the management of interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, covenants, credit risk and counterparty risk, and equity market risk. The policies for managing interest rate, foreign exchange and liquidity risk are set by the Treasury and Financing Committee. See Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees;\n- -for the insurance plan, see Section 2.2.2.3 Insurance;\n- -more  generally,  risk  management  policies  throughout  the Orange group are discussed in Section 2.2 Activity and risk management framework,  which  is  an  integral  part  of  the Management Report;\n- -with respect to how the energy crisis and its economic fallout affects Orange, see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events.\n\ntaxes or fines can be disputed, the authorities can also decide to suspend services.\n\nIn some countries where the Group is present, its contribution to local economic activity is significant. However, its image is sometimes linked to that of the French government, exposing the Group to potential abuse or reprisals.\n\nLastly, threats to certain geopolitical, diplomatic or trade-related balances may result in tighter protectionist measures and/or current or future international economic sanctions against certain countries, which could affect the value or sustainability of investments made in those countries.\n\nSuch situations could call into question the profitability outlook used when making investment decisions and could adversely impact the Group's financial position and earnings.",

These risks are heightened by the roll-out of new technologies, the growing use of Cloud services, as well as the outsourcing of digital services and the development of new activities (for example in the field of connected devices).\n\nThe occurrence of these risks could, in particular, result from malicious acts (such as cyber-attacks) aimed in particular at the data in Orange's possession, and also inadvertently from within Orange or Group partners to which certain business activities are outsourced.\n\nThe Group could be held liable if these risks were to materialize. In addition, its reputation could be seriously harmed because Orange's  positioning  as  a  trusted  operator  comes  with  high expectations from its stakeholders in terms of security, which could have a significant adverse effect on future earnings.\n\nThe shift of Orange's ecosystem toward a more open and fragmented  model  enables  global  non-telecommunication actors to take an increasing share of the service and network value chain.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nCompetition with numerous actors, such as Over-The-Top (OTT) service providers and Internet market leaders, is spreading to the majority of the value-added services that use existing networks offered by Orange, leading to fiercer competition at certain points along the value chain. In that sense, new players (SD-WAN, etc.) and other solution and service providers, particularly Cloud solution and service providers, are positioning themselves as aggregators of such services, a role traditionally filled by integrated operators such as Orange. At the same time, disruptive technologies, such as the development of voice traffic via videoconferencing apps, allow new non-telecommunication actors to capture revenue streams historically going to telecommunication operators.\n\nFurthermore, the evolution of the ecosystem is marked by the massive  investments  made  by  new  actors  in  infrastructure, specifically in that based on new technologies such as the Cloud and network virtualization, but also in submarine cables in which Orange is no longer necessarily a partner.\n\nLastly, the opening up and fragmentation of networks enable existing actors (such as infrastructure managers, network businesses not in the telecommunication sector such as railways and local authorities) to offer network services.\n\nOperators such as Orange, for which the direct relationship with customers is a source of value, could therefore be marginalized. Likewise, the massive investment by new actors in infrastructure could, over time, make the Group increasingly dependent on them; some already control, for example, 80% of submarine cables or their capacity.\n\nThese developments could adversely affect Orange's revenues and margins.\n\nThe high concentration of Orange's critical suppliers, the growing use of outsourcing, as well as global supply tensions represent a risk for the Group's activities.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOrange depends, particularly in the areas of network infrastructure, information systems and mobile handsets, on a limited number of critical suppliers operating in highly concentrated markets. As such, any unilateral decision made by a key partner could be detrimental to the economic, strategic or compliance interests of the Group.\n\nDespite Orange's secure and alternative purchasing policies, this dependence poses a risk to the Group's current or future business in the event that one of these suppliers defaults or decides to change its business practices, regardless of the cause, including in the event of international economic sanctions against such critical supplier or its country of origin.\n\nThe risk of supply disruption, including in the energy sector, is heightened by shortages linked to specific conditions in some markets, such as the market for electronic components or the supply of essential resources, and by the intensity of the global economic recovery which has caused tension in the supply of many products and raw materials, including minerals and rare resources needed for the production of electronic equipment.\n\nIf one of its critical suppliers failed to deliver on Orange's purchasing requirements, Orange's business, earnings and reputation could be adversely affected on a long-term basis.\n\nA large part of Orange's revenues is generated in both highly competitive and regulated markets where pressure on prices remains strong in an inflationary context.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nIn the current period of inflation, during which customers may question the need for some premium services, the service price increases by Orange may not be enough to maintain its margins in the highly competitive environment in which the Group operates, and given the technological and societal disruption that affect its markets. In addition, the decisions of sector regulators and competition  authorities  that  regulate  some  of  these  prices  or markets do not always allow a fair valuation of Orange's services, similarly affecting its revenues and margins.\n\nFurthermore,  the  difficult  economic  environment,  marked  by inflation and rising energy costs, is weighing on Orange's operating margins and, considering its pricing model, it is not certain that it will be able to pass on to customers all the cost increases that it may incur.\n\nOrange is exposed to the risk of interruption to its services, particularly in the event of cyberattacks, conflicts or a shortage of strategic resources.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nDue to the essential nature of telecommunication, compounded by the widespread take-up of teleworking and the digitization of businesses,  the  networks  of  telecommunication  operators  are particularly exposed to risks of service disruption due to deliberate malicious and sometimes criminal acts, such as cyber-attacks. Increasingly sophisticated, these currently constitute a permanent threat  to  individuals  and  businesses  alike.  Moreover,  in  the event of conflicts, telecommunication networks and associated infrastructure are also the preferred target of sabotage or pressure from governmental or judicial authorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

They may occur as a result of extreme weather events, a shortage of essential resources, human error, particularly when subcontractors work on shared infrastructure, in the event of the failure of a critical supplier, or when new apps or software are rolled out or updated. They could also occur following capacity saturation  linked  to  exceptional  events  such  as  population displacements in a context of war. With specific reference to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, where Orange will be the sole network provider for broadcasts, service interruption would have negative financial impacts and significantly harm the Group's brand image and reputation.\n\nDespite the business continuity and crisis management measures taken by Orange to protect its networks, resize them and maintain control  of  its  outsourced  infrastructure,  the  ever-increasing occurrence  of  cyber-attacks,  the  implementation  of  all-IP technologies, the increase in the size of service platforms as well as the consolidation of equipment in a reduced number of locations mean that service interruptions could in the future affect a larger number of customers simultaneously or even several countries at the same time.\n\nSuch events may disrupt the activity, not only of Orange customers but - more widely - of all citizens, and may even affect their health and safety. They could thus cause Orange to be held liable, lead to a reduction in traffic and revenues, and therefore in earnings and outlook, and cause serious damage to its reputation. If they were to occur at the level of one or several countries, they could also trigger crisis situations, potentially affecting the security of the countries concerned.\n\nOrange's technical infrastructure is vulnerable to intentional or  accidental  damage,  but  also  to  natural  disasters,  the occurrence of which has increased due to climate change.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nIn the context of wars, terrorism, social or activist movements, or any other situation of internal or external conflict, Orange's infrastructure is vulnerable and may be the target of sabotage or other intentional damage. In addition, accidental events such as fires or errors or negligence during civil engineering work on infrastructure could also lead to significant destruction of Orange's facilities.\n\nLastly, Orange's infrastructure can also be damaged by natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, storms) whether or not related to weather phenomena, the occurrence and intensity of which are increasing with ongoing climate change. Thus, in the medium term, rising sea levels could affect sites and facilities located near the coast more often.\n\nWhether such damage is intentional or not, it can lead to service interruptions in a context where the expectations of Orange's customers and other stakeholders remain very high regarding Orange's capacity to provide service continuity, including in the case of extreme weather events.\n\nFurthermore, while large-scale disasters are likely to aggravate losses and associated damage, the coverage of such losses by insurers could further decrease, leaving Orange to bear significant costs that could significantly affect its financial position and outlook.\n\nFaced with the high connectivity needs linked to changing uses, Orange must accelerate the roll-out of its networks while improving the quality of service, but such investments are constrained by the availability of its resources.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOrange  must  accelerate  the  roll-out  of  its  fixed  and  mobile broadband and very high-speed broadband networks in the regions and improve the quality of service of its networks to meet the high demand for connectivity linked to changing uses. Moreover, Orange has made commitments regarding geographic coverage and quality of service to central government and local authorities in France. However, Orange's investment capacity is constrained by the availability of human, industrial and financial resources, both its own and those of its subcontractors. Failure to meet these expectations in a balanced manner could have an adverse effect on Orange's earnings and reputation.\n\nMobile Financial Services activities pose risks to Orange that are specific to this sector in each country covered by its services.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nMobile  Financial  Services,  including  banking  services,  expose Orange  to  industry-specific  risks  such  as  money  laundering, terrorist financing and non-compliance with economic sanctions programs, as well as common risks that are particularly sensitive in Mobile Financial Services, such as fraud, cyber-attacks and service interruption.\n\nIf they were to materialize, these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group's reputation and financial position.\n\nThe Group's brand policy represents a risk for the Orange brand image.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nThe vast majority of the Group's business activities are operated under the single Orange brand. Although the Group takes great care to preserve the value of the major asset that is the Orange brand, the execution risks inherent in each of its business activities could, if they materialize, affect the image of the Orange brand and thus damage the reputation of the entire Group, particularly in 2024 when Orange will be the sole network provider for Olympic and Paralympic Games broadcasts.\n\nIn the event of significant damage to the Orange brand image, the Group's earnings and outlook could be adversely affected.\n\nOrange's new strategy may not yield the expected results.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nThe success of the strategy Lead the Future (see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy) could depend on the accomplishment of the transformation projects which require, in particular, the support of Orange's employees and customers. It could also depend on changes in the legal and regulatory framework and a fairer application of the existing legal and regulatory framework to telecommunication operators. The implementation of this new strategy also involves the continuation of operational efficiency programs such as the digitization  of  processes  and  cost  management  and  capital allocation policies centered on the creation of value, which may not bring the expected results. Lastly, current geopolitical tensions could also affect how this strategy plays out (see Orange's broad geographic footprint and the scope of its activities expose it to geopolitical, macroeconomic, security and operational risks above).",

Orange also has to comply with its own regulatory obligations and oversight by authorities seeking to maintain effective market competition, as well as, in some countries, additional constraints owing to its historically dominant position in the fixed telecommunication market.\n\nOrange's business and earnings could be materially affected by changes in laws or regulations, some of which may be extraterritorial in nature, or by changes in government policy, including decisions made by regulatory or competition authorities regarding:\n\n- -the modification or renewal under unfavorable conditions, or even the withdrawal, of fixed or mobile operator's licenses;\n- -conditions for accessing networks (primarily in connection with roaming or infrastructure sharing) or rolling-out new networks such as Fiber;\n- -service  rates;\n- -the introduction of new taxes or increases in existing taxes on telecommunication companies, including the introduction of taxes aimed at facilitating the achievement of countries' carbon neutrality targets (such as taxes on use or handset purchases);\n- -banking and financial supervision, and any related compliance regulations  such  as  laws  and  regulations  on  economic sanctions;\n- -non-financial corporate obligations;\n- -data  security;\n- -merger and acquisition policy;\n- -regulations affecting operators in competing sectors, such as cable;\n- -consumer  legislation.\n\nSuch  changes,  developments  or  decisions  could  materially adversely affect the Group's revenues and earnings.\n\nFor  further  information  on  regulatory  risks,  see  Section  1.7 Regulation of telecommunication activities.\n\nThe scope of Orange's business activities and the interconnection of its networks expose it to numerous acts of technical fraud, specific to the telecommunication sector.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nOrange has to deal with various types of fraud on its telecommunication services activities, which may target it directly or its customers. In a context of increasing technological complexity, network virtualization, and acceleration of the implementation of new services or new applications, types of fraud that are more difficult to detect or control may also appear, favored for instance by the development of mass data processing and artificial intelligence, which increases the scope for possible attacks, particularly cyber-attacks.\n\nIf a material fraud were to occur, Orange's revenues, margins, service quality and reputation could be adversely affected.\n\nOrange is regularly involved in litigation, the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on its earnings, financial position or reputation.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nOrange believes that, in general and in all the countries where it operates, it complies in all material respects with the regulations in force relating to its activities and its relations with its partners, suppliers, subcontractors and customers, as well as with the conditions governing its operator's licenses. However, it is not able to predict the decisions of supervisory or judicial authorities, which are regularly asked to rule on such issues. If Orange were to be ordered by the competent authorities of a country in which it operates to pay an indemnity or a fine, or to suspend certain of its business activities, based on a breach of applicable regulations, its financial position and earnings could be significantly adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, Orange (particularly in France and Poland) is frequently involved in proceedings with its competitors and the Regulatory Authorities due to its pre-eminent position in some of the markets where it operates, and the claims made against Orange can be very substantial. In the past, the Group has been fined several tens of millions of euros or even several hundreds of millions of euros for cartel practices or for abuse of dominant position. The Group is also involved in commercial disputes where the stakes can be very high. The outcome of lawsuits is inherently unpredictable.\n\nFor  proceedings  before  the  European  competition  authorities, the maximum amount of fines provided for by law is 10% of the consolidated revenues of the offending company (or the Group to which it belongs, as the case may be).\n\nLastly, due in particular to its relationships with numerous partners, suppliers and subcontractors, Orange is exposed to a growing risk of legal action by various stakeholders from civil society alleging shortcomings  on  environmental,  employee-related  or  social matters. This could be the case, for instance, if Orange were to distribute products found to contain rare minerals extracted under non-compliant conditions. These legal actions could also aim to compel Orange to finance measures intended to limit the effects of climate change. Such actions could cause significant damage to Orange's reputation and adversely affect its financial position.\n\nThe  main  proceedings  involving  Orange  are  described  in Note 10 Taxes and Note 18 Litigation to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Developments in, or the outcome of, some or all of these ongoing proceedings could have a material adverse effect on Orange's earnings or financial position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

Orange recognizes impairment on those assets if events or circumstances occur that entail material adverse changes of a lasting nature, affecting the economic environment or the assumptions or objectives adopted at the time of the acquisition.\n\nOver the past five years, Orange has recognized material impairment of its investments in Romania, Spain, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Jordan. At December 31, 2023, the cumulative amount of goodwill impairment was 10.1 billion euros, excluding impairment of interests in associates and joint ventures which, in certain cases, include goodwill in their carrying value.\n\nNew events or unfavorable circumstances could prompt Orange to review the current value of its assets and to recognize further material impairment with an adverse effect on its earnings.\n\nIn addition, in the event of a disposal or IPO, the value of certain subsidiaries may be affected by changes in the equity and bond markets.\n\nFor  further  information  on  goodwill  and  recoverable  amounts (particularly key assumptions and sensitivity), see Note 7 Impairment losses and goodwill and Note 8.3 Impairment of fixed assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 18.\n\n## Credit-rating risk\n\nA change in Orange's credit rating could increase the cost of debt and in some cases limit access to the financing it needs.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nOrange's  credit  rating  from  rating  agencies  is  based  partly on factors beyond its control, namely conditions affecting the telecommunication  industry  in  general  or  conditions  affecting certain countries or regions in which it operates. It may be changed at any time by the rating agencies, in particular as a result of changing economic conditions, a downturn in the Group's earnings or  performance,  or  changes  to  its  shareholding  structure.  A prolonged multi-notch downgrade in Orange's credit rating would have a material adverse effect on its financing terms.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nOrange's earnings and outlook could be affected if conditions of access to capital markets were to become difficult.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nOrange mainly finances itself through the bond markets. Very unfavorable changes in the macroeconomic environment could restrict Orange's access to its usual sources of funds or significantly increase its financing costs due to an increase in market interest rates and/or the spreads applied to its borrowings.\n\nAny inability to access the financial markets for a lasting period and/or obtain financing on reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on Orange. In particular, the Group may not be able to carry out certain projects or could be forced to allocate a significant portion of its available cash to servicing or repaying its debt, to the detriment of investment or shareholder returns. In any event, Orange's earnings, cash flows and, more generally, its financial position and flexibility could be adversely affected.\n\nSee Note 14.3 Liquidity risk management to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which sets out the various sources of funding available to Orange, the maturity of its debt and changes in its credit rating, as well as Note 14.4 Financial ratios, which contains information on the limited commitments of the Orange group in relation to financial ratios and in the event of default or material adverse change.\n\n## Market risks\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nOrange's business activities could be affected by the changes in interest rates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the normal course of business, Orange obtains most of its funding from capital markets (particularly the bond market) and makes little use of bank credit.\n\nSince most of its current debt is at a fixed rate, Orange has limited exposure to a short-term rise in interest rates. The Group remains exposed to a sustained and continuous increase in interest rates for its future financing.\n\nTo limit exposure to interest rate fluctuations, Orange uses financial instruments  (derivatives),  but  the  Company  cannot  guarantee that transactions carried out with such financial instruments will completely limit its exposure, or that suitable financial instruments will be available at reasonable prices. In the event that Orange cannot  use  financial  instruments  or  if  its  financial  instruments strategy proves ineffective, its cash flows and earnings may be adversely affected.",

Intra-period variations in the average exchange rate of a particular currency could materially affect revenues and expenses denominated in that\n\n## 2.1.4 Non-financial risk factors\n\nNon-financial risks included in the scope of Orange's Statement of Non-Financial Performance (SNFP) are identified, assessed and managed using the same methodology as that used for operational risks related to its business, legal risks and financial market risks.\n\nIn  its  SNFP,  Orange  presents  the  material  environmental, employee-related and social risks to which its business activities may give rise, whether for itself or its stakeholders, as well as risks relating to governance, such as corruption risks, and matters relating to business ethics and the fight against tax avoidance. These risks were assessed in relation to the non-financial challenges that appear in the Group's double-materiality matrix (see Section 2.2.2).\n\nCombating tax avoidance, food waste and food insecurity and promoting  respect  for  animal  welfare  and  responsible  food practices were all taken into account in Orange's non-financial risk assessment. However, they were not considered likely to give rise to material risks to the Group's operations or reputation, or to have a material impact on stakeholders, because of the Group's activities.\n\nOrange is exposed, particularly as a result of cyber-attacks, to risks of disclosure or inappropriate modification of personal data, especially those of its customers.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOrange's  business  activities  require  the  transmission  via  its networks and the storage on its infrastructure of the personal data of its customers, employees or the general public.\n\nDespite its infrastructure protection systems, Orange's business activities expose it - in terms of infringement of human rights and fundamental freedoms - to risks of loss, disclosure, unauthorized communication to third parties or inappropriate modification of such personal data, in particular when setting up new services or apps or their updates. These risks are heightened by the roll-out of new technologies, the growing use of Cloud services, as well as the outsourcing of digital services and the development of new activities (for example in the field of connected devices).

In addition, Orange operates in other monetary zones, in particular in Africa and the Middle East. Depreciation of the currencies of the countries in this region would negatively affect the Group's consolidated revenues and earnings.\n\nWhen preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euros at the fiscal year closing rate. This translation could have a negative impact on the consolidated balance sheet, assets and liabilities and equity, for potentially significant amounts, as well as on net income in the event of disposal of these subsidiaries.\n\nThe management of foreign exchange risk and an analysis of the sensitivity of the Group's position to changes in exchange rates are set out in Note 14.2 Foreign exchange risk management to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\ncertain operations are outsourced, or (iii) government requests that are not compliant with legal or regulatory requirements (see also the risk factor The scope of Orange's business activities, its numerous locations around the world, and its business dealings with a variety of partners may expose the Group to a risk of violating human rights and fundamental freedoms).\n\nOrange may be held liable in various countries, under personal data protection laws (such as the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, GDPR), which strengthen the rights of individuals and increase the obligations of companies involved in data processing, such as telecommunication operators and financial services providers. If these risks were to materialize, the owners of the data disclosed or modified could suffer damage, and the Group could be held liable, compliance with its purpose could be called into question and its reputation could be materially affected.\n\nOrange faces various internal and external risks relating to human health and safety.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOwing to the specific nature of Orange's business as an operator and its geographical scope, international conflicts and a context where social tensions and industrial unrest are increasing expose Orange employees and subcontractors to risks to their safety while performing their professional activities.\n\nIn addition, in a context of more regular teleworking, Orange's employees  and  its  subcontractors  are  exposed  to  the  risks associated  with  these  new  working  conditions,  which  are sometimes sources of social isolation, which can also have direct or indirect repercussions on their health or even their safety.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group's  transformation  program,  the  rapid acceleration of the virtualization of interactions and the development of digital tools could generate psychosocial risks, potential sources of physical or psychological disability for individuals.

This  trend  accelerated  in  2023,  particularly  within  the  central functions  of  the  various  operational  headquarters,  as  part  of the  implementation  of  the  new  intergenerational  agreement  in December 2021.\n\nAt the same time, the need for new skills is growing, whether related  to  technological  developments  or  the  Group's  line  of development specifically in terms of rare skills or occupations experiencing shortages in the job market. If Orange's attractiveness as an employer or its training programs were to prove insufficient, this could reduce its ability to effectively pursue its activities and successfully implement its strategy; its earnings and outlook could be adversely affected by it, and some of the human risks described in the risk factor 'Orange faces various internal and external risks relating to human health and safety' could increase.\n\nIn addition, without the necessary skills, the Group's commitment to provide digital support to stakeholders could prove harder to keep.\n\nThe commitments made by Orange in terms of reducing its environmental impacts may not be met because they are largely based on its value chain and depend on the rapid development of new uses and technologies.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOrange has made a commitment to be Net Zero Carbon by 2040 and has set itself intermediate objectives to achieve this. The plan initiated by Orange should enable it to limit its environmental footprint and that of its value chain. The implementation of the principles of the circular economy, the many actions aimed at strengthening the control of its energy consumption, and the use of renewable energies or investments in carbon sinks fully contribute to this approach.\n\nA predominant part of Orange's environmental footprint is, however, linked to its value chain. As such, Orange's efforts to achieve its commitment to be Net Zero Carbon in 2040 could be jeopardized both by the difficulties that its suppliers and subcontractors could encounter to reduce the footprint of the products and equipment supplied to Orange and by the sharp increase in digital traffic linked in particular to the development of uses.\n\nIf Orange's environmental action plans, particularly during the period of technological transition on fixed and mobile networks, prove insufficient or require the mobilization of unavailable resources, the Group could fail to meet its commitment. This situation could have a significant negative effect on its image and could consequently lead to a loss of confidence among its stakeholders. This could lead, among other things, to a reduction in the number of customers, a loss of attractiveness as an employer, or an increase in the cost of financing. Should they materialize, these risks could, in addition, render Orange liable since these factors as a whole could affect the earnings and outlook of the Group. Beyond potential adverse effects on Orange, this could curb the development of the digital society.\n\nThe  scope  of  Orange's  business  activities,  its  numerous locations around the world, and its business dealings with a variety of partners may expose the Group to a risk of violating human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nAs the Group's activities and those of its suppliers and subcontractors are carried out in all parts of the world, Orange could, in spite of the implementation of its Vigilance Plan, be exposed to violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms involving third parties with which a direct or indirect link may be established. Such violations may relate to forced labor, modern slavery or human trafficking, the rights of children, non-decent, discriminatory or dangerous working conditions, interference with freedom of association or expression, or privacy. In particular, they could occur in regions where minerals are mined, processed and traded in conflict zones, or areas where human rights are not respected.\n\nIf they were to materialize, these risks could have a material adverse impact on Orange, or the relevant suppliers and subcontractors, in terms of image and reputation, and could result in liability for the Group.\n\nIn addition, Orange could be forced to comply with injunctions from local authorities other than what is formally required by law and regulations in the sense of having to suspend the operation of certain networks for which Orange is responsible or intercept communications, or even disclose personal data to third parties. Orange may also be compelled by local authorities to suspend or intercept communications that are routed by it.\n\nSuch situations could tarnish Orange's reputation and result in the infringement of the freedom of expression and respect for privacy of the populations of the offending countries.\n\nOrange is exposed to risks of corruption or individual or collective behavior that is not in line with its business ethics.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nAs the Group's activities and those of its suppliers, subcontractors and partners cover all regions of the world, Orange could, despite its  efforts  to  continually  improve  its  anti-corruption  system  in accordance with applicable laws, be exposed to or implicated in cases related to corrupt practices or influence peddling. Similarly, despite its fraud prevention and detection program, Orange could also be the victim of fraudulent behavior or behavior that does not comply with international conventions, its Code of Ethics or its supplier code of conduct. Such behavior may originate from persons or companies with which a direct or indirect link can be established, and may directly or indirectly target Orange, its customers, its business relationships or its employees.\n\nIn any event, the Group could be held liable, and Orange's earnings, service quality and reputation could be adversely affected.",

These transition risks could have direct and indirect financial impacts for the telecommunication industry and specifically for Orange.\n\nExposure to electromagnetic fields from telecommunication equipment  could  have  harmful  effects  on  health  and  the perception of such a risk could hinder the development of services. Excessive and inappropriate use of telecommunication services and equipment could also have harmful consequences on health.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nThe concerns raised in many countries regarding the possible human health risks of exposure to electromagnetic fields from telecommunication equipment have generally led public authorities to adopt binding regulations and health authorities to issue various precautions on usage.\n\n## 2.2 Activity and risk management framework\n\nOrange's risk management and internal control systems consist of an organization, procedures and management systems implemented by General Management and all employees under the authority of the Board of Directors. They are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of operational and strategic objectives, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the reliability of financial and non-financial information.\n\nThe  measures  in  place  notably  enable  Orange  to  meet  its obligations under certain laws such as the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, France's Financial Security Law of July 17, 2003, Government Order\n\n2008-1278 of December 8, 2008 transposing Directive 2006/43/ EC of May 17, 2006 on statutory audits, the Government Order of March 17, 2016 transposing Directive 2014/56/EU, and also French Law 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 on transparency, the fight against corruption, and the modernization of economic life, known as Sapin II, as well as Law 2017-399 of March 27, 2017 relating to the duty of vigilance of parent companies and ordering companies, which requires the implementation of a Vigilance Plan, and Directive 2014/95/EU of October 22, 2014, as regards the disclosure of non-financial information, transposed into French law by Decree 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017.\n\n- 2\n\nThere is a consensus among expert groups and health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO), that no health risk has been established to date from exposure to electromagnetic fields below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). The complementary scientific studies conducted to date on some of the spectrums used for 5G have come up with similar findings. Nevertheless, Orange cannot prejudge the findings of future publications on these issues. If an adverse health effect were to be scientifically established, it would have a material adverse effect on Orange's business and brand image and on the Group's earnings and financial position. Beyond potential adverse effects on Orange, this could significantly curb the development of the digital society.\n\nAny public perception of a risk to human health or biodiversity could lead to a reduction in the number of customers and their level of use, as well as an increase in litigation, particularly against the installation of mobile antennas. This could lead to difficulties in creating new sites, in a context where certain stakeholders question the usefulness of rolling out 5G networks. There could also be a tightening of regulations, resulting in reduced coverage, failure to meet Orange's coverage commitments to the authorities, deteriorating quality of service and an increase in network roll-out costs.\n\nThe ubiquity of connected digital equipment may lead to inappropriate use due to overuse or exposure to inappropriate content and online harassment. Negative consequences on users could be both physical and psychological, particularly on young adults and children. If this ubiquity were perceived as a risk for the most vulnerable groups, it could undermine confidence in digital technology and act as a brake on innovation, and, for Orange, result in a decrease in the use of its services and a deterioration of its image.\n\nMoreover, the use of new technologies such as generative artificial intelligence presents human and social risks that we do not yet fully comprehend.\n\nIn any event, the Group could be held liable, and Orange's revenues, earnings, service quality and reputation could be adversely affected.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.1 Group Audit, Control and Risk Management\n\nA new Audit Control Risk charter was signed in December 2023 by the Chief Executive Officer and the Group Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development. It defines the framework of  the  missions  of  the  ACR  community  (Audit,  Control  and Risks) under the guidance of the Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department (DACRG) and the integrated insurance approach (synergies between local and central ACR functions, and operational departments) to meet the company's objectives. The charter reminds of the independence of internal audit in its operation as an actor in the third line of control.\n\nThe DACRG is under the authority of the Group Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development. It combines the following functions within a single body: internal audit, risk management, general control, credit management, internal control and fraud and revenue assurance.\n\nIts role is to define, roll out, manage and assess the activities and risk management system of the Group as a whole on behalf of General Management with a view to providing integrated assurance, offering the optimum balance between risks and opportunities, working closely with the operational departments and addressing their concerns, capitalizing on a team of experts and co-constructing innovative  approaches,  in  cooperation  with  the  other  teams responsible for Group risk management, while preserving audit independence.\n\nAt the heart of the Group's challenges and strategy, the DACRG supports  developments  in  the  Group's  activities  through  this integrated assurance. To this end, its role is to protect revenues (through  revenue  assurance  and  customer  risk  management), control fraud (prevention, detection and handling), provide support to the second line of control and strengthen governance, while offering solutions to improve risk control and create value.\n\nThe continuous improvement process in risk management and internal control is reflected, for instance, in:\n\n- -updates of the fraud prevention processes, the modules of which are distributed and evaluated on a regular basis;\n- -risk management training for Directors and Chief Executive Officers of subsidiaries;\n- -the matching of audit assignments with the Group's major risks;\n- -the dissemination of defined policies and practices, which cover  the  main  activities  and  may  be  accompanied  by a  self-assessment  process  to  enable  entities  to  position themselves in relation to the practices and levels of control expected by the Group;\n- -the  development  and  implementation  of  procedures  for analyzing large volumes of data to improve the effectiveness of the actions of the teams.\n\nThe DACRG coordinates the organization of Audit, Control and Risk Management reviews with members of the Executive Committee in collaboration with the divisions' Internal Control functions. They are designed to provide assurance that the internal control system is effective, namely that the principal risks have been identified and the appropriate steps have been taken to limit their potential impact. Audit, Control and Risk Management reviews are part of the integrated assurance approach between operational departments and functions in charge of risk management.\n\nUnder the Strategic Plan, the DACRG and the ACR community have been strengthened to support business growth internationally and its diversification into multi-services, particularly in Mobile Financial Services.\n\nLastly, the DACRG's activities are in line with the best practices promoted  by  IFACI  (Institut  fran\u00e7ais  de  l'Audit  et  du  Contr\u00f4le Interne - French Institute for Audit and Internal Control) and AMRAE (Association pour le Management des Risques et des Assurances de  l'Entreprise  -  French  Association  for  Enterprise  Risk  and Assurance).\n\n## ISO 9001 Quality Certification for the Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department\n\nThe 2015 version of the ISO 9001 certification for the DACRG was confirmed in June 2023.\n\nThis quality approach, which supports the DACRG's aim of becoming a 'trusted business partner' contributes to the improvement and simplification of all processes with a view to adopting best practices that meet the requirements of Orange's stakeholders.\n\nThis certification covers all activities carried out by the DACRG in the field of risk management within the Group.\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nGroup Internal Audit has around 50 qualified auditors working as a shared service for all Group entities. They are located in France for the most part. Group Internal Audit includes dedicated experts for  the  IT  system,  the  networks  and  financial  services.  Group Internal Audit cooperates with local audit teams, in accordance with their governance rules, sharing of audit plans, follow-up of recommendations, joint audits and methodological exchanges. This mainly concerns operator subsidiaries that are not wholly owned (notably Orange Polska and Orange Belgium in Europe and the Sonatel and Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Groups in Africa). Group Internal Audit, Orange Polska's Internal Audit, Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's Internal Audit and Sonatel Group's Internal Audit are subject to annual certification by IFACI (Institut Fran\u00e7ais de l'Audit et du Contr\u00f4le Internes - the French Institute for Audit and Internal Control), in accordance with the French professional standards for internal audit.\n\nIn  February  2024,  the  Chairman  of  the  Audit  Committee,  the Chief Executive Officer and the Group Executive director Finance, Performance and Development signed a Group Audit Charter specifying the powers, scope and operating rules of the Group Internal Audit. This Charter strengthens the link with local audit teams, in particular by establishing a functional link.\n\nIssues may be referred directly to Group Internal Audit by the Chair of the Audit Committee in the course of his duties or by General Management. The Group Audit Director may inform the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee directly.\n\nEach year, the audit plan is endorsed by the Risk Committee and approved by the Audit Committee. An annual report, with the main results and findings, is also presented to the Risk Committee of the General Management and then the Audit Committee.\n\nThe joint operation with Deutsche Telekom (BuyIn) is jointly audited by  the  Internal  Audit  Departments  of  the  Orange  group  and Deutsche Telekom.\n\nThrough its assignments, Internal Audit helps the Group maintain an appropriate control system by assessing its effectiveness and efficiency and issuing observations and recommendations for its continuous  improvement.  The  recommendations  arising  from internal audit assignments are systematically monitored, and give rise to action plans that are drawn up and implemented by the Group's divisions and subsidiaries. These assignments notably include work performed at the request of the Group's Internal Control Department as part of the systematic assessment of management systems, particularly through cyclical audits of subsidiaries' internal control systems. Internal Audit also contributes to the process of identifying, assessing and handling risks through the results of audit assignments and recommendations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

To that end:\n\n- -it coordinates the risk identification and assessment processes on behalf of the Risk Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees);\n- -it ensures that the corresponding action plans are followed up on, with support from Group Internal Control and networks of risk managers and internal controllers from the entities and subsidiaries;\n- -it  supports  Group  entities  in  mapping  risks  of  all  kinds, including supporting the Group Corporate Social Responsibility Department with regard to non-financial risks;\n- -it contributes to crisis management by presenting forecast scenarios and by analyzing the causes and consequences of undesirable events;\n- -it anticipates,  in  collaboration  with  the  Group  Strategy Department, the risks related to the strategic plan.\n\nA risk is defined as a potential event, the consequences of which, if it occurred, would prevent Orange or one of its entities from carrying out its missions, meeting its commitments or achieving its objectives, or which could affect Orange's employees, assets, earnings and financial position, the environment, or the reputation of the entity or the Group.\n\nThe various sources of risk identification combine the views of management and those of the operating entities. The analysis of causes and consequences complements and fine-tunes the description  of  the  event  and  respectively  influences  the  risk probability level or risk impact level. The context analysis makes it possible to characterize the risk in each particular situation, to fine-tune its causes and consequences, and to assess the probability and impacts in a way that is suited to the location of the organization where the risk is observed. Risk mapping reflects the principle of the prevalence of impact analysis (consequence-related) over probability analysis (cause-related).\n\nGroup departments identify and assess, at least annually, the risks that fall within their scope. This risk map forms the cornerstone on which the management systems are built. It creates a connection to the additional action plans aimed at stepping up the internal control required for the coverage of these risks. The list of significant events, changes in risks and the monitoring of action plans are examined in relation to each department's Audit, Control and Risk Management reviews.\n\nAt Group level, risks are monitored by General Management's Risk Committee. The report on overall risk management is reviewed at least once a year by this committee. It is presented to the Directors at a special meeting of the Audit Committee, during which major risks are discussed in the presence of the Directors concerned. This process includes a review of all the risks described in Section 2.1 Risk factors of this document.\n\nIn 2021, an audit of the Group's risk management system, carried out by a firm of external auditors, concluded that the principles and practices mentioned above are assets and knowledge on which the Group has built a robust risk management system.\n\n## General Control and investigations\n\nGeneral Control is tasked, at the request of Executive Committee members or their respective Management Committees, or following a report from the whistleblowing system, with investigating matters involving employees that may run counter to the Group's interests. These matters may involve instances of fraud, conflicts of interest, damage to Group assets, behavioral problems and in general any acts by employees that are inconsistent with Group rules. In this respect, General Control works in a complementary manner to the various departments within the DACRG as well as to Group General Inspection.  In  France,  General  Control  is  represented  by  the investigations unit, which was merged in 2020 into a single team, and at Group level, for international affairs and central functions, by the General Controllers. Some countries, such as Poland, Spain, Romania and Senegal, have dedicated internal structures and operate in a network with General Control.\n\n## Credit Management\n\nGroup Credit Management is tasked with minimizing financial risks related to credit granted to Group customers. Its objective is to have a consolidated view of credit risks with customers and partners (periodic Credit Committee meetings) and to implement tools to manage those risks. To do this, it relies on local teams or contacts and on the processes in place in each operating entity.\n\nIt  promotes  the  Credit  Management  culture  and  supervises customer risk management within the Group. It heads the Group Credit Committee, which meets periodically with the various divisions to review bad debt, which is recognized in other operating income and expenses (see Note 4.3 Trade receivables and Note 5.2 Other operating expenses to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nAs in the previous year, the teams pursued measures to harmonize, consolidate and control the financial impacts related to the current crises.\n\n## Internal Control\n\nGroup Internal Control develops and leads the Internal Control strategy within Orange. To that end, it defines a methodology, processes and the tools necessary for its application. It implements them annually, in particular with:\n\n- -the management and dissemination of the Group's internal control framework through Orange's internal control policy, on governance, control environment and operational processes, and other policies and practices coordinated in association with the relevant second-line players, in order to capitalize on and reinforce all the existing systems;\n- -support for Group entities in their risk review procedures and associated control systems (governance, control environment, operational processes). These procedures are based on an end-to-end cross-functional vision, the aim being to identify the main improvements to be made in terms of risk coverage and therefore internal control, and to take corrective actions as needed;\n- -the monitoring of entities in the control of their internal control assessment system based on risk analysis. In addition, internal audits can be used, as part of the Standard Entity Reviews, to confirm the results of the self-assessment and ensure the effectiveness of the action plans implemented.",

        "page_content": "Group Internal Control coordinates the Internal Control functions of divisions and entities by providing them with support and advice on the quality and control of their systems. The aim of the local Internal Control functions is to assist the operating managers of their entities in order to help them structure and maintain an efficient Internal Control system meeting both their own needs and the Group's standards. To that end, they apply the Group's activity and risk management control guidelines within their entities.\n\nGroup Internal Control assists the various departments through Internal  Control  assignments  designed  to  provide  reasonable assurance that activities are properly controlled in various areas (e.g. compliance with laws and regulations, governance, operational or decision-making processes, integration of new entities, support for the implementation of action plans, etc.).\n\nGroup Internal Control is a stakeholder in the overarching project to implement the requirements of the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), alongside the Sustainable Finance Department and the Group's executive management for Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nAmong its recurring actions, it follows up with the heads of the governance committees (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees).\n\nThe  Orange  group's  Internal  Control  function  coordinates  the Group's  GRC  (Governance,  Risk  &  Compliance)  solution,  in particular  for  internal  control  and  risk  management  system documentation, assessments and action plans, and internal audit recommendations. The GRC solution, which is regularly updated, meets the company's expectations with a view to strengthening the integrated assurance strategy developed and rolled out by the DACRG.\n\nThe Internal Control assessment is presented to the Group Risk Committee and then to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Fraud and Revenue Assurance\n\nRevenue recognition in the telecommunication industry is based on data capture, involving various components of the access network (supporting  and  collecting  uses),  valuation  via  the  IT  systems (supporting the customer bases and valuation of individual items), and recording via the accounting and financial systems (supporting the production of financial statements). The complexity of this technical and commercial architecture has led Orange, through its Fraud and Revenue Assurance Department, to develop its own revenue protection strategy. It is supported by a methodology that ensures the correct measurement, substance, comprehensiveness and  valuation  of  the  individual  elements  underlying  customer invoicing, through a risk-oriented overview of the entire process chain.\n\n- 2\n\nGroup Fraud and Revenue Assurance (GFRA) also defines the Group's strategy and approach to fraud prevention and detection. To support the roll-out of this strategy, GFRA works very closely with the Internal Control and Risk Management teams, along with other central and operating entity teams.\n\nOrange has adopted an approach based on risk analysis and anticipation in order to manage fraud. GFRA continuously monitors existing and emerging fraud risks, as well as any new fraud-related legislation. This enables Orange to adapt its anti-fraud strategy accordingly. GFRA maintains up-to-date mapping of the Group's fraud risks, covering all risks anticipated in this area (including financial statement fraud, technical (cyber) fraud, identity theft and social engineering fraud, missing trader VAT carousels, money laundering and terrorist financing).\n\nOrange has implemented preventive controls to reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of fraud that could constitute a major risk.\n\nSince prevention cannot be 100% effective, the Group has also defined a control framework designed to detect instances of fraud. Any case or suspicion of fraud identified through these controls is investigated and dealt with in accordance with the law and Orange's ethical principles.\n\nOrange believes that to manage fraud risk and protect revenues effectively, the cost of fraud and revenue loss must be controlled at the entity level and consolidated at the Group level, allowing major incidents to be analyzed and handled, and any emerging trends to be identified. With regard to the production of Group financial information, the approach defined by GFRA includes the relevant risks in this area, such as fraud committed by management or financial statement fraud.\n\nFraud detection is the responsibility of management, assisted by GFRA and local fraud detection specialists in the Group's entities.\n\nA Group whistleblowing system is in place, as provided for under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, France's Sapin II law of December 9, 2016 and the Law of March 27, 2017 relating to the duty of vigilance of parent companies and ordering companies. The system is presented in Section 4.3.3.8.2 Group whistleblowing system.\n\nWhen  internal  fraud  is  strongly  suspected,  investigations  are generally entrusted to specialized services, in particular to General Control. The investigation services are responsible for establishing the materiality of the facts. In cases of internal fraud, company management determines the penalties. For all cases detected (internal or external fraud), the legal, civil or criminal consequences are considered after consulting the company's Legal Department.\n\nAs part of a continuous improvement process, cases of fraud are analyzed by GFRA in order to improve controls and the measures to be taken, and thus better prevent and detect similar cases.\n\nA report on fraud prevention and detection is reviewed at least once a year by the Group Risk Committee and presented at a Joint meeting of Board Committees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

In addition, an insurance policy translates certain operational risks into financial commitments.\n\n## 2.2.2.1 Specific internal control procedures pertaining to the preparation and processing of accounting and\n\n## financial information\n\nThe Group Accounting Department and the Group Controlling Department, which both report to the Group Executive Director, Finance, Performance and Development, play a decisive role in the Internal Control system.\n\nThe Group Accounting Department and the Group Controlling Department have the following key duties:\n\n- -producing the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements and the Statutory Financial Statements of Orange SA and certain French  subsidiaries  within  timeframes  that  meet  financial market requirements and legal obligations; ensuring that the statements provide a true and fair view of the company in compliance with the accounting policies adopted by the Group;\n- -preparing reports on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Statutory Financial Statements and producing the documentation  necessary  for  the  financial  communication of results and the management reporting summary for the Executive Committee;\n- -managing the monthly and quarterly reporting cycle, allowing management to measure the Group's performance on a regular basis;\n- -designing and implementing Group accounting and management methods, procedures and standards;\n- -and identifying and carrying out the necessary changes to the Group's accounting and management information systems.\n\nWithin these departments, Internal Control of accounting and financial information is organized around the following elements:\n\n- -the Disclosure Committee;\n- -the Group accounting and controlling function;\n- -unified accounting and management reporting;\n- -and Group-wide accounting standards and methods.\n\n## Disclosure Committee\n\nThe Disclosure Committee operates under the authority of the Group Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development. It is chaired, by delegation, by the Group Chief Accounting Officer, and includes the relevant department heads within the accounting, legal,  internal  audit,  management  control,  investor  relations and  communications  fields.  It  ensures  the  integrity,  accuracy, compliance with applicable laws and regulations and recognized practices,  consistency  and  quality  of  the  Group's  financial information. It carries out this task within the procedural framework for the preparation and validation of financial information as defined for the entire Group. Accordingly, it examines all financial disclosures made by the Company: the Consolidated Financial Statements, the annual and half-yearly financial reports, the Universal Registration Document filed with the AMF and the US Annual Report (Form 20-F) filed with the SEC, as well as any press releases containing financial information and presentations to institutional investors. In addition, the Committee looks at the financial communication of the principal listed subsidiaries. It met 13 times in 2023.\n\n## Unified accounting and management reporting\n\nAll Group entities are part of the Group's management and steering cycle, which has three fundamental components:\n\n- -the  forecast  process  (plan,  budget  and  periodic  internal forecasts);\n- -the process of preparing the companies' Statutory Financial Statements and the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements; and\n- -the management reporting process.\n\n## Forecast process (plan, budget and periodic internal forecasts)\n\nThe Group's budget process requires regular updates of internal projections and management's close involvement. It is applied to all the Group's countries, divisions, business units and subsidiaries.\n\nThe  budget  must  reflect  the  Group's  ambitions  at  each  level of the organization. The budget is drawn up once a year in the fourth quarter, and is presented to and approved by the Group's governance bodies. Further forecasts are made during the year to determine the allocation of resources with a view to achieving the budget objectives.\n\nThe budget dossier is composed of:\n\n- -packages of financial data along with summary comments, particularly on major actions, and detailed analyses on revenue, cost trajectories and planned sales initiatives;\n- -investments detailed by nature;\n- -and an analysis of risks and opportunities.\n\nAs part of the budget process, the divisions establish and analyze performance measurement indicators. The budget is broken down by month to serve as a reference for the Group's monthly reporting.\n\nThe Group also draws up a multi-year plan for all countries and divisions, setting out medium-term financial trajectories for the Group.\n\n## Process of preparing the companies' Statutory Financial Statements and the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOrange's financial statements are prepared in accordance with the following principles:\n\n- -pre-closing of accounts at the end of May and the end of November;\n- -anticipation of estimates and handling of complex accounting operations;\n- -and formalization of closing processes and schedules.\n\nAs such, documenting the processes leading to the production of financial information up to the entry of consolidation packages constitutes  a  common  framework  for  all  contributors,  thereby strengthening Internal Control within the accounting and controlling function.\n\nInstructions from the Consolidation Department specifying the process and agreed timeline for each closing are disseminated within the Group, and then broken down by subsidiary.\n\nConsolidation packages are prepared monthly by Group entities in accordance with IFRS and entered into the Group's consolidation and reporting tool.",

        "page_content": "Where  they  are  compatible  with  local  rules  applicable  to  the Statutory Financial Statements, the Group principles are preferred in order to limit subsequent restatements. However, if an entity applies principles that are not consistent with those of the Group in its Statutory Financial Statements and they have a material impact on the assessment of its earnings and assets, the entity concerned will make adjustments to ensure consistency.\n\nEach entity is responsible for identifying, periodically measuring and reconciling differences in accounting methods between the Statutory Financial Statements and the Group standards.\n\nThe identification and assessment of the Group's unrecognized contractual commitments are covered by a specific report drawn up annually by the Legal Department and the Finance Department, working in close collaboration. The Group's significant litigations that are likely to have a material impact on its financial position are brought to the attention of the Claims and Commitments Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees).\n\n## Management reporting process\n\nThe reporting process is a major part of the financial control and information system. It is the preferred tool for monitoring, controlling and steering the Group's General Management. The reconciliation of  accounting  information  with  forecast  data,  combined  with monthly analysis at each level of the Group, contributes to the quality and reliability of the information produced. This operating principle, established by the controlling and accounting functions, applies to all Group entities and at each level of the organization (business unit, division and Group).\n\nThe  Group's  reporting  content  and  supporting  documents, which are used to track the achievement of Group objectives, are established on a regular and consistent basis. The financial data used for reporting are derived mainly from the Group's consolidation and reporting tool, and reporting formats are standardized. The reports are validated by the heads of the Controlling Department in each country.\n\nThis reporting allows for the Group's management and performance indicators to be monitored, and consists of:\n\n- -a reporting in the second and third months of each quarter, including financial and operational indicators and identifying the main changes by business segment, country and business line;\n- -a quarterly dashboard designed to provide the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Committee with key operational indicators for the Group as well as major events and alerts.\n\nBusiness reviews at the Executive Committee level are organized by country under the authority of the Group Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development. Their purpose is to steer the business. They bring together the Chief Executive Officer, Group Finance Department and the country CEO and Finance function, as well as HR, on a quarterly basis. These reviews are based on formalized and standardized reporting. The collection of information for these reports is organized for each country in accordance with the Group's reporting instructions.\n\n## Group-wide accounting standards and methods\n\nFor the preparation of projected and actual Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group has opted for the unification principle, which implies:\n\n- -consistency of the reference framework, accounting methods and consolidation rules;\n- -standardization of reporting formats;\n- -and use of a common IT consolidation and reporting tool within the Group.\n\n- 2\n\nThe Group Accounting Department is responsible for defining and disseminating the Group's accounting policies under IFRS. It also monitors changes in standards and formalizes the Group's accounting policies under IFRS in a systematic and structured manner through the Group accounting manual, closing instructions and information or training meetings.\n\nThe system is supplemented by the establishment of standards liaison officers in the various countries and divisions. They form a  network  tasked  with  identifying  accounting  issues  locally, disseminating the Group's accounting policies among divisions, countries, entities, and accounting departments, and taking into account the training needs of employees responsible for the proper application of Group accounting policies.\n\n## 2.2.2.2 Summary of internal control work implemented pursuant\n\n## to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\n\nDue to its listing on the New York Stock Exchange, Orange is subject to the provisions of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Section 404 of this Act, the Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Executive  Director  Finance, Performance and Development are required to prepare a report in which they make a statement on the effectiveness of internal control procedures relating to the preparation of the Group's financial statements under IFRS, as presented in the annual report (Form 20F), which is filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Statutory Auditors conduct their own assessment of Internal Control. The management and Statutory Auditors' reports are included in Form 20-F each year.\n\nTo better meet the requirements of Section 404 of the Act, Orange has implemented, under the guidance of the Group Internal Control Department, a permanent program to strengthen Internal Control culture across the entire Group.\n\nBy applying principles issued by the SEC, Orange focuses its Financial  Internal  Control  system  on  areas  of  significant  risk, making it both more relevant and more effective, and limiting the assessment work to controls covering those areas.\n\nRegarding the reliability of financial information, Orange relies on the internationally recognized 2013 framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Orange organizes the five components of the COSO under two headings:\n\n- -control environment (governance committees, overall policies and procedures);\n- -and operational control (flows and processes).\n\nThe annual work program, which covers the control environment and operational control, comprises the following main actions, based on the risks identified:\n\n- -identification  of  the  scope:  this  concerns  the  Group's governance  committees,  control  environment  areas  and consolidated entities whose scope is aligned with the audit of the financial statements;\n- -scoping:  identification  by  entity  of  the  relevant  control environment  domains  and  flows  and  information  systems supporting those flows;\n- -documentation of the Internal Control system implemented and assessment of its effectiveness.\n\nThe work relating to the assessment of Financial Internal Control takes into account the work undertaken by those responsible for the second line of control, such as risk management analyses, work on fraud (prevention, detection and investigation) as well as the work of the third line, i.e. internal audit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

Orange implements a strategy aimed at organizing the transfer of  those  risks  to  players  whose  solvency  and  management capacity (production and claims) must meet the Group's security requirements and needs in an optimized protection/cost ratio.\n\nAn insurance plan has accordingly been negotiated in the insurance and reinsurance market for risk financing, and the players involved in this plan (insurers and brokers) are periodically reassessed in calls for tenders.\n\nThis insurance plan reflects the nature of the Orange group's risks and is adapted to the capacities offered by the markets to international companies of Orange's size and in its area of business. The suitability of its policies in meeting the Group's needs is confirmed by regular studies and benchmarking.\n\nNegotiations conducted during the most recent policy renewals confirmed  that  the  hard  market  is  persisting  and  impacting the majority of business lines (property damage and business interruption losses, financial lines, third-party liability, etc.).\n\nThis year, the underwriting policies followed by the vast majority of insurance companies involve the application of significant rate increases related to inflation, among other things.\n\nNegotiated coverage has been impacted by new exclusions related to the international context (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus) and the loss ratio trends for key accounts (natural events).\n\nDespite this context and market trend, the Group was able to renew its main policies while preserving most of the capacity and coverage underwritten.\n\nThis policy has also made it possible to gradually expand the scope of insurance coverage to virtually all Group subsidiaries, activities and revenues, taking into account their specific regional or regulatory constraints.\n\nIn addition, the insurance policy in place includes a risk management strategy designed to identify potential vulnerabilities within the Group and to carry out preventive actions in line with changes in the Group's activities, sites and environment. This strategy is reflected in the organization of regular visits to Orange's main sites in France and internationally, in partnership with the Group's insurers and brokers.\n\nIn the same vein, Orange's insurance policy includes a contractual risk  prevention  part  concerning  agreements  made  with  key customers, suppliers and other Group partners.\n\nThe transformation of the core business from telecom operator to multi-service operator has generated new risks, requiring it to constantly adapt financing in line with the nature of the business activities. The Group's insurers and service providers are kept regularly  informed  of  developments,  and  dedicated  insurance policies are taken out where necessary.\n\nThe main insurance policies that make up the current plan are designed to protect against the following risks:\n\n- -risks of property damage, consequential financial losses and technology risks;\n- -third-party and customer civil liability risks incurred during the management of the company and the performance of its activities;\n- -risks associated with the company's vehicle fleets.\n\nThe risk of damage to the telephone poles and open-wire lines of the overhead fixed network remains self-insured. The resulting financial expense is monitored in conjunction with the Group's experts as the traditional markets (insurance and reinsurance) no longer offer an appropriate risk transfer solution.\n\nSpecific policies are also negotiated and implemented, including:\n\n- -assistance for employees on business trips or professional assignments, or expatriates;\n- -work site insurance (real estate or construction projects);\n- -new activities (financial activities, banking).",

Its Executive Director reports regularly to the Executive Committee, directly and through the work of the CSR and Ethics Committee (CSREC - see Section 5.2.2.3. Executive Committee and Group governance committees), and to the Board of Directors through the work of the Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility  Committee  (GCSERC  -  see  Section 5.2.1.6. Committees of the Board of Directors). Furthermore, the Group's non-financial risks and their control framework are reviewed by the Audit Committee.\n\nBased on proposals by the General Management, the Board of Directors sets the long-term strategic guidelines in corporate, social and environmental matters. The General Management presents to the Board of Directors the ways in which the strategy will be applied along with an action plan and timelines for such actions. The Executive Committee holds special work sessions on the subject twice a year, informing the Board of Directors annually of the results. The Executive Committee and the Board of Directors also review and approve the Statement of Non-Financial Performance (SNFP), the Vigilance Plan and its implementation, as well as the Declaration on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking.\n\nThe Group CSR Division collaborates in particular with the Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department (see Section 2.2.1 Group Audit, Control and Risk Management). In particular, it relies on the work on non-financial risks presented by other divisions to Orange's Risk Committee and on the Group's risk assessment and management methodology. It also uses the Group's methodology for rolling out its risk management approach to the entities and takes part in the divisions' Internal Control Reviews.\n\nIt  works  closely  with  the  Sustainable  Finance  Department  on coordinating and monitoring the various social and environmental programs, drawing on the Group's financial reporting standards, processes and information system.\n\nThe Group CSR Division consists of three separate departments:\n\n- -Environmental, which coordinates climate change adaptation and transition plans, monitoring the Group's commitments on issues such as energy management;\n- -Social, which drives the Group's ambitions in terms of digital inclusion, equal opportunities and respect for human rights;\n- -CSR  governance  and  trust,  which  oversees  compliance with the Group's various obligations on non-financial issues (reporting, duty of vigilance), seeks to identify CSR skills within the Group, determines stakeholder expectations (monitoring the Group's purpose, stakeholder dialog), and manages Orange's commitments as a supplier and trusted custodian of data.\n\nThe assignments within the Group are organized around three pillars:\n\n- -developing and expressing a CSR ambition and demonstrating the value it generates;\n- -establishing an operational model and governance to guide the environmental and social trajectories;\n- -developing a CSR culture and skill sets in order to create lasting commitment across the Group.\n\nThe CSR Division reports on the Group's performance within its scope  of  activity,  specifically  through  non-financial  reporting.  It oversees  the  trajectories,  objectives  and  financial  implications associated with the CSR commitments through forecast exercises (budget  and  strategic  plan)  along  with  half-yearly  CSR-themed reviews of the divisions in liaison with the Finance Department and the Strategy Department. It relies on a network of CSR managers within the entities, on the support function networks (finance, purchasing and logistics, innovation and strategy) and on those responsible for the implementation of the Vigilance Plan, who contribute to the operational roll-out of this process. The Sustainable Finance Department, reporting directly to the Group's Finance Director, was created in early 2023 to strengthen this process.\n\nOrange's executive compensation factors in CSR criteria, which reflect the most important social and environmental issues for the Group (see Section 5.4.3 Compensation of members of the Executive Committee).\n\n## 2.2.3.2 Specific non-financial internal control procedures\n\nThe specific internal control procedures described below, together with the policies and measures implemented, help mitigate the risks identified by the Group in its risk mapping and in its Vigilance Plan (1) . In its Statement of Non-Financial Performance (SNFP), the Group outlines the risks corresponding to the non-financial issues identified by its dual materiality analysis. The analysis is consistent with the Group's risk mapping and the risk factors described in Section 2.1.4 Non-financial risks.\n\nOrange uses the definition and criteria found in reporting based on the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGP), implemented in February 2015 on matters related to human rights (2) , in order to assess the impacts of its activities on stakeholders. It is an approach based on:\n\n- -an assessment of the severity of risks in terms of their effects on  people,  independently  of  any  policies  or  action  plans implemented by Orange to mitigate their consequences;\n- -the probability of their occurrence given the Group's scope, independently of any policies or action plans implemented by Orange to mitigate their occurrence; and\n- -Orange's ability to propose a solution, i.e. to the impact that the policies or action plans developed by Orange may have.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

It provides a means of organizing security, the human and financial resources for the implementation of the following functional policies:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1)  HR responsibility.\n- (2)  CSR responsibility.\n\nUsing a risk-based approach, the Group Security Policy (GSP) defines  the  main  security  principles  aligned  with  the  Group's strategic goals and adds value to its commercial offers. It complies with supranational and national laws and regulations where the Group operates and adopts practices consistent with international standards and guidelines. The aim of security is to protect people, in particular employees; the Group's information and customer data; its offers, products and services (telecom services, financial products  and  services, etc.);  its  business  processes;  and  all intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, including IT&Networks (ITN) infrastructure.\n\nThe GSP applies to all Group entities, i.e. Orange SA and the subsidiaries, according to the arrangements made by their Board of Directors. The policy is enforced by Executive Committee members with delegated powers and by the directors of the various entities, who implement it by allocating the necessary resources. To that end, they appoint a Chief Security Officer (CSO) and a Head of IT\n\nand Network Security. They also set targets for them. In a constant search for efficiency, each entity applies the principles operationally by implementing and monitoring action plans. Any departure from the policy's principles is formalized through an exemption process. Regular  assessment  checks  (audits,  target  tracking, etc.)  are carried out both locally and at Group level and used to update the risk mapping. The Group Security Department ensures that policies are applied in areas within its remit. It also proposes the introduction of shared services and pooled expertise, ensuring that these are implemented so that the Group can meet its targets. Transparent and functional, the GSP is used by everyone and is posted on the orange.com website.\n\nThe mechanisms for keeping people, assets, information and the environment safe are described in the consolidated sustainability report.

The aim of the GSMS is to continually improve security by managing and assessing risks, particularly those related to cyber threats. The Group Security Policy (see Section 1.1.1.3 Group Security Policy) is a core component of the GSMS. It sets out a risk-based approach along with various security guidelines and strategic objectives for Orange's business sectors.\n\nOrange's cybersecurity risk management is implemented by the Group Security Department ('SECD'). It is responsible for defining the parameters of Orange's cybersecurity risk profile and presenting its analysis of key cybersecurity issues to its management. Through the SECD, the implementation of the Group Security Policy is regularly assessed and monitored to ensure that it is properly applied and followed. The SECD is also responsible for identifying the Group's main cybersecurity risks. These are presented to and approved by the Risk Committee, which in turn reports to the Group Executive Committee. The SECD handles any cybersecurity incidents, which it reports to the Risk Committee and, if necessary, to the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances.\n\nEmployees are also informed of cybersecurity issues and risks via a range of internal training modules covering both data security principles and compliance requirements with regard to personal data protection.\n\nOrange may also call upon service providers to help it assess, improve, implement and monitor its cybersecurity risk management programs. Orange has processes in place to monitor and identify risks related to cybersecurity threats associated with the use of those service providers. A dedicated team within the SECD is responsible for assessing third-party cybersecurity risks. The Group conducts a cybersecurity review and seeks contractual assurances regarding cybersecurity from its suppliers.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Group is not aware of any cybersecurity incident that has occurred since the start of 2023 that would have affected or would be reasonably likely to affect Orange, its business strategy, results of its operations or its financial position. For more information on risks related to cybersecurity threats (see Section 2.1.1  Operational risks and Section 2.1.4 Non-financial risks).\n\n## Governance\n\nThe SECD has day-to-day responsibility for monitoring cybersecurity risks.  It  also  periodically  presents  to  the  Risk  Committee  its cybersecurity risk analysis, the risk mitigation plan, the security objectives and KPIs, the findings from its cybersecurity audits and the results of self-assessments carried out by the various Orange entities.\n\n- 2\n\nThe  SECD  chairs  the  Group  Operational  Security  Committee ('GOSC'),  which  meets  regularly  to  review  Orange's  overall cybersecurity strategy and resilience.\n\nWithin the Executive Committee, the Risk Committee receives regular reports from the SECD. A report on cybersecurity risks is also presented to the Audit Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3 Group management and governance committees). The Audit Committee regularly assesses the Group's risks, including the effectiveness of risk monitoring tools, the major risks facing the Group and the preventive  measures  taken.  The  Audit  Committee  submits  its analysis to the Board of Directors, which may suggest improvements and oversees the implementation of the proposed measures.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing risk management, including monitoring risks related to cyber threats (2) .\n\n## 2.2.3.5 2024 Vigilance Plan\n\nThe 2024 Vigilance Plan is in line with the 2023 Vigilance Plan: it takes into account the Group's strategic policies expressed through its purpose, its commitments and its strategic plans.\n\nFor more details, the full version of Orange's 2024 Vigilance Plan and the 2023 Vigilance Plan report are available at https://gallery. orange.com/RSE.\n\n## 2.2.3.5.1 Policy and governance\n\nThe Vigilance Plan and its report are presented to the CSR and Ethics Committee and to the Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC), before being approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Group  CSR  Department  is  responsible  for  defining  and actually implementing the plan. It coordinates with other Group functions, such as internal control, risk management, compliance, purchasing, human resources, the legal department, security, and the operational divisions (entities, geographic regions), to roll the plan out to the Group entities and Orange departments.\n\nThe Group CSR Department first appointed a manager to roll out the Vigilance Plan in 2020. This manager is tasked with developing the Vigilance Plan and its report, ensuring its implementation, and instilling a culture of vigilance within the Group and across its upstream value chain.\n\nThe person responsible for the roll-out of the Vigilance Plan has a network of contributors in the Group's entities and departments to ensure its implementation and measure its effectiveness.\n\n## 2.2.3.5.2 Scope of the Plan's roll-out\n\nThe plan is intended to be rolled out across all of the Group's consolidated subsidiaries and departments.\n\nOrange measures the roll-out of its plan based on three criteria:\n\n- -appointment  or  designation  of  the  person  responsible  for the Vigilance Plan at the entity; in 2023, 29 of the 34 entities, representing 98% of the Group's revenue, met this criterion;\n- -local implementation of Group mapping in the entity;\n- -approval by the entity's governance body of the entity's action plan as part of the duty of vigilance (General Management or Board of Directors).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

The risks are assessed according to a common reference framework and are divided into four risk categories. Each Group entity and department updates the risk mapping annually for its local scope of activity. Risk mapping is subject to approval by local management. The Group's duty of vigilance risk mapping is updated using the feedback from local management, combined with analysis from business experts\n\nwithin the various Orange departments (such as HR, Purchasing, Security and CSR). The updated risk mapping is then incorporated into the Vigilance Plan and presented to the Group's governance committees (see Section 0). It is also incorporated into the CSR Department's risk mapping, which is presented to the Group's Audit, Control and Risk Management Department during an annual internal control review.\n\nThe four risk categories shown in the mapping below reflect the assessment for fiscal year 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, the assessment of all risk categories remained unchanged from the previous year. However, the following points are worth noting:\n\n- -for  the  risk  category  'inadequacy  or  shortcomings  of  the Vigilance Plan,' the draft EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CS3D) could lead to stricter requirements and mechanisms under French law. In view of this regulatory context and higher stakeholder expectations, Orange aims to maintain the robustness of its central system and plans to step up the roll-out and monitoring of its Vigilance Plan, with more checks, more formalization and enhanced local governance;\n- -for the risk category 'severe harm to human health, safety and security,' the rise in the number of assaults and abuse in  distribution  channels  and  the  decline  in  the  perception of well-being at work in France and Europe are contextual elements that are incorporated into the risk mapping. Orange has increased its support measures as a result. Enhanced monitoring is still necessary to ensure that subcontractors working on Orange infrastructure follow safety guidelines;\n- -for  the  risk  category  'severe  environmental  damage,'  the hardest risks to manage are in the Africa & Middle East region due to recycling and hazardous waste management facilities, which are still underdeveloped in some countries. In addition, the Group's CO 2 emission reduction commitments remain a challenge;\n- -for the risk category 'serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms,' the increasingly complex geopolitical context (national crises, armed conflict, rise in nationalism, etc.) are major concerns for the Group. Orange continually strives to ensure that its management systems are able to protect all its stakeholders.\n\n## 2.2.3.5.4 2023 roll-out progress report\n\nThe roll-out and implementation of the Vigilance Plan continued in 2023. The key points were as follows:\n\n- -Orange published its Duty of Vigilance policy (signed by its Chief Executive Officer), demonstrating the company's commitment to the duty of vigilance;\n- -Orange scaled up the plan's roll-out:\n- -Duty  of  Vigilance  liaison  officers  were  appointed, thereby improving the Group's coverage of the plan; the appointments mainly concern the MEA region and Orange Business,\n- -the Group stepped up its coordination and support for the network of employees assisting with the implementation of the duty of vigilance, with more frequent meetings and a more precise prioritization framework for the expected targets. The policy's slogan 'together, let's all do our part for the duty of vigilance' emerged naturally from these discussions and interactions,\n- -Orange worked jointly with its social partners on the duty of vigilance risk mapping. Trade unions were invited to express their views at three workshops held to evaluate the risks and provide context for their assessment. The workshops gave them a better understanding of the scope of the law and the system in place at the company to comply with it;\n- -Orange  has  improved  the  underlying  basis  for  its  risk assessment methodology:\n- -the duty of vigilance risk framework has been updated to take into account internal and external developments relating to the duty of vigilance,\n- -the supplier assessment methodology has been enhanced. It is now mandatory for all procurement professionals, regardless of location, with a view to standardizing practices and the sector's upskilling in the field of CSR. The JAC prioritization process has also been reviewed to facilitate the handling of supplier duty of vigilance audits.",

There will be ongoing dialog with the social partners, with regular feedback and discussions.\n\nAll Group entities and departments are expected to take ownership of the new risk framework. A new project will be set up in 2024 using case studies to define and contextualize the severity levels of each risk in the duty of vigilance framework.\n\nThe work carried out in 2023 on the third-party assessment system will be regularly monitored to ensure that the Group's entities and departments have taken steps to implement the system within their\n\n- 2\n\noperational processes, to test its effectiveness and to adapt it if necessary as part of the ongoing drive for improvement.\n\nFrom a legal and organizational point of view, Orange will continue to analyze the implications of the draft EU CS3D and its future transposition into French law.\n\nCommunication and awareness-raising on the duty of vigilance and its plan remain key to disseminating the culture and reinforcing the management system.\n\nA pilot program to introduce operational oversight on the use of child labor will be set up in 2024 at one of the entities in the MEA region. Feedback from the pilot will determine how the program will be extended to other countries in the region thereafter.\n\n## 2.2.3.5.6 Monitoring of action plans by risk\n\nThe monitoring of the plan by type of risk is summarized in the table below:\n\n| Risk                                                                                                                                                                   | Governance                                                                                          | Indicator                                                                                                                             | 2023                                      | 2022                                      | 2021                                      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Inadequacy or shortcomings of the Vigilance Plan cluster                                                                                                               | Inadequacy or shortcomings of the Vigilance Plan cluster                                            | Inadequacy or shortcomings of the Vigilance Plan cluster                                                                              |                                           |                                           |                                           |\n| 1.

This was largely due to the performance of retail services (B2C+B2B, see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) and equipment sales. On a comparable basis, the Africa & Middle East countries were the main contributor to growth, with revenues rising by 729 million euros (i.e. 11.4%), followed by the European countries, which grew by 248 million euros (i.e. 2.2%). Revenues in France declined by 248 million euros (down 1.4%) on a comparable basis, mainly due to lower revenues from wholesale services and, to a lesser degree, conventional telephony services (narrowband). Excluding fixed-only narrowband services, other retail services (B2C+B2B) rose by 3.0%, mainly driven by growth in convergent services. Orange Business and Totem were flat overall compared with 2022 (respective growth of 0.2% and 0.3% on a comparable basis).\n\nCommercial activity posted good results in 2023, mainly due to fiber optic. The convergent customer base had 11.9 million customers  across  the  Group,  up  0.7%  year  on  year  on  a comparable basis. Mobile services totaled 254 million accesses, of which 103.9 million were contracts (up by 4.8% and 10.1% year on year, respectively, on a comparable basis). Fixed services totaled 44.5 million  accesses,  including  16.5 million  very  high-speed broadband accesses, are still growing strongly (up 11.9% year on year on a comparable basis). In line with the downward trend in conventional fixed telephony, fixed narrowband access continued its structural decline, falling by 14.4% year on year.\n\nEBITDAaL totaled 13,035 million euros in 2023, up 0.6% on a historical basis and 1.3% on a comparable basis with 2022, in line with the announced target for slight growth. On a comparable basis, the excellent performance of the Africa & Middle East countries (up 12.7%) offset by more than twofold the decrease in Orange Business (down 15.4% year on year), which is beginning to reverse its trend. Thanks to the value-based strategy combined with strict cost discipline, the European countries also posted growth of 5.8% on a comparable basis, attributable mainly to Spain (up 12.2%). On\n\na comparable basis, France decreased by 3.6%, adversely affected by the downward trend in wholesale services and higher energy access costs for fixed and mobile networks.\n\nOperating income stood at 4,969 million euros in 2023, up 3.5% on a historical basis and 6.6% on a comparable basis versus 2022.  This  increase  mainly  reflected  the  counter-effect  of  the recognition in 2022 of goodwill impairment in Romania, and the growth of EBITDAaL. These positive changes were partially offset by increased restructuring costs related to Orange Business and Orange Bank (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), the increase in depreciation and amortization of fixed assets (mainly in France) and the increase in charges related to French part-time for seniors plans, due to the effect of pension reform enacted in France in April 2023 (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).\n\nConsolidated net income totaled 2,892 million euros in 2023, an increase of 275 million euros compared with 2022. This increase resulted from both a decrease in income tax and an increase in operating income, partially offset by a decline in finance costs, net.\n\nEconomic CAPEX stood at 6,815 million euros in 2023, down 7.5% on a historical basis and 6.7% on a comparable basis versus 2022. With a decline of 487 million euros on a comparable basis, economic CAPEX was sharply lower in 2023, and now represents 15.4% of revenues, in line with the target announced. On a comparable basis, the main contributor to this decline was France (down 10.2%, i.e. 344 million euros), due to the maturing of the fiber optic roll-out, and Spain (down 12.5%, i.e. 107 million euros). At December 31, 2023, Orange had 71.7 million households connectable to FTTH worldwide (up 10.4% year on year on a comparable basis) and an FTTH access base of 15.4 million accesses (up 12.5% year on year on a comparable basis).\n\nOrganic cash flow from telecom activities stood at 3,661 million euros in 2023, in line with the announced target of at least 3.5 billion euros. The growth of 602 million euros in the organic cash flow from telecom activities between the two periods mainly reflects the decrease in economic CAPEX and the increase in the EBITDAaL from telecom activities.\n\nNet financial debt totaled 27,002 million euros at December 31, 2023,  an  increase  of  1,704 million  euros  compared  with December 31, 2022, mainly reflecting the takeover of VOO by Orange Belgium (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).",

        "page_content": "Value creation , a pillar of the Lead the Future strategic plan, is demonstrated by the following three indicators compared with 2022:\n\n- -free  cash  flow  all-in  from  telecom  activities reached 2,940 million euros in 2023, up 1,095 million euros;\n- -the ROCE of telecom activities improved by 0.8 points to reach 6.7% in 2023, close to the target announced for 2025;\n- -and  the earnings per share attributable to owners of the parent company of 0.85 euros was up by more than 16% (see Note 15.7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nWith regard to the dividend , see Section 6.3 Dividend distribution policy.\n\n## 3.1.1.3 Significant  events\n\n## Lead the Future, Orange's new strategic plan\n\nIn February 2023, Orange presented Lead the Future, its new strategic plan which aims to generate value from the recognized excellence of its core business and to grow sustainably in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Orange also confirms the repositioning of its Enterprise services activities in next generation connectivity solutions  and  the  acceleration  in  cybersecurity  (see  Orange Business transformation plan below). Accompanying the plan is an ambitious new company model placing, at its heart, social and environmental responsibility and operational excellence.\n\nFor more information on the strategic plan Lead the Future, see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy.\n\n## Inflationary environment\n\nIn 2023, widespread inflation continued to weigh on the Group's operating margins, particularly through higher energy costs, higher wages and employee benefit expenses and higher costs of other products and services (in particular through indexation effects: rent, operating taxes and levies payable, services, etc.). In this macroeconomic environment (see Note 2.5.4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), Orange continued its efforts to achieve its financial objectives. The Group has several key strengths in this inflationary environment.\n\nOrange has opted for a value-based strategy. Due to its high level of customer satisfaction and the quality of its network, the Group has some capacity to raise prices. In France, price increases took place during the first half-year of 2023, representing an additional one or two euros per contract on B2C fixed and mobile contracts under the Orange and Sosh brands. In addition to France, all European countries began introducing rate increases in 2022, which continued in 2023. In terms of revenue, the effect of these price increases is gradual. In 2023, the price increases partially offset the impact of inflation on the Group's costs.\n\nIn terms of energy, Orange has significant coverage of its electricity needs (the Group's main energy component) at prices set through Power  Purchase  Agreements  (PPAs  -  see  Note 14.6 to  the Consolidated Financial Statements) and purchases already made on the markets. In addition to the measures already taken, Orange is also continuing the work undertaken across its scope to optimize its energy consumption. Energy purchases, the main component of which is electricity, amounted to just over one billion euros in 2023, up 28.0% compared with 2022 on a comparable basis (see Note 5.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nWith regard to labor expenses, only some Group entities are required to adjust all salaries to inflation, as is the case in Belgium and Luxembourg. In France, Orange SA implemented an overall salary budget increase of 4.8% in 2023, maintaining a particular focus on the lowest compensation levels. Orange is thus strengthening its action in favor of the purchasing power of employees, while preserving the Group's financial balances.\n\nIn addition, BuyIn, the Orange and Deutsche Telekom procurement joint venture, provides some negotiating power to the Group to secure supplies and limit price increases. Orange also relies on its\n\n- 3\n\noperational efficiency plan to offset the inflationary effects that the Group is experiencing (see Progress of the operational efficiency plan below).\n\nThe Group's lead in terms of network roll-out, and particularly of fiber optic, also allows Orange to limit its exposure to the increase in associated costs. In addition, the choice made by Orange to retain control of its infrastructure, in particular via Totem, its European TowerCo, makes it possible to partially limit the Group's exposure to the effects of indexing rent for this asset class to inflation.\n\nLastly, on the financial front, the Group's robust balance sheet, its diversified financing and interest rate risk management policy, as well as Orange's creditworthiness, help limit the Group's exposure to the effect of interest rate increases.\n\n## Progress of the operational efficiency plan\n\nThe Group continues to closely manage its costs. Orange has set a target to save an additional 600 million euros by 2025, on a defined cost base of 12.0 billion euros at the end of 2022 (after the integration of telecommunication operator VOO, see Changes in the asset portfolio below). To this end, the Group relies on initiatives taken within the new business model detailed by management and related to the new Lead the Future strategic plan (see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy).\n\nBased on the defined cost base at the end of 2022, the Group achieved net savings of around 300 million euros in fiscal year 2023.\n\n## Effect of French pension reform\n\nIn  France,  the  pension  reform  law,  gradually  raising  the  legal retirement age to 64, was enacted on April 14, 2023. The effects of this reform have been recognized in the consolidated income statement as a plan amendment (see Note 6.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), via:\n\n- -an additional provision of 241 million euros recognized for the French part-time for seniors plans signed in 2018 and 2021. These agreements provided for the extension of the measures in the event of pension reform for the employees concerned;\n- -and a provision reversal of 22 million euros on capital-based or annuity-based defined-benefit plans.\n\n## Orange Business transformation plan\n\nAs  part  of  the  Lead  the  Future  strategic  plan  presented  in February 2023 (see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy), the  Group  announced  that  it  wanted  to  transform  its  B2B telecommunication operator model in order to adapt to the changing B2B market. Orange Business aims to become the benchmark European network and digital integrator. This ambition is rooted in its recognized expertise in secure and trusted connectivity solutions which provide the foundation for companies' digital transformation. It will also rest on a re-focusing of the range of services it offers, the evolution of its company model and a far-reaching program of cost optimization.\n\nIn line with this desire to change, the Enterprise business segment is changing its name to Orange Business (see Note 1.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nIn France, Orange Business has also presented the operational implementation of its strategic priorities within the framework of the strategic plan, Lead the Future. This plan, which carries a strong ambition to transform and simplify Orange Business, whose market is undergoing profound changes, includes the discontinuation of around 150 products and services and the elimination of around 650 jobs in France, on a voluntary basis.\n\nRestructuring costs were recognized in the consolidated income statement for a total of 215 million euros for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the Orange Business transformation plan in France and abroad (see Significant events 2023 in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 5.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

This acquisition represents an investment of 1.373 billion euros net of cash acquired. At the end of the transaction, Nethys retains a minority interest in VOO and now has protective rights to ensure the completion of the industrial and social project. The Group has granted Nethys a put option on its remaining stake in VOO, exercisable for three years. As of the acquisition date, a current financial liability of 279 million euros was recognized in this respect (see Notes 3.2 and 13.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nIn addition, in late 2023, Nethys announced its intention to convert its stake into Orange Belgium shares. When this transaction is complete (see Notes 3.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), Nethys could obtain an 11% stake in Orange Belgium.\n\nThe acquisition of VOO marks an important step in Orange's convergence ambitions in Belgium, and is expected to generate significant synergies, mainly related to the transfer of VOO's Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) business to the Orange Belgium network.\n\n## Acquisition of NEHS Digital and Xperis by Enovacom (an Orange Business healthcare subsidiary)\n\nIn September 2023, Enovacom, a healthcare subsidiary of Orange Business, announced the acquisition of NEHS Digital and Xperis.\n\nNEHS Digital is a publisher and distributor of healthcare solutions and a service operator, specializing in medical imaging, and Xperis is a specialist in healthcare data interoperability. Together, these two entities cover five key areas of expertise: medical imaging, telemedicine, the organization of medical interpretation services, the production and coordination of care services, and the security and interoperability of information systems. These acquisitions strengthen the strategy of Orange Business in the development of solutions for healthcare professionals. With the integration of these companies, Enovacom's teams now benefit from the expertise of more than 600 e-healthcare professionals.\n\n## Acquisition of Expertime by Orange Business\n\nIn December 2023, Orange Business announced the acquisition of Expertime, a services company specializing in Microsoft solutions and recognized for its expertise in apps, collaborative solutions and data. Its 165 employees will strengthen the Microsoft expertise of the Orange Business teams in the areas of Public Cloud, Artificial Intelligence and Data. This acquisition, in line with the Lead the Future strategic plan, furthers the ambition of Orange Business to accelerate its growth in digital services in France and Europe and to become a certified network and digital integrator on the best technologies on the market to support companies in their digital transformation.\n\n## Merger of Orange Romania Communications into Orange Romania\n\nIn September 2021, Orange acquired a majority stake of 54% in fixed operator Telekom Romania Communications (TKR, renamed Orange Romania Communications), with the Romanian government retaining the remaining 46% of the capital.\n\nIn December 2023, an agreement was signed with the Romanian state defining the main principles of the merger of Orange Romania Communications  into  Orange  Romania  and  the  entry  of  the Romanian government into the capital of Orange Romania. The signing of this agreement has no impact on the Consolidated\n\nFinancial Statements at December 31, 2023 (see Note 3.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThe merger, which is expected to take place in the first half of 2024, will enable Orange to implement its convergent operator strategy in Romania.\n\n## Disposal of all OCS and Orange Studio securities to the Canal+ Group\n\nIn line with its announcement of January 2023, in January 2024 Orange finalized the disposal to the Canal+ Group of all of its securities in the OCS pay-TV package and in Orange Studio, the film and TV co-production subsidiary. The leading distributor of OCS, Canal+ had been a shareholder of OCS since 2012, with a holding of 33.33%. Following the deal, the Canal+ Group becomes the sole shareholder of both companies.\n\nSince their founding in 2007 and 2008 respectively, competition in the audiovisual sector, particularly for OCS, has continued to intensify with the emergence of powerful international platforms. Through this agreement with the Canal+ Group, historic partner of Orange and a recognized European player in the creation and distribution of content, the Group aims to sustain the long-term development of these two subsidiaries, while preserving jobs and the pre-financing of content creation.\n\nAs part of this transaction, Orange has granted Canal+ standard and specific guarantees. In addition, the transaction, which was finalized at the end of January 2024, is expected to result in a loss of around 170 million euros in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements in the first half of 2024 (see Notes 3.2 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Discontinuation of Orange Bank activity and agreements with BNP Paribas\n\nAs part of a strategic review of its assets, Orange, after seeking a partner for its banking subsidiary, announced in late June 2023 that it was entering into exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas to define a partnership for the referral of Orange Bank's client portfolio in France, develop mobile terminal financing solutions, and discuss the terms of a potential resumption of Orange Bank's activity in Spain.\n\nAt the end of these negotiations, Orange Bank announced in late February 2024 a partnership with BNP Paribas to offer a banking continuity solution for its clients in France and Spain. This partnership was formalized by the signing of several agreements:\n\n- -a referral agreement in France, through which Hello bank!, BNP Paribas' mobile bank, offers an exclusive offer to Orange Bank's clients in France (subject to eligibility conditions); and\n- -a commercial agreement to provide a continuity solution to Orange Bank's clients in Spain (subject to eligibility conditions) through BNP Paribas Personal Finance's Spanish subsidiary, Banco Cetelem.\n\nIn  parallel,  Orange  and  BNP  Paribas  Personal  Finance  are collaborating on the implementation of a new credit solution for mobile terminal financing.\n\nAdditionally, in 2023, Orange Bank initiated an information-consultation process with its employee representative bodies to cease its activities and negotiate a job safeguard plan concerning over 600 positions in France. As of December 31, 2023, this plan was still under negotiation. Therefore, a restructuring provision, corresponding to the best estimate at this date of the costs of this plan, was recognized for a total amount of 122 million euros as of December 31, 2023 (see notes 3.2 and 5.3 of the appendix to the Consolidated Financial Statements).",

includes:\n\n- -the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, which amounted to 461 million euros, mainly due to changes in the Egyptian pound of 380 million euros, and to a lesser extent, in the US dollar of 43 million euros, against the euro;\n- -the favorable effect of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes, which stand at 322 million euros and primarily include (i) the effect of the takeover of VOO by Orange Belgium on June 2, 2023 for 281 million euros (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), and (ii) to a lesser extent, the effect of the acquisition of SCRT and Telsys by Orange Cyberdefense on November 8, 2022 for 32 million euros;\n- -and the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. an increase in revenues of 790 million euros.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the increase of 790 million euros, i.e. 1.8%, in Group revenues between 2022 and 2023 is mainly attributable to:\n\n- -the increase of 637 million euros (i.e. 5.9%), in Mobile-only services related to (i) strong growth in mobile services (prepaid and contracts) in nearly all Africa & Middle East countries, driven largely by growth in data services and (ii) to a lesser extent, the increase in mobile-only contracts in the European countries (linked in particular to the value-based strategy, see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events) and for Orange Business;\n- -the increase of 319 million euros (i.e. 8.3%) in IT & Integration Services, primarily for Orange Business (driven by cybersecurity, integration and digital & data services), and, to a lesser degree, in the European countries (Poland, Spain and Romania);\n- -the increase of 329 million euros (i.e. 4.2%), in Convergent services, which grew in all European countries except Romania, in connection with the value-based strategy (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), the penetration of fiber optic offers in access bases, and the increase in the number of convergent services customers;\n- -and the increase of 238 million euros (i.e. 7.3%), in Equipment sales, in all European countries, with marked growth in Spain, Poland and Belgium, due to upgrading to higher-value products, growth in equipment sales to businesses and the increased unit price of equipment in an inflationary environment.\n\nThese positive changes are partially offset by:\n\n- -the decrease of 474 million euros (i.e. 6.5%) in Wholesale services, mainly in France, and to a lesser degree in the European countries:\n- -in France, the decline in wholesale services was mainly due to (i) the decline in unbundling revenues on the copper network, (ii) the reduction in the construction of fiber optic networks (Public Initiative Networks or PINs), (iii) the decline in mobile and fixed interconnection (mainly due to the decrease in voice and message traffic and to regulatory cuts in call termination rates), (iv) the decrease in FTTH line co-financing received from other operators, (v) partially offset by the increase in FTTH lines leased to third-party carriers, and by the growth in visitor roaming revenues,\n- -in the European countries and for international wholesale services, the decrease in wholesale services was mainly due to (i) the decline in international transit for services to international wholesale services (structural decrease in the market and refocusing of services on higher value-added activities) and in Spain, and (ii) regulatory cuts in mobile and fixed call termination rates in Europe,\n- -at the Group level, these changes were partially offset (i) by the sale of rights of use for a submarine cable in the Caribbean and (ii) the increase in wholesale services in the Africa & Middle East countries, mainly due to the implementation of a national roaming agreement in Egypt;\n- -the decrease of 175 million euros (down 1.9%) in Fixed-only services, primarily due to:\n- -the decrease in the fixed-only services of Orange Business, due to (i) the decline in voice services, with the downward trend in conventional fixed telephony, and (ii) the decrease in data services, mainly owing to the general trend toward the transformation of data services technologies,\n- -the downward trend in fixed-only narrowband services (conventional telephony), mainly in France,\n- -partially  offset  by  the  growth  of  fixed-only  broadband services  in  the  Africa  &  Middle  East  countries  (mainly due to the growth of fixed-only broadband access bases) and in France (in line with the value-based strategy, see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events);\n- -and  to  a  lesser  extent,  the  decrease  of  82 million  euros (i.e.  7.2%), in Other revenues, mainly in France, primarily due to the decline in the construction of build-to-suit mobile sites.\n\nThe analysis of the change in revenues by business segment is detailed in Section 3.1.3 Review by business segment.",

This decrease is mainly due to (i) the decrease in business value added tax (cotisation sur la valeur ajout\u00e9e des entreprises - CVAE), the main component of the territorial economic contribution (contribution \u00e9conomique territoriale CET), in France (see Note 10.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (ii) partially offset by the increase recorded in the Africa & Middle East countries, mainly related to the growth in activity and the increase in spectrum fees;\n- -and  the  decrease  of  0.4%,  i.e. 32 million  euros  in  labor expenses (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary). Wages and employee benefit expenses decreased slightly between the two periods, with the decrease in the average number of employees (full-time equivalent) being offset in particular by the effect of policies relating to employee wages in France and abroad in an inflationary environment (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).\n\n## These positive changes are partially offset by:\n\n- -the  increase  of  5.0%,  i.e. 388 million  euros,  in  adjusted commercial  expenses,  equipment  and  content  costs  (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary), mainly due to the rising cost of handsets and other equipment sold, in the European countries (in line with the growth in equipment sales), for Orange Business (in particular unified communication and collaboration services) and for international wholesale services (in connection with the sale of rights of use for a submarine cable in the Caribbean);\n- -the increase of 8.9%, i.e. 322 million euros, in other network expenses  and  IT  expenses  (see  Section 7.2.1  Financial glossary), due to (i) higher energy access costs for fixed and mobile networks, mainly in France and, to a lesser extent, in Other  European  countries  (see  Section 3.1.1.3  Significant events),  (ii) the  growth  in  traffic  and  the  ongoing  network roll-outs in the Africa & Middle East countries, and (iii) increased IT expenses for Orange Business (related in particular to the growth in cybersecurity services);\n- -the increase of 85.0%, i.e. 118 million euros, in interest on lease liabilities, mainly resulting from (i) the rise in interest rates affecting the discount rates applied to contracts and the effects of rent indexation in an inflationary environment (see Section 3.1.1.3  Significant events), and (ii) the development of the secondary market for co-financing and leased lines in France (see Note 9.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);\n- -the increase of 22.4% i.e. 82 million euros, in adjusted other operating  expenses  (Section 7.2.1 Financial  glossary), essentially due to (i) developments in various litigations between the two periods, (ii) the increase in the cost of bank credit risk (see Notes 1.3, 1.4 and 5.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (iii) the increase in impairment and losses on trade receivables in telecom activities (see Notes 4.3 and 5.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);\n- -the increase of 1.4%, i.e. 45 million euros, in adjusted other external  purchases  (see  Section 7.2.1  Financial  glossary), mainly due to (i) the increase in overheads (travel, consulting and support missions, use of temporary staff, vehicle energy costs, etc.), and (ii) the increase in real estate fees (in particular due  to  rent  indexation  and  the  impact  of  higher  energy costs on lease expenses in an inflationary environment, see Section 3.1.1.3  Significant events), (iii) partially offset by the decrease in building costs for resale in France (fiber optic networks and mobile sites);\n- -and secondarily, (i) the increase of 20.5%, i.e. 22 million euros, in depreciation and amortization of financed assets in France (set-top boxes financed by a bank intermediary, see Note 8.5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (ii) the increase of 1.4%, i.e. 22 million euros, in depreciation of right-of-use assets (commencement of new leases, development of the secondary market for co-financing and leased lines in France, see Note 9.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).",

This impairment mainly reflected (i) a significant increase in the discount rate due to changes in market assumptions, (ii) increased competitive pressure, and (iii) the downward revision of the business plan compared with the one used at December 31, 2021, particularly in the first few years (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);\n- -and  the  295 million  euro  increase  in  EBITDAaL  excluding interest on lease liabilities and on debts related to financed assets (with no effect on operating income).\n\nThese positive changes are partially offset by:\n\n- -the increase of 349 million euros in restructuring programs costs (mainly departure plans), largely related to the recognition in 2023 of (i) restructuring costs related to Orange Business (in France and abroad) and to Orange Bank, of 215 million euros and 122 million euros, respectively (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events and 2023 Highlights in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 5.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (ii) impairment losses on right-of-use assets and restructuring costs (departure plans) in Poland;\n- -the 305 million euro increase in depreciation and amortization of fixed assets (see Note 8.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), mainly in France and, to a lesser extent, in the Africa & Middle East countries, essentially linked to the material investments made in recent years (especially in connection with the roll-out of fixed and mobile networks) and to the recognition of accelerated depreciation in 2023;\n- -the increase of 131 million euros in specific labor expenses. This increase was mainly due to the French part-time for seniors plans (TPS, a program relating to agreements for the employment of older workers in France) and related bonuses, and mainly reflects (i) the recognition, in 2023, of a charge of 241 million euros corresponding to the additional provision relating to the pension reform enacted in France in April 2023 (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events and Note 6.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (ii) partially offset by the counter-effect of the recognition, in 2022, of a substantial number of employees signing up for these plans;\n- -and the decrease of 67 million euros in the gain on the review of fixed assets, investments and business portfolio, due to the decrease in the gain on the disposal of fixed assets (see Note 8.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) in the Africa & Middle East countries (mainly due to the counter-effect of the recognition in 2022 of asset disposals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - DRC) and for shared services (under the programs for the optimization of real estate assets).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

This change reflects (i) the decrease of 393 million euros in income tax and (ii) the increase of 168 million euros in operating income on a historical basis, (iii) partially offset by the deterioration of 286 million euros in finance costs, net.\n\nThe year-on-year deterioration of 286 million euros in finance costs, net (see Note 13.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) was essentially due to:\n\n- -the increase in the cost of gross financial debt excluding financed assets, mainly due to (i) higher interest charges on the variable-rate portion of debt and on short-term financing in a context of rising interest rates, (ii) the counter-effect, in 2022, of the change in fair value of derivatives set up in anticipation of debt issuances, and (iii) the change in the interest-rate effect of derivatives hedging the Polish zloty-denominated debt;\n- -the deterioration of other net financial expenses, mainly due to  the  increase  in  the  discounting  expense  on  employee benefits (see Notes 6.1 and 13.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);\n- -and the increase in interest on lease liabilities, mainly resulting from (i) the rise in interest rates affecting the discount rates applied  to  contracts  and  the  effects  of  rent  indexation  in an  inflationary  environment  (see  Section 3.1.1.3  Significant events), and (ii) the development of the secondary market for co-financing and leased lines in France (see Note 9.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);\n\n- -partially offset by (i) the increase in gains (losses) on assets contributing to net financial debt, due to higher returns on investments as a result of rising interest rates, and (ii) to a lesser extent, the improvement in foreign exchange gains (losses).\n\nThe decrease of 393 million euros in income tax (see Note 10.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) between the two periods primarily stems from:\n\n- -the decrease in the income tax payable of the Orange SA tax consolidation group, mainly due to changes in the income of the entities in the tax consolidation group in France;\n- -and  the  recognition,  in  2023,  of  deferred  tax  income  of 190 million euros for Belgian subsidiaries (other than the Orange Belgium group) to reflect the favorable change in the business projections for the recoverability of deferred tax assets.\n\nNet  income  attributable  to  non-controlling  interests  amounted to 451 million euros in 2023, compared with 471 million euros in 2022 (see Note 15.6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

basis , the 10.5% decrease in Group investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets between 2022 and 2023, i.e. a decrease of 944 million euros, includes:\n\n- -the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, which amounted to 220 million euros, mainly due to changes in the Egyptian pound against the euro of 201 million euros;\n- -the favorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes amounting to 25 million euros;\n- -and the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. a decrease in Group investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of 750 million euros.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the decrease of 750 million euros in Group investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets between 2022 and 2023, i.e. a decrease of 8.5%, is mainly due to the combined effect of (i) the decrease in investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding telecommunication  licenses  and  (ii) the  decrease  in  expenses relating to telecommunication licenses.\n\nThe  Group's  financial  investments  (see  Section 7.2.1  Financial glossary) are described in Section 3.1.4 Cash flow, equity and financial debt.\n\n## 3.1.2.5.1 Capital  expenditure\n\n## 3.1.2.5.1.1 Economic  CAPEX\n\nIn  2023,  the  Orange  group's  economic  CAPEX  represented 6,815 million euros (comprising 6,783 million euros from telecom activities and 33 million euros from Mobile Financial Services), down 7.5% on a historical basis and 6.7% on a comparable basis. The ratio of economic CAPEX to revenue from telecom activities was 15.4% in 2023, a fall of 1.5 percentage points on a historical basis and 1.4 percentage points on a comparable basis with 2022.\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the 7.5% decrease in Group economic CAPEX between 2022 and 2023, i.e. a decrease of 555 million euros, includes:\n\n- -the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations of 93 million euros, mainly due to changes in the Egyptian pound against the euro of 74 million euros;\n- -the positive impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 25 million euros;\n- -and the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. a decrease of 487 million euros in economic CAPEX.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the decrease of 487 million euros in the Group's economic CAPEX between 2022 and 2023, a decline of 6.7%, is mainly attributable to:\n\n- -the decline in gross investment in very high-speed broadband fixed networks (FTTH), mainly in France, Spain and Poland, after the major roll-outs of recent years. At December 31, 2023, the Group had 71.7 million households connectable to FTTH worldwide (up 10.4% year on year on a comparable basis), including 37.4 million in France, 16.8 million in Spain, 13.4 million in other European countries and 4.1 million in Africa & Middle East countries. The total number of households connectable to all very high-speed broadband networks (FTTH and cabled networks) was 75.4 million at December 31, 2023;\n- -the decline in economic CAPEX relating to leased handsets, Liveboxes and equipment installed on customer premises in France, in connection with financed assets (also recognized in investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets);\n- -and the decline in investment in very high-speed broadband mobile networks (4G/5G) in Spain, following the major roll-outs in the country in previous years;\n- -partially offset by (i) increased investments in the networks of the Africa & Middle East countries, mainly in very high-speed broadband  mobile  networks  (4G/5G),  in  order  to  support business growth (capacity investments) and changes in usage, (ii) the  decrease  in  co-financing  received  from  third-party operators in France, (iii) the decrease in disposals of fixed assets, mainly due to the counter-effect of the recognition, in 2022, of asset disposals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and (iv) the counter-effect of the recognition in 2022 of investments by Orange Marine in the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Telecommunication licenses may, in some cases, give rise to annual fees recognized as operating taxes and levies payables in the Consolidated income statement (see Note 10.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nIn 2023 , capital expenditure relating to telecommunication licenses totaled 721 million euros and mostly concerned (i) Belgium for 303 million euros (second tranche within the general framework of the acquisition of 5G licenses and renewal of the existing 2G/3G spectrum),  (ii) Poland  for  121 million  euros  (acquisition  of  5G licenses), (iii) Egypt for 113 million euros (second tranche for the acquisition of 4G licenses), (iv) Senegal for 53 million euros and (v) Botswana for 38 million euros (see Note 8.4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nIn 2022 , on a historical basis , capital expenditure relating to telecommunication  licenses  totaled  1,060 million  euros.  This mostly concerned (i) Romania for 319 million euros (acquisition of 5G licenses), (ii) Egypt for 311 million euros (first tranche for the acquisition of 4G licenses), (iii) Belgium for 254 million euros (mainly within the general framework of the acquisition of 5G licenses and the renewal of the existing 2G/3G spectrum), (iv) Poland for 75 million euros and (v) Jordan for 67 million euros.\n\n## 3.1.2.5.2 Investment  commitments\n\nInvestment commitments are set out in Notes 16 and 17.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 3.1.2.5.3 Investment  projects\n\nIn line with the Lead the Future strategic plan (see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy), Orange has confirmed the decrease in its investments in 2023, with a ratio of economic CAPEX to revenues of close to 15%. This decrease is the result, first of all, of the slowdown in investments in fiber optic, after several years of intensive roll-outs in Europe, including France. However, Orange is maintaining its investments in active and passive mobile networks (in particular through Totem, the Group's European TowerCo) and for wholesale services, in order to strengthen its leading position in terms of network quality. Going forward, the Orange group will continue to invest, while systematically seeking to maximize value creation, while disposing of non-strategic assets.\n\nThe Group will focus on its core business in order to confirm its leadership, while optimizing and adding further value to its fixed networks (particularly FTTH) and mobile networks (particularly 5G).  It  will  use  its  data  in  partnership  with  major  Cloud  and artificial intelligence (AI) players, while rolling out more efficient IT infrastructure, such as Data centers and next-generation supply chain information systems. The aim of this approach is to make the networks more efficient, thus contributing to a better financial performance. The establishment of 'Network Integration Factories' will also accelerate the automation and virtualization of network management, while providing new services for customers.\n\nFor  the fixed  network ,  whether  using  own  infrastructure  or third-party  networks  via  co-financing  or  optimized  leasing,\n\nOrange has high ambitions when it comes to marketing its fiber optic offers. As for FTTH infrastructure, Orange will continue to invest directly, particularly in France, under the new agreement on the widespread roll-out of fiber optic by 2025 (see Section 1.3 Highlights and Note 16.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Aware of the disparities in the roll-out between different urban centers in France, additional efforts will be deployed in areas with the least fiber coverage from 2024. In addition, Orange is offering to make connectable on demand all customers not eligible for fiber optic who so request, until the copper network is shut down (see Section 1.4.1  Operating activities - France). This change in the steering of roll-outs in medium-density areas ('AMII areas' - appel \u00e0 manifestation d'int\u00e9r\u00eat d'investissement or 'Call for Investment Intentions'), through connection on demand, complements the industrial-scale roll-out by geographical area. This initiative will help to achieve widespread fiber optic coverage in medium-density areas (AMII areas) by the end of 2025. Orange is also committed to continuing roll-outs in very densely populated areas ('ZTD' Zones Tr\u00e8s Denses). In 2024, the Group plans to carry out a test of roll-out on demand for its customers in two major cities within this perimeter. To continue the industrial effort in certain areas while controlling its investments, Orange will rely on its FiberCos, such as Orange Concessions, which brings together the FTTH connections of the Public Initiative Networks (PIN) in France.\n\nOn the mobile network , the Group will focus on continuing to roll out 5G, characterized by lower latency and the possibility of network slicing. Generally speaking, in order to optimize the roll-outs of its mobile networks, Orange will continue to develop network sharing agreements whenever this is relevant. In addition, Orange will accelerate the development of its passive mobile infrastructure in Europe via Totem, the Group's European TowerCo. Lastly, as part of its modernization drive, Orange is committed to pursuing the transformation of its mobile networks, with plans for the gradual shutdown of 2G and 3G networks in all European countries by 2030.\n\nIn  the Africa  &  Middle  East region,  Orange  will  maintain  its investments in rolling out fixed network infrastructure (FTTH) and mobile network infrastructure (4G/5G) for high-growth markets. The aim of this approach is to strengthen its position as a benchmark digital partner. At the same time, Orange is committed to innovative ventures,  such  as  Maxit,  a  super-app  that  brings  together telecommunications, financial services and e-commerce.\n\nIn enterprise services, Orange Business will continue to expand into IT, Cloud, data, service integration and cybersecurity to become a value-generating service orchestrator. This shift in direction will be enabled by (i) accelerating the internal transformation of networks and modes of operation by geographic region, while maintaining the level of investment, (ii) continuing the migration of customer networks to software to meet the needs of companies concerned with making their networks more reliable and optimizing their connectivity costs, with, among other things, the development of SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network) technology, and (iii) positioning itself as a trusted partner in cybersecurity.\n\nTo  meet  growing  demand  for international  connectivity ,  the Group will continue to invest in submarine cable projects, including to meet its own capacity requirements. In the second half of 2023, Orange strengthened its position in the maintenance and laying of submarine cables, with the inauguration of the new cable-laying ship, the Sophie Germain, a state-of-the-art vessel designed to minimize its environmental impact (see Section 1.3 Highlights). Through its subsidiary, Orange Wholesale, the Group will also take on an advisory role for major international connectivity projects.\n\nSee also Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy.",

This  growth  in terms of value is also accompanied by growth in volume, with a year-on-year increase of 0.6% in the convergent customer base. Furthermore, the number of mobile phones in households continues  to  grow,  with  10.3 million  convergent  mobile customers at December 31, 2023 (up 1.3% year-on-year);\n- -the increase in Equipment sales, mainly related to demand for more expensive mobile handsets;\n- -the increase in Fixed-only broadband services (up 63 million euros, i.e. 2.1%). This increase was mainly the result of the 2.2% growth in 12-month fixed-only broadband ARPO (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) due to (i) the rate increases in the first half of 2023 (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events) and (ii) a favorable mix effect, mainly thanks to growth in very high-speed fixed broadband accesses (FTTH);\n- -and the increase of 32 million euros from Mobile-only services, mainly driven by the 4.0% increase in 12-month mobile-only ARPO (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary). This growth was mainly due to the increase in rates in the first half of 2023 (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events) and offsets the year-on-year decrease of 2.7% in the mobile-only access base (essentially the result of the downward trend in the prepaid mobile access base).\n\nThe change in mobile, fixed and convergent access bases is presented in Section 3.1.3.1.5 Additional information - France.",

On a comparable basis, the convergent customer base of European countries grew by 0.7% year on year, reaching 5.9 million customers at December 31, 2023;\n- -the growth of IT & Integration Services, mainly in Poland, and, to a lesser extent, in Spain and Romania;\n- -and the growth in Mobile-only services in all countries except Spain and Romania, mainly driven by growth in 12-month mobile-only ARPO (linked in particular to rate increases, see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events). On a comparable basis, the mobile-only access base increased by 1.7% year on year and reached 44.3 million accesses at December 31, 2023;\n- -partially  offset  by  the  decrease  in  Wholesale  services  in all  European  countries,  mainly  due  to  regulatory  cuts  in call termination rates (mobile and fixed) and the decline in international transit (particularly in Spain).\n\nThe change in mobile, fixed and convergent access bases is presented in Section 3.1.3.2.5 Additional information - Europe.\n\n## 3.1.3.2.2 EBITDAaL - Europe\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the 265 million euro increase in EBITDAaL in the European countries between 2022 and 2023 is the result of (i) the favorable effect of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes of 76 million euros, due to the takeover of VOO by Orange Belgium on June 2, 2023 (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), (ii) the positive effect of foreign exchange fluctuations of 23 million euros, and (iii) the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. a 165 million euro increase in EBITDAaL.\n\n## Change on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the increase of 165 million euros in the EBITDAaL in European countries between 2022 and 2023 can essentially be attributed to:\n\n- -(i) the 248 million euro increase in revenue, (ii) the decrease in interconnection costs, as a direct result of the regulatory cuts in call termination rates and the decrease in international transit, and (iii) the increase in other operating income (net of other operating expenses);\n- -partially offset by (i) the increase in commercial expenses, equipment and content costs, reflecting growth in equipment sales, (ii) the increase in labor expenses, mainly for the entities in Romania (development of a shared services center) and in Belgium (wage indexation), (iii) the increase in network access connectivity costs, mainly in Belgium and Poland, due to the rise in the number of customers on third-party very high-speed broadband networks, and (iv) the rise in interest on lease liabilities, mainly due to the increase in interest rates affecting the  discount  rates  applied  to  contracts  in  an  inflationary environment (see Section 3.1.3 Significant events).\n\n## 3.1.3.2.3 Operating income - Europe\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the increase of 948 million euros in the operating income in the European countries between 2022 and 2023 was due to (i) the favorable effect of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes of 16 million euros, (ii) the positive effect of foreign exchange fluctuations of 11 million euros, and (iii)  the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. an increase of 921 million euros in operating income.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the increase of 921 million euros in operating income in the European countries between 2022 and 2023 is primarily due to:\n\n- -(i) the counter-effect of the recognition in 2022 of goodwill impairment of 789 million euros in Romania (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (ii) the increase of 165 million euros in EBITDAaL;\n- -partially offset by the increase in restructuring programs costs, mainly in Poland, mainly due to departure plans (see Note 5.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

European countries between 2022 and 2023 includes (i) the favorable effect of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes of 72 million euros due to the takeover of VOO by Orange Belgium on June 2, 2023 (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), (ii) the positive effect of foreign exchange fluctuations of 11 million euros, and (iii) the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. a 135 million euro decrease in economic CAPEX.\n\n## Change on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the decrease of 135 million euros in economic CAPEX in the European countries between 2022 and 2023 was mainly due to (i) lower investment in networks in Spain (see Section 3.1.3.2.6 Additional information - Spain), and, to a lesser extent, in Poland, (ii) partially offset by higher investment in mobile networks in Belgium and increased IT investments in Poland and Romania.\n\n## 3.1.3.2.5 Additional information - Europe\n\n| Europe                                                   | 2023

This growth in value, enabled by the focus on customer value management combined with a moderate promotional policy, more than offsets the erosion of the customer base (down 3.0% year on year);\n- -the growth of IT and Integration Services;\n- -and the growth of Fixed-only broadband services, due to both (i)  the 4.4% growth in the fixed-only broadband access base year on year, and (ii) the 1.5% growth in 12-month fixed-only broadband ARPO;\n- -partially offset (i) by the decline in Wholesale services, mainly related to the decrease in international transit and the regulatory cuts in call termination rates, and (ii) to a lesser extent, by the decrease in Mobile-only services, mainly due to the 6.4% contraction in the prepaid mobile access base, partially offset by growth of 1.0% in 12-month mobile-only ARPO between the two periods.\n\n## EBITDAaL - Spain\n\nChange on a historical basis and on a comparable basis\n\nOn both a historical basis and a comparable basis , the increase of 135 million euros in EBITDAaL in Spain between 2022 and 2023 was mainly due to:\n\n- -(i) the decrease in service fees and inter-operator costs, directly connected  to  the  contraction  in  revenues  from  wholesale services (see Revenue - Spain above), (ii) the decrease in network operating and maintenance expenses, mainly due to the counter-effect of higher energy access costs in 2022 for the fixed and mobile network, (iii) the increase of 50 million euros in revenues, and (iv) the increase in other operating income;\n- -partially offset (i) by the increase in the cost of handsets and other equipment sold, mainly due to the growth in mobile equipment sales, and (ii) higher interest on lease liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The mobile access base also continued to grow, recording a year-on-year increase of 4.3%;\n- -the growth of Fixed-only services, driven by the development of fixed-only broadband services, which rose by 12.6% year on year. The fixed-only broadband access base grew by 20.2% year on year reaching 3.3 million customers at December 31, 2023;\n- -and the increase in Wholesale services, largely due to the introduction of a national roaming agreement in Egypt.\n\n## 3.1.3.3.2 EBITDAaL - Africa & Middle East\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the increase of 151 million euros in EBITDAaL in Africa & Middle East countries between 2022 and 2023 includes (i) the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for 185 million euros, mainly as a result of movements in the Egyptian pound against the euro, (ii) the positive impact of changes in the scope of  consolidation  and  other  changes  for  28 million  euros,  and (iii)  the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. an increase of 307 million euros in EBITDAaL.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the increase of 307 million euros in EBITDAaL in Africa & Middle East countries between 2022 and 2023 is primarily explained by the growth of 729 million euros in revenues, partially offset by:\n\n- -the increase in commercial expenses and equipment costs, due to (i) higher fees, related to the growth in the revenues of Orange Money, (ii) increased equipment costs in Egypt resulting from a new distribution agreement, and (iii) the increase in the costs of SIM cards in several countries;\n- -the rise in other operating expenses, mainly reflecting the change in various risks between the two periods;\n- -the increase in network operating and maintenance expenses as a result of traffic growth, ongoing network roll-outs in all countries and higher energy access costs for fixed and mobile networks (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events);\n\n- -higher operating taxes and levies payables, mainly as a result of business growth and higher spectrum fees;\n- -higher service fees and inter-operator costs, directly in line with revenue growth in wholesale services and mostly related to the introduction of a national roaming agreement in Egypt;\n- -and rising labor expenses in almost all countries, relating to the commercial performance in the region.\n\n## 3.1.3.3.3 Operating income Africa & Middle East\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the increase of 90 million euros in operating income in Africa & Middle East countries between 2022 and 2023 includes (i) the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for 104 million euros, mainly as a result of movements in the Egyptian pound against the euro, (ii) the positive impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 28 million euros, and (iii)  the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. an increase of 166 million euros in operating income.\n\n## Change on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the increase of 166 million euros in operating income in Africa & Middle East countries between 2022 and 2023 is primarily explained by the rise of 307 million euros in EBITDAaL, partially offset by:\n\n- -the increase in depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, mainly due to growth in investments in recent years and the amortization of the new telecommunication licenses acquired;\n- -the  counter-effect  of  the  recognition  in  2022  of  gains  on disposal of 73 million euros related to the review of fixed assets, investments and business portfolio (mainly linked to the disposal of assets in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire);\n- -and the recognition in 2023 of a net expense on significant litigation of 38 million euros.\n\n## 3.1.3.3.4 Economic CAPEX Africa & Middle East\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the decrease of 22 million euros in economic CAPEX in Africa & Middle East countries between 2022 and 2023 includes (i) the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for 98 million euros, and (ii) the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. an increase of 76 million euros in economic CAPEX.\n\n## Change on a comparable basis\n\nOn  a comparable  basis ,  the  increase  of  76 million  euros  in economic  CAPEX  in  Africa  &  Middle  East  countries  between 2022 and 2023 is chiefly the result of the growth in investments in very high-speed broadband mobile networks (4G/5G) to support business growth (capacity investments) and changes in usage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Orange Business\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn  a historical  basis ,  the  decrease  of  125 million  euros  in the EBITDAaL of Orange Business between 2022 and 2023 is attributable to:\n\n- -the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for 3 million euros, partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 2 million euros;\n- -and the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. a decrease of 123 million euros in EBITDAaL.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the decrease of 123 million euros in the EBITDAaL of Orange Business between 2022 and 2023 can essentially be attributed to:\n\n- -the increase in commercial expenses and equipment costs in  connection  with  higher  sales  of  equipment  for  unified communication and collaboration services;\n- -higher IT costs, related notably to increased cybersecurity services;\n- -the rise in labor expenses, mainly due to the increase in the average salary and the number of employees connected with the development of IT & Integration Services and information technologies as part of the transformation of Orange Business into a Digital Services Company model (DSC, see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events);\n- -and the increase in other external purchases, relating to (i) the increase in overheads, (ii) the increase in building costs for resale, due to the development of integration services and information technologies, and (iii) the increase in real estate fees in an inflationary environment (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events);\n- -partially  offset  by  (i) the  decrease  in  service  fees  and inter-operator costs, directly connected with the contraction in revenues from voice services, (ii) the decrease in other operating expenses (net of other operating income), (iii) the decrease in operating taxes and levies payables, and (iv) the increase of 14 million euros in revenues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

In  2023, 16.7% of hosting revenues came from external customers, representing an increase of 0.5 points compared with 2022;\n- -and the increase in studies and site redevelopment work in France;\n- -largely offset by the decrease in revenues due to the rebilling of energy costs (see below).\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Totem had 27,292 sites with 38,116 active occupants, i.e. an occupation rate of 1.40 occupants per site.\n\n## 3.1.3.5.2 EBITDAaL - Totem\n\nChange on a historical basis and on a comparable basis\n\nOn both a historical basis and a comparable basis , the increase of 2 million euros in Totem's EBITDAaL between 2022 and 2023 was mainly due to:\n\n- -(i) the decrease in energy access costs, mainly due to the decrease in average energy prices between the two periods, and (ii) the increase of 2 million euros in revenues;\n- -mostly offset by (i) the increase in interest on lease liabilities and depreciation and amortization of right-of-use assets, mainly due to the rise in interest rates in an inflationary environment (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events) and the increase in the number of leased sites accompanying the growth in hosting activity, and (ii) the increase in building costs for resale.\n\n## 3.1.3.5.3 Operating income - Totem\n\nChange on a historical basis and on a comparable basis\n\nOn both a historical basis and a comparable basis , Totem's operating income was flat between 2022 and 2023. Between the two periods, the increase in EBITDAaL excluding interest on lease liabilities (with no effect on operating income) was offset by the increase in depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and the rise in restructuring programs costs.\n\n## 3.1.3.5.4 Economic CAPEX - Totem\n\nChange on a historical basis and on a comparable basis\n\nOn both a historical basis and a comparable basis , the 1 million euro increase in Totem's economic CAPEX between 2022 and 2023 was primarily due to the increase in the construction of new mobile sites, partially offset by the decrease in tower reinforcement works.\n\n## 3.1.3.6 International Carriers & Shared Services\n\n| International Carriers & Shared Services (at December 31, in millions of euros)   | 2023   | 2022 on a comparable  basis  (1)   | 2022 on a historical  basis   | Change (%) on a comparable  basis   | Change (%) on a historical  basis   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Revenue                                                                           | 1,478  | 1,536                              | 1,540                         | (3.7)%                              | (4.0)%                              |\n| EBITDAaL  (1)                                                                     | (30)   | (84)                               | (96)                          | 63.8%                               | 68.4%                               |\n| EBITDAaL/Revenue                                                                  | (2.0)% | (5.4)%                             | (6.2)%                        | 3.4 pt                              | 4.2 pt                              |\n| Operating income                                                                  | (563)  | (478)                              | (417)                         | (17.8)%                             | (34.9)%                             |\n| eCAPEX  (1)                                                                       | 225    | 278                                | 278                           | (19.0)%                             | (19.0)%                             |\n| eCAPEX/Revenue                                                                    | 15.2%  | 18.1%                              | 18.1%                         | (2.9 pt)                            | (2.8 pt)                            |\n| Investments in property, plant   and equipment and intangible assets              | 245    | 333                                | 333                           | (26.4)%                             | (26.4)%                             |\n| Investments in property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets/Revenue       | 16.6%  | 21.7%                              | 21.6%                         | (5.1 pt)                            | (5.1 pt)                            |\n| Average number of employees                                                       | 12,005 | 12,282                             | 12,134                        | (2.3)%                              | (1.1)%                              |\n\n- (1) See Section 3.1.5 Financial indicators not defined by IFRS and Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

That increase was mainly due to (i) higher Sofrecom revenues, and (ii) higher Orange Marine revenues due, on the one hand, to the increase in submarine cable-laying in a dynamic market, and, on the other, to the sale of cables and a submarine robot, (iii) partially offset by the decline in revenues from content activities (OCS and Orange Studio, see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).\n\n## 3.1.3.6.2 EBITDAaL - International Carriers & Shared Services\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the improvement of 65 million euros in the EBITDAaL of International Carriers & Shared Services between 2022 and 2023 included (i) the positive effect of foreign exchange fluctuations of 10 million euros, (ii) the favorable effect of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 2 million euros, and (iii) the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. an increase of 53 million euros in EBITDAaL.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the improvement of 53 million euros in the EBITDAaL of International Carriers & Shared Services between 2022 and 2023 was mainly due to:\n\n- -the sharp decline in interconnection fees, directly linked to lower wholesale services revenues and relating for the most part to the drop in voice traffic;\n- -the decrease in content costs, due to the reduced activity of OCS and Orange Studio (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events);\n\n- -the decrease in the depreciation and amortization of right-of-use assets, chiefly related to the termination of leases on tertiary buildings (offices and stores) and technical sites;\n- -and the decrease in labor expenses, in line with the reduction in the average number of employees (full-time equivalent), particularly for shared services;\n- -partially offset by (i) the decrease of 57 million euros in revenues, (ii) the increase in commercial expenses and equipment costs due to production transferred from inventory following the sale of rights of use for a submarine cable in the Caribbean, (iii) higher IT expenses, primarily as a result of increased outsourcing, and (iv) the increase in other external purchases, particularly due to higher real estate fees in an inflationary environment (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).\n\n## 3.1.3.6.3 Operating income - International Carriers & Shared Services\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the deterioration of 146 million euros in the operating income of International Carriers & Shared Services between 2022 and 2023 included:\n\n- -the unfavorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes, amounting to 71 million euros, mainly including the counter-effect of the gain on disposal related to the remeasurement of Deezer shares at fair value (following the merger of Deezer into the SPAC I2PO, and the initial public offering of the new entity in July 2022), recognized as a review of fixed assets, investments and business portfolio for 77 million euros in 2022 (see Note 3.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);\n- -the positive impact of foreign exchange fluctuations of 10 million euros;\n- -and the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. a decrease of 85 million euros in operating income.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the downturn of 85 million euros in the operating  income  of  International  Carriers  &  Shared  Services between 2022 and 2023 was mainly attributable to:\n\n- -(i)  the increase in specific labor expenses, mainly associated with French part-time for seniors plans and the related bonuses (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events - Effect of French pension reform), (ii) the increase in depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, (iii) the decrease in gains on disposal of fixed assets, mainly due to the decrease in disposals of real estate assets, and (iv) the increase in restructuring programs costs;\n- -partially offset by (i) the growth in EBITDAaL excluding interest on lease liabilities (with no effect on operating income) and (ii) the decrease in acquisition and integration costs.",

At December 31, 2023, Orange Bank Africa had 1.3 million customers.\n\nAs part of a strategic review of its assets, Orange, after seeking a partner for its banking subsidiary, announced in late June 2023 that it was entering into exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas to define a partnership for the referral of Orange Bank's client portfolio in France, develop mobile terminal financing solutions, and discuss the terms of a potential resumption of Orange Bank's activity in Spain. At the end of these negotiations, Orange Bank announced in late February 2024 a partnership with BNP Paribas to offer a banking continuity solution for its clients in France and Spain. This partnership was formalized by the signing of several agreements (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).\n\n## 3.1.3.7.1 Operating  activities\n\nThe segment information for Mobile Financial Services (operating income,  investments  in  property,  plant  and  equipment  and intangible assets) is presented in Notes 1.3, 1.4 and 1.6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 3.1.3.7.1.1\n\nOperating income -\n\nMobile Financial Services\n\nChange on a historical basis and on a comparable basis\n\nOn both a historical basis and a comparable basis , the decrease of 106 million euros in the operating income of Mobile Financial Services between 2022 and 2023 was mainly due to:\n\n- -(i)  the recognition, in 2023, of a provision of 122 million euros for restructuring costs in connection with the termination of Orange Bank activities (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events and 2023 Highlights of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 5.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (ii) to a lesser extent, the increase in the cost of bank credit\n\nrisk (see Notes 1.3, 1.4 and 5.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);\n\n- -partially offset by (i) the increase in net banking income (NBI, see  Notes 1.3,  1.4  and  4.2 to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements), driven by the increase in interest on banking investments in the context of rising interest rates, and the development of banking activities in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and (ii) the reduction in the depreciation and amortization of fixed assets.\n\n3.1.3.7.1.2\n\nEconomic CAPEX -\n\nMobile Financial Services\n\nChange on a historical basis and on a comparable basis\n\nOn both a historical basis and a comparable basis , the decrease of 3 million euros in the economic CAPEX of Mobile Financial Services between 2022 and 2023 was mainly due to the decrease in IT investments.\n\n## 3.1.3.7.2 Assets, liabilities and cash flows\n\nThe segment information for Mobile Financial Services (assets, liabilities and cash flows) is presented in Notes 1.7, 1.8 and 1.9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the activities of Mobile Financial Services (financial assets and liabilities) are described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nSince 2020, Orange Espagne has had in place a non-recourse program with Orange Bank for the disposal of receivables due in installments, replacing an existing program with a third-party bank. This program led to these receivables being derecognized from the balance sheet of Orange Espagne (within telecom activities) and presented as customer loans and receivables within Mobile Financial  Services  activities  (see  Notes 4.3  and  17.1.1 to  the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nLoans and receivables of Orange Bank are composed of loans and receivables with customers and credit institutions. Outstanding customer loans and receivables at December 31, 2023 came to 2.4 billion euros, a decrease of 123 million euros compared with December 31, 2022, due to the slowdown of commercial activity in France. Loans to B2C customers made up 97.6% of that total. 57.1% were consumer loans (see Note 17.1.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nPayables related to Orange Bank transactions are composed of customer deposits and bank's payables with credit institutions.

Accordingly, Section 3.1.4.1\n\nLiquidity and cash flows from telecom activities and Section 3.1.4.2 Financial debt and liquidity position of telecom activities deal with telecom activities, and Section 3.1.3.7 Mobile Financial Services covers the Group's banking activities.\n\n## 3.1.4.1 Liquidity and cash flows from telecom activities\n\n## 3.1.4.1.1 Organic cash flow and free cash flow all-in from telecom activities\n\nOrganic cash flow and free cash flow all-in from telecom activities are financial indicators not defined by IFRS.

At December 31, 2023, the liquidity position of telecom activities comprised (i) 6,120 million euros available to be drawn on credit lines, (ii) cash and cash equivalents of 5,504 million euros and (iii) investments at fair value of 2,678 million euros (see Note 14.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## 3.1.4.2.3 Exposure to market risks and financial instruments\n\nThe management of interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and counterparty risk, financial ratios and equity market risk, is described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFor further information on risks relating to financial markets, see Section 2.1.3 Financial risks.\n\n## 3.1.4.2.4 Change in Orange's credit rating\n\nOrange's credit rating is an additional overall performance indicator used to assess the Group's financial policy and risk management policy and, in particular, its solvency and liquidity risk. It is not a substitute for an analysis carried out by investors. Rating agencies regularly review the ratings they award. Any change in the rating could affect the cost of future financing or access to liquidity.\n\nIn  addition,  a  change  in  Orange's  credit  rating  will,  for  some outstanding financing, affect the compensation paid to investors via Step-up clauses (a clause that triggers an increase in the coupon interest rate in the event of a downgrade of Orange's long-term credit rating by the rating agencies, according to contractually defined rules - this clause may also stipulate a downward revision of the coupon interest rate in the event of an improvement in the rating, as long as the interest rate does not drop below the initial interest rate on the loan - see Note 14.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nOrange's credit rating at December 31, 2023 is as follows:\n\n| Orange's credit rating   | Standard & Poor's   | Moody's   | Fitch Ratings   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| (at December 31, 2023)   |                     |           |                 |\n| Long-term debt           | BBB+                | Baa1      | BBB+            |\n| Outlook                  | Stable              | Positive  | Stable          |\n| Short-term debt          | A2                  | P2        | F2              |\n\nFor further information on risks related to the financial markets and a history of the Company's credit ratings, see Section 2.1.3 Financial risks.\n\n## 3.1.4.3 Equity\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the French State held 22.95% of the share capital of Orange SA and 28.95% of the voting rights, directly or in concert with Bpifrance Participations (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThe payment of dividends by Orange took place as follows (see Note 15.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements):\n\n- -in 2023, payment of (i) the balance of the dividend of 0.40 euros per share for the 2022 fiscal year, and (ii) the interim dividend of 0.30 euros per share for the 2023 fiscal year;\n\n- -in 2022, payment of (i) the balance of the dividend of 0.40 euros per share for the 2021 fiscal year, and (ii) the interim dividend of 0.30 euros per share for the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally,  Orange  has  not  exercised  its  right  to  defer  the coupon payment for the subordinated notes since their issuance (see Note 15.4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and accordingly paid the noteholders compensation of 185 million euros in 2023 (including 177 million euros paid and 8 million euros reclassified as short-term borrowings) and 215 million euros in 2022 (including 213 million euros paid and 2 million euros reclassified as short-term borrowings).\n\nFollowing the transactions on subordinated notes in 2023, the Group's outstanding subordinated notes amounted to 4,950 million euros at December 31, 2023 (see Note 15.4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).",

Changes in equity are described in the\n\nconsolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity and in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 3.1.4.4 ROCE of telecom activities\n\nThe ROCE of telecom activities is a financial indicator not defined by IFRS. For further information on the calculation of the ROCE of telecom activities and the reasons why the Orange group uses this indicator, see Section 3.1.5 Financial indicators not defined by IFRS and Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary.\n\nThe ROCE of telecom activities came to 6.7% in 2023 compared with 5.8% in 2022.\n\n| ROCE of telecom activities  (1) (at December 31, in millions of euros)   |         | 2023   | 2022 on a historical  basis   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|-------------------------------|\n| (2)                                                                      |         |        |                               |\n| Net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) for fiscal year N               | (a)     | 3,890  | 3,383                         |\n| Net operating assets (NOA) at December 31, N-1  (2)                      | (b)     | 58,330 | 58,078                        |\n| ROCE of telecom activities  (1)                                          | (a)/(b) | 6.7%   | 5.8%                          |\n\n- (1) See Section 3.1.5 Financial indicators not defined by IFRS and Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary.\n- (2) See Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary.\n\nBetween December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, the ROCE of telecom activities increased by 0.8 points, due to the growth in net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) between 2022 and 2023. This growth was mainly due to the increase in EBITDAaL on a historical basis (despite the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations), as well as:\n\n- -(i) the counter-effect of the recognition in 2022 of goodwill impairment  in  Romania  (see  Note 7 to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements), and (ii) the decrease in adjusted income tax;\n- partially  offset  by  (i) the  growth  in  the  depreciation  and amortization  of  fixed  assets  (see  Section 3.1.2.2.2  Group operating income), (ii) the increase in restructuring programs costs (see Section 3.1.2.2.2 Group operating income), and (iii) the effect of French pension reform on French part-time for seniors plans (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events and Section 3.1.2.2.2 Group operating income).\n\n## 3.1.5 Financial indicators not defined by IFRS\n\nIn this document, in addition to the financial indicators reported in  accordance  with  IFRS  (International  Financial  Reporting Standards), Orange publishes financial indicators not defined by IFRS. As described below, these figures are presented as additional information and are not meant to be substitutes for, or to be confused with, the financial indicators as defined by IFRS.\n\n## 3.1.5.1 Data on a comparable basis\n\nIn order to allow investors to track the annual changes in the Group's operations, data on a comparable basis are presented for the previous period. The transition from data on a historical basis to data on a comparable basis consists of keeping the results for the fiscal year ended and restating the results for the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year, in order to present financial data with comparable methods, scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods. Orange provides details of the effect of changes in method, scope of consolidation and exchange rates on its key operating indicators in order to isolate the intrinsic\n\nbusiness effect. The method used is to apply to the data of the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year the methods and the scope of consolidation for the period just ended, as well as the average exchange rates used for the consolidated income statement in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the period just ended.\n\nOrange's management believes that the presentation of these indicators on a comparable basis is relevant because these are indicators used internally by the Group to monitor its operating activities. Changes on a comparable basis better reflect organic business changes.\n\nData on a comparable basis are financial indicators not defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other groups. It is provided as additional information only and should not be considered a substitute for an analysis of the Group's historical data for the past fiscal year or previous periods.\n\n-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

It consists of (i) financial liabilities excluding operating payables (translated into euros at the year-end closing rate) including derivative instruments (assets and liabilities), (ii) less cash collateral paid, cash, cash equivalents and financial assets at fair value. Furthermore, financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges included in net financial debt are set up to hedge items that are not included therein, such as future cash flows. As a result, the portion relating to these unmatured hedging instruments recorded in other comprehensive income is added to gross financial debt to offset this temporary difference.\n\nThe breakdown of net financial debt is shown in Note 13.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNet financial debt is an indicator of financial position used by the Group.

As net financial debt (as defined and used by Orange) does not take into account Mobile Financial Services activities, for which this concept is not relevant, net financial debt is divided by EBITDAaL from telecom activities. In addition, when changes  in  the  scope  of  consolidation  significantly  affect  the Group's net financial debt at the end of the period, the calculation of the ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL from telecom activities is adjusted to take into account the EBITDAaL from those entities over the previous 12 months.\n\nThe table below shows the calculation of the ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL of telecom activities.\n\n| (at December 31, in millions of euros)                             | 2023   | 2022 on a historical  basis   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|\n| Net financial debt (a)                                             | 27,002 | 25,298                        |\n| EBITDAaL from telecom activities (b)                               | 13,157 | 13,080                        |\n| Ratio of net financial debt/EBITDAaL of telecom activities (a / b) | 2.05   | 1.93                          |\n\nThe ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL of telecom activities is used by Orange to measure the Group's ability to repay its debt, and more broadly to measure its financial strength.

The combination of Orange Spain and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil activities takes the form of an equal joint venture, co-controlled by Orange and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil, with equal governance rights in the combined entity.\n\nThe new company is positioned as one of the leading operators in the Spanish market in terms of customers, user experience, talent and network coverage (fiber and mobile) and a sustainable actor with the financial capacity to continue investing in the development of telecom infrastructure in Spain. It will serve more than 7.3 million fixed customers, more than 30 million mobile services and more than 2.2 million TV customers and will manage important network and IT assets to assure a nationwide FTTH and 4G/5G coverage. In financial terms, it will become a stronger and solid market player with estimated revenues of above 7.4 billion euros and EBITDAaL of over 2.3 billion euros. The company's value reaches 18.6 billion euros, before synergies. According to revised estimates, the new company is expected to generate synergies of more than 490 million euros per year by the fourth year following the completion of the operation. Based on preliminary closing accounts, the respective proceeds at closing will be approximately 4.4 billion euros for Orange and approximately 1.65 billion euros for M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil shareholders.\n\n## 3.2.2 Financial  objectives\n\nOrange confirms its financial targets to 2025, as presented at the Capital Markets Day on February 16, 2023 (on a comparable basis and without taking into account mergers and acquisitions that have not yet been finalized).\n\nIn 2024, Orange aims to achieve the following targets within its current scope:\n\n- -slight growth in EBITDAaL (see Section 3.1.5.2 EBITDAaL);\n- -discipline on eCAPEX (see Section 3.1.5.3 eCAPEX);\n- -organic cash flow from telecom activities (see Section 3.1.5.5 Organic cash flow from telecom activities) of at least 3.8 billion euros;\n- -and a ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL from telecom activities (see Section 3.1.5.8 Ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL from telecom activities) unchanged at around 2x in the medium term.\n\nThis transaction was made possible by the European Commission's authorization on February 20, 2024, and the Spanish government's agreement on March 12, 2024 to control foreign investment. As part of the proposed remedies, the parties have agreed to cede frequencies to Digi in three spectrum bands and proposed an optional national roaming agreement at market conditions.\n\nThe new company will be operational from the beginning of the second quarter and will be accounted for by the equity method in the Orange Group financial statements. Jean Fran\u00e7ois Fallacher, Executive Director in charge of Orange France, has been appointed non-executive Chairman of the joint venture and Meinrad Spenger as its Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## New issue and tender offer of subordinated notes\n\nOrange issued on March 27, 2024 700 million euros undated deeply subordinated fixed to reset rate notes with a first call date as of 15 December 2030 and with a fixed coupon of 4.50% until the first reset date and launched a tender offer up to the same amount to repurchase existing Euro-denominated hybrid notes.\n\n## TDIRA\n\nFollowing a Buyback, as of March 28, 2024, 43,813 TDIRAs remain outstanding for a total par value of 618 million euros.\n\nThe deconsolidation of Spain does not change the targets of slight growth in EBITDAaL and discipline on eCAPEX. Organic cash flow from telecom activities, within the scope excluding Orange Spain, will continue to grow by more than 300 million euros between 2023 and 2025, to reach at least 3.3 billion euros in 2024 and 3.5 billion euros in 2025 (organic cash flow from telecom activities restated for Orange Spain was 3.18 billion in 2023).\n\nFor more information on the outlook and objectives beyond 2024, see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy.\n\nRegarding the dividend, see Section 6.3 Dividend distribution policy.\n\nThese objectives are based on the assumptions stated in the presentation of the key changes in the telecom services market and the Group strategy (see Section 1.2 Business model, market and strategy) as well as in the presentation of the Group's operating activities, which include a description of the various business segment markets (see Section 1.4 Operating activities).\n\nThey were compiled and prepared on a comparable basis with the historical financial information and in line with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements. The most significant risks are detailed in Section 2.1 Risk factors.",

The Europe aggregate thus includes all the business segments in this region;\n- -the Sonatel sub-group (grouping together Sonatel in Senegal, Orange Mali, Orange Bissau, Orange in Guinea and Orange in Sierra Leone), the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-group (including the Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire entities, Orange in Burkina Faso and Orange in Liberia) and each of the other countries in Africa & Middle East. The Africa & Middle East aggregate thus presents all the business segments in this region;\n- -Orange Business, which combines communication solutions and services as well as integration and information technology services for businesses in France and around the world (including the cybersecurity activity);\n- -Totem, which combines the activities of the European TowerCo and operates a portfolio of some 27,000 tower sites in France and Spain;\n- -International Carriers & Shared Services (IC&SS) activities, which includes certain resources, mainly in the areas of networks, information systems, Research and Development and other shared Group activities, as well as the Orange brand;\n- -Mobile  Financial Services, which includes Orange Bank.\n\nThe use of shared resources, mainly provided by International Carriers & Shared Services, is taken into account in segment results based either on the terms of contractual agreements between legal entities, external benchmarks or by reallocating costs among the segments. The supply of shared resources is included in the other income of the service provider, and the use of these resources is included in the expenses of the service user. The cost of shared resources may be affected by changes in contractual relationships or organization and may therefore impact the segment results presented from one fiscal year to another.\n\n## Operating performance indicators\n\nEBITDAaL and eCAPEX are the key operating performance indicators used by the Group to:\n\n- -manage and assess its operating and segment results; and\n- -implement its investment and resource allocation strategy.\n\nThe Group's management believes that the presentation of these indicators is relevant as it provides readers with the same management indicators as those used internally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The associated procedures are based on third-party decisions (regulatory authority, court, etc.) and occur over a different period from the activities at the source of the litigation. Costs are by nature difficult to predict in terms of their source, amount and period;\n- -specific labor expenses: irrespective of any departure plans included in restructuring programs costs, certain employee working time adjustment programs have a negative impact on the period in which they are signed and implemented. Specific labor expenses also relate to changes in assumptions and experience effects for the various part-time for seniors plans in France;\n- -review of fixed assets, investments and business portfolio: the Group conducts an ongoing review of its fixed assets, investments and business portfolio. In this context, exit or disposal decisions are implemented and, by their nature, have an impact on the period in which they take place;\n- -restructuring programs costs: the adaptation of the Group's activities to changes in the environment may generate costs related to the shutdown or major transformation of an activity. These costs, linked to the cessation or major transformation of an activity, mainly consist of employee departure plans, contract terminations and costs in respect of contracts that have become onerous;\n- -acquisition and integration costs: the Group incurs costs directly related to the acquisition of entities and their integration in the months following their acquisition. These are primarily fees, registration costs and earn-outs;\n- -where appropriate, other specific items that are systematically specified in relation to income and/or expenses.\n\nEBITDAaL is a financial indicator not defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other groups. It is provided as additional information only and should not be considered a substitute for operating income or cash flows provided by operating activities.\n\neCAPEX relates to acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding telecommunication licenses and financed assets, minus the price of disposal of fixed assets. It is used internally as an indicator to allocate resources. eCAPEX is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other companies.\n\nThe Group uses organic cash flow from telecom activities as an operating performance measure for telecom activities as a whole. Organic cash flow from telecom activities relates to net cash flows provided by telecom activities minus (i) repayment of lease liabilities and debt related to financed assets, (ii) purchases and sales of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, net of the change in fixed asset payables, (iii) excluding the effect of telecommunication licenses paid and significant litigation paid (and received). Organic cash flow is a financial indicator not defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other groups.\n\nThe Group uses free cash flow all-in from telecom activities as an operating performance measure for telecom activities as a whole. Free cash flow all-in from telecom activities relate to net cash provided by telecom activities minus (i) repayment of lease liabilities and debt relating to financed assets, (ii) purchases and sales of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, net of the change in fixed asset payables, and (iii) payments of coupons on subordinated notes. Free cash flow all-in from telecom activities is a financial indicator not defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other groups.\n\n## Assets and liabilities\n\nInter-segment assets and liabilities are reported in each business segment.\n\nNon-allocated assets and liabilities of telecom activities mainly include external financial debt, external cash and cash equivalents, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and equity. Financial debt and investments between these segments are presented as unallocated items.\n\nFor Mobile Financial Services, the line 'Other' includes the assets and liabilities listed above as well as loans and receivables and payables related to Mobile Financial Services transactions.\n\nThe other accounting policies are presented within each note to which they refer.",

In addition to its role as a supplier of connectivity,  the  Group  provides  enterprise  services,  primarily solutions  in  the  fields  of  digital  work,  security  and  improving business line processes.\n\nTelecommunication operator activities are regulated and dependent upon the granting of licenses, just as Mobile Financial Services activities have their own regulations.\n\n## 2.2 Basis of preparation of the /financial statements\n\nThe  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  were  approved  by the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 14, 2024 and will be submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting on May 22, 2024.\n\nThe 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards\n\n(IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union. Comparative figures are presented for 2022 and 2021 using the same basis of preparation.\n\nThe data are presented in millions of euros, without a decimal. Rounding  to  the  nearest  million  may  in  some  cases  lead  to non-significant discrepancies in the totals and subtotals shown in the tables.\n\nFor  the  reported  periods,  the  accounting  standards  and interpretations endorsed by the European Union are similar to the compulsory standards and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) with the exception of the texts currently being endorsed, that have no effect on the Group's financial statements. Consequently, the Group's financial statements are prepared in accordance with the IFRS standards and interpretations, as published by the IASB.\n\nThe principles applied to prepare the 2023 financial data are based on:\n\n- -all the standards and interpretations endorsed by the European Union that were compulsory at December 31, 2023;\n- -the options taken relating to the date and methods of first-time adoption (see 2.3 below);\n- -the recognition and measurement options allowed under IFRS:\n\n| Standard   |                                                                                                          | Alternative used                                                                                                                              |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| IAS 1      | Accretion expense on operating liabilities  (employee benefits, environmental  liabilities and licenses) | Classification as financial expenses                                                                                                          |\n| IAS 2      | Inventories                                                                                              | Measurement of inventories according to the weighted average unit cost method                                                                 |\n| IAS 7      | Interest paid and dividends received                                                                     | Classification as net cash provided by operating activities                                                                                   |\n| IAS 16     | Property, plant and equipment                                                                            | Measurement at amortized historical cost                                                                                                      |\n| IAS 38     | Intangible assets                                                                                        | Measurement at amortized historical cost                                                                                                      |\n| IFRS 3     | Non-controlling interests                                                                                | At the acquisition date, measurement either at fair value or according   to the portion of the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity |\n\n- -accounting positions adopted by the Group in accordance with paragraphs 10 to 12 of IAS 8:\n\n| Topic                                                                                                 | Note                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements                                                     | Financial statements and segment information |\n| Operating taxes and levies payables                                                                   | 10.1                                         |\n| Income taxes                                                                                          | 10.2                                         |\n| Non-controlling interests: change in ownership interest  in a subsidiary and transactions with owners | 3 and 15.6                                   |\n\nIn the absence of any accounting standard or interpretation applicable to a specific transaction or event, the Group's management uses its judgment to define and apply an accounting policy that will result in relevant and reliable information, such that the financial statements:\n\n- -present a true and fair view of the Group's financial position, financial performance and cash flows;\n- -reflect the economic substance of transactions;\n- -are  neutral;\n- -are prepared on a prudent basis; and\n- -are complete in all material respects.\n\n- 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

        "page_content": "3 -\n\n## 2.3 New standards and interpretations applied from January 1, 2023\n\nOnly the amendments of the standards applicable to the Group whose effective date is January 1, 2023 are described below.\n\n## 2.3.1 Amendment to IAS 1: Disclosure of accounting policies\n\nThe amendment to the standard indicates that an entity must now disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. This amendment only marginally changes the information provided by the Group in its notes to the annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 2.3.2 Amendment to IAS 8: Definition of accounting estimates\n\nThe amendment to the standard revised the definition of accounting estimates without changing the concept. The implementation of this amendment has had no impact on the Group's Consolidated Financial  Statements  and  should  only  marginally  change  the information  provided  by  the  Group  in  its  notes  to  the  annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 2.3.3 Amendment to IAS 12: Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities acquired through a single transaction\n\nThe amendment introduces a new exception to the exemption from the initial recognition of deferred taxes. As a result of this amendment,  an  entity  does  not  apply  the  initial  recognition exemption for transactions that give rise to deductible and taxable temporary differences of identical amounts.\n\nUnder applicable tax law, equal taxable and deductible temporary differences may arise on initial recognition of an asset and a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. For example, this may occur when the lease liability and the corresponding right-of-use asset are recognized under IFRS 16 at the inception of a lease. The Group's accounting policies were already aligned with the proposals of the amendment.\n\n## 2.3.4 Amendment to IAS 12: International tax reform - Pillar Two model rules\n\nAmendments have been made to IAS 12 in response to the OECD's 'Pillar Two' reform of international taxation, which mainly aims to establish a minimum tax rate of 15%, to be applied in France from the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nThis amendment includes:\n\n- -a  temporary,  mandatory  exception  for  the  recognition  of deferred tax resulting from the implementation of this Pillar Two reform; and\n- -various disclosures to be made prior to the implementation of  this  reform  in  order  to  inform  users  of  the  financial statements of the Group's exposure to the consequences of its implementation.\n\nThe  Group  has  launched  a  working  group  to  identify  the consequences and organize the processes needed to comply with this tax reform. Given the current progress of the work done by the Group and the regulations of the countries in which the Group operates, the financial consequences are expected to be limited (see Note 10.4).\n\n## 2.3.5 IFRS 17 and amendments to IFRS 9: Insurance Contracts\n\nThe Group is not subject to the provisions of the new IFRS 17 on the recognition and measurement of insurance contracts. The amendments to IFRS 9 propose provisions enabling the disclosure of comparative information to companies adopting IFRS 17 for the first time.\n\n## 2.4 Standards and interpretations compulsory after December 31, 2023 with no early adoption\n\n## 2.4.1 Amendment to IAS 21: Lack of exchangeability\n\nIAS 21 has been amended to specify how to assess whether a currency is exchangeable or not and how to determine the exchange rate when it is not. As the Group does not operate in countries with non-exchangeable currencies, the implementation of this amendment is not expected to have any impact. The date of entry into force of this amendment is January 1, 2025.\n\n## 2.4.2 Amendment to IAS 7 and IFRS 7: Reverse factoring - Supplier finance arrangements\n\nThe amendment to the two standards is added to the list of disclosures, with a specific focus on reverse factoring transactions. This amendment should only marginally change the information provided by the Group in its notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as such factoring transactions are already described in the Group's notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The date of entry into force of this amendment is January 1, 2024.\n\n## 2.4.3 Amendment to IAS 1: Classification of liabilities as current or non-current\n\nThe  amendment  to  the  standard  sets  out  new  provisions  for assessing the presentation of a liability in the balance sheet at the reporting date, based on conditions that might make the liability payable within the 12 months following the reporting date. This amendment is not expected to have any impact on the Group's Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  is  only  expected  to marginally change the information provided by the Group in its notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The date of entry into force of this amendment is January 1, 2024.\n\n## 2.4.4 Amendment to IFRS 16: Lease liability in a sale and leaseback\n\nThe amendment clarifies the accounting treatment of changes in the lease liability arising from the sale of an asset followed by the leaseback of the asset at variable rents. This amendment does not change the initial accounting treatment of the lease liability, but specifies that in the event of subsequent changes in rents, the difference between the rent actually paid and the reduction in the liability is recognized in the income statement. The Group does not expect the implementation of this amendment to have a significant impact, as sale and leaseback transactions are not common within the Group. The provisions of this amendment will apply as of January 1, 2024.",

|\n\nFurthermore, aside from the elements linked to the level of activity, income and future cash flows are sensitive to changes in financial market risks, notably interest rate and foreign exchange risks (see Note 14).\n\n## 2.5.3 Consideration of climate change risks\n\nNatural disasters and other accidental events related to climate change, such as fires, could lead to significant destruction of the Orange group's facilities, resulting in both service interruptions and high repair costs. The frequency and intensity of weather events related to climate change (e.g. floods, storms and heat waves) continue to increase, which could aggravate claims and increase the related damage. In the medium term, rising sea levels could affect sites and facilities located near the coast more often. While coverage of claims by insurers could decrease further, the damage caused by major disasters could result in significant costs to Orange, some of which could be at the expense of the Orange group and thus affect its financial position and outlook.\n\nThe  Group  is  therefore  integrating  climate  change  risks  more systematically into its activities. This can be seen in the assessment of these risks on the value of some of its assets through their depreciation  schedule  or  as  an  event  that  could  lead  to  the identification  of  an  impairment  loss  indicator  or  on  the  future\n\nprospects of obtaining financing. Consideration of climate risks is also reflected in the Group's commitment to be Net Zero Carbon by 2040. This commitment has led to changes in certain investment choices related to its activity.\n\nNumerous projects have been initiated within the Group in order to understand the impacts of climate change on its operations. The implementation of actions to limit the effects of the Group's activities on climate change is also underway. The outcome of these projects could lead the Group to review certain accounting treatments, judgments or estimates of financial risks, the impact of which is still difficult to assess reliably. Climate resilience and adaptation are fast-growing topics and will require the Group to better assess the risks to which it is exposed. The Group has begun a process of analysis in order to diagnose the exposure to climate risks of its various geographic locations based on the study of various impact scenarios related to climate change. At December 31, 2023, the Group has not identified any reliably estimated material impact on its financial statements at the stage of completion of the projects in progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

As of the completion of this transaction, Orange Romania Communications is jointly owned by Orange (54%) and the Romanian government (46%).\n\nOn  December 6,  2023,  an  agreement  was  signed  with  the Romanian state defining the main principles of the merger of Orange Romania Communications into Orange Romania and the entry of the Romanian state into the capital of Orange Romania.\n\nThe signing of this agreement has no impact on the Consolidated Financial  Statements  at  December 31,  2023.  The  merger  is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024.\n\n## Other ongoing projects in 2023\n\n## Conclusions from the Orange Bank strategic review and exclusive negotiations entered into with BNP Paribas\n\nOn June 28, 2023, the Orange group announced that it was entering into exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas to define a referral partnership for the Orange Bank customer portfolio in France, and to develop financing solutions for mobile devices. The two groups are also discussing the terms of a takeover of Orange Bank's business in Spain. This partnership will provide a continuity solution for Orange Bank customers and is in line with the intention to progressively withdraw Orange Bank from the retail banking market in France and Spain.\n\n## Changes in the scope of consolidation during 2022\n\n## Merger by incorporation of Deezer by the SPAC I2PO and initial public offering of the global music streaming platform\n\nOn April 19, 2022, I2PO, a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) publicly traded since July 2021, and Deezer (the global music and audio streaming platform) announced that they had reached a definitive agreement for a business combination.\n\nOn July 4, 2022, Deezer's shareholders contributed their shares to the SPAC in exchange for newly issued shares of the latter. A capital increase was carried out at the same time.\n\nThe merged entity, renamed Deezer, was floated on the stock exchange on July 5, 2022, and is now listed on the professional compartment of the Euronext Paris regulated market. Before the\n\ninitial public offering, the transaction valued Deezer's shares at 1.05 billion euros.\n\nPrior to the transaction, the Group held an equity interest of 10.42% in Deezer and exercised a significant influence over the entity due to its presence on the Board of Directors.\n\nAfter the transaction, Orange holds 8.13% of the new entity and no longer exercises a significant influence. Pursuant to IAS 28 and IFRS 9, the transaction entailed the disposal of all of Deezer's interests in associates and joint ventures and the purchase at fair value of 9,061,723 shares in the new entity. Orange also purchased 500,000 additional shares by participating in the capital increase that followed the merger.\n\nThe Deezer shares had been fully impaired in the Group's financial statements and the fair value of the I2PO shares was calculated on the basis of the price proposed for the initial public offering of July 5, 2022, i.e. 8.50 euros per share.\n\nThis transaction thus resulted in the Orange group recognizing a gain on disposal of 77 million euros in the income statement for the second half-year.\n\nThe shares of the new entity are presented in the balance sheet as investment securities at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Changes in the scope of consolidation during 2021\n\n## Disposal of 50% of the capital of Orange Concessions\n\nOn November 3, 2021, after receiving final approvals from the antitrust and local authorities, the Orange group sold a 50% stake in Orange Concessions to the HIN consortium (bringing together La Banque des Territoires, CNP Assurances and EDF Invest) for an amount of 1,053 million euros, resulting in the loss of Orange's exclusive control over this entity and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe transaction also includes a call option for the acquisition of an additional 1%, exercisable by Orange during the second quarter of the years 2026 to 2027. Guarantees, which are customary in this type of transaction, have also been granted (see Note 16 Contractual obligations and off-balance sheet commitments).\n\nAs part of the transaction, 43 million euros was also received as compensation for a shareholder loan between Orange and Orange Concessions that existed prior to the disposal date. In addition, in November 2021, Orange Concessions repaid approximately 620 million euros of loans contracted, before the transaction date, with Orange SA following the issuance of bank loans by Orange Concessions.\n\nFollowing this transaction, Orange Concessions is 50% owned by Orange and 50% owned by the consortium, which have joint control over this entity, which combines 24 subsidiaries that hold Public Initiative Networks (PIN) contracts with local authorities in mainland France and the French overseas territories.\n\nThis investment has been accounted for using the equity method since November 3, 2021. The fair value of the remaining stake retained by the Orange group (corresponding to 50% of the capital of Orange Concessions) amounted to 1,053 million euros at the transaction date (see Note 11 Interests in associates and joint ventures).",

The offer was opened from April 8 to April 23, 2021 and then voluntarily reopened from April 28, 2021 to May 4, 2021, under the same conditions. Following this offer, Orange SA directly and indirectly held 76.97% of the share capital of Orange Belgium.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Changes in the scope of consolidation\n\nEntities are fully consolidated if the Group has the following:\n\n- -power over the investee; and\n- -exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n- -the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of its returns.\n\nIFRS 10 requires the exercise of judgment and continuous assessment of the control situation.\n\nClarifications of when the ownership interest does not imply a de facto presumption are provided in Note 20, which lists the main consolidated entities.\n\nJoint ventures and companies over which the Group exercises significant influence (generally corresponding to an ownership interest of 20% to 50%) are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nWhen assessing the level of control or significant influence exercised over a subsidiary or associate, the existence and effect of any exercisable or convertible potential voting rights at the closing date are taken into account.\n\n## Takeovers (business combinations)\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method:\n\n- -the acquisition cost is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including all contingent consideration, at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the fair value of a contingent consideration are accounted for either through profit or loss or in equity, in accordance with the applicable standards, facts and circumstances;\n- -goodwill is the difference between the consideration transferred, plus the non-controlling interests and the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, and is recognized as an asset in the statement of financial position. Considering the Group's activity, the fair value measurements of the identifiable assets mainly relate to licenses, customer bases and brands (which cannot be capitalized when developed in-house), generating associated deferred tax. The fair value of these assets, which cannot be observed, is established using commonly adopted methods, such as those based on revenues or costs (e.g.: the 'Greenfield' method for the valuation of licenses, the 'relief from royalty' method for the valuation of brands and the 'excess earnings' method for customer bases);\n\nThe total acquisition cost of these shares amounted to 316 million euros.  This  share  offer  did  not  change  the  Orange  group's pre-existing control over Orange Belgium, its subsidiaries and non-consolidated  shares.  Thus,  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements, this transaction resulted in an effect of (316) million euros on equity (including (172) million euros relating to the portion attributable to owners of the parent company and (144) million euros relating to the portion attributable to minority shareholders).\n\nThe cash paid out to acquire these minority interests in Orange has been presented in the financing flows in the statement of cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The related other comprehensive income, if any, is fully reclassified to profit or loss. When the previous portion was measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the remeasurement was recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Loss of exclusive control resulting from the partial disposal of consolidated shares\n\nA loss of exclusive control by the Group over one of its subsidiaries results in the recognition in profit or loss of a capital gain or loss on the disposal, and in the remeasurement at fair value of the residual interest retained in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 10 applicable in the event of a loss of control.\n\n## Loss of significant influence or joint control leading to the discontinuation of the equity method while retaining a residual interest\n\nA loss of significant influence or joint control by the Group over one of its associates or joint ventures while retaining a residual interest results in the recognition in profit or loss of a capital gain or loss on the disposal of the shares sold, and, in accordance with the provisions of IAS 28, the remeasurement at fair value of the residual interest retained. The fair value of the retained interest constitutes the entry value of the financial asset within the scope of IFRS 9.\n\n## Internal transfer of consolidated shares\n\nThe IFRS do not address the accounting treatment of a transfer of consolidated shares within the Group resulting in changes in ownership interest. The Group applies the following accounting policy:\n\n- -the transferred shares are carried at historical cost and the gain or loss on disposal is fully eliminated in the acquirer's accounts;\n- -the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their share in equity against Group retained earnings, with no impact on profit and loss and equity.\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nThe Group qualifies an asset or group of assets as 'held for sale' when:\n\n- -the management is committed to a plan to sell;\n- -the asset is available for immediate sale in its current state (subject to any conditions precedent that are usual in such disposals); and\n- -the disposal is highly likely to take place within 12 months.\n\nThus, when the Group is committed to a plan to sell involving the loss of control or significant influence over one of its assets, it classifies all assets and liabilities of the entity concerned on a separate line in the statement of financial position: 'Assets/Liabilities held for sale', at a value equal to the lower of the net carrying value and the fair value net of disposal costs.\n\nIn addition, when the asset or group of assets held for sale is a major component of a business segment, its contribution to the income statement is presented separately below 'net income from continuing operations' and its cash flow contribution is presented in the statement of cash flows.\n\n## Note 4 Sales\n\n## 4.1 Revenue\n\nRevenue is presented by category and segment in Note 1. The breakdown of revenue by type is as follows:\n\n- -Convergent services: these include revenue from convergent services in the B2C market (combined Internet + Mobile offers);\n- -Mobile-only services: mobile-only services revenue includes call revenues (voice, SMS and data), mainly outgoing, excluding convergent services (see below);\n- -Fixed-only services: revenue from fixed-only services includes revenue from retail sales of fixed broadband and narrowband\n\n- services, excluding convergent services (see below) and B2B fixed solutions and networks services, including voice and data services;\n- -IT  &  Integration  Services:  these  services  include  unified communication and collaboration services (LAN and telephony, consultancy, integration, project management), hosting and infrastructure services (including Cloud Computing), application services (customer relations management and other application services), security services, video conferencing offers and equipment sales related to the above products and services;",

        "page_content": "- -Services to carriers (wholesale): wholesale revenue includes roaming revenue from customers of other networks (national and  international  roaming),  from  Mobile  Virtual  Network Operators (MVNO), from network sharing and from equipment sales to operators;\n- -Equipment  sales:  equipment  sales  include  all  sales  of equipment  (handsets,  broadband  equipment,  connected devices and accessories) with the exception of equipment sales related to IT & Integration Services (presented on the 'IT &\n\n- 3\n\nIntegration Services' line), sales of network equipment related to the operation of voice and data services in the Orange Business segment (presented on the 'Fixed-only services' line), equipment sales to external distributors or brokers (presented on the 'Other revenues' line) and equipment sales to operators;\n\n- -other revenues: these revenues include, in particular, equipment sales to external distributors and brokers, revenue from portals, online advertising and the Group's cross-functional activities and miscellaneous other revenues.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nMost revenue falls within the application scope of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers.' Orange's products and services are offered to customers under services-only contracts and contracts combining the equipment used to access services and/or other service offers. Revenue is recognized net of VAT and other taxes collected on behalf of governments.\n\n- -Standalone service offers (mobile-only services, fixed-only services, convergent services)\n\nOrange offers its B2C and B2B customers a range of fixed and mobile telephony services, fixed and mobile Internet access offers and content offers (TV, video, media, value-added audio service, etc.). Some contracts are for a fixed term (generally 12 or 24 months), while others may be terminated at short notice (i.e. monthly arrangements or portions of services).\n\nService revenue is recognized when the service is provided, based on use (e.g. minutes of traffic or bytes of data processed) or the period (e.g. monthly service costs).\n\nFor some content services, Orange may act solely as an agent enabling the supply by a third-party of goods or services to the customer and not as a principal in the supply of the content. In such cases, revenue is recognized net of amounts transferred to the third party.\n\nContracts with customers generally do not include a material right, as the price invoiced for subscriptions and the services purchased and consumed by the customer beyond the specific scope (e.g. additional consumption, options, etc.) generally reflect their standalone selling prices. There is no significant impact from contract modification for this type of service contract. Service obligations transferred to the customer at the same pace are treated as a single obligation.\n\nWhen contracts include contractual clauses relating to commercial discounts (initial discount on signing the contract or conditional on reaching a consumption threshold) or items provided free of charge (for example: a free three-month subscription), the Group spreads these discounts or free items over the term of the contract (the period during which the Group and the customer have firm commitments). Where applicable, the consideration payable to the customer is recognized as a deduction from revenue in accordance with the specific terms and conditions of each contract.\n\nIf the performance obligations are not classified as distinct, the offer revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. One of the main applications of this method is the initial service connection in the context of a subscription and communication offer. It is not generally separable from the subscription and communication offer and its invoicing is therefore recognized in income over the average term of the expected contractual relationship.\n\n## -Separate equipment sales\n\nOrange offers its B2C and B2B customers several ways to buy their equipment (primarily mobile devices): equipment sales may be separate from or bundled with a service offer. When separate from a service offer, the amount invoiced is recognized in revenue on delivery and receivable immediately or in installments over a period of up to 24 months. Where payment is received in installments, the offer comprises a financial component and gives rise to the calculation of interest deducted from the amount invoiced and recognized over the payment period in finance costs, net.\n\nWhere Orange purchases and sells equipment to indirect channels, the Group generally considers that Orange maintains control until resale to the end-customer (the distributor acts as an agent), even where ownership is transferred to the distributor. Sale proceeds are therefore recognized when the end-customer takes possession of the equipment (on activation).\n\n## -Bundled equipment and service offers\n\nOrange proposes numerous offers to its B2C and B2B customers comprising equipment (e.g. a mobile device) and services (e.g. a talk & text plan).\n\nEquipment revenue is recognized separately from service revenue if the two components are distinct (i.e. if the customer can receive one or other of the services separately). Where one of the components in the offer is not at its separate selling price, revenue is allocated to each component in proportion to their individual selling prices. This is notably the case in offers combining the sale of a mobile phone at a reduced price, where the individual selling price of the mobile phone is considered equal to its purchase cost and logistics expenses plus a commercial margin based on market practice. The amount allocated to equipment sales is recognized under revenue on delivery in exchange for a contract asset, spread over the term of the service contract.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

Revenue recognition requires an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each contract in order to determine whether distinct performance obligations exist. Under these contracts, if the build phase is classified as separate, the Group recognizes the revenue of this phase according to the percentage of completion. However, if the Group does not have a certain right to payment and/or if there is no continuous transfer of control of the asset being built, then revenues for this phase are recognized upon completion. These contracts are generally multi-year, with scalable offers. On each contract modification, we assess the scope of the modification and its impact on the contract price in order to determine whether the modification should be treated as a separate contract, as though the existing contract were terminated and a new contract signed, or whether the modification should be considered as a change to the existing contract.\n\n## -Service offers to carriers (wholesale)\n\nThree types of commercial agreements are entered into with wholesale customers for domestic wholesale activities or international carrier offers:\n\n- -'pay-as-you-go' model: contract generally applied to 'legacy' regulated activities (bitstream call termination, local loop access, roaming and certain data solution contracts), where contract services are not covered by a firm volume commitment. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided (which relates to transfer of control) over the contractual term;\n- -'send-or-pay' model: contract where the price, volume and term are defined. The customer has a commitment to pay the amount indicated in the contract irrespective of actual traffic consumed over the commitment period. This contract category notably includes certain MVNO (mobile virtual network operator), IDD (international direct dialing) or hubbing (call free floating) contracts. The relevant revenue is recognized progressively based on actual traffic during the period, to reflect transfer of control to the customer;\n- -mix model: hybrid contract combining the 'pay-as-you-go' and 'send-or-pay' models, comprising a fixed entry fee paid by the customer providing access to preferential pricing conditions for a given volume ('send-or-pay' component). In addition to this entry fee, an amount is invoiced based on traffic consumption ('pay-as-you-go' component). The amount invoiced for the entry fee included in this type of commercial agreement is recognized progressively in revenue based on actual traffic over the period.\n\nCurrent agreements between major transit carriers are not invoiced or cross-invoiced ('free peering') and are therefore not recognized in revenue.\n\n## -Quality of service commitment clause\n\nThe contracts entered into by the Group and its customers include service level commitments regarding the processing of orders, delivery and after-sales support (delivery time, performance, recovery time). If the Group fails to comply with one of these commitments, it then compensates the customer, usually in the form of a price reduction. The projected amount of these penalties is recognized as a deduction from revenue whenever it is expected that the commitment will not be fulfilled.\n\n## -Public-private service concession arrangements\n\nThe Group rolls out and/or operates certain networks under service concessions, such as the Public Initiative Networks implemented in France to roll out fiber optic networks in less populated areas. Some contracts are analyzed in accordance with IFRIC 12 'Service Concession Arrangements.' When the Group builds a network, construction revenue is recognized in consideration of a right to receive compensation from either a public entity or users of the public service. This right is accounted for as:\n\n- -an intangible asset for the right to receive payments from public service users amounting to the fair value of the corresponding infrastructure and is amortized over the term of the contract; and/or\n- -a financial receivable for the unconditional right to receive royalties from the public entity, for the fair value of the consideration expected from the public entity. This receivable is recognized at amortized cost.\n\n## -Lease  agreements\n\nOrange's lease revenue is related either to its regulatory obligations to lease technical sites to its competitors, to the supply of equipment in certain contracts with B2B customers, or to the granting of rights of use meeting the criteria for leasing network equipment, i.e. occasional leases of surplus space in certain buildings to third parties.\n\nLease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term, except for certain equipment leases to B2B customers, which are classified as finance leases; in such cases the equipment is considered sold on credit.",

Those trade receivables which include deferred payment terms over 12 or 24 months for customers buying a mobile phone are discounted and classified as current items in the statement of financial position. Receivables from B2B equipment finance leases are recognized as current operating receivables because they are acquired in the normal course of business.\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of IFRS 9, the impairment of trade receivables is based on three methods:\n\n- -a collective statistical method: this is based on historical losses and leads to a separate impairment rate for each aging balance category. This analysis is performed over a homogeneous group of receivables with similar credit characteristics because they belong to a customer category (B2C, professionals);\n- -a stand-alone method: the assessment of impairment probability and its amount are based on a set of relevant qualitative factors (aging of late payment, other balances with the counterparty, rating from independent agencies, geographical area). This method is mainly used for carrier customers (national and international), administrations and public authorities, as well as for businesses services key accounts;\n- -a provisioning method based on expected loss: IFRS 9 requires recognition of expected losses on receivables immediately upon recognition of the financial instruments. In addition to the pre-existing provisioning system, the Group applies a simplified approach of early impairment at the time the asset is recognized. The rate applied depends on the maximum revenue non-recoverability rate.\n\nRecognition of impairment losses for a group of receivables is the step preceding identification of impairment losses on individual receivables. As soon as information is available (customers in bankruptcy or subject to court-ordered liquidation), these receivables are then excluded from the statistical impairment database and individually impaired.\n\nThe trade receivables may be part of non-recourse programs. When they are assigned to consolidated securitization mutual funds, they remain on the statement of financial position. Other disposals to financial institutions may lead to their de-recognition in the event that legal ownership and almost all the risks and benefits of the receivables are transferred as described by IFRS 9.",

This is the case in a bundled offer combining the sale of a mobile phone and mobile telecommunication services for a fixed period, where the mobile phone is invoiced at a reduced price leading to the reallocation of a portion of amounts invoiced for the telecommunication service to the supply of the mobile phone. The excess amount allocated to the mobile phone over the price invoiced is recognized as a contract asset and transferred to trade receivables as the service is invoiced.\n\nContract assets, like trade receivables, are subject to impairment for credit risk. The recoverability of contract assets is also verified, including to cover the risk of impairment loss should the contract be interrupted. Recoverability may also be impacted by a change in the legal environment governing offers.\n\nContract liabilities represent amounts paid by customers to Orange before receiving the goods and/or services promised in the contract. This is typically the case for advances received from customers or amounts invoiced and received for goods or services not yet provided, for example for subscriptions payable in advance or prepaid contracts (previously recognized in deferred income).\n\nCustomer contract assets and liabilities are presented, respectively, in current assets and current liabilities since they are a normal part of the Group's operations.\n\n## Costs of obtaining a contract\n\nWhere a telecommunication service contract is signed via a third-party distributor, this distributor may receive business provider remuneration, generally paid in the form of a commission for each subscription or invoice-indexed commission. Where the Group considers that these commissions are incremental and would not have been paid in the absence of the customer contract, the commission cost is estimated and capitalized in the balance sheet. It should be noted that the Group has adopted the simplification measure authorized by IFRS 15 to recognize the costs of obtaining a contract as an expense at the time they are incurred, if the amortization period of the asset that the Group would recognize for them does not exceed one year.\n\nThe costs of obtaining fixed-period mobile services contracts are capitalized and expensed on a pro rata basis over the enforceable period of the contract, as these costs are generally incurred each time a customer renews the fixed period. The costs of obtaining fixed services contracts for a pre-determined term for B2C market customers are expensed on a pro rata basis over the estimated period of the customer relationship. The costs of obtaining B2B and operator solution contracts are not material.\n\n## Costs to fulfill a contract\n\nCosts to fulfill a contract consist of all the initial contractual costs necessary to fulfill one or more performance obligations of a contract. These costs, when they are directly related to a contract, are capitalized and expensed on a pro rata basis over the enforceable period of the contract.\n\nAt Group level, these costs mainly concern contracts for B2B customers, with, for example, design, installation, connection and migration costs that relate to a future performance obligation of the contract.\n\nThe assumptions underlying the period over which the costs of fulfilling a contract are expensed are periodically reviewed and adjusted in line with observations; termination of the contractual relationship with the customer results in the immediate expensing of the remaining deferred costs. Where the carrying value of deferred costs exceeds the remaining consideration expected to be received for the transfer of the related goods and services, less expected costs relating directly to the transfer of these goods and services yet to be incurred, the excess amount is similarly immediately expensed.",

We have elected to apply certain available practical expedients when disclosing unfulfilled performance obligations, including the option to exclude expected revenues from unsatisfied obligations of contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. These contracts are primarily monthly service contracts.\n\nIn addition, certain contracts offer customers the ability to purchase additional services. These additional services are not included in the transaction price and are recognized when the customer exercises the option (generally on a monthly basis). They are not therefore included in unfulfilled performance obligations.\n\nSome multi-year service contracts with B2B and operator customers include fixed monthly costs and variable user fees. These variable user fees are excluded from the table of unfulfilled performance obligations.\n\n## 4.5 Other  assets\n\n| (in millions of euros)                              | December 31,  2023   | December 31,  2022   | December 31,  2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Orange Money - restriction of electronic money  (1) | 1,430                | 1,242                | 1,030                |\n| Submarine cable consortiums  (1)                    | 272                  | 230                  | 194                  |\n| Advances and downpayments                           | 191                  | 177                  | 147                  |\n| Security deposits paid                              | 108                  | 96                   | 105                  |\n| Other                                               | 578                  | 688                  | 654                  |\n| Total                                               | 2,579                | 2,433                | 2,130                |\n\n- (1) These receivables are offset by the liabilities of the same amount (see accounting policies below and Note 5.7).\n\n| (in millions of euros)                | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Other assets - in the opening balance | 2,433  | 2,130  | 1,837  |\n| Business related variations  (1)      | 174    | 304    | 236    |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation | 11     | 5      | 24     |\n| Translation adjustment                | (10)   | (17)   | 28     |\n| Reclassifications and other items     | (29)   | 11     | 5      |\n| Other assets - in the closing balance | 2,579  | 2,433  | 2,130  |\n| o/w other non-current assets          | 192    | 216    | 254    |\n| o/w other current assets              | 2,388  | 2,217  | 1,875  |\n\n- (1) Including the restriction of electronic money related to Orange Money for 199 million euros.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

These receivables are offset by the liabilities of the same amount (see Note 5.7).\n\nOrange Money is a money transfer, payment and financial services solution provided via an electronic money ('e-money') account linked to an Orange mobile number.\n\nSince 2016, the Orange group has become an Electronic Money Issuer ('EMI') in some of the countries in which it operates, via dedicated, approved, internal subsidiaries. Regulations state that EMIs, as last-resort guarantors for the reimbursement of e-money holders, are obliged to restrict the funds collected in exchange for the issue of e-money (obligation to protect holders). The e-money distribution model relies on Orange's subsidiaries and third-party distributors. EMIs issue e-money (or units of value 'UV') at the request of these distributors in exchange for funds collected therefrom. The distributors then transfer the e-money to end holders.\n\nWithin the Orange group, this restriction includes the protection of third-party holders (distributors and customers).\n\nThese transactions have no impact on the Group's net financial debt and are listed under the following headings:\n\n- -assets restricted to an amount equal to the e-money in circulation outside of the Orange group (or UV in circulation);\n- -UV in circulation under liabilities, representing the obligation to reimburse the third-party holders (customers and third-party distributors).\n\nThese two headings are presented under 'other assets' and 'other liabilities' and under operating activities as 'change in working capital requirement'.\n\n## Note 5 Purchases and other expenses\n\n## 5.1 External  purchases\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                        | 2023     | 2022     | 2021     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Commercial, equipment expenses and content rights             | (8,163)  | (7,772)  | (7,385)  |\n| o/w costs of terminals and other equipment sold               | (4,830)  | (4,459)  | (4,234)  |\n| o/w advertising, promotional, sponsoring and rebranding costs | (784)    | (804)    | (783)    |\n| Service fees and inter-operator costs                         | (3,972)  | (4,251)  | (4,349)  |\n| o/w interconnexion costs                                      | (2,359)  | (2,703)  | (2,956)  |\n| Other network expenses, IT expenses                           | (3,928)  | (3,590)  | (3,530)  |\n| Other external purchases                                      | (3,259)  | (3,119)  | (2,709)  |\n| o/w building cost for resale                                  | (1,170)  | (1,236)  | (1,047)  |\n| o/w overhead                                                  | (1,292)  | (1,172)  | (1,044)  |\n| o/w rental expenses                                           | (111)    | (134)    | (147)    |\n| Total external purchases  (1)                                 | (19,322) | (18,732) | (17,973) |\n\n- (1) Energy purchases, mainly comprising electricity, represent (1,017) million euros in 2023, (798) million euros in 2022 and (579) million euros in 2021.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nFirm purchase commitments are disclosed as unrecognized contractual commitments (see Note 16).\n\nAdvertising, promotion, sponsoring, communication and brand development costs are recorded as expenses during the period in which they are incurred.\n\nSince the application of IFRS 16, on January 1, 2019, lease expenses have included rental payments on leases with an enforceable period, with no option to extend, of 12 months or less, leases where the value, when new, of the underlying asset is less than approximately 5,000 euros, and variable lease payments which were not included in the measurement of the lease liability (see Note 9).",

The amount of provision recorded is based on a case-by-case assessment of the risk level, and events arising during the course of legal proceedings may require a reassessment of this risk at any time. Where appropriate, litigation cases may be analyzed as contingent liabilities, which correspond to:\n\n- -probable obligations arising from past events that are not recognized because their existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Company's control; or\n- -present obligations arising from past events that are not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\n## Acquisition and integration costs\n\nAcquisition and integration costs are incurred at the time of acquisition of legal entities (costs linked to the acquisition of the entity, consultancy fees, training costs for new employees, migration costs associated with customer offers, labor expenses associated with the transition). They are incurred over a maximum period of 12 months following the acquisition date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

This plan carries a strong ambition to transform and  simplify  Orange  Business,  whose  market  is  undergoing profound changes. The plan includes the discontinuation of the commercialization of around 150 products and services and the elimination of around 650 jobs in France, on a voluntary basis. As a result, restructuring costs (including provisions corresponding to the best estimate to date of the costs of the plan) were recognized at December 31, 2023, for 176 million euros.\n\n## End of Orange Bank activities\n\nOn June 28, 2023, the Orange group announced its intention to withdraw from retail banking in France and Spain, as well as the launch of discussions with BNP Paribas with a view to providing Orange  Bank  customers  with  a  dedicated  offering,  customer journey and support. Since then, Orange Bank has embarked on negotiations with employee representatives to initiate a departure plan (around 600 jobs in France). At December 31, 2023, this plan is still being negotiated. A restructuring provision totalling 122 million euros was recognized at December 31, 2023, corresponding to the best estimate to date of the costs of the plan.\n\nSome restructuring costs are directly recorded in operating income and are not included in the following movements of provisions:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                            | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Restructuring provisions - in the opening balance | 162    | 185    | 117    |\n| Additions with impact on income statement  (1)    | 393    | 98     | 277    |\n| Reversals with impact on income statement         | (26)   | (26)   | (17)   |\n| Discounting with impact on income statement       | (1)    | (5)    | (1)    |\n| Utilizations without impact on income statement   | (54)   | (90)   | (191)  |\n| Changes in consolidation scope                    | 0      | -      | -      |\n| Translation adjustment                            | 1      | (1)    | (0)    |\n| Reclassifications and other items                 | 0      | 0      | (1)    |\n| Restructuring provisions - in the closing balance | 477    | 162    | 185    |\n| o/w non-current provisions                        | 196    | 43     | 61     |\n| o/w current provisions                            | 281    | 119    | 124    |",

They include payables that the supplier may have assigned, with or without notification, to financial institutions as part of direct or reverse factoring, and those for which the supplier proposed an extended payment period to Orange and for which Orange confirmed the payment arrangement under the agreed terms. Orange considers these financial liabilities to have the characteristics of trade payables, in particular due to the ongoing commercial relationship, the payment schedules ultimately consistent with the operating cycle of a telecommunication operator, in particular for the purchase of primary infrastructure, the supplier's autonomy in the anticipated relationship and a financial cost borne by Orange that corresponds to the compensation of the supplier for the extended payment schedule agreed.\n\nTrade payables without specified interest rates are measured at par value if the interest component is negligible. Interest-bearing trade payables are recognized at amortized cost.",

These agreements provided for the extension of the measures in the event of pension reform for the employees concerned;\n- -a provision reversal of 22 million euros was recognized on capital-based or annuity-based defined-benefit plans.\n\n## 6.2.2 Types of post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits\n\nIn accordance with the laws and practices in force in the countries where it operates, the Group has obligations in terms of employee benefits:\n\n- -with regard to retirement, the majority of employees are covered by defined  contribution  plans required  by  law  or  under national agreements. In France, civil servants employed by Orange SA are covered by the French government sponsored civil and military pension plan. Orange SA's obligation under the plan is limited to the payment of annual contributions (French law no. 96-660 dated July 26, 1996). Consequently, Orange SA has no obligation to fund future deficits of the pension plans covering its own civil servant employees or any other civil service plans. Expenses recognized under the terms of defined contribution pension plans amounted to (667) million euros in 2023 (compared with (691) million euros in 2022 and (727) million euros in 2021);\n- -the Group is committed to a limited number of annuity-based defined-benefit plans : notably the Equant plans in the United Kingdom for 215 million euros in 2023 and a plan for senior managers in France for 187 million euros in 2023. Plan assets\n\n- were transferred to these plans in the United Kingdom and in France. A few years ago, these plans were closed to new subscribers and also closed in the United Kingdom with regard to vesting;\n- -the Group is also committed to capital-based defined-benefit plans where,  in  accordance  with  the  law  or  contractual agreements, employees are entitled to bonuses on retirement, depending on their years of service and end of career salary; this essentially relates to bonuses due upon retirement in France, particularly for employees under private-law contracts (643 million euros for Orange SA, i.e. 79% of the capital-based plans)  and  for  civil  servants  (13 million  euros,  i.e. 2%  of capital-based plans);\n- -other post-employment benefits are also granted to retired employees: these are benefits other than defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans;\n- -other  long-term  benefits may  also  be  granted  such  as seniority  awards,  long-term  compensated  absences  and French part-time for seniors plans (Temps Partiel Senior (TPS)) detailed below.\n\n## French part-time for seniors plans\n\nThe French part-time for seniors plans (TPS) are accessible to civil servants and employees under private contract with French entities who are eligible for full retirement benefits from January 1, 2028 (before the application of the 2023 pension reform) and who have at least 15 years of service at the Group.\n\nThese plans give employees the opportunity to work 50% or 60% of a full-time job whilst receiving:\n\n- -base compensation of between 65% and 80% of a full-time job;\n- -the retirement entitlement benefits of full-time employment during the period in question (both the Company's and the employee's contributions);\n- -and a minimum compensation level.",

The CET allows for a reduction in the amount of time worked.\n\nAs part of the intergenerational agreement renegotiations, a French part-time for seniors (TPS) plan was signed on December 17, 2021, resulting in the recognition of an employee benefit liability of 1,225 million euros at December 31, 2021.\n\nAt  December 31,  2023,  the  number  of  employees  who  are participating in the French part-time for seniors plans (TPS), and thus included in the provision, is approximately 9,150 employees.\n\n## 6.2.3 Key assumptions used to calculate obligations\n\nThe assessment of post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits is based on retirement age calculated in accordance with the provisions applicable to each plan and the necessary conditions to ensure entitlement to a full pension, both of which are often subject to legislative changes.\n\nThe valuation of the obligation of the French part-time for seniors plans (TPS) had been sensitive to estimates of the potentially eligible population and to the sign-up rate for the plans (estimated at 70% on average), and the trade-offs that the beneficiaries ultimately made between the different plans proposed. At December 31, 2023, with sign-ups to the 2018 and 2021 French part-time for seniors plans (TPS) no longer possible, the sensitivity to the sign-up rate was not presented.\n\nThe discount rates used for the French entities (which accounts for 95% of Orange's pension and other long-term employee benefit obligations at December 31, 2023) are as follows:\n\n|                    | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| More than 10 years | 3.25% to 4.20%      | 3.75% to 3.85%      | 0.80% to 1.05%      |\n| Less than 10 years | 3.20% to 4.15%  (1) | 3.20% to 3.75%      | - 0.15% to 0.40%    |\n\nThe discount rates used for the euro zone are based on corporate bonds rated AA with a duration equivalent to the duration of the obligations.\n\nThe increase in annuities of the Equant plans in the United Kingdom is based on inflation (3% used) up to 5%.\n\n(in millions of euros)\n\nDiscount rates (1)\n\n75\n\nThe main capital-based defined-benefit plan (retirement bonuses for employees under private-law contracts in France) is principally sensitive  to  employment  policy  assumptions  (Orange  has historically had high numbers of employees of retirement age), salary revaluation and long-term inflation of 2%.\n\nThe impacts on pension benefit obligations of a change in the key assumption would be as follows:\n\nRate increase by 50 points\n\nRate decrease by 50 points\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Including (16) and 16 million euros for the French part-time for seniors plans (TPS) (short-term duration).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

It is calculated on the basis of external indices commonly used as a reference for the eurozone,\n- -actuarial gains and losses on post-employment benefits are fully recorded in other comprehensive income,\n- -the Group's defined-benefit plans are not generally funded. In the rare cases where they are, the plan assets are set up by employer and employee contributions which are managed by separate legal entities whose investments are subject to fluctuations in the financial markets. These entities are generally administered by joint committees comprising representatives of the Group and of the beneficiaries. Each committee adopts its own investment strategy which is designed to strike the optimum strategies to match assets and liabilities, based on specific studies performed by external experts. It is generally carried out by fund managers selected by the committees and depends on market opportunities. Assets are measured at fair value, determined by reference to quoted prices, since they are mostly invested in listed securities (mainly equities and bonds) and the use of other asset classes is limited.\n\nOther long-term employee benefits may be granted, such as seniority awards, long-term compensated absences and the French part-time for seniors plan (TPS) agreements. The calculation of the related commitments is based on actuarial assumptions (including demographic, financial and discounting assumptions) similar to those relating to post-employment benefits. The relevant actuarial gains and losses are recognized in net income for the period when they arise.\n\nTermination benefits are subject to provisions (up to the related obligation). For all commitments entailing the payment of termination benefits, actuarial gains and losses are recognized in net income for the period when modifications take place.\n\n## 6.3 Share-based  compensation\n\n## Free share award plans in force at December 31, 2023\n\nThe Board of Directors approved the implementation of free share award plans (Long-Term Incentive Plans - LTIP) reserved for the Executive Committee, Corporate Officers and senior executives designated as 'Executives' or 'Leaders.'\n\n## Main characteristics\n\n| Implementation date by the Board of Directors       | July 25, 2023 LTIP 2023-2025   | July 27, 2022 LTIP 2022-2024   | July 28, 2021 LTIP 2021-2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Maximum number of free share units  (1)             | 1.9 million                    | 1.8 million                    | 1.8 million                    |\n| Estimated number of beneficiaries                   | 1,200                          | 1,300                          | 1,300                          |\n| Acquisition date of the rights by the beneficiaries | March 31, 2026                 | December 31, 2024              | December 31, 2023              |\n| Delivery date of the shares to the beneficiaries    | March 31, 2026                 | March 31, 2025                 | March 31, 2024                 |\n\n- (1) In countries where the regulations, tax codes or labor laws do not permit awards of stock, the beneficiaries of the plan will receive a cash value based on the market price of Orange stock at the delivery date of the shares.\n\n## Continued employment condition\n\nThe allocation of rights to beneficiaries is subject to a continued employment condition:\n\n|                                           | LTIP 2023-2025                       | LTIP 2022-2024                          | LTIP 2021-2023                          |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Assessment of the employment continuation | From July 25, 2023 to March 31, 2026 | From July 27, 2022 to December 31, 2024 | From July 28, 2021 to December 31, 2023 |\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nDepending on the plans, the allocation of rights to beneficiaries is subject to the achievement of internal and external performance conditions, i.e.:\n\n- -the  organic  cash  flow  from  telecom  activities  internal performance condition, as defined in the plan regulations, assessed at the end of the three years of the plan against the objective set by the Board of Directors for the LTIP 2021-2023, 2022-2024 and 2023-2025;\n\n- -the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) internal performance condition, two-thirds of which comprises the reduction of CO 2 emissions and one-third the proportion of women in the Group's management networks for the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 2023-2025.

The aggregated share of these subsidiaries, which publish their own regulated information, is less than or equal to\n\n20% of consolidated revenues, operating income and net income excluding non-recurring transactions.\n\n## 7.4 Sensitivity of recoverable amounts\n\nBecause of the correlation between operating cash flows and investment capacity, a sensitivity of net cash flows is used. As cash flows at the terminal point represent a significant portion of the recoverable amount, a change of plus or minus 10% in these cash flows is presented as a sensitivity assumption.\n\nThe cash flows are those generated by operating activities net of acquisitions and disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (including a tax expense at a standard rate, repayment of lease liabilities and debt related to financed assets, related interest expenses and excluding other interest expenses). An additional analysis was carried out on the most sensitive CGUs for which the amount of lease liabilities was material in order to confirm the absence of impairment losses or additional impairment losses.\n\nA sensitivity analysis was carried out on the main consolidated activities or the activities most sensitive to the assumptions of the impairment tests and is presented below to enable readers of the financial statements to estimate the effects of their own estimates. Changes in cash flows, perpetual growth rates or discount rates exceeding the sensitivity levels presented have been observed in the past.",

governance. The revised assumptions resulted in the identification of a negative margin, however, the impairment of fixed assets of (42) million euros recognized over the period (see Note 8.3), represents all the assets eligible for impairment under IAS 36 at December 31, 2023. Sensitivity analyses are therefore not relevant.\n\n## Romania\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the fair value of Romania is defined on the basis of the expected merger of Orange Romania Communications (formerly  Telekom  Romania  Communications)  into  Orange Romania, with the Romanian state acquiring a stake in Orange Romania (see Note 3.2). Sensitivity analyses, calculated on cash flows and financial parameters, are therefore not relevant for this CGU at December 31, 2023.\n\n## Jordan\n\nAt December 31, 2023, a sensitivity analysis was carried out on each of the following criteria, taken individually:\n\n- -1% increase in the discount rate;\n- -1% decrease in the perpetual growth rate;\n- -10% decrease in terminal-year cash flows.\n\nThis sensitivity analysis identified an estimated impairment risk of up to 11% of the net value of goodwill.\n\nOther entities not shown above individually represent less than 4% of the recoverable amount of the consolidated entities, or do not present a recoverable amount close to the net value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

It is tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when there is an indication that it may be impaired. Thus, changes in general economic and financial trends, the different levels of resilience of the telecommunication operators with respect to the deterioration of local economic environments, changes in the market capitalization of telecommunication operators, as well as financial performance compared to market expectations represent external impairment indicators that are analyzed by the Group, together with internal performance indicators, in order to assess whether an impairment test should be performed more than once a year.\n\nThese tests are performed at the level of each Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) (or group of CGUs). These generally correspond to business segments or to each country in the Africa and Middle East region and Europe. This is reviewed if the Group changes the level at which it monitors return on investment for goodwill testing purposes.\n\nTo determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized, the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the CGUs or groups of CGUs is compared to their recoverable amount, for which Orange uses mostly the value in use.\n\nValue in use is estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on economic and regulatory assumptions, license renewal assumptions and sales activity and investment forecasts drawn up by the Group's management, as follows:\n\n- -cash flow projections are based on three-to-five-year business plans and include a tax cash flow calculated as EBIT (operating income) multiplied by the statutory tax rate (excluding the impact of deferred tax and unrecognized tax loss carryforwards at the date of valuation). In the case of recent acquisitions, longer-term business plans may be used;\n- -post-tax cash flow projections beyond that timeframe may be extrapolated by applying a declining or flat growth rate for the next year, and then a perpetual growth rate reflecting the expected long-term growth in the market;\n- -post-tax cash flows are subject to a post-tax discount rate, using rates which incorporate a relevant premium reflecting a risk assessment for the implementation of certain business plans or country risks. The value in use derived from these calculations is identical to the one that would result from discounting pre-tax cash flows at pre-tax discount rates.\n\nThe key operating assumptions used to determine values in use are common across all of the Group's business segments. Key assumptions for most CGUs include:\n\n- -key revenue assumptions, which reflect market level, penetration rate of the offers and market share, positioning of the competition's offers and their potential impact on market price levels and their transposition to the Group's offer bases, regulatory authority decisions on pricing of services to customers and on access and pricing of inter-operator services, technology migration of networks (e.g. extinction of copper local loops), decisions of competition authorities in terms of concentration or regulation of adjacent sectors such as cable;\n- -key cost assumptions, on the level of marketing expenses required to deal with the pace of product line renewals and the positioning of the competition, the ability to adjust costs to potential changes in revenues or the effects of natural attrition and employee departure plans underway;\n- -key assumptions on the level of capital expenditure, which may be affected by the rollout of new technologies, by decisions of regulatory authorities relating to licenses and spectrum allocation, deployment of fiber networks, mobile network coverage, sharing of network elements or obligations to open up networks to competitors.\n\nThe tested net carrying values include goodwill, land and assets with finite useful lives (property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and net working capital requirements including intra-group balances). The Orange brand, an asset with an indefinite useful life, is subject to a specific test, see Note 8.3.\n\nIf an entity partially owned by the Group includes goodwill attributable to non-controlling interests, the impairment loss is allocated between the shareholders of Orange SA and the non-controlling interests on the same basis as that on which profit or loss is allocated (i.e. ownership interest).\n\nImpairment loss for goodwill is recorded definitively in operating income.",

Its recoverable amount is assessed based on the expected contractual royalties discounted in perpetuity (and included in the business plan), less costs attributable to the brand's owner.\n\n## 8.4 Other intangible assets\n\n| (in millions of euros)      | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023              | December 31, 2023       | December 31, 2023   | December 31,  2022   | December 31,  2021   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                             | Gross value         | Accumulated  depreciation  and | Accumulated  impairment | Net book  value     | Net book  value      | Net book  value      |\n| Telecommunications licenses | 12,891              | (5,962)                        | (52)                    | 6,878               | 6,869                | 6,691                |\n| Software                    | 14,400              | (9,951)                        | (106)                   | 4,344               | 4,280                | 4,331                |\n| Orange brand                | 3,133               | -                              | -                       | 3,133               | 3,133                | 3,133                |\n| Other brands                | 1,106               | (145)                          | (897)                   | 65                  | 60                   | 69                   |\n| Customer bases              | 5,443               | (5,085)                        | (14)                    | 344                 | 246                  | 346                  |\n| Other intangible assets     | 2,089               | (1,553)                        | (201)                   | 335                 | 358                  | 370                  |\n| Total                       | 39,063              | (22,695)                       | (1,269)                 | 15,098              | 14,946               | 14,940               |\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                             | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Net book value of other intangible assets - in the opening balance | 14,946  | 14,940  | 15,135  |\n| Acquisitions of other intangible assets                            | 2,365   | 2,678   | 2,842   |\n| o/w telecommunications licenses  (1)                               | 721     | 1,060   | 926     |\n| Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation  (2)               | 208     | 35      | (888)   |\n| Disposals                                                          | (7)     | (5)     | (4)     |\n| Depreciation and amortization                                      | (2,332) | (2,418) | (2,363) |\n| Impairment                                                         | (48)    | (33)    | (40)    |\n| Translation adjustment                                             | (69)    | (245)   | 92      |\n| Reclassifications and other items  (3)                             | 35      | (7)     | 165     |\n| Net book value of other intangible assets - in the closing balance | 15,098  | 14,946  | 14,940  |\n\nIn 2021, included the acquisition of the 5G license in Spain for 611 million euros and the renewals in France of the 2G licenses for 207 million euros and the 3G licenses for 57 million euros.\n\n- In 2021, mainly included the effects of the loss of exclusive control on Orange Concessions (see Note 3.2).\n- (3) In 2021, mainly included incentive bonus fees on penetration rates and business continuity payable by the Public Initiative Networks to the local authorities for 195 million euros.\n\n## Internal costs capitalized as intangible assets\n\nInternal costs capitalized as intangible assets include to labor expenses and amount to 423 million euros in 2023, 418 million euros in 2022, and 399 million euros in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The associated payables  to  these  financed  assets  are  presented  in  financial liabilities and are included in the definition of the net financial debt (see Note 13.3)\n\n## Internal costs capitalized as property, plant and equipment\n\nInternal costs capitalized as property, plant and equipment mainly include labor expenses and amount to 365 million euros in 2023, 400 million euros in 2022, and 450 million euros in 2021.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is made up of tangible fixed assets and financed assets. It mainly comprises network facilities and equipment.\n\nThe gross value of property, plant and equipment is made up of its acquisition or production cost, which includes study and construction fees as well as enhancement costs that increase the capacity of equipment and facilities. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, except where they serve to increase the asset's productivity or extend its useful life.\n\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment also includes the estimated cost of dismantling and removing the fixed asset and restoring the site where it was located under the obligation incurred by the Group.\n\nThe roll-out of assets by stage, particularly network assets, in the Group's assessment, does not generally require a substantial period of preparation. As a result, the Group does not generally capitalize the interest expense incurred during the construction and acquisition phase for its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nIn France, the regulatory framework governing the fiber optic network roll-out (Fiber To The Home - FTTH) organizes the access by commercial operators to the last mile of networks rolled out by another operator on a co-funding basis (ab initio or a posteriori) or through a line access. The sharing of rights and obligations between the various operators co-financing the last mile of networks is classified as a joint operation in accordance with IFRS 11 'Partnerships': Orange only recognizes in its assets the portions (built or acquired) in networks that it has co-financed or built.\n\nThe Group has entered into network sharing arrangements with other mobile operators on a reciprocal basis, which may cover passive infrastructure sharing, active network and even spectrum equipment.",

The provision is assessed on the basis of the identified costs for the current fiscal year, extrapolated for future years using the best estimate that will allow the obligation to be settled. This estimate is reviewed annually and the provision is adjusted where necessary against the dismantling asset recognized and the underlying assets, if any. The provision is discounted at a rate set by geographical area corresponding to the average risk-free rate of a 15-year government bond.\n\nWhen the obligation is settled, the provision is reversed against the net carrying value of the dismantling asset and the net carrying value of the underlying assets if the dismantling asset is less than the financial provision reversal.\n\n## Note 9 Lease  agreements\n\nIn the course of its activities, the Group regularly enters into leases as a lessee. These leases are divided between the following asset categories:\n\n- -Land and buildings;\n- -Networks and devices;\n- -IT  equipment;\n- -other.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe mandatory IFRS 16 'Leases', has been applied within the Group since January 1, 2019.\n\nIFRS 16 defines a lease as a contract that conveys to the lessee the right to control the use of an identified asset. All leases are recognized in the balance sheet as an asset reflecting the right to use the leased assets and a corresponding liability reflecting the related lease obligations (see Notes 9.1 and 9.2). In the income statement, amortization of right-of-use assets (see Note 9.1) is presented separately from interest on lease liabilities. In the statement of cash flows, cash outflows relating to interest expenses impact cash flows provided by operating activities, while principal repayments on lease liabilities impact cash flows related to financing activities.\n\nFor the lessor, assets subject to leases must be presented in the balance sheet according to the nature of the asset and the associated lease revenues as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWhen the Group carries out a transaction categorized as sale and leaseback in accordance with IFRS 16, a right-of-use asset is recognized in proportion to the previous carrying value of the asset corresponding to the right-of-use asset retained to offset a lease liability. Gains (losses) on disposal of fixed assets are recognized in the income statement in proportion to the rights actually transferred to the buyer-lessor. The adjustment of the gains (losses) on disposal recognized in the income statement for the share on which the Group retains its user rights via the lease corresponds to the difference between the right-of-use asset and the lease liability recognized in the balance sheet.\n\nFinally, the Group applies the two exemptions provided for in IFRS 16, i.e. leases with a term of 12 months or less that are not automatically renewable and those where the replacement value of the underlying asset is less than approximately 5,000 euros. Leases covered by either of these two exemptions are presented in off-balance sheet commitments and an expense is recognized in 'external purchases' in the income statement.\n\nThe Group classifies as a lease a contract that confers to the lessee the right to control the use of an identified asset for a given period, including a service contract if it contains a lease component.\n\nThe Group has defined 4 major categories of leases:\n\n- -Land and buildings: these leases mainly concern commercial (point of sale) or service activity (offices and headquarters) leases, as well as leases of technical buildings not owned by the Group. Real-estate leases entered into in France generally have long terms (nine-year commercial leases with early termination options after three and six years, known as '3/6/9 leases') (see Note 9.2). However, depending on the geographical location of the leases, their legal term may vary and the Group may be required to adopt a specific enforceable period taking into account the local legal and economic environment;\n- -Networks and devices: the Group is required to lease a certain number of assets in connection with its mobile activities. This is notably the case for land for antenna installation, mobile sites leased from third-party operators and certain 'TowerCos' contracts (companies operating telecom masts). Leases are also entered into as part of fixed-line network activities. These leases mainly concern access to the local loop where the Orange group is a market challenger (full or partial unbundling), as well as the lease of land transmission cables;\n- -IT equipment: this asset category primarily comprises leases for servers and hosting space in Data centers;\n- -other: this asset category primarily comprises leases for vehicles and technical equipment.",

This lease liability is equal to the present value of fixed and in-substance fixed payments not paid at that date, plus any amounts that Orange is reasonably certain to pay at the end of the lease, such as the exercise price of a purchase option (where it is reasonably certain to be exercised), or penalties payable to the lessor for terminating the lease (where termination is reasonably certain).\n\nThe Group only takes the lease component of the contract into account when measuring the lease liability. For certain asset classes where leases include both service and lease components, the Group may recognize a single contract, classified as a lease (i.e. without distinguishing between the service and lease components).\n\nOrange systematically determines the lease term as the period during which leases cannot be terminated, plus periods covered by any extension options that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise and any termination options that the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise. In the case of '3/6/9' leases in France, the term adopted is assessed on a contract-by-contract basis.\n\nThe term is also defined taking into account any laws and practices specific to each jurisdiction or business sector regarding firm lease commitment terms granted by lessors. The Group nonetheless assesses the enforceable term, based on the circumstances of each lease, taking into account certain indicators such as the existence of significant penalties in the event of termination by the lessee. To determine the length of this enforceable period, the Group considers the economic importance of the leased asset and the assumptions made in its strategic plan.\n\nWhen non-removable leasehold improvements have been made to leased assets, the Group assesses, on a case-by-case basis, whether these improvements provide an economic benefit when determining the enforceable term of the lease.\n\nWhen a lease includes a purchase option, the Group considers the enforceable term to be equal to the useful life of the underlying asset where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the purchase option.\n\nFor each lease, the discount rate used is determined based on the yield on government bonds in the lessee country, taking into account the term and currency of the lease, plus the Group's credit spread.\n\nAfter the lease commencement date, the amount of the lease liability may be reassessed to reflect changes introduced by the following main cases:\n\n- -a change in term resulting from a contract amendment or a change in the assessment of the reasonable certainty that a renewal option will be exercised or a termination option will not be exercised;\n- -a change in the amount of lease payments, for example following the application of a new index or rate in the case of variable payments;\n- -a change in the assessment of whether a purchase option will be exercised;\n- -any other contractual change, for example a change to the scope of the lease or its underlying asset.",

This decline in the corporate tax rate resulted in a reduction in the current tax expense of 35 million euros in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, the current tax expense included a tax income resulting from the reassessment of an income tax charge booked in periods prior to those presented in the amount of 376 million euros.\n\n## Deferred tax expense\n\nDeferred taxes are recorded at the tax rate applicable at the time of their reversal, i.e. 25.83%.\n\nIn 2021, the deferred tax expense included a deferred tax income of 316 million euros related to the recognition of an employee benefit liability for the French part-time for seniors plans (Temps Partiel Seniors - TPS).\n\n## Spanish tax group\n\n## Current tax expense\n\nThe  corporate  tax  rate  applicable  is  25%  for  all  fiscal  years presented. The current income tax expense mainly represents the obligation to pay a minimum level of tax calculated on the basis of 75% of taxable income due to the 25% limit on the use of available tax loss carryforwards. This tax expense may then be reduced by the use of tax credits.\n\nA temporary measure was introduced in the Corporate Income Tax Law applicable in 2023 for the determination of the year tax base under the tax consolidation regime. This measure limits to 50% the allocation of the individual negative tax bases generated by the entities that compose the Group. The 50% not allocated may be used in the following ten years, in equal parts.\n\nIn 2023, as in 2021, the Spanish tax group is profitable. The use of tax credits explains the absence or the low current tax expense recognized for the fiscal years.\n\nIn 2022, the Spanish tax group was in deficit, which explained the absence of current tax expense recognized for the fiscal year.\n\n## Deferred tax expense\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, deferred tax incomes of respectively 53 million euros and 30 million euros were recognized, to reflect the favorable effect of the change in business projections for the recoverability of deferred tax assets.\n\nIn 2021, a deferred tax expense was recognized for (162) million euros, to reflect the negative impact of the unfavorable developments in business plans on the recoverable amount of deferred tax assets.\n\n## Africa & Middle East\n\nThe main contributors to the income tax expense are the entities of the Group operating in Guinea, Mali, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Senegal:\n\n- -in Guinea, the corporate tax rate is 35% and the current tax expense amounts to (110) million euros in 2023, (94) million euros in 2022 and (63) million euros in 2021;\n- -in Mali, the corporate tax rate is 30% and the current tax expense amounts to (75) million euros in 2023, (64) million euros in 2022 and (67) million euros in 2021;\n- -in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the corporate tax rate is 30% and the current tax expense amounts to (74) million euros in 2023, (86) million euros in 2022 and (91) million euros in 2021;\n- -in Senegal, the corporate tax rate is 30% and the current tax expense amounts to (58) million euros in 2023, (55) million euros in 2022 and (53) million euros in 2021.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\n## Current tax expense\n\nThe applicable corporate tax rate in the United Kingdom increased from 19% in 2022 to 25% from 2023. This increase in the corporate tax rate results in an increase in the current tax expense of (20) million euros in 2023.\n\nThe current tax expense primarily reflects the taxation of activities related to the Orange brand.\n\n## Deferred tax expense\n\nIn 2021, the corporate tax rate increase to 25% applicable from 2023 was passed (compared with 19% before). The deferred tax expense for the fiscal year therefore included an increase of (188) million euros in deferred tax liabilities recognized on the Orange brand.\n\n## Other subsidiaries\n\n## Deferred tax expense\n\nIn 2023, a deferred tax income of 190 million euros has been recognized for Belgian subsidiaries (other than the Orange Belgium group), to reflect the favorable effect of the change in business projections for the recoverability of deferred tax assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The deferred tax assets recognized for Spain amount to 0.5 billion euros at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe deferred tax assets recognized for Belgium amount to 0.3 billion euros at December 31, 2023.\n\nMost of the other tax loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets have been recognized will expire beyond 2028.\n\n## 10.3 Developments in tax disputes and audits\n\n## Developments in tax disputes and audits in France\n\n## Tax audits\n\nOrange SA was the subject of several tax audits for the years 2017-2018  and  2019-2020,  for  which  the  tax  adjustments notified to date total approximately 535 million euros (including default penalties and interest). These adjustments mainly relate to the calculation of VAT on digital offerings, tax on electronic communication services on these same digital offerings, research tax credit, tax on television services, a portion of brand royalties paid by Orange SA to the UK company Orange Brand Services Ltd for reasons similar to the adjustments notified during the previous audits, as well as the inclusion in the tax base of income from the sale of equipment in 2019 and 2020, and the reassessment of previous tax loss carryforwards used for fiscal years 2017 and 2018.\n\nAll of these adjustments are being challenged by Orange SA. In  accordance  with  its  accounting  policies,  the  Group  makes a best estimate of the risk of these adjustments based on the technical merits of the positions defended, for which the effects are non-material.\n\nOrange SA was subject to a tax audit covering fiscal years 2015 and 2016. A tax adjustment was issued in 2019 covering the calculation of brand royalties paid by Orange SA to the UK company Orange Brand Services Ltd and deducted from its taxable income. The administration questions the inclusion of revenue from the roaming contract with Free and revenue from the fixed PSTN\n\nbusiness.  This  adjustment  request  is  being  challenged  by Orange SA, which has requested the opening of out-of-court proceedings  and  arbitration  between  the  French  and  UK  tax authorities, which are still ongoing. The additional tax expense would effectively result in double taxation that would fail to comply with the provisions of the Franco-British tax agreement and the European arbitration agreement.\n\n## Tax disputes\n\nThere were no major developments in other tax disputes over the period.\n\n## Developments in tax disputes and audits in the rest of the Group\n\nIn the same way as other telecom operators, the Group regularly deals with disagreements concerning the taxation of its network in various countries.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of Congo, Orange was the subject of a tax audit for the years 2017-2019, for which the legal tax adjustments notified total approximately 146 million euros at December 31, 2023. These adjustments mainly relate to the recognition method for mobile prepaid revenue and the non-taxation of electronic money flows in third-party accounts to be transferred to end customers. All of these adjustments are being challenged by Orange RDC, which has appealed to the Finance Minister.\n\nThere were no major developments in other tax disputes and audits in the rest of the Group over the period.\n\n## 10.4 International tax reform - Pillar Two\n\nThe Group has launched a working group in order to identify consequences and organize processes that will enable it to comply with this tax reform.\n\nThe Group simulated the Transitional Safe Harbour tests of the OECD  based  on  CbCR  (also  known  as  Country-by-Country Reporting) and the Consolidated Financial Statements for 2020, 2021 and 2022. Over the three years tested, some 15 jurisdictions failed the tests, and this may vary from one fiscal year to the next. The main reasons identified were the use of tax loss carryforwards, non-taxed items that affect pre-tax profit such as capital gains on disposals and low corporate tax rates (below 15%) in some jurisdictions where the Group operates.\n\nGiven the current progress of the work done by the Group and the regulations of the countries in which the Group operates, the financial consequences are expected to be limited (see Note 2.3.4).",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nCurrent income tax and deferred tax are measured by the Group at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities of each country, based on its interpretation with regard to the application of tax legislation. The Group calculates the tax assets and liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position based on the technical merits of the positions it defends versus that of the tax authorities.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax basis, as well as for unused tax losses, using the liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when their recovery is considered probable.\n\nA deferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, interests in joint ventures and associates, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n- -the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference (e.g. the payment of dividends); and\n- -it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nAccordingly, for fully consolidated companies, a deferred tax liability is only recognized in the amount of the taxes payable on planned dividend distributions by the Group.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\nAt each period end, the Group reviews the recoverable amount of the deferred tax assets carried by certain tax entities with significant tax losses carryforwards. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is assessed in the light of the business plans used for impairment testing. This plan may be adjusted for any tax specificities.\n\nDeferred tax assets arising on these tax losses are not recognized under certain circumstances specific to each company/tax consolidation group concerned, and particularly where:\n\n- -entities cannot assess the probability of the tax loss carryforwards being set off against future taxable profits, due to the horizon for forecasts based on business plans used for impairment testing and uncertainties as to the economic environment;\n- -entities have not yet begun to use the tax loss carryforwards;\n- -entities do not expect to use the losses within the timeframe allowed by tax regulations;\n- -it is estimated that tax losses are uncertain to be used due to risks of differing interpretations with regard to the application of tax legislation.\n\n## Note 11   Interests in associates and joint ventures\n\n## 11.1 Change in interests in associates and joint ventures\n\nThe table below shows the value of the main interests in associates and joint ventures:\n\n| Company (in millions of euros)                           | Main activity                                                | Main   co-shareholder                                   | interest   | %  December 31,  2023   | 2022   | December 31,  December 31,  2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------|--------|------------------------------------|\n| Entities jointly controlled                              | Entities jointly controlled                                  | Entities jointly controlled                             |            |                         |        |                                    |\n| Orange  Concessions and  its subsidiaries                | Operation/maintenance related  to Public Initiative Networks | Consortium  HIN (50%)                                   | 50%        | 1,012                   | 1,057  | 1,049                              |\n| \u015a wiat\u0142ow\u00f3d  Inwestycje Sp.  z o.o.

On November 3, 2021, the Orange group sold 50% of the capital in Orange Concessions to the consortium HIN, comprising La Banque des Territoires (Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts), CNP Assurances\n\nand EDF resulting in the loss of Orange's exclusive control over this entity and its subsidiaries. The Orange Concessions group is jointly controlled with the consortium and is consolidated in the financial statements of the Orange group according to the equity method. The Group continues to have obligations under network construction, concession and operation contracts in proportion to its shareholding, i.e. 1,336 million euros at December 31, 2023.",

If an associate or joint venture incurs losses and the carrying value of the investment is reduced to zero, the Group ceases to recognize the additional share of losses since it has no commitment beyond its investment.\n\nAn impairment test is performed at least annually and whenever there is objective evidence of impairment loss, such as a decrease in the quoted price when the investee is listed, significant financial difficulty of the entity, observable data indicating a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, or information about significant changes having an adverse effect on the entity.\n\nAn impairment loss is recorded when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value, the recoverable amount being the higher of the value in use and the fair value less transaction costs. The unit of account is the whole investment. Any impairment loss is recognized in the 'share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures'.

Following the repurchase at the end of 2022 of the last subordinated notes denominated in pounds sterling (see Note 15.4), the Group is no longer exposed to the financial exchange risk resulting from these instruments.\n\nIncome and expenses on assets included in net financial debt mainly comprise interest on the Group's financial assets of 283 million euros in 2023, 48 million euros in 2022 and (3) million euros in 2021.\n\nOther net financial expenses are mainly composed of interests on lease liabilities for (258) million euros in 2023, (145) million euros in 2022 and (120) million euros in 2021 (see Note 9.2).\n\nFinally, other comprehensive income includes the revaluation of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (Note 13.7) and cash flow hedges (Note 13.8.2).\n\nOther gains and losses related to financial assets and liabilities are recognized in operating income (foreign exchange gains and losses on trade receivables, trade payables and the associated hedge derivatives) in the amount of (17) million euros in 2023, (31) million euros in 2022 and (19) million euros in 2021.\n\n| (in millions of euros)   | Finance costs, net                  | Finance costs, net                                                | Finance costs, net           | Finance costs, net                 | Finance costs, net             | Finance costs, net   | Other com- prehensive  income   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                          | Cost of gross  financial  debt  (1) | Gains  (losses)  on assets  contributing  to net finan- cial debt | Cost of net  financial  debt | Foreign  exchange  gains  (losses) | Other net  financial  expenses | Finance  costs, net  | Reserves                        |\n| 2023                     |                                     |                                                                   |                              |                                    |                                |                      |                                 |\n| Financial assets         | -

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability are deducted from the liability's carrying value. The costs are subsequently amortized over the life of the liability, using the effective interest rate method.\n\nSome financial liabilities at amortized cost, including borrowings, are subject to hedging. This mainly relates to the hedging of payables in foreign currencies against the exposure of their future cash flows to foreign exchange risk (cash flow hedging).\n\n## 13.4 TDIRA\n\nPerpetual bonds redeemable for shares (titres \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e remboursables  en  actions  or  TDIRAs)  with  a  par  value  of 14,100 euros are listed on Euronext Paris. Their issuance was described  in  a  prospectus  approved  by  the  Commission des Op\u00e9rations de Bourse (now the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers or AMF - French Financial Markets Authority) on February 24, 2003. At December 31, 2023, taking into account redemptions since their issuance, 44,880 TDIRAs remain outstanding with a total par value of 633 million euros.\n\nThese TDIRAs are redeemable for new Orange SA shares at any time at the holders' request or, under certain conditions as\n\ndescribed in the appropriate prospectus, at Orange SA's initiative based on a ratio of 622.844 shares to one TDIRA (i.e. a conversion price of 22.638 euros). The initial ratio of 300 shares to one TDIRA has been adjusted several times to protect bondholders' rights and may be further adjusted under the terms and conditions set out in the prospectus.\n\nSince January 1, 2010, the interest rate on the TDIRAs has been the three-month Euribor + 2.5%.\n\nTDIRAs are subject to split accounting with one part treated as equity and another part as a liability. For the securities outstanding at December 31, 2023, the 'equity' component before deferred tax stood at 152 million euros.\n\n| (in millions of euros)                 | December 31,  2023   | December 31,  2022   | December 31,  2021   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Number of securities                   | 44,880               | 44,880               | 44,880               |\n| Equity component before deferred taxes | 152                  | 152                  | 152                  |\n| Debt component                         | 643                  | 638                  | 636                  |\n| o/w accrued interests not yet due      | 10                   | 6                    | 3                    |\n| Paid interests                         | 36                   | 16                   | 13                   |\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nSome Group financial instruments include both a financial debt component and an equity component. This relates to perpetual bonds redeemable for shares (TDIRAs). On initial recognition, the debt component is measured at its market value, corresponding to the value of the contractually determined future cash flows discounted at the market rate applied at the date of issuance to comparable instruments providing substantially the same conditions, but without the option to convert to or redeem for shares. This debt component is subsequently recognized at amortized cost.\n\nThe equity component, originally calculated as the difference between the notional value of the instrument and the fair value of the debt component, remains the same throughout the life of the instrument.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

These assets are recognized at fair value at initial recognition and subsequently. All changes in fair value are recorded in net financial costs, net.\n\n- -Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified to profit or loss (FVOCI)\n\nEquity securities which are not consolidated or equity-accounted are, subject to exceptions, recognized as assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified to profit or loss. They are recognized at fair value at initial recognition and subsequently. Temporary changes in value and gains (losses) on disposals are recorded as other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n- -Financial assets at amortized cost (AC)\n\nThis category mainly includes miscellaneous loans and receivables. These instruments are recognized at fair value at initial recognition and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. If there is any objective evidence of impairment of these assets, the value of the asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. An impairment loss is recognized in the income statement when impairment tests demonstrate that the financial asset's carrying value is higher than its recoverable amount. For these financial assets, the provisioning system also covers expected losses according to IFRS 9.\n\n## 13.8 Derivatives\n\n## 13.8.1 Market value of derivatives\n\n| (in millions of euros)            |   December 31,  2023 | December 31,  2022   | December 31,  2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Hedging derivatives               |                  583 | 893                  | 484                  |\n| Cash flow hedge derivatives       |                  583 | 893                  | 484                  |\n| Derivatives held for trading  (1) |                   95 | 176                  | (79)                 |\n| Net derivatives  (2)              |                  678 | 1,069                | 405                  |\n\nThe risks hedged by these derivatives are described in Note 14.

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nDerivatives are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position and presented according to their maturity date, regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 (hedging instruments versus trading derivatives).\n\nDerivatives are classified as a separate line item in the statement of financial position.\n\nTrading derivatives are economic hedge derivatives not classified as hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in the value of these instruments are recognized directly in profit or loss.\n\nHedge accounting is applicable when:\n\n- -at the inception of the hedge, there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship;\n- -the effectiveness of the hedge is demonstrated at inception and it is expected to continue in subsequent periods: i.e. at inception and throughout its duration, the company expects changes in the fair value of the hedged item to be almost fully offset by changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument.\n\nThere are three types of hedging accounting:\n\n- -a fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (or an identified portion of the asset or liability) that are attributable to a particular interest rate and/or currency risk and which could affect profit or loss. The hedged portion of these items is remeasured at fair value in the statement of financial position. Changes in this fair value are recognized in the income statement and offset by symmetrical changes in the fair value of financial hedging instruments to the extent of the hedge effectiveness;\n- -a cash flow hedge is a hedge of exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to a particular interest rate and/or currency risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a transaction believed to be highly probable (such as a future purchase or sale) which could affect profit or loss. As the hedged item is not recognized in the statement of financial position, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in other comprehensive income. It is reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item (financial asset or liability) affects the profit or loss or in the initial cost of the hedged item when it relates to the hedge of a non-financial asset acquisition cost;\n- -a net investment hedge is a hedge of exposure to changes in value attributable to the foreign exchange risk of a net investment in a foreign operation, which could affect profit or loss on the disposal of the foreign operation. The effective portion of the net investment hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income. It is reclassified in profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.\n\nFor transactions qualified as fair value hedges and for economic hedges, the foreign exchange impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives is booked in operating income when the underlying hedged item is a commercial transaction and in finance costs, net when the underlying hedged item is a financial asset or liability.\n\nHedge accounting can be terminated when the hedged item is no longer recognized, i.e. when the Group revokes the designation of the hedging relationship or when the hedging instrument is terminated or exercised. The accounting consequences are as follows:\n\n- -fair value hedge: at the hedge accounting termination date, the adjustment of the fair value of the liability is amortized using an effective interest rate recalculated at this date. Should the item hedged disappear, the change in fair value is recognized in the income statement;\n- -cash flow hedge: amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item is no longer recognized. In all other cases, amounts are reclassified in profit or loss, on a straight-line basis, throughout the remaining life of the original hedging relationship.\n\nIn both cases, subsequent changes in the value of the hedging instrument are recorded in profit or loss.\n\nConcerning the effects of the foreign currency basis spread of cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges, the Group has chosen to designate these as hedging costs. This option enables recognition of these effects in other comprehensive income and amortization of the cost of the basis spread in profit or loss over the period of the hedge.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

        "page_content": "## Note 14   Information on market risk and fair value of /financial assets and liabilities (telecom activities)\n\nThe Group uses financial position or performance indicators that are not specifically defined by IFRS, such as EBITDAaL (see Note 1.10) and net financial debt (see Note 13.3).\n\nMarket risks are monitored by Orange's Treasury and Financing Committee,  which  reports  to  the  Executive  Committee.  The Committee is chaired by the Group's Executive Committee member in charge of Finance, Performance and Development and meets on a quarterly basis.\n\nIt sets the guidelines for managing the Group's debt, especially in  respect  of  its  interest  rate,  foreign  exchange,  liquidity  and counterparty risk exposure for the coming months, and reviews past management (transactions carried out, financial results).\n\nMacroeconomic events and their consequences on the financial market did not call into question the risk management policy relating to financial instruments. The Group continued to set up and manage hedging instruments in order to limit its exposure to operational and financial foreign exchange and interest rate risks, while maintaining a diversified financing policy.\n\n## 14.1 Interest rate risk management\n\n## Management of fixed-rate/variable-rate debt\n\nOrange group seeks to manage its fixed-rate/variable-rate exposure in euros in order to minimize interest costs by using firm and conditional interest rate derivatives such as swaps, futures, caps and floors.\n\nThe fixed-rate component of gross financial debt, excluding cash collateral received and agreements to buy back non-controlling interests, is estimated at 91% at December 31, 2023, 96% at December 31, 2022 and 94% at December 31, 2021.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of the Group's position to changes in interest rates\n\nThe sensitivity of the Group's financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is only analyzed for the components of net financial debt that are interest-bearing and therefore exposed to interest rate risk.\n\n## Sensitivity of financial expenses\n\nBased on a constant amount of debt and a constant management policy, a 1% rise in interest rates would increase the annual cost of gross financial debt by 14 million euros, while a decrease of 1% would lower it by 12 million euros.\n\n## Sensitivity of cash flow hedge reserves\n\nA 1% rise in euro interest rates would improve the market value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and increase the\n\nassociated cash flow hedge reserves by approximately 695 million euros. A 1% decrease in euro interest rates would reduce their market  value  and  decrease  the  cash  flow  hedge  reserve  by approximately 696 million euros.\n\n## 14.2 Foreign exchange risk management\n\n## Operational foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group's foreign operations are carried out by entities that operate in their own country and mainly in their own currency. Their operational exposure to foreign exchange risk is therefore limited to certain types of flows: purchases of equipment or network capacity, purchases of devices and equipment sold or leased to customers and purchases from or sales to international carriers.\n\nWhenever possible, the entities of the Orange group have put in place policies to hedge this exposure (see Note 13.8).\n\n## Financial foreign exchange risk\n\nFinancial foreign exchange risk mainly relates to:\n\n- -dividends paid to the parent company: in general, the Group's policy is to economically hedge this risk from the date of the relevant subsidiary's Shareholders' Meeting;\n- -financing of the subsidiaries: except in special cases, the subsidiaries are required to cover their funding needs in their functional currency;\n- -Group financing: most of the Group's bonds, after derivatives, are denominated in euros. From time to time, Orange SA issues bonds in markets other than euro markets (primarily the US dollar, pound sterling and Swiss franc). If Orange SA does not have assets in these currencies, in most cases, the issues are translated into euros through cross currency swaps. The debt allocation by currency also depends on the level of interest rates and particularly on the interest rate differential relative to the euro.\n\nFollowing the repurchase at the end of 2022 of the last subordinated notes denominated in pounds sterling (see Note 15.4), the Group is no longer exposed to the financial exchange risk resulting from these instruments.\n\nThe table below shows the main exposures to foreign exchange fluctuations  of  the  net  financial  debt  in  foreign  currencies  of Orange SA, Orange Polska and Orange Egypt, and also shows the sensitivity of the entity to a 10% change in the foreign exchange rates of the currencies to which it is exposed. Orange SA and Orange Egypt are the entities bearing the main foreign exchange risk, including internal transactions that generate a net foreign exchange gain or loss in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n| (in millions of currency units)   | Exposure in currency units   | Exposure in currency units   | Exposure in currency units   | Exposure in currency units   | Exposure in currency units   | Exposure in currency units   | Sensitivity analysis   | Sensitivity analysis   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                   | EUR                          | USD                          | GBP                          | PLN                          | CHF                          | Total  translated            | 10% gain  in euro      | 10% loss  in euro      |\n| Orange SA                         | -                            | 8                            | 0                            | (1)                          | (13)                         | (7)                          | 1                      | (1)                    |\n| Orange Polska                     | (116)                        | (6)                          | -                            | -                            | -                            | (121)                        | 11                     | (13)                   |\n| Orange Egypt                      | -                            | (83)                         | -                            | -                            | -                            | (75)                         | 7                      | (8)                    |\n| Total (currencies)                | (116)                        | (80)                         | 0                            | (1)                          | (13)                         | (202)                        |                        |                        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

of funding:\n\n- -regular issues in the bond markets;\n- -occasional  financing  through  loans  from  multilateral  or development lending institutions;\n- -issues in the short-term securities markets under the NEU Commercial Paper program (Negotiable European Commercial Paper, formerly called 'commercial paper').\n\n## Liquidity of investments\n\nOrange invests its cash surpluses in cash equivalents that meet IAS 7 cash equivalent criteria or at fair value investments (negotiable debt securities, bonds with a maturity of no more than two years, UCITS and term deposits). These investments prioritize minimizing the risk of capital loss over performance.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and fair value investments are held mainly in France and other European Union countries, which are not subject to restrictions on convertibility or exchange controls.\n\n## Smoothing debt maturities\n\nThe policy followed by Orange is to apportion debt maturities evenly over the years to come.\n\nThe following table shows undiscounted future cash flows for each financial liability shown on the statement of financial position. The key assumptions used in this schedule are:\n\n- -amounts in foreign currencies are translated into euros at the year-end closing rate;\n- -future variable-rate interest is based on the last fixed coupon, unless a better estimate is available;\n- -TDIRAs  being  necessarily  redeemable  in  new  shares, no redemption is taken into account in the maturity analysis. In addition, as the interest payable on the bonds is due over an undetermined period (see Note 13.4), only interest payable for the first period is included (including interest payments for other periods would not provide relevant information);\n- -the  maturities  of  revolving  credit  lines  are  the  contractual maturity dates;\n- -'Other items' (undated and non-cash items) reconcile, for financial liabilities not accounted for at fair value, the future cash flows and the balance in the statement of financial position.",

This aggregate, not defined by IFRS, may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other groups.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the liquidity position of Orange's telecom activities  amounts  to  14,302 million  euros  and  exceeds  the repayment obligations of its gross financial debt in 2024. It breaks down as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Orange group's telecom activities has access to credit facilities in the form of bilateral credit lines and syndicated credit lines. Most of these lines bear interest at variable rates. The available undrawn amount of the credit facilities is 6,120 million euros (including 6,000 million euros for Orange SA).\n\nCash  equivalents  amounted  to  2,444 million  euros,  mainly  at Orange SA, comprising 1,979 million euros of UCITS and 100 million euros of term deposits.\n\nInvestments at fair value amounted to 2,678 million euros, exclusively at Orange SA, comprising 2,485 million euros of NEU Commercial Paper and 166 million euros of bonds.\n\nAny specific contingent commitments in terms of financial ratios are presented in Note 14.4.\n\nDue to its cash level and other immediately disposable investments, the Group is not dependent on the sale of receivables organized in certain countries (see Note 4.3).\n\n## Change in Orange's credit rating\n\nOrange's credit rating is an additional overall performance indicator used to assess the Group's financial policy and risk management policy and, in particular, its solvency and liquidity risk. It is not a substitute for an analysis carried out by investors. Rating agencies regularly review the ratings they award. Any change in the rating could affect the cost of future financing or access to liquidity.\n\nIn addition, a change in Orange's credit rating will, for certain outstanding financing, affect the remuneration paid to investors:\n\n- -one Orange SA bond (see Note 13.5) with an outstanding amount of 2.5 billion US dollars maturing in 2031 (equivalent to 2.3 billion euros at December 31, 2023) is subject to a Step-up clause in the event that Orange's credit rating changes. This clause was triggered in 2013 and 2014: the coupon due in March 2014 was thus calculated on the basis of an interest rate of 8.75%. And since then, the bond has been bearing interest of 9%;\n- -the margin of the 6 billion euro syndicated credit facility signed on  November 23,  2022  is  subject  to  change  depending on  whether  Orange's  credit  rating  is  raised  or  lowered. At December 31, 2023, this credit facility was undrawn.\n\nOrange's rating did not change during 2023. For Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), the outlook included in the rating changed during 2023, from stable to positive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The breach of these ratios constitutes an event of default that can lead to early repayment of the line of credit or loan concerned.\n\nThe main commitments are as follows:\n\n- -Orange Egypt: in respect of bank financing agreements signed in 2018 and 2022, of which the total amount outstanding at December 31, 2023 is 3,050 million Egyptian pounds and 83 million US dollars (i.e. 164 million euros), Orange Egypt is required to comply with a 'net senior debt to reported EBITDA' ratio;\n- -M\u00e9di Telecom: in respect of its bank financing agreements signed in 2022, of which the total amount outstanding at December 31,  2023  is  3,659 million  Moroccan  dirhams (i.e. 335 million euros), M\u00e9di Telecom is required to comply with ratios relating to its 'net financial debt', 'net financial debt/ EBITDA' and 'net equity';\n- -Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire: in respect of its bank financing agreements signed in 2016 and 2019, of which the total amount outstanding at December 31, 2023 is 70 billion CFA francs (i.e. 107 million euros), Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is required to comply with a 'net debt to reported EBITDA' ratio;\n\nThese ratios were complied with at December 31, 2023.\n\n## Main commitments to sustainability targets\n\nOrange SA is committed to social and environmental responsibility. This commitment is expressed, among other things, by the introduction of financial liabilities that include a Step-up clause to change the coupon rates if Orange fails to meet its sustainability target:\n\n- -on November 23, 2022, Orange signed with 27 international banks a 6 billion euros multi-currency syndicated revolving credit facility indexed on environmental and social indicators, to refinance  in  advance  its  previous  syndicated  loan maturing  in  December 2023.  This  sustainable  refinancing illustrates the Group's environmental, social and governance (ESG)  commitments,  with  an  indexation  of  the  margin  to the  achievement  of  objectives  relating  to CO 2 emissions (scopes 1 & 2, scope 3), in line with Orange's goal of being Net Zero Carbon by 2040, and to gender diversify its workforce. This new facility, initially maturing in November 2027, includes two options to extend for one more year each, exercisable by Orange and subject to the banks' approval. In October 2023, Orange exercised the first option enabling the initial maturity to be extended with the agreement of the lenders as follows: 5,872 million euros maturing in November 2028 and 128 million euros retaining the initial maturity of November 2027;\n- -on September 11, 2023  Orange  carried  out  its  first sustainability-linked bond issue, for a total nominal amount of 500 million euros, maturing in 2035, with a coupon rate of 3.875%. The bonds are linked to the Group's target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) and its commitment to provide digital support and training to external beneficiaries.\n\n## Default or material adverse change clauses\n\nMost of Orange's financing agreements, notably including the 6 billion euros syndicated credit facility set up on November 23, 2022, as well as bonds, are not subject to early redemption obligations in the event of a material adverse change or cross default provisions. However, most of these agreements include cross acceleration provisions. Thus, the mere occurrence of events of default in other financing agreements would not automatically trigger accelerated repayment under the aforementioned agreements.\n\n## 14.5 Credit risk and counterparty risk management\n\nThe Group could be exposed to a concentration of counterparty risk in respect of its trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, investments and derivatives.\n\nOrange considers that it has limited concentration in counterparty risk with respect to trade receivables due to its large and diverse customer  base  (residential,  professional  and  large  business customers)  operating  in  numerous  industries  and  located  in many French regions and foreign countries. The maximum value of the counterparty risk on these financial assets is equal to their recognized net carrying value. An analysis of net trade receivables past due is provided in Note 4.3. Loans and other receivables mainly include elements for which the amount due but not provisioned is not material.\n\nOrange SA is exposed to counterparty risk through its investments and derivatives. Therefore, it performs a strict selection of public, financial or industrial institutions in which it invests or with which it enters into derivative agreements. This selection takes particular note of the institutions' credit ratings. Therefore:\n\n- -for each non-banking counterparty selected for investments, limits are based on the ratings and maturities of the investments;\n- -for each bank counterparty selected for investments and for derivatives, limits are based on equity, rating, CDS (credit default swaps, an accurate indicator of potential default risk) as well as on periodic analyses carried out by the Treasury Department;\n- -theoretical limits and consumption limits are monitored and reported on a daily basis to the Group treasurer and the head of the trading room. These limits are adjusted regularly depending on credit events.\n\nFor derivatives, master agreements relating to financial instruments (French Banking Federation) are signed with all counterparties and provide for the netting of payables and receivables, in case of failure of one of the parties, as well as the calculation of a final balance to be received or paid. These agreements include a CSA (Credit Support Annex) cash collateral clause that can lead to either a deposit (collateral paid) or collection (collateral received), on a daily basis. These payment amounts correspond to the change in the market value of all derivatives.\n\nAs  a  rule,  investments  are  negotiated  with  high-grade  banks. Exceptionally, subsidiaries occasionally deal with counterparties with the highest ratings available locally.",

In accordance with IFRS 9, contracts concluded on non-financial assets (electricity) to meet the normal business needs of the company and used solely for its business, rather than for speculation or arbitrage on energy price fluctuations, are not considered as derivatives (application of the 'own-use' exemption in IFRS 9). The Group's commitments under those contracts are presented as off-balance sheet commitments in Note 16.1.\n\nTo meet its commitments in terms of Net Zero Carbon by 2040, the Group enters into Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) for electricity generated by renewable sources.\n\nThese contracts may be physical (with physical delivery of electricity and therefore not leading to the recognition of derivative instruments),\n\nor virtual. Energy supply is achieved through a portfolio of contracts mixing PPA, Solar/Energy As A Service, power purchase contracts with different terms (market), and supply contracts (aggregation and distribution).\n\nThe Group is considering Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs). These contracts result in the recognition of derivatives at fair value through profit or loss since there is no physical delivery of electricity. At December 31, 2023, the Group has only Virtual Power Purchase Agreements in Poland and Romania. These contracts are classified as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of which has a direct impact on the income statement. Fluctuations in the fair value of the effective portion of the hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income (see Note 13.8.2).\n\n## Effect of mechanisms to offset exposure to credit risk and counterparty risk of derivatives\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                   | December 31,  2023   | December 31,  2022   | December 31,  2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Collateralised Derivatives (net) (a)                     | 647                  | 1,014                | 408                  |\n| Fair value of collateralised derivatives assets          | 867                  | 1,374                | 690                  |\n| Fair value of collateralised derivatives liabilities     | (220)                | (360)                | (282)                |\n| Amount of cash collateral paid/(received) (b)            | (565)                | (1,034)              | (362)                |\n| Amount of cash collateral paid                           | 21                   | 38                   | 27                   |\n| Amount of cash collateral received                       | (586)                | (1,072)              | (389)                |\n| Residual exposure to counterparty risk (a) + (b)  (1)    | 82                   | (20)                 | 46                   |\n| Non collateralised Derivatives (net)                     | 31                   | 55                   | (3)                  |\n| Fair value of non collateralised derivatives assets      | 56                   | 81                   | -                    |\n| Fair value of non collateralised derivatives liabilities | (25)                 | (26)                 | (3)                  |\n\nThe change in net cash collateral deposits between 2022 and 2023 is mainly due to the depreciation of the US dollar and the interest rate effect of derivatives hedging bonds denominated in US dollar.

At December 31, 2023,  it  held  2,429,143 treasury  shares.  Orange SA  owns subsidiaries listed on equity markets whose share value may be affected by general trends in these markets. In particular, the market value of these listed subsidiaries' shares is one of the measurement variables used in impairment testing.\n\nThe UCITS in which Orange invests for cash management purposes do not hold equities.\n\nThe Orange group is also exposed to equity risk through some of its retirement plan assets (see Note 6.2).\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Group is not materially exposed to market risk on the shares of listed companies.\n\n## 14.8 Capital  management\n\nOrange SA and its non-financial subsidiaries are not subject to regulatory requirements related to equity (other than the usual standards applicable to any commercial company).\n\nIts financial subsidiaries (like electronic money institutions) are subject to regulatory equity requirements specific to their sector and jurisdiction.\n\nLike any company, Orange manages its financial resources (both equity and net financial debt) as part of a balanced financial policy, aiming to ensure flexible access to capital markets, including for the purpose of selectively investing in development projects, and to provide a return to shareholders.\n\nIn terms of net financial debt (see Note 13.3), this policy translates into liquidity management as described in Note 14.3 and a specific attention to credit ratings assigned by rating agencies.\n\nThis policy is also reflected, in some markets, by the presence of minority shareholders in the capital of subsidiaries controlled by Orange. This serves to limit the Group's debt while providing a benefit from the presence of local shareholders.",

The results calculated using the internal valuation model are systematically benchmarked with the values provided by Bloomberg.\n\nThe Group considers the carrying value of trade payables and deposits received from customers to be a reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the high liquidity of these items.\n\nThe fair value of long-term trade payables is the value of future cash flows discounted at the interest rates observed by the Group at the end of the period.",

Their fair value is measured in accordance with the provisions of the contractual agreements. When the commitment is based on a fixed price, a discounted value is retained.\n\nThe fair value of derivatives , mostly traded over the counter, is determined using the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted using the interest rates observed by the Group at the end of the period. The results calculated using the internal valuation model are consistently benchmarked with the values provided by bank counterparties and Bloomberg.\n\nWhen there are no reliable market data which identify the probability of default, the CVA (Credit Value Adjustment) and the DVA (Debit Value Adjustment) are measured based on historical default charts and CDS (Credit Default Swap) trends. Counterparty credit risk and the Group's own specific default risk are also continuously monitored based on the monitoring of debt security credit spreads on the secondary market and other market information. Given the implementation of collateralization, and based on counterparty policies and the management of the indebtedness and liquidity risk described in Note 14, CVA and DVA estimates are not material compared with the measurement of the related financial instruments.\n\n## Note 15   Equity\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Orange SA's share capital, based on the number of issued shares at this date, amounted to 10,640,226,396 euros, divided into 2,660,056,599 ordinary shares with a par value of 4 euros each.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the share capital and voting rights of Orange SA broke down as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 15.1 Changes in share capital\n\nNo new shares were issued during the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n## 15.2 Treasury  shares\n\nAs authorized by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 23, 2023, the Board of Directors instituted a new Share Buyback Program (the 2023 Buyback Program) and canceled the 2022 Buyback Program, with immediate effect.

Orange had a call option on each of these tranches respectively from February 7, 2020, February 7, 2024, and February 7, 2022 and  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  contractually  defined events.\n\nStep-up clauses provide for coupon adjustments of 0.25% in 2025 and an additional 0.75% in 2040 for the first tranche, 0.25% in 2024 and an additional 0.75% in 2044 for the second tranche, and 0.25% in 2027 and an additional 0.75% in 2042 for the third tranche.\n\nThis issuance was the subject of a prospectus approved by the AMF (visa no. 14-036).\n\nOn April 5, 2023, Orange launched an offer to repurchase the  entire  existing  second  and  final  tranche.  On  April 18, 2023, following this offer, the Group was able to repurchase 802 million euros of these subordinated notes. The nominal amount remaining in circulation after this repurchase amounts to 198 million euros. On December 13, 2023, Orange announced its intention to exercise its option on February 7, 2024 to repurchase the remaining outstanding amount of 198 million euros. As a result, the remaining outstanding amount was reclassified to current financial liabilities at December 31, 2023.\n\n- -On October 1, 2014, as part of its EMTN program, Orange issued the equivalent of 3 billion euros of deeply subordinated notes, in euros and pounds sterling, in three tranches:\n- -1 billion euros with a fixed annual coupon of 4% (entire tranche repurchased in 2019 and 2021),\n- -1.25 billion euros with a fixed annual coupon of 5%, and\n- -600 million pounds sterling (771 million euros at the ECB fixing price on the issue date), with a fixed annual coupon of 5.75%.\n\nA revision of interest rates based on market conditions is provided for contractually on each call option exercise date. Orange has a call option on each of these tranches respectively from October 1, 2021, October 1, 2026, and April 1, 2023 and upon the occurrence of certain contractually defined events.\n\nStep-up clauses provide for coupon adjustments of 0.25% in 2026 and an additional 0.75% in 2041 for the first tranche, 0.25% in 2026 and an additional 0.75% in 2046 for the second tranche, and 0.25% in 2028 and an additional 0.75% in 2043 for the third tranche.\n\nThis issuance was the subject of a prospectus approved by the AMF (visa no. 14-525).\n\nSuccessive repurchases were carried out on the third and last tranche in 2020 and 2021.\n\nOn November 21, 2022, Orange launched a final repurchase offer on this tranche, for the remaining 426 million pounds sterling (historical cost of 547 million euros). On November 30, 2022, following this offer, the Group repurchased 387 million pounds sterling of these subordinated notes (historical value\n\n- 3\n\nof 496 million euros).

They are booked in equity.\n\nAs equity instruments are recognized at historical value, the tranche denominated in foreign currency is never remeasured. Where appropriate, a translation adjustment impact is booked in equity when a call option is exercised.\n\nThe remuneration of holders is recorded directly in equity at the time of the decision to pay the coupons.\n\nThe tax impact related to the remuneration is accounted for through profit or loss, and that related to the remeasurement of the foreign currency portion is accounted for in equity.\n\n## Equity component of perpetual bonds redeemable for shares (TDIRAs) (see Note 13.4)\n\nThe equity component is determined as the difference between the fair value of the instrument taken as a whole and the fair value of the debt component. The equity component thus determined and recognized at inception is not subsequently re-measured and remains in equity, even when the instrument is extinguished.\n\n'other movements' in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity and amounted to 6 million euros in 2023, (2) million euros in 2022 and 29 million euros in 2021.",

The decrease in the carrying value of a foreign operation, either due to its own losses or because of the recognition of an impairment loss, does not result in a reclassification through profit or loss of the accumulated translation adjustments.\n\nReclassification of translation adjustments is presented in profit or loss within:\n\n- -net income of discontinued operations, when a line of business or major geographical area is disposed of;\n- -gains (losses) on disposal of fixed assets, investments and activities, when other businesses are disposed of.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Financial debt is remeasured at each reporting period end in accordance with the contractual arrangements (at fair value or at present value if fixed price) and, in the absence of any guidance provided by IFRS, with a counterparty in net finance costs.\n\n## Non-controlling interests that are debtors\n\nTotal comprehensive income of a subsidiary is attributed to the owners of the parent company and to the non-controlling interests. In accordance with IFRS 10, this can result in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\n## Transactions with shareholders of a controlled entity\n\nEach transaction with minority shareholders of an entity controlled by the Group, when not resulting in a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction with no effect on consolidated comprehensive income.\n\n## 15.7 Earnings per share\n\n## Net income\n\nThe Group net income used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share is determined according to the following method:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                                         | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Net income - basic                                                             | 2,440  | 2,146  | 233    |\n| Effect of subordinated notes                                                   | (175)  | (200)  | (225)  |\n| Net income attributable to the owners of the parent company - basic (adjusted) | 2,265  | 1,946  | 8      |\n| Impact of dilutive instruments on net income TDIRA                             | -      | 12     | -      |\n| Net income attributable to the owners of the parent company - diluted          | 2,265  | 1,957  | 8      |\n\n## Number of shares\n\nThe weighted average number of shares used to calculate the basic and diluted earnings per share is presented below:\n\n| (number of shares)                                           | 2023          | 2022          | 2021          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding       | 2,659,184,216 | 2,658,328,369 | 2,656,981,542 |\n| Impact of dilutive instruments on number of ordinary shares: |               |               |               |\n| TDIRA                                                        | -             | 27,269,551    | -             |\n| Free share award plans (LTIP)                                | 1,336,982     | 1,233,198     | 776,743       |\n| Weighted average number of shares outstanding - diluted      | 2,660,521,198 | 2,686,831,119 | 2,657,758,285 |\n\nThe average market price of the Orange share is higher than the fair value adopted under the free share award plans for all periods presented (see Note 6.3).

The number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share takes into account the conversion into ordinary shares of potentially dilutive instruments outstanding during the period. These instruments are considered dilutive when they have the effect of reducing earnings per share of continuing operations.\n\nWhen basic earnings per share are negative, diluted earnings per share are identical to basic earnings per share. In the event of a capital increase at a price lower than the market price, and in order to ensure comparability of the reporting periods shown, the weighted average numbers of shares outstanding in current and previous periods are adjusted. Treasury shares owned, which are deducted from the consolidated equity, do not enter into the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n## Note 16   Unrecognized contractual commitments (telecom activities)\n\nOnly the contractual commitments and off-balance sheet commitments of the entities controlled by the Group are presented below.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Orange is not aware of having entered into any commitment that may have a material effect on its current or future financial position, other than the commitments mentioned in this note.\n\n## 16.1 Operating activities commitments\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                                 | Total   | Less than  one year   | From one to  five years   | More than  five years   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Operating activities commitments                                       | 9,220   | 3,692                 | 3,291                     | 2,237                   |\n| Operating leases commitments                                           | 228     | 94                    | 93                        | 41                      |\n| Handsets purchase commitments                                          | 1,353   | 1,334                 | 15                        | 4                       |\n| Transmission capacity purchase commitments                             | 1,397   | 232                   | 465                       | 699                     |\n| Other goods and services purchase commitments                          | 3,918   | 1,241                 | 1,691                     | 985                     |\n| Investment commitments                                                 | 878     | 417                   | 443                       | 17                      |\n| Public Initiative Networks commitments  (1)                            | 61      | 10                    | 19                        | 32                      |\n| Guarantees granted to third parties in the ordinary course of business | 1,386   | 363                   | 565                       | 459                     |\n\n## Lease commitments\n\nLease commitments include property leases relating to contracts for which the underlying asset will be available after December\u00b031, 2023 and leases for which the Group applies the exemptions allowed by IFRS 16 (see Note 9).\n\n| (in millions of euros)       |   Minimum  future lease  payments |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Property lease commitments   |                               152 |\n| o/w technical activities     |                                51 |\n| o/w shops/offices activities |                               101 |\n\nMaturities are set forth below:\n\n| (in millions of euros)      |   Minimum  future lease  payments |   Less than  one year |   Between  one and  two years |   Between  two and  three years |   Between  three and  four years |   Between  four and  five years |   More than  five years |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Property lease  commitments |                               152 |                    45 |                            25 |                              16 |                               19 |                              10 |                      37 |\n\nLease commitments correspond to the outstanding minimum future lease payments until the normal date of renewal of the leases or the earliest possible termination date.\n\nProperty  lease  commitments  in  France  represent  40%  of  all property lease commitments.",

They include an agreement on the use of an FTTH network in Spain for 819 million euros and 327 million euros for the provision of satellite transmission capacity (the maturity of these commitments extends until 2040, depending on the contracts).\n\n## Other purchase commitments for goods and services\n\nThe Group's other purchase commitments for goods and services mainly relate to network operation and maintenance.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, these commitments include:\n\n- -energy purchase commitments for an amount of 927 million euros;\n- -commitments relating to co-financed and leased lines for an amount of 255 million euros;\n- -the purchase of broadcasting rights for an amount of 360 million euros;\n- -hosting services for active equipment for mobile sites under a 'built-to-suit' agreement for an amount of 413 million euros;\n- -site management service contracts ('TowerCos') signed in Africa: these commitments represent an amount of 269 million euros;\n- -the maintenance of submarine cable for which Orange has joint ownership or user rights, for an amount of 212 million euros;\n- -network maintenance for an amount of 191 million euros;\n- -commitments to partners in the field of sports for an amount of 82 million euros.\n\n## Investment commitments\n\nAt the end of December 2023, investment commitments amount to 878 million euros.\n\nIn addition of commitments expressed in monetary terms, the Group has made commitments to National Regulatory Authorities, such as ensuring a certain coverage of the population by its fixed and mobile networks, particularly in connection with the assignment of licenses and in respect of quality of service. These commitments will require capital expenditure in future years to roll out and enhance the networks. They are not shown in the above statement of commitments related to operating activities if they have not been expressed in monetary terms, which is usually the case. The Group has accordingly agreed to meet the following conditions:\n\n## In France:\n\n- -Orange  and  the  French  government  announced  on November 7, 2023 that they had reached a new agreement on the widespread roll-out of fiber optic by 2025. In the AMII (Appel \u00e0 manifestation intention d'investissement - call for expression of investment interest) zone, this new roll-out commitment will replace the 2022 milestone of the L. 33-13 commitments (i.e. the second milestone of the commitments made in 2018). This proposal is based on the following elements:\n- -by 2025, 1,120,000 premises in the entire AMII zone will be made connectable (which would represent 98.5% of connectable premises, including cases of blockage/refusal),\n- -by  2024,  140,000 premises  within  the  perimeter  of 55 inter-municipality cooperation zones with the lowest FTTH coverage.\n\n- 3\n\nIn  addition,  a  government  order  incorporating  the  terms of  Orange's  commitment  could  be  published  following  an advisory  opinion  from  Arcep  (Autorit\u00e9  de  R\u00e9gulation  des Communications Electroniques, des Postes et de la Distribution de la Presse - the French Electronic Communications, Postal and Print Media Distribution Regulatory Authority), and may entail additional obligations:\n\n- -when Arcep awarded several spectrum blocks in the 700 MHz and 3.5 GHz bands for the territories of R\u00e9union and Mayotte in 2022:\n- -a network coverage obligation of 7 predefined zones by 2025,\n- -an obligation to provide two sites by 2024;\n- -the obligations included in the authorization to use 5G spectrum in mainland France in the 3.4-3.8 GHz band issued to Orange on November 12, 2020 are as follows:\n- -the  roll-out  of  sites  (3,000 sites  by  the  end  of  2022, 8,000 sites by the end of 2024 and 10,500 sites by the end of 2025), 25% of which must be located in rural areas or industrial areas outside of very densely populated areas,\n- -widespread availability of a 5G service at all sites by the end of 2030, an obligation that may be met either with the 3.4-3.8 GHz band or another band,\n- -the provision of a speed of at least 240 Mbits/s per segment from 75% of sites by the end of 2022, 85% of sites by the end of 2024, 90% of sites by the end of 2025 and 100% of sites by the end of 2030,\n- -coverage of the main highways by the end of 2025 and major roads by the end of 2027,\n- -the provision of differentiated services and the activation of the IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) network protocol.\n\nIn addition, the commitments made by Orange to participate in  the  first  stage  of  the  procedure,  which  enabled  it  to obtain 50 MHz at a reserve price, became obligations in the authorization issued:\n\n- -from the end of 2023, Orange will have to provide a fixed offer from sites using the 3.5 GHz band and a fixed offer to cover premises that benefit from fixed-access radio network services,\n- -Orange will have to meet reasonable requests for the provision of services from private sector companies and public sector structures, provide indoor coverage, offer hosting  for  mobile  virtual  network  operators  (MVNOs) and be transparent about network failures and planned roll-outs;\n- -in 2018, pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 33-13 of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code regarding coverage in sparsely populated areas, Orange committed to:\n- -ensuring that within its FTTH roll-out scope in the AMII area, and unless refused by third parties, 100% of homes and professional premises would have access to FTTH sales offers by the end of 2020 (including a maximum 8% of premises connectable on demand) and that 100% of homes and professional premises would be made connectable by the end of 2022. Subsequent to an opinion from Arcep, these  proposals  were  accepted  by  the  government  in July 2018,\n- -outside  of  the  AMII  area,  Orange  proposed  that  it make roll-out commitments as part of AMEL (Appel \u00e0 manifestation  d'engagements  locaux  -  Call  for  Local Commitments) procedures in the Vienne, Haute-Vienne, Deux-S\u00e8vres and Lot-et-Garonne departments;\n- -on January 14, 2018, the Orange group and the other French mobile  operators  signed  an  agreement  (the  'New  Deal') to ensure better mobile coverage of the French mainland and particularly rural areas. This agreement includes enhanced coverage obligations, which are included for the 2018-2021 period in our existing licenses in the 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

Nearly all material disposal agreements provide for caps on these warranties.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the main warranties in effect are as follows:\n\n- -fundamental warranties granted to the HIN consortium (made up of La Banque des Territoires, Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts, CNP Assurances and EDF) in connection with the disposal of Orange Concessions (50% of the capital sold in 2021), expiring 3 years after the date of the transaction, and tax warranties expiring 60 days after the end of the statutory limitation periods;\n- -warranties granted to the APG group in connection with the disposal of the FiberCo in Poland (50% of the capital sold in 2021), which will expire at the end of 18 months, with the exception of the tax and fundamental warranties, which will expire after 7 and 6 years, respectively;\n- -miscellaneous standard warranties granted to buyers of real estate sold by the Group.\n\nOrange believes that the risk of all these warranties being enforced is remote or that the potential consequences of their being enforced are not material with respect to the Group's results and financial position.\n\n## Asset and liability warranties received in relation to acquisitions\n\nUnder  the  terms  of  acquisition  agreements  between  Group companies and the transferors of certain assets, the Group has received warranty clauses relating to assets and liabilities. Nearly all material acquisition agreements provide for caps on these warranties.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the main warranties in effect are as follows:\n\n- -standard and specific capped warranties obtained from Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A. in connection with the acquisition of Telekom Romania Communications, which expired on March 31, 2023 (with respect to general representations and warranties) and will expire on September 30, 2028 (with respect to fundamental warranties). Some specific capped allowances have also been obtained, for up to 10 years;\n- -standard and specific capped warranties obtained from Nethys in connection with the acquisition of VOO, which will expire on December 2, 2024 for the general representations and warranties and on June 2, 2028 for the fundamental warranties. Some specific capped allowances have also been obtained, for up to 7 years.\n\nOrange believes that the risk of all these warranties being enforced is remote or that the potential consequences of their being enforced are not material with respect to the Group's results and financial position.\n\n## Commitments relating to securities\n\nUnder the terms of agreements with third parties, Orange can make or receive commitments to purchase or to sell securities. The ongoing commitments at December 31, 2023 are not likely to have material impacts on the Group's financial position.\n\n## Orange Tunisie\n\nUnder the terms of the shareholders' agreement with Investec dated May 20, 2009, Orange has a call option giving it the right to purchase at market value 1% of the share capital of Orange Tunisie plus one share, subject to regulatory authorizations. If this option were exercised, Orange would take control of Orange Tunisie. Investec would then have the right to sell to Orange 15% of the share capital of Orange Tunisie at market value.\n\n## Orange Concessions\n\nUnder  the  terms  of  the  shareholders'  agreement  signed  on March 27, 2021, which became effective on November 3, 2021, with the HIN consortium (made up of La Banque des Territoires, Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts, CNP Assurances and EDF), Orange has a call option that can be exercised in fiscal year 2026 enabling it to acquire at market value 1% of the voting rights of Orange Concessions, subject to the award of the authorizations.\n\n## FiberCo in Poland\n\nUnder the terms of the shareholders' agreement with APG Group signed on April 11, 2021, Orange has a call option that can be exercised from fiscal year 2027 giving it the right to purchase at market value 1% of the share capital of \u015a wiat\u0142ow\u00f3d Inwestycje Sp.z o.o., subject to the award of the authorizations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

These assets are recognized at fair value at initial recognition and subsequently. All changes in value are recorded in profit or loss.\n\n- -Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified to profit or loss (FVOCI)\n\nEquity securities which are not consolidated or equity-accounted are, subject to exceptions, recognized as assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified to profit or loss. They are recognized at fair value at initial recognition and subsequently. Temporary changes in value and gains (losses) on disposals are recorded as other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n- -Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may be reclassified to profit or loss (FVOCIR)\n\nAssets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may be reclassified to profit or loss mainly include investments in debt securities. They are recognized at fair value at initial recognition and subsequently. Temporary changes in value are recorded in other comprehensive income that may be reclassified to profit or loss. In case of disposal, the cumulative gain (or loss) recognized in other comprehensive income that may be reclassified to profit or loss is then reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n- -Financial assets at amortized cost (AC)\n\nThis category primarily comprises various loans and receivables as well as fixed-income securities held for the purpose of collecting contractual flows. These instruments are recognized at fair value at initial recognition and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, debt instruments classified as financial assets at amortized cost or as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, lease receivables, financing commitments and financial guarantees given are systematically subject to impairment or a provision for an expected credit loss. These impairment losses and provisions are recorded as soon as loans are granted, commitments are concluded or bonds are purchased, without waiting for the appearance of an objective indication of impairment.\n\nTo do this, the financial assets concerned are divided into three categories according to the change in credit risk observed since their initial recognition and an impairment loss is recorded on the amount outstanding of each of these categories, as follows:\n\n- -performing loans: the calculation of expected losses is made on a 12-month basis, and the financial income (interest) is calculated on the basis of the gross amount of the instrument;\n- -impaired loans: if the credit risk has significantly deteriorated since the loans were recorded in the balance sheet, the expected losses, estimated over the duration of the loan, are recognized as an impairment or a provision and the financial income (interest) is calculated on the basis of the gross amount of the instrument;\n- -doubtful loans: impairment or a provision is recognized for the expected loss, estimated over the duration of the loan. The financial income is calculated on the basis of the amount of the instrument net of the impairment.\n\n## 17.1.2 Financial liabilities related to Orange Bank transactions (excluding derivatives)\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                             | December 31,   | December 31,   | December 31,   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                                    | 2023           | 2022           | 2021           |\n| Payables to customers  (1)                                         | 2,601          | 1,787          | 1,796          |\n| Debts with financial institutions  (2)                             | 215            | 837            | 1,009          |\n| Deposit certificate                                                | 219            | 325            | 356            |\n| Cash collateral deposit                                            | 73             | 82             | -              |\n| Other  (3)                                                         | 66             | 112            | 27             |\n| Total Financial liabilities related to Orange Bank activities  (4) | 3,173          | 3,143          | 3,188          |\n\n- (2) Decrease mainly related to repayments to the European Central Bank (TLTROs) of 601 million euros.\n- (3) Including 37 million euros of rate hedging credit portfolios reassessment.\n- (4) Including 100 million euros in non-current financial liabilities in 2023, 110 million euros in 2022 and 27 million euros in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The net fair value of these derivatives at December 31, 2023 is 37 million euros;\n- -100 million euros in notional value (of which 100 million euros at more than five years), hedging a portfolio of French fungible Treasury bonds (Obligations Assimilables du Tr\u00e9sor - OAT) of the same amount and maturity. The fair value of these swaps at December 31, 2023 is 14 million euros;\n- -20 million euros in notional value hedging a portfolio of French fungible  Treasury  bonds  index-linked  to  consumer  prices harmonized within the euro zone (Obligations Assimilables du Tr\u00e9sor index\u00e9es sur l'inflation des prix de la zone euro - OAT\u20aci) of the same amount and maturity, i.e. 2030. The fair value of these swaps at December 31, 2023 is (4) million euros;\n- -5 million euros in notional value hedging a portfolio of securities maturing in 2028, whose fair value at December 31, 2023 is close to zero.\n\nThe ineffective portion of these hedges recognized in profit or loss in 2023 is not material.\n\n## Cash flow hedge derivatives\n\nAt January 1, 2020, Orange Bank had documented a micro-hedging of its issues through interest rate swaps which, at the end of 2023, represented:\n\n- -186 million euros in notional value (including 166 million euros maturing in 2024, 10 million euros maturing between one and two years and 10 million euros maturing in 2027), hedging negotiable debt securities issued by the bank, the fair value of which was 4 million euros at December 31, 2023.\n\n## Trading derivatives\n\n- -Orange Bank has set up interest rate swaps as economic hedges (not designated as hedges under IFRS) of EIB securities for a total notional amount of 10 million euros maturing in 2029, the fair value of which was 1 million euros at December 31, 2023. The net effects of this economic hedge on profit or loss are not material;\n- -Orange Bank has a portfolio of trading swaps with a total notional value of 16 million euros maturing within five years and a total fair value of close to zero at December 31, 2023.\n\n## 17.2 Information on market risk management with respect to Orange Bank activities\n\nOrange Bank has its own risk management system in accordance with banking regulations. In terms of banking regulation, Orange Bank is under the supervision of the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution - ACPR) and must at all times comply with a capital requirement in order to withstand the risks associated with its activities.\n\nOrange Bank's activities expose it to most of the risks defined by the ordinance of November 3, 2014, relating to the internal control of companies in the banking, payment services and investment services sector subject to the control of the ACPR. The most significant of these risks are:\n\n- -credit risk and counterparty risk: the risk of loss incurred in the event of default by a counterparty or counterparties considered as the same beneficiary;\n- -liquidity risk: the risk that Orange Bank will not be able to meet its commitments or not be able to unwind or offset a position due to the market situation;\n- -operational risk: the risk resulting from an inadequacy or failure due to procedures, employees or internal systems or to outside events, including events that are unlikely to occur but that would incur a high risk of loss. Operational risk includes the risk of internal and external fraud and IT risk;\n- -interest rate risk: the risk incurred in the event of changes in interest  rates  impacting  on-balance  sheet  and  off-balance sheet transactions, excluding, where applicable, transactions exposed to market risk;\n- -non-compliance  risk:  the  risk  of  judicial,  administrative  or disciplinary sanctions, material financial loss or damage to reputation,  arising  from  non-compliance  with  provisions specific to banking and financial activities;\n- -concentration risk: the risk arising from excessive exposure to a counterparty, to a group of counterparties operating in the same economic sector or geographic area, or the application of credit risk reduction techniques, particularly collateral issued by a single entity;\n- -market risk: the risk of loss due to movements in market product prices.\n\nThe size of the bank and its moderate risk profile led to the choice of  standard  methods  regarding  the  application  of  Regulation no. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 26, 2013.",

        "page_content": "Orange Bank is not involved with complex products. For market transactions, the bank's Executive Committee sets the limits while the Risk Management Department monitors compliance with these limits and the quality of the authorized signatories.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Bank  has  defined  and  regularly  tests  its business  continuity  system.  The  Bank  has  also  undertaken, as  comprehensively  as  possible,  to  identify  and  assess  its operational risks, for which it also monitors occurrences.\n\nIn line with regulations, and in particular titles IV and V of the ordinance of November 3, 2014, the bank's Executive Committee, on the recommendation of the Risk Management Department, establishes the institution's risk policy, which is formalized through the risk appetite framework, and ensures its proper implementation.\n\nThe Risk Management Department analyzes and monitors risk, carries out the necessary controls and produces reports for various committees: The Credit Committee (management of credit and counterparty risk), the Risk and Audit Committee (management of  operational  risks),  the  Financial  Security  and  Compliance Committee  (management  of  non-compliance  risk),  the  ALM Committee (management of market, interest rate and liquidity risk) and the Executive Committee.\n\n## 17.2.1 Credit risk and counterparty risk management\n\nSince July 2022, Orange Bank has began migrating its consumer credit  distribution  platform,  previously  hosted  by  Franfinance (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group), to Younited Credit. This roll-out was completed in the first quarter of 2023. The bank is thus benefiting from new credit risk management technologies.\n\nThe Bank has also reviewed its provisioning models to adapt them to the type of loan portfolio and macroeconomic conditions, resulting in a provision reversal of 6 million euros.\n\nAt the end of December 2023, the cost of risk of Orange Bank amount to 56 million euros, including 16 million euros in France and 40 million euros in Spain. Excluding exceptional adjustments (review of macroeconomic outlooks or review of models), the cost of risk is 63 million euros, of which 23 million euros for France and 40 million euros for Spain.\n\nIn France, the cost of risk is mainly concentrated in demand deposit accounts due to the increase in outstanding debit balances and in personal loans due to the increase in outstandings since the roll-out of Younited Credit.\n\nIn Spain, the cost of risk is mainly related to the increase in Orange Espagne's mobile handset financing outstandings from 600 million euros at December 31, 2022 to 667 million euros at December 31, 2023 (excluding the provision for credit risk).\n\n## 17.2.2 Market and interest rate risk management\n\nOrange Bank does not carry out proprietary trading operations. Its market activity mainly consists of investments to optimize liquidity management and purchases of interest rate hedges.\n\nThe value of the securities portfolio continues to decrease in line with the bank's strategy, market risk indicators remain stable and the associated risks are not material.\n\nFixed-interest  securities  in  investment  portfolios  are  hedged. Orange Bank has no exposure classified as trading book. The interest rate risk, after the capital increase in December 2023, is less than 1% of the CET1 (Common Equity Tier 1) ratio. Finally, the basic risk is not material.\n\n## 17.2.3 Liquidity risk management\n\nIn 2023, Orange Bank continued to manage its liquidity in a prudent manner. At the end of December 2023, the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) is 160% and the LCR (short-term liquidity coverage ratio) reaches 784%. 2023 was characterized by a liquidity surplus related to customer transactions. The deficit has changed from 855 million euros at December 31, 2022 to a liquidity surplus of 84 million euros at December 31, 2023. This change was mainly due to the high level of deposits in term accounts in 2023 (via the RAISIN platform).\n\nOrange Bank has stepped up the diversification of its financing sources through the RAISIN term account program, in order to offset the outflow of customer deposits and the expiration of the European Central Bank's financing programs (TLTROs) for 601 million euros in 2023. RAISIN term account outstandings increased from 40 million euros at December 31, 2022 to 1.2 billion euros at December 31, 2023.\n\nA plan to secure liquidity has been put in place in view of the bank's context:\n\n- -a committed repo facility with BNP Paribas relating to the Senior tranche of the 'Orange Bank Personal Loan 2020' FCT (securitization mutual fund) and a basket of eligible securities;\n- -a credit facility for 400 million euros signed between Orange Bank and Orange SA on June 28, 2023.\n\nOrange Bank's financing plan was revised and presented to the ACPR at the end of 2023 to demonstrate that the bank is able to comply with its prudential ratios for solvency (capital requirement) and liquidity (LCR, NSFR and Pillar 2 liquidity) at all times.\n\nThis updated financing plan, presented on a monthly basis, is in line with the plans previously communicated to the ACPR and remains in accordance with the Group's financing envelope of 1.3 billion euros approved by the Orange SA Board of Directors on July 25, 2023.\n\n## 17.2.4 Operational risk management\n\nAt bank level, the operational risk guidance scope covers:\n\n- -operational  risks  carried  by  all  the  bank's  activities (management, operating and support activities);\n- -operational  risks  from  major  and  critical  external  service providers.\n\nOperational risk management is the responsibility of the Permanent Control and Operational Risk Director, who reports to the Executive Director  of  Risk  and  Control,  a  member  of  the  Management Committee, who in turn reports directly to an effective director of Orange Bank.\n\nThe operational risk management system is based on the collection of  operational  incidents  and  losses,  risk  mapping,  scenario analyses and key risk indicators managed by the operational risk department and monitored within the context of risk appetite, and on the management of insurance policies covering the main types of risks faced by the bank. An inventory and collection of all of the bank's operational incidents (proven risks), including IT, IT security and non-compliance risks, are in place. Incidents are reported as soon as they are detected by all bank employees in a dedicated IT tool.\n\nWhere non-compliance incidents are identified, the Operational Risks Department notifies the Compliance Department, which is responsible for monitoring and managing them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

They amounted to 3 million euros in 2022 and 1 million euros in 2021. The losses recorded in 2023 are mainly due to external fraud, particularly credit fraud, as well as, to a lesser extent, commercial disputes and execution errors. Action plans have been drawn up in collaboration with the business lines to mitigate the various types of risk described above and to further secure the various processes, given the Orange group's announced intention to wind down its banking activities.\n\n## 17.2.5 Non-compliance risk management\n\nOrange Bank's Compliance function is part of the Compliance, Financial Security and  Investment  Services  Compliance Department,  whose  Director  is  a  member  of  the  Executive Committee. This function is impartial and independent from the operational business lines to safeguard its objectivity. It is also a local function responsible for ensuring that all of the bank's business lines adhere to the compliance system.\n\nThe main mission of Compliance is to oversee the management of non-compliance risk. It ensures that the level of non-compliance risk to which Orange Bank is exposed is compatible with the guidelines and policies set by the Board of Directors in this area, as well as with the overall limits for financial, non-financial and operational risk (e.g. reputational risk, regulatory sanctions, etc.).\n\nIn  this  context,  Compliance  implements  all  actions  aimed  at ensuring compliance with the requirements of external and internal standards (organization, processes, procedures). These actions take place along the entire value chain, from the execution of transactions by the various business lines to their monitoring by Compliance.\n\nAs the first level of control, employees and their superiors identify the risks arising from their activity and comply with the procedures and limits set out in the General Procedures and operating procedures. They are in particular responsible for:\n\n- -implementing operational controls and first-level controls that can be formalized, tracked and reported on;\n- -formalizing and verifying compliance with the procedures for processing transactions, detailing the responsibilities of those involved and the types of controls carried out;\n- -verifying the compliance of transactions;\n- -implementing  the  recommendations  drawn  up  by  the second-level control functions for the first-level control system;\n- -reporting to and alerting second-level control functions. As the second level of control, Compliance verifies in particular that the risks have been identified, assessed and managed by the first level of control in accordance with the rules and procedures in place.\n\nIn particular, Compliance is responsible for overseeing:\n\n- -the  compliance  of  transactions  executed  by  employees in  accordance  with  the  laws,  regulations  and  professional standards;\n- -the  implementation  of  compliance  recommendations  by first-level control;\n- -the adoption and monitoring of remedial action plans where non-compliance risks have been identified.\n\nIn addition, the compliance function within Orange Bank mainly consists of:\n\n- -producing and updating internal standards and procedures within its remit;\n- -advising  and  assisting  operational  business  lines  in  their decision-making;\n- -raising awareness and training all employees on compliance issues, depending on the transactions they execute;\n- -reporting regularly to the supervisory authorities;\n- -regularly assessing non-compliance risk, mapping risks and fulfilling its duty to alert General Management;\n- -monitoring changes in the laws and regulations in coordination with the legal department in order to incorporate new standards into internal processes (general policies, charters, codes and operating procedures) and to inform employees and the various business lines of these changes;\n- -verifying, as a second-level control function, the implementation of administrative, legislative and regulatory provisions as well as professional or internal standards.\n\nCompliance also covers the areas of financial security and data protection, which are, from an organizational viewpoint, managed respectively by the Head of Financial Security, who reports to the Director of Compliance, Financial Security and Investment Services Compliance (on financial security) and by the Data Protection Officer within the legal department.\n\nIn  relation  to  training  and  raising  employee  awareness,  the Human Resources Department training unit, in conjunction with Compliance, establishes and monitors employee training courses, which are the foundation of the compliance system. Mandatory training programs are organized for all new arrivals. In 2023, 100% of  employees  attended  Regulatory  and  Compliance  Overview training course.\n\nSimilarly, all employees concerned attended a training course on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing and 90% attended a Group training course on anti-corruption. Furthermore, other mandatory and regulatory training programs (particularly on real estate loans, consumer credit and the claims management system) were provided to the employees concerned.",

        "page_content": "## Note 18   Litigation\n\nThis note presents all of the significant litigation in which the Group is involved with the exception of litigation relating to disputes between Orange and the tax or social security administrations over tax, income taxes or social security contributions. These litigation are described, respectively, in Notes 6.2 and 10.3, as appropriate.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the provisions for risks recorded by the Group for all its litigation (except those presented in Notes 6.2 and  10.3)  amount  to  283 million  euros  (387 million  euros  at December 31, 2022 and 405 million euros at December 31, 2021). Orange believes that any disclosure of the amount of provisions on a case-by-case basis for ongoing disputes could seriously harm the Group's position. The balance and overall movements in provisions are presented in Note 5.2.\n\n## France\n\n## Mobile services\n\n- -As part of the compensation proceedings between Digicel and Orange (implementation of anti-competitive practices on the mobile and fixed-to-mobile markets in the French Caribbean and French Guiana in the early 2000s and sanctioned by the French Competition Authority in 2009), the Commercial Court of Paris ordered Orange to pay Digicel 346 million euros after interests discounting. In June 2020, the Paris Court of Appeal reversed the discounting method applied to the damages set forth in the judgment rendered by the Commercial Court of Paris in December 2017 and ordered Orange to pay Digicel the sum of 249 million euros. Following this judgment, Orange has been refunded 97 million euros. In March 2023, the Supreme Court partially quashed and annulled the Paris Court of Appeal's ruling of June 17, 2020 on the specific point of the progressive nature of the basis on which interests are applied to compensate for the cash flow loss associated with the discounting of the principal loss. Orange referred the case to the Court of Appeal in March 2023. The proceedings are ongoing.\n\n## Fixed services\n\n- -Following the final decision of the French Competition Authority to fine Orange 350 million euros for having implemented four anti-competitive practices in the 'enterprise' market segment on December 17, 2015, several players, including Adista, filed actions for damages against Orange. The proceedings before the Paris Commercial Court between Adista and Orange, which are now the only ones in progress in this case, are ongoing and are currently in the deliberation phase.\n- -In the dispute between Orange and SFR over fixed telephony retail offers for second homes, in September 2021 the Court of Appeal ordered SFR to return the sums awarded to it (i.e. 53 million euros). SFR then appealed again to the Supreme Court. In a ruling dated October 18, 2023, the Supreme Court dismissed SFR's appeal in its entirety. The case is now closed.\n- -In the dispute between Bouygues Telecom and Orange before the Commercial Court of Paris regarding the quality of service of Orange's wholesale offers on the copper local loop, Bouygues Telecom is seeking damages estimated at 85 million euros. Orange considers these claims to be unfounded.\n- -In December 2023, Iliad brought an action against Orange before the Commercial Court of Paris regarding the quality of service of Orange's wholesale offers on the copper local loop. Iliad is claiming 49 million euros. Orange considers these claims to be unfounded.\n\n- 3\n\n- -On February 24, 2023, Bouygues Telecom and SDAIF (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de D\u00e9veloppement pour l'Acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'Infrastructure Fibre) brought an action against Orange before the Commercial Court of Paris regarding the mechanism for returning FTTH connections, which allows commercial telecom operators with access to Orange's fiber network to connect their end-customers themselves and have part of the cost of this connection returned to them when the line is taken over by a new commercial operator. Bouygues Telecom and SDAIF maintain that the mechanism put in place by Orange does not comply with the regulations and are claiming 125 million euros, revalued at the end of January 2024 at 152 million euros, corresponding, according to them, to the refunds due in respect of terminations of FTTH lines since the origin of the contract. Orange considers these allegations to be unfounded.\n\n## Other proceedings in France\n\n- -In  June 2018,  Iliad  filed  for  summary  judgment  against Orange SA before the presiding judge of the Commercial Court of Paris, aiming to ban some of its mobile telephony offers proposing mobile handsets at attractive prices accompanied by subscription packages, on the grounds that they constituted consumer credit offers. In October 2020, Iliad had estimated its losses at 790 million euros, which it has since revalued at 810 million euros. The case is currently before the judges deciding on the merits of the case.\n- -Orange Bank is involved in a historical dispute in which a plaintiff is claiming a total of approximately 310 million euros for the financial loss it claims to have suffered. As the Group believes these claims to be unfounded and is strenuously challenging them, it has not recognized any financial liability.\n- -In the dispute between ASSIA and Orange regarding an alleged infringement of two patents relating to the dynamic xDSL line management, for which ASSIA was claiming a provision of 500 million euros in damages as compensation for its financial loss, which it estimated at 1,418 million euros, the Paris Judicial Court in September 2023 dismissed ASSIA's claims in their entirety. ASSIA has 3 months from the date of service of the judgment to lodge an appeal. The proceedings are ongoing.\n- -On  November 7,  2023,  Arcep  (Autorit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gulation des communications \u00e9lectroniques, des postes et de la distribution de la presse) fined Orange SA 26 million euros for failing to comply by April 14, 2021 with its commitment made in 2018 on the grounds of article L. 33-13 of the French postal and electronic communication code to make 100% of homes and professional premises in the communes listed in its commitment connectable or connectable on demand to fiber. The penalty has been enforced, but Orange has also filed a complaint with the French Council of State to challenge the legitimacy and proportionality of the penalty.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\n- -In December 2018, the directors of former UK retailer Phones 4U, (which is in administration and no longer trading), filed a complaint against the three main UK mobile network operators, including EE, and their parent companies, including Orange. The Phones 4U claim (for an unquantified amount) is currently being  challenged  in  the  UK  courts.  By  judgment  dated November 10, 2023, the judge dismissed Phones 4U's claim in its entirety. The proceedings are ongoing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

The parties have requested the intervention of T-Mobile Polska in the proceedings, which it has accepted. The proceedings are ongoing.\n\n## Africa & Middle East\n\n- -A number of shareholder disputes are ongoing between the joint venture comprising Agility and Orange, on the one hand, and its Iraqi co-shareholder in the capital of the Iraqi operator, Korek Telecom, on the other hand. These disputes, which concern various breaches of contractual documents, are the subject of pre-litigation proceedings and arbitral and judicial proceedings in various countries. In one of these disputes, on March 20, 2023, an arbitration court set up under the aegis of the International Chamber of Commerce made a final award: noting various breaches of the shareholders' agreement and tortious acts committed by the Iraqi co-shareholder (including collusion with the Iraqi telecommunications regulator (CMC) to obtain a decision to cancel the March 2011 partnership between the operator Korek Telecom, Agility and Orange),\n\n## Note 19   Subsequent  events\n\n## Completion of the aquisition of OCS and Orange Studio by Canal+ Group\n\nOn January 9, 2023 Orange and the Canal+ Group announced the signature of a memorandum of agreement for the acquisition by the Canal+ Group of all the shares held by Orange in the OCS pay TV package and in Orange Studio, the film and series co-production subsidiary. The Canal+ Group will become the sole shareholder of both companies following this transaction.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, the French Competition Authority authorized the transaction subject to commitments made by the Canal+ group.\n\nOn January 31, 2024, Orange and the Canal+ Group completed this transaction, which should result in a loss of around 170 million euros in the Orange Group's consolidated accounts. Following this transaction, the Canal+ group becomes the sole shareholder of both companies.\n\nAs part of this transaction, Orange has granted Canal+ standard and specific guarantees.\n\n## Favorable decision of the Spanish Constitutional Court on a tax dispute in progress\n\nOrange Espagne has initiated a dispute over the measure limiting the use of tax loss carryforwards that was introduced since 2016 which limits the amount of tax losses that can be offset to 25% of taxable income (compared with 70% previously). Orange Espagne\n\nthe  arbitral  court  awarded  1.7 billion  American  dollars  in damages for the benefit of the joint venture between Agility and Orange. In addition, on March 19, 2019, following an administrative decree adopted by the Iraqi Ministry of Trade and  Industry,  the  General  Register  of  companies  in  Erbil (Iraqi Kurdistan) restored the shareholding structure of Korek Telecom as it existed before Orange and Agility had acquired a stake. As a result, the registration of the Korek Telecom shares in the name of the original shareholders was imposed without any compensation or reimbursement of the amounts invested. Orange thus considers that it was unlawfully expropriated of its investment and, on March 24, 2019, sent a notice of dispute to the Republic of Iraq based on the Bilateral lnvestment Treaty between France and Iraq. In the absence of an amicable settlement with the Iraqi State, Orange submitted a request for arbitration with the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) on October 2, 2020.\n\nIn order to provide its telecommunication services, the Group sometimes uses the fixed assets of other parties and the terms of use of these assets are not always formalized. The Group is sometimes subject to claims and might be subject to future claims in this respect, which could result in a cash outflow in the future. The amount of the potential obligations or future commitments cannot be measured with sufficient reliability due to the legal complexities involved.\n\nOther than proceedings that may be initiated in respect of disputes between Orange and the tax or social security authorities over tax, income taxes and social security contributions (see Notes 6.2 and 10.3), there are no other administrative, legal or arbitration proceedings,  including  any  proceedings  that  are  pending, suspended or threatened, of which Orange is aware, which may have or have had in the last 12 months a material impact on the Company's and/or Group's financial position or profitability.\n\nis claiming a total of around 180 million euros for fiscal years 2017 to 2021.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, no asset was recognized in relation to this dispute.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, the Constitutional Court (high court in the country) ruled that this measure was illegal. The National Court (Audiencia Nacional) will confirm this decision in the context of the dispute initiated by Orange Espagne.\n\n## Tax dispute in Spain on the business activity tax (IAE - Impuesto de Actividades Econ\u00f3micas)\n\nOrange  Espagne  contests  the  conformity  of  business  activity tax ('Impuesto de Actividades Econ\u00f3micas') with the European directives and claims the restitution of the amounts paid for this tax for the years 2003-2021. Orange Espagne has thus initiated various disputes relating to this tax.\n\nOn 5 February 2024, a favorable decision for Orange Espagne was issued by the National Court (Audiencia National) ordering the tax authorities to reimburse an amount of 174 million euros (including interest) for the years 2012 to 2018. The administration may appeal this decision within 30 days of the decision.\n\nDisputes for years 2003-2011 and 2019-2021 remain open to date and follow specific procedures.",

The Company provides its B2C and B2B customers and other telecommunication operators with a wide range of services, including fixed telephony and  mobile  communications,  data  transmission,  Internet  and multimedia and other value-added services.\n\nThe Company's purpose, as laid down in Article 2 of the Bylaws, is as follows: 'As a trusted partner, Orange gives everyone the keys to a responsible digital world'.\n\n## Note 2 Signi/ficant  events\n\n## 2.1 Pension  reform\n\nIn  France,  the  pension  reform  law,  gradually  raising  the  legal retirement age to 64, was enacted on April 14, 2023.\n\nThe effects of this reform have been recognized in the income statement as a plan amendment and break down as follows:\n\n- -an additional provision of (238) million euros was booked in exceptional income and expense on the French part-time for seniors plans signed in 2018 and 2021 (see Note 5.3.1 Employee benefits), which provided for the extension of the plans in the event of pension reform for the employees concerned;\n- -a  provision  reversal  of  22 million  euros  was  recognized in  exceptional  income  and  expense  on  capital-based  or annuity-based defined-benefit plans (see Note 5.3.1 Employee benefits).\n\n## 2.2 Simpli/fied merger of Orange Cara\u00efbe SA into Orange SA\n\nThe 2023 fiscal year was marked by the simplified merger by absorption of Orange Cara\u00efbe SA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Orange SA.\n\n## Purpose of the merger\n\nThis merger is in line with measures to simplify and streamline the Group's legal structures in order to unite the teams, simplify organizations and strengthen Orange's commercial position with customers in French Guiana as a multi-services operator.\n\n## Designation and effect of the transaction\n\nAs this is an internal restructuring, and in accordance with ANC Regulation No. 2014-03 of June 5, 2014 as amended by Regulation No. 2017-01 of May 5, 2017 relating to the French General Chart of Accounts (Title VII - Recognition and measurement of mergers and similar transactions), the assets and liabilities of Orange Cara\u00efbe SA have been recorded in Orange SA's financial statements at their net carrying value.\n\nOrange SA is governed by French law on public limited companies (soci\u00e9t\u00e9s  anonymes),  subject  to  specific  laws  governing  the Company, particularly French Law No. 90-568 of July 2, 1990 relating to the organization of public postal and telecommunication services, and Government Order No. 2014-948 of August 20, 2014 on the governance and capital transactions of publicly held companies. Orange SA is also regulated by its Bylaws.\n\nThe activities of the Company are governed primarily by European Union  directives  and  by  the  French  Postal  and  Electronic Communications  Code  (Code  fran\u00e7ais  des  postes  et  des communications \u00e9lectroniques).\n\nOrange SA has been listed since 1997 on Euronext Paris (symbol: ORA) and on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: ORAN).\n\nThis merger is subject to the simplified merger regime regulated by Article L. 236-11 of the French Commercial Code, and came into legal effect on October 1, 2023. Pursuant to the option provided by Article L. 236-4 of the French Commercial Code, it was decided that the merger would be carried out with retroactive accounting and tax effect to January 1, 2023.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the assets of Orange Cara\u00efbe SA were valued at 185 million euros and its liabilities at 128 million euros, resulting in contributed net assets of 57 million euros. At this date, Orange Cara\u00efbe SA had no regulated provisions in its financial statements.\n\nAs Orange SA holds all the shares making up the share capital of Orange Cara\u00efbe SA, and no capital increase was carried out to compensate for the contribution, no merger premium was recorded.\n\nThe difference between the net assets contributed by Orange Cara\u00efbe SA, calculated on the basis of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the net carrying value in Orange SA's financial statements of all the shares held in the share capital of Orange Cara\u00efbe SA (i.e. 119 million euros) constitutes in this case a merger loss of (62) million euros recognized in finance costs, net (see Note 3.4 Finance costs, net).\n\n## 2.3 Business reorganization operations\n\nOrange Business has presented the operational implementation of its strategic priorities for the Enterprise business segment within the framework of the strategic plan, Lead the future. This plan carries a strong ambition to transform and simplify the Enterprise business, whose market is undergoing profound changes. Orange SA has embarked on a transformation program that includes discontinuing the marketing of some offers and services and the implementation of a voluntary departure plans (elimination of around 650 positions in France), for which discussions with employee representative bodies were in progress as of December 31, 2023. In this context, a restructuring provision of (132) million euros was recognized at December 31, 2023, corresponding to the best estimate to date of the costs of this plan (see Note 3.5 Exceptional income and expense).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

This amount mainly comprises an income tax expense of (175) million euros and income from tax consolidation of 91 million euros accruing to Orange SA, the parent company of the tax consolidation group, and tax credits in the amount of 59 million euros.\n\nOrange SA has opted for Group tax consolidation relief with various subsidiaries. At December 31, 2023, the tax consolidation group comprised 54 companies (56 companies at December 31, 2022).\n\nThe  Company's  net  future  tax  relief  reflects  an  amount  of approximately 217 million euros at December 31, 2023, (253 million euros at December 31, 2022), which is primarily linked to the provision for employee benefit obligations. This relief will mainly be applied over the period from 2024 to 2032.\n\n## Developments in tax disputes and audits\n\n## Tax audits\n\nOrange SA was the subject of several tax audits for the years 20172018 and 2019-2020, for which the tax adjustments notified to date total approximately 535 million euros (including default penalties and interest). These adjustments mainly relate to the calculation of VAT on digital offerings, tax on electronic communication services on these same digital offerings, research tax credit, tax on television services, a portion of brand royalties paid by Orange SA to the UK\n\ncompany Orange Brand Services Ltd for reasons similar to the tax adjustments notified during the previous audits, as well as the inclusion in the tax base of income from the sale of equipment in 2019 and 2020, and the reassessment of previous tax loss carryforwards used for fiscal years 2017 and 2018.\n\nAll of these adjustments are being challenged by Orange SA. In  accordance  with  its  accounting  policies,  the  Group  makes a best estimate of the risk of these adjustments based on the technical merits of the positions defended, for which the effects are non-material.\n\nOrange SA was subject to a tax audit covering fiscal years 2015 and 2016. A tax adjustment was issued in 2019 covering the calculation of brand royalties paid by Orange SA to the UK company Orange Brand Services Ltd and deducted from its taxable income.

It includes, in particular, the  activities  in  Spain  (excluding  passive  infrastructure management), Romania, Slovakia and Belgium (78% owned);\n- -the value in use of the Orange Participations (OPA) securities consists of the share of values in use of its directly and indirectly held operating subsidiaries, plus the net cash held by OPA and its intermediate holding companies. It mainly includes activities carried out in the Africa & Middle East region, grouped within the Orange Africa & Middle East (OMEA) intermediary holding company, banking activities in France and activities in the Public Initiative Networks (through the Orange Concessions securities held);\n- -the value in use of the Orange Polska securities comprises Orange SA's share (50.7%) in the enterprise value of Poland, less the net debt of the Orange Polska group;\n- -the value in use of the Orange Brand Services Limited (OBSL) securities consists of the value in use of the Orange brand, plus the net cash held by OBSL;\n- -the value in use of the Orange Business Services SA (OBS SA) securities consists of the share of the values in use of its directly and indirectly held operating subsidiaries, plus the net cash held by OBS SA and its intermediate holding companies.

The initial ratio of 300 shares to one TDIRA has been adjusted several times to protect bondholders' rights and may be further adjusted under the terms and conditions set out in the prospectus.\n\nSince January 1, 2010, the interest rate on the TDIRAs has been the three-month Euribor 2.5%.\n\nAccrued interest is recognized in income and accrued interest not yet due is included on the liabilities side of the balance sheet outside the heading 'Other shareholders' equity.'\n\n## 5.3 Provisions\n\n| (in millions of euros)             | Employee benefits and similar        | Employee benefits and similar   | Dismantling             | Provisions          | Other      | Total                         |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                    | Post-employment  benefits Note 5.3.1 | benefits Note 5.3.1 Long-term   | and restoring  of sites | for litigation  (1) | provisions | provisions for  contingencies |\n| Provision in the opening balance   | 595                                  | 2,316                           | 286                     | 312                 | 626        | 4,135                         |\n| Allocations  (2)                   | 106                                  | 616                             | -                       | 18                  | 197        | 937                           |\n| Reversals  (2)                     | (49)                                 | (512)                           | (12)                    | (127)               | (167)      | (867)                         |\n| Reversals - used                   | (30)                                 | (512)                           | (12)                    | (2)                 | (115)      | (671)                         |\n| Reversals - unused                 | (19)                                 | -                               | -                       | (125)               | (53)       | (197)                         |\n| Discounting and other effects  (3) | 28                                   | 54                              | (44)                    | 2                   | (0)        | 40                            |\n| Provision in the closing balance   | 680                                  | 2,473                           | 231                     | 205                 | 656        | 4,245                         |\n\n- (1) See the detail in Note 7 Litigation.\n- (2) Including 9 million euros for provisions relating to the free share award plans, offset by a charge to labor expenses (see Note 5.3.2 Share-based compensation).\n- (3) Including (58) million euros for dismantling provisions offset by the recognition of a dismantling asset (see Note 10.1.14 Provisions pour contingencies) and 14 million euros related to the net effect of the merger with Orange Cara\u00efbe.\n\nThe impact of changes in provisions on the income statement for the fiscal year breaks down as follows:\n\n| (in millions of euros)            | Operating  income   | Financial  income   | Exceptional  income   | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------|\n| Increases (including discounting) | (184)               | (93)                | (726)                 | (1,003) |\n| Reversals                         | 236                 | 1                   | 621                   | 859     |\n| Balance at December 31, 2023      | 52                  | (92)                | (104)                 | (145)   |\n\n## 5.3.1 Employee  benefits\n\n## Types of post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits\n\nIn accordance with French laws and practices, Orange SA has obligations relating to employee benefits:\n\n- -with regard to retirement, employees are covered by defined contribution plans required by law.

The CET allows for a reduction in the amount of time worked.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the number of employees who are current beneficiaries of the French part-time for seniors plans, and therefore included in the provision, was approximately 9,150.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the provision for French part-time for seniors plans was 1,678 million euros (versus 1,726 million euros at December 31, 2022).\n\n## Key assumptions used to calculate obligations\n\nThe assessment of post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits is based on retirement age, calculated in accordance with the provisions applicable to each plan and the necessary conditions to ensure entitlement to a full pension, both of which are often subject to legislative changes.\n\nThe valuation of the obligation of the French part-time for seniors plans is sensitive to estimates of the potentially eligible population and to the sign-up rate for the plans (estimated at 70% on average), and the trade-offs that the beneficiaries will ultimately make between the different plans proposed. At December 31, 2023, with sign-ups to the 2018 and 2021 French part-time for seniors plans (TPS) no longer possible, the sensitivity to the sign-up rate was not presented.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used to measure Orange SA's obligation in respect of retirement and other long-term employee benefits are as follows:\n\n|                                                 | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Discount rate  (1)                              | 3.20% to 4.15%      | 3.40% to 3.85%      |\n| Average expected long-term increase in salaries | 1.4% to 2.7%  (1)   | 1.2% to 2.20%       |\n| Long-term inflation rate                        | 2%                  | 2%                  |\n\n- (1) Rates of 3.45% and 3.20%, respectively, were used to value commitments relating to the 2018 and 2021 French part-time for seniors plans (compared with 3.40% and 3.55% at December 31, 2022).\n\nThe discount rates are based on AA-rated corporate bonds with the same maturity as the obligation.\n\nThe main capital-based defined-benefit plan (retirement bonuses for employees under private-law contracts in France) is sensitive to employment policy assumptions (Orange has historically had high numbers of employees of retirement age), salary revaluation and long-term inflation of 2%.\n\nThe impacts on pension benefit obligations of changes in key assumptions would be as follows:\n\n(in millions of euros)\n\nDiscount rate\n\n(48)\n\n50\n\nIf the rate decreases 50 points If the rate increases 50 points\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  performance condition is assessed at the end of the three-year plan against the targets set by the Board of Directors;\n\n- -the  Total  Shareholder  Return  (TSR)  external  performance condition. The TSR performance is assessed by comparing the  change  in  the  Orange  TSR  based  on  the  relative performance of the total return for Orange shareholders over the three fiscal years and the change in the TSR calculated on the average values of the benchmark index, Stoxx Europe 600 Telecommunications, or any other index having the same purpose and replacing it during the term of the plan.\n\nRights subject to the achievement of performance conditions (as a % of the total entitlement)\n\n|                                           | LTIP 2023-2025   | LTIP 2022-2024   | LTIP 2021-2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Organic cash flow from telecom activities | 40%              | 50%              | 50%              |\n| Total Shareholder Return (TSR)            | 30%              | 30%              | 30%              |\n| Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)     | 30%              | 20%              | 20%              |\n\nAll performance conditions are estimated to be met at the end of the three years of the plan.",

This sustainable refinancing illustrates the Group's environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments, with an indexation of the margin to the achievement of objectives relating to CO 2 emissions (scopes 1 & 2, scope 3), in line with Orange's goal of being Net Zero Carbon by 2040, and to gender diversify its workforce. This new\n\nfacility, initially maturing in November 2027, includes two options to extend for one more year each, exercisable by Orange and subject to the banks' approval. In October 2023, Orange exercised the first option enabling the initial maturity to be extended with the agreement of the lenders as follows: 5,872 million euros maturing in November 2028 and 128 million euros retaining the initial maturity of November 2027.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Orange SA's liquidity position exceeded the repayments of gross financial debt scheduled in 2024.",

It is not a substitute for an analysis carried out by investors. Rating agencies regularly review the ratings they award. Any change in the rating could affect the cost of future financing or access to liquidity.\n\nIn addition, a change in Orange's credit rating will, for certain outstanding financing, affect the remuneration paid to investors:\n\n- -one Orange SA bond with an outstanding amount of 2.5 billion dollars maturing in 2031 (equivalent to 2.227 billion euros at December 31, 2023) is subject to a Step-up clause in the event that Orange's credit rating changes. This clause was triggered in 2013 and early 2014: the coupon due in March 2014 was thus calculated on the basis of an interest rate of 8.75%,and since then, the bond has been bearing interest of 9%;\n- -the margin of the 6 billion euro syndicated credit facility signed on  November 23,  2022  is  subject  to  change  depending on  whether  Orange's  credit  rating  is  raised  or  lowered. At December 31, 2023, this credit facility was undrawn.\n\nOrange's credit rating was unchanged at December 31, 2023. The outlook changed during 2023, from stable to positive, for Moody's Investors Service (Moody's).\n\n|                 | Standard & Poor's   | Moody's   | Fitch Ratings   |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Long-term debt  | BBB+                | Baa1      | BBB+            |\n| Outlook         | Stable              | Positive  | Stable          |\n| Short-term debt | A2                  | P2        | F2              |\n\n## 5.5.4 Financial  covenants\n\n## Commitments with regard to financial ratios\n\nOrange SA does not have any credit line or loan subject to specific covenant with regard to financial ratios.\n\n## Commitments related to instances of default or material adverse changes\n\nMost of Orange SA's financing agreements, notably including the 6 billion euros syndicated credit facility set up on November 23, 2022, as well as bonds, are not subject to early redemption obligations in the event of a material adverse change or cross default provisions. However, most of these agreements include cross acceleration provisions. Thus, the mere occurrence of events of default in other financing agreements would not automatically trigger accelerated repayment under the aforementioned agreements.\n\n## 5.5.5 Credit risk and counterparty risk management\n\nOrange SA could be exposed to counterparty risk in respect of its trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, investments and derivatives.\n\nOrange SA considers that it has limited counterparty risk with respect to trade receivables due to its large and diverse customer base (residential, professional and large business customers) operating in numerous industries and located in many French regions and foreign countries. The maximum value of the counterparty risk on these financial assets is equal to their recognized net carrying value.\n\nOrange SA is exposed to counterparty risk through its investments and derivatives. Therefore, it performs a strict selection of public, financial or industrial institutions in which it invests or with which it enters into derivatives agreements. This selection takes particular note of the institutions' credit ratings. Therefore:\n\n- -for each non-banking counterparty selected for investments, limits  are  set,  based  on  the  ratings  and  maturities  of  the investments;\n- -for each bank counterparty selected for investments and for derivatives, limits are based on equity, rating, CDS (credit default swaps, an accurate indicator of potential default risk) as well as on periodic analyses carried out by the Treasury Department;\n- -theoretical limits and consumption limits are monitored and reported on a daily basis to the Group treasurer and the head of the trading room. These limits are adjusted regularly depending on credit events.\n\nFor derivatives, master agreements relating to financial instruments (French Banking Federation) are signed with all counterparties and provide for the netting of payables and receivables, in case of failure of one of the parties, as well as the calculation of a final balance to be received or paid. These agreements include a CSA (Credit Support Annex) cash collateral clause that can lead to either a deposit (collateral paid) or collection (collateral received), on a daily basis. These payment amounts correspond to the change in the market value of all derivatives.\n\nAs a rule, investments are negotiated with high-grade banks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

In the vast majority of cases, these hedges are subject to mirror transactions in the subsidiaries for which they are set up, with Orange SA not bearing any residual interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk.\n\n| (in millions of euros)                  | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                         | Notional  amount    | Fair value          | Notional  amount    | Fair value          |\n| Off-balance sheet financial instruments |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Interest rate swaps                     | 3,050               | 56                  | 1,581               | 65                  |\n| Cross currency swaps                    | 8,140               | 559                 | 7,038               | 777                 |\n| Forward currency contracts              | 2,473               | (3)                 | 1,530               | 28                  |\n| Total firm commitments                  | 13,663              | 612                 | 10,149              | 870                 |\n| Options                                 | 91                  | (0)                 | 69                  | (1)                 |\n| Total contingent commitments            | 91                  | (0)                 | 69                  | (1)                 |\n| Total                                   | 13,754              | 612                 | 10,218              | 869                 |\n\n## 5.6 Other  liabilities\n\n| (in millions of euros)                         | December 31,  2023   | December 31,  2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Subsidiaries' cash current accounts            | 4,787                | 5,753                |\n| of which Atlas Services Belgium  (1)           | 676                  | 2,030                |\n| of which Equant                                | 982                  | 958                  |\n| of which FTIMMO H                              | 272                  | 263                  |\n| of which Orange Espagne                        | 269                  | 241                  |\n| of which Orange Brand Services Limited         | 186                  | 162                  |\n| of which Totem France                          | 287                  | 205                  |\n| of which Orange Participations                 | 685                  | 521                  |\n| of which Orange Africa & Middle East  (2)      | -                    | 98                   |\n| Tax and social security liabilities            | 1,422                | 1,379                |\n| Payables to submarine cable consortium members | 272                  | 230                  |\n| Other                                          | 323                  | 398                  |\n| Total                                          | 6,804                | 7,760                |\n\n## 5.7 Deferred  income\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                             | December 31,  2023   | December 31,  2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Deferred financial income                                          | 721                  | 769                  |\n| of which instruments eligible for hedge accounting                 | 326                  | 326                  |\n| of which balances received upon unwinding of derivatives           |                      |                      |\n| and spread until maturity of the hedged underlying                 | 372                  | 413                  |\n| Deferred operating income                                          | 684                  | 733                  |\n| of which B2C subscriptions                                         | 210                  | 212                  |\n| of which the spreading over 20 years of the invoicing              |                      |                      |\n| for civil works services as part of the cable network contribution | 14                   | 25                   |\n| Total                                                              | 1,405                | 1,502                |\n\n## 5.8 Maturity of non-/financial receivables and payables\n\nAt December 31, 2023, non-financial receivables and payables were due within one year, with the main exception of telecom license payables of 589 million euros (see Note 3.1.1 Intangible assets).",

These commitments will require capital expenditure in future years to roll out and enhance the networks. They are not shown in the table above since they are not expressed in monetary terms:\n\n- -Orange  and  the  French  government  announced  on November 7, 2023 that they had reached a new agreement on the widespread roll-out of fiber optic by 2025. In the AMII (Appel \u00e0 manifestation d'int\u00e9r\u00eat - call for expression of investment interest) zone, this new roll-out commitment will replace the 2022 milestone of the L. 33-13 commitments (i.e. the second milestone of the commitments made in 2018). This proposal is based on the following elements:\n- -by 2025, 1,120,000 premises in the entire AMII zone will be  made  connectable  (which  would  represent  98.5% of connectable premises, including cases of blockage/ refusal),\n- -by  2024,  140,000 premises  within  the  perimeter  of 55 inter-municipality cooperation zones with the lowest FTTH coverage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Subsequent to an opinion from Arcep, these  proposals  were  accepted  by  the  government  in July 2018,\n- -outside  of  the  AMII  area,  Orange  proposed  that  it make roll-out commitments as part of AMEL (Appel \u00e0 manifestation  d'engagements  locaux  -  Call  for  Local Commitments) procedures in the Vienne, Haute-Vienne, Deux-S\u00e8vres and Lot-et-Garonne departments;\n- -on January 14, 2018, the Orange group and the other French mobile  operators  signed  an  agreement  (the  'New  Deal') to ensure better mobile coverage of the French mainland and particularly rural areas. This agreement includes enhanced coverage obligations, which are included for the 2018-2021 period in our existing licenses in the 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and\n\n2,100 MHz bands, and for the post-2021 period in the new 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz licenses awarded on November 15, 2018:\n\n- -targeted programs for the improvement of coverage, with the coverage of 5,000 areas per operator by 2029,\n- -the widespread roll-out of 4G by the end of 2020 on almost all existing mobile sites,\n- -acceleration  of  the  coverage  of  transportation  routes, ensuring  that  the  main  roads  and  railways  have  4G coverage,\n- -the supply of a fixed 4G service and the extension of the service to 500 additional sites upon request from the government by 2020,\n- -the widespread provision of telephone coverage indoors, proposing voice over Wi-Fi, SMS over Wi-Fi offers and on-demand  offers  involving  the  indoor  coverage  of buildings,\n- -improved  reception  quality  across  France,  particularly in rural areas, with good coverage (according to Arcep Decision No. 2016-1678 relating to publications providing information on mobile coverage) by 2024-2027;\n- -in 2015, in France, when the spectrum in the 700 MHz band was allocated, Orange took:\n- -coverage obligations in 'priority roll-out areas' (40% of the country within 5 years, 92% within 12 years and 97.7% within 15 years) and in 'dead zone' not yet covered by a broadband network (100% within 12 years), at the level of priority main roads (100% within 15 years) and at the level of the national rail network (60% within 7 years, 80% within 12 years and 90% within 15 years);\n- -in 2011, in France, when the spectrum in the 2.6 GHz and 800 MHz bands was allocated, Orange took:\n- -an optional commitment to host Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) on certain technical and pricing terms under Full MVNO schemes,\n- -a coverage obligation for mobile access with theoretical maximum download speeds of at least 60 Mbits/s per user (25% of the country within 4 years and 75% within 12 years for the 2.6 GHz band; 98% of the country within 12 years and 99.6% within 15 years for the 800 MHz band) which can be met by using both the allocated spectrum and other spectrum,\n- -for the 800 MHz band, specifically, a coverage obligation in priority areas (40% of the country within 5 years, 90% within 10 years) with no obligation to provide roaming services, a coverage obligation in each department (90% within 12 years, 95% within 15 years), and an obligation to pool resources in communities covered by the 'dead zone' program.\n\nNon-compliance with these obligations could result in fines and other sanctions, ultimately including the withdrawal of licenses awarded. Management believes that Orange SA is able to fulfill these commitments to the government authorities.\n\n## Guarantees granted to third parties in the ordinary course of business\n\nAs the parent company of the Orange group, Orange SA grants guarantees  to  third  parties  in  order  to  cover  the  contractual obligations of its direct or indirect subsidiaries. These guarantees totaled 1,053 million euros at December 31, 2023.\n\nAs part of the roll-out of the high-speed and very high-speed broadband network in France, the Group has entered into contracts via Public Initiative Networks (mainly public service delegation contracts  and  public-private  partnership  contracts  as  well  as public design, construction, operation and maintenance contracts), under the terms of which Orange SA has counter-guaranteed, for an overall amount of 190 million euros at December 31, 2023, a portion of the commitments made by its subsidiaries to the public",

        "page_content": "authorities, particularly regarding guarantees of performance and restoration of infrastructure.\n\nThese commitments include the performance guarantees granted to certain customers of the Enterprise Division subsidiaries, for an amount of 468 million euros.\n\nOrange SA provides certain guarantees to third parties (financial institutions,  customers,  partners  and  government  agencies) to ensure the fulfillment of its contractual obligations in the ordinary course of its business. These guarantees are not shown in the table above, as they do not increase the amount of its commitments.\n\n## 6.2 Other  commitments\n\n## Warranties given on disposals\n\nUnder the disposal agreements for certain assets, subsidiaries or equity investments entered into by its subsidiaries, the Company guarantees that those subsidiaries will fulfill their obligations under the asset and liability warranties they have granted. Nearly all material disposal agreements provide for caps on these warranties.\n\n## Note 7 Litigation\n\nThis note presents all of the significant litigation in which Orange SA is involved with the exception of litigation relating to disputes between Orange SA and the tax or social security administrations over tax, income taxes or social security contributions. These disputes are described, respectively, in Note 3.6 Income taxes and Note 5.3 Provisions.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the provisions recognized by Orange SA for all litigation in which it is involved (other than those in Note 3.6 Income taxes and Note 5.3 Provisions) amounted to 205 million euros, compared with 312 million euros at December 31, 2022. Orange SA believes that any disclosure of the amount of provisions on a case-by-case basis for ongoing disputes could seriously harm the Group's position. The balance and overall movements in provisions are presented in Note 5.3 Provisions.\n\n## Litigation related to competition law\n\n## Mobile services\n\n- -As part of the compensation proceedings between Digicel and Orange (implementation of anti-competitive practices on the mobile and fixed-to-mobile markets in the French Caribbean and French Guiana in the early 2000s and sanctioned by the French Competition Authority in 2009), the Commercial Court of Paris ordered Orange to pay Digicel 346 million euros after interest discounting. In June 2020, the Paris Court of Appeal reversed the discounting method applied to the damages set forth in the judgment rendered by the Commercial Court of Paris in December 2017 and ordered Orange to pay Digicel the sum of 249 million euros. Following this judgment, Orange was refunded 97 million euros. In March 2023, the Supreme Court partially quashed and annulled the Paris Court of Appeal's ruling of June 17, 2020 on the specific point of the progressive nature of the basis on which interest is applied to compensate for the cash flow loss associated with the discounting of the principal loss. Orange referred the case to the Court of Appeal in March 2023. The proceedings are ongoing.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the main warranties in place were standard warranties granted to buyers of real estate sold by the Group.\n\nThe warranty given to BT as part of the EE sale, backed 50/50 by the Orange group and Deutsche Telekom as tax and fundamental warranties, except for events ascribable solely to one or the other, and capped at the contractually set price of disposal of 5.1 billion pounds sterling (5.8 billion euros converted at the exchange rate at December 31, 2022) for Orange's share, which expired in 2023. As a result, there are no longer any current warranties relating to this transaction.\n\nThe Company believes that the risk of all these warranties being enforced is remote and that the potential consequences of their being enforced are not material with respect to Orange SA's results and financial position.\n\n## 6.3 Financing  commitments\n\nOrange SA's main commitments relating to financial payables are set out in Note 5.4 Financial liabilities and Note 5.5 Exposure to market risks.\n\n## Fixed services\n\n- -Following the final decision of the French Competition Authority to fine Orange 350 million euros for having implemented four anti-competitive practices in the 'enterprise' market segment on December 17, 2015, several players, including Adista, filed actions for damages against Orange. The proceedings before the Paris Commercial Court between Adista and Orange, which are now the only ones in progress in this case, are ongoing and are currently in the deliberation phase.\n- -In the dispute between Orange and SFR over fixed telephony retail offers for secondary residences, in September 2021 the Court of Appeal ordered SFR to return the sums awarded to it (i.e.  53 million euros). SFR has filed another appeal with the Supreme Court. In a ruling dated October 18, 2023, the Supreme Court dismissed SFR's appeal in its entirety. The case is now closed.\n- -In the dispute between Bouygues Telecom and Orange before the Commercial Court of Paris regarding the quality of service of Orange's wholesale offers on the copper local loop, Bouygues Telecom is seeking damages estimated at 85 million euros. Orange considers these claims to be unfounded.\n- -In December 2023, Iliad brought an action against Orange before the Commercial Court of Paris regarding the quality of service of Orange's wholesale offers on the copper local loop. Iliad is claiming 49 million euros. Orange considers these claims to be unfounded.\n- -On February 24, 2023, Bouygues Telecom and the SDAIF (soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de d\u00e9veloppement pour l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'infrastructure fibre development company for access to fiber infrastructure) brought an action against Orange before the Commercial Court of Paris regarding mechanism for returning FTTH connections, which allows commercial telecom operators with access to Orange's fiber network to connect their end-customers themselves, and have part of the cost of this connection returned to them when the line is taken over by a new commercial operator. Bouygues Telecom and SDAIF maintain that the mechanism put in place by Orange does not comply with the regulations and are claiming 125 million euros, revalued at the end of January 2024 at 152 million euros, corresponding, according to them, to the refunds due in respect of terminations of FTTH lines since the beginning of the contract. Orange considers these claims to be unfounded.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

        "page_content": "3 -\n\n## Other proceedings\n\n- -In  June 2018,  Iliad  filed  for  summary  judgment  against Orange SA before the presiding judge of the Commercial Court of Paris, aiming to ban some of its mobile telephony offers proposing mobile handsets at attractive prices accompanied by subscription packages, on the grounds that they constituted consumer credit offers. In October 2020, Iliad had estimated its losses at 790 million euros, which it has since revalued at 810 million euros. The case is currently before the judges deciding on the merits of the case.\n- -In  the  dispute  between  ASSIA  and  Orange  regarding  an alleged infringement of two patents relating to the dynamic xDSL  line  management,  for  which  ASSIA  was  claiming  a provision of 500 million euros in damages as compensation for its financial loss, which it estimated at 1,418 million euros, the Paris Judicial Court dismissed ASSIA's claims in their entirety in September 2023. ASSIA has 3 months from the date of service of the judgment to lodge an appeal. The proceedings are ongoing.\n\nIn order to provide its telecommunication services, Orange SA sometimes uses the fixed assets of other parties, the terms of use of which are not always formalized. The Company is sometimes subject to claims and might be subject to future claims in this respect, which could result in a cash outflow in the future. The amount of the potential obligations or future commitments cannot be measured with sufficient reliability due to the legal complexities involved.\n\nOther than proceedings that may be initiated in respect of disputes between Orange SA and the tax or social security authorities over tax, income taxes (see Note 3.6 Income taxes) and social security contributions, there are no other administrative, legal or arbitration proceedings, including any proceedings that are ongoing, pending, or threatened, of which Orange is aware, which may have or have had in the last 12 months a material impact on the Company's and/ or Group's financial position or profitability.\n\n- -On November 7, 2023, Arcep fined Orange SA 26 million euros for failing to comply by April 14, 2021 with its commitment made in 2018 on the basis of Article L. 33-13 of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code to make 100% of homes and professional premises in the communes listed in its commitment connectable or connectable on demand to fiber optic. The penalty has been enforced, but Orange has also filed a complaint with the French Council of State to challenge the legitimacy and proportionality of the penalty.\n\n## Note 8 Transactions with companies and related parties\n\nThe main related-party transactions with associates are carried out in the ordinary course of business and are entered into through arm's length transactions.\n\nThe  additional  related-party  transactions  cover  the  main transactions carried out in the ordinary course of business with companies that belong to the Group and that are not wholly owned (directly or indirectly) by Orange SA and companies in which the\n\n## Note 9 Subsequent  events\n\n## Completion of the acquisition of OCS and Orange Studio by Canal+ Group\n\nOrange and the Canal+ Group have announced on January 9, 2023 the signature of a memorandum of agreement for the acquisition by the Canal+ Group of all the shares held by Orange in the OCS pay TV package and in Orange Studio, the film and series co-production subsidiary. The Canal+ Group will become the sole shareholder of both companies following this transaction.\n\nChairman of Orange SA's Board of Directors is a member of the Board of Directors, Supervisory Board or Executive Committee.\n\nTelecommunication  services  provided  to  French  governmental authorities, which are among Orange SA's largest customers, as well as to its various local and regional authorities, are provided on an arm's length basis.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, the French Competition Authority authorized the transaction subject to commitments made by the Canal+ group.\n\nOn January 31, 2024, Orange and the Canal+ group finalized this transaction. Following the deal, the Canal+ Group becomes the sole shareholder of both companies.\n\nAs part of this transaction, Orange SA has granted Canal+ standard and specific guarantees.\n\n## Note 10   Accounting policies for preparing the /financial statements\n\nThe  Statutory  Financial  Statements  of  Orange SA  have  been prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting principles in France and with the provisions of the French General Chart of Accounts.\n\n## 10.1 Accounting  policies\n\nThe financial statements were prepared in accordance with ANC Regulation No. 2014-03 of June 5, 2014, regarding the amended version of the French General Chart of Accounts.\n\nGeneral accounting practices were used in accordance with the French General Chart of Accounts, in line with the principle of prudence, and following the basic assumptions below:\n\n- -going  concern;\n- -independence of fiscal years;\n- -consistency of accounting methods from one fiscal year to the next.\n\nand in accordance with general rules for the preparation and presentation of statutory financial statements.\n\nThe historical cost method was adopted as the basic method of accounting.

        "page_content": "## 10.1.1 Transactions in foreign currencies\n\nSales in foreign currencies are recorded under revenues at the exchange rate on the day of sale. The effect of hedging is, where applicable, accounted for under the same heading as revenue.\n\nMonetary balances in foreign currencies are translated at the fiscal year-end exchange rate. Losses or gains arising on the translation of receivables and payables at the year-end rate are recognized in the balance sheet respectively as 'unrealized foreign exchange losses' on the assets side or 'unrealized foreign exchange gains' on the liabilities side.\n\nFor financial transactions, unrealized gains or losses on all balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions are determined by currency and by year of due date. For commercial transactions, unrealized gains or losses are determined by currency.\n\nA provision is recorded for any net unrealized exchange losses other than those underpinned by an underlying instrument that is part of a hedge of equity securities in foreign currencies.\n\nTranslation adjustments for operating payables and receivables (provisioned  or  realized)  are  entered  under  operating  income. Translation  adjustments  for  financial  payables  and  receivables (provisioned or realized) are entered under finance costs, net.\n\n## 10.1.2 Revenue  recognition\n\nThe main revenues from Orange SA's activities are recognized as follows:\n\n## Provision of equipment\n\nRevenues from the sale of handsets and accessories are recognized when delivered. Installation fees are recognized in revenues when the line is activated.\n\nEquipment lease revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## Service revenue\n\nRevenues from telephone and Internet access subscriptions are recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the service.\n\nRevenues from incoming and outgoing telephone communications are recognized when the service is provided.\n\nRevenues related to the use of leased lines and to medium-speed and broadband data transmission are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.\n\nRevenues related to the sale of transmission capacity on terrestrial and submarine cables are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.\n\nRevenues from Internet advertising are recognized over the period in which the advertising service is provided.\n\n## Separable components of a bundled offer and related offers\n\nMany service offers available on the Group's main markets comprise two components: an equipment component (e.g. a mobile handset) and a service component (e.g. a talk & text plan).\n\nHence, for bundled offers including a handset sold at a discounted price and telecommunication services, revenues recognized for the handset sale are limited to the amount of the arrangement that is not contingent upon the rendering of service provision, i.e. the amount paid by the customer for the handset: this amount is usually the amount paid on delivery, or the discounted amounts paid over a 12or 24-month period with respect to offers paid for in installments.\n\nWhere separable, revenues from equipment sales are recognized when the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer. The provision of an Internet box does not constitute either a separable component of the Internet access service offer nor a rental because Orange maintains control of the box and its usage.\n\n- 3\n\nFor certain commercial offers, revenues from connection to a service are recognized in full when billing the first connection, even if this service is not separately identifiable from the subscription and communications.\n\n## Sales of content\n\nRevenues from the sale of numbers with revenue and cost-sharing arrangements ('contact number' service) are recognized at their gross amount. Amounts due to providers of such services are recognized in operating expenses.\n\nRevenues  from  the  sale  or  supply  of  content  (audio,  video, games, etc.) through the various communication systems (mobile, PC, TV, fixed telephony, etc.) are recognized at their gross amount; payments  to  content  publishers  are  therefore  recognized  in operating expenses. When Orange SA is acting as agent in the sale or supply of content, the related transactions are recognized as on behalf of third parties, and only Orange SA's fees are recognized in net income.\n\n## Customer acquisition and loyalty program costs\n\nCustomer  acquisition  and  retention  costs,  other  than  loyalty program costs, are recognized in net income in the fiscal year in which they are incurred, that is, on acquisition or renewal.\n\nThe accounting treatment of rights to loyalty discounts granted to customers is defined by CNC Urgent Issues Committee Opinion 2004-E dated October 13, 2004. When the right to a benefit is granted, the Company undertakes to provide cash discounts or benefits in kind to its customers. The equivalent value in euros of loyalty discounts granted to customers is recognized under deferred income. It is estimated on the basis of assumptions on churn rates and utilization rates of the rights by subscribers and is deferred until such time as it is converted into revenues when a future sale is made. This principle is applied to Orange SA's existing PCM (Programme Changer de Mobile - Change Your Mobile) and PRT (Programme Renouvellement de Terminal - Handset Renewal Program) programs, under which customers can get a new mobile phone provided that they enter into a new contractual obligation.\n\n## Long-term contract\n\nFor  long-term  contracts,  as  defined  in  Article  622-1 of  the French  General  Chart  of  Accounts,  the  Company  used  the percentage-of-completion  method  of  revenue  recognition. The percentage of completion is determined according to the characteristics of each contract (measured by costs or technical milestones).\n\n## 10.1.3 Intangible  assets\n\nPursuant to ANC Regulation No. 2015-06 of November 23, 2015, at the start of the fiscal year on January 1, 2016, the technical losses recognized in the financial statements were allocated, transaction by transaction, to the underlying assets on which there were unrealized gains. The residual amount of losses not allocated to components of identified assets remains in commercial goodwill and is subject to impairment tests as described in Note 9.1.5 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nThus, intangible assets mainly include technical merger losses not allocated to identified assets, licenses, patents, usage rights, software and leasehold rights, as well as development costs.\n\n## Gross value\n\nIntangible assets are recognized at acquisition or production cost.\n\nThe acquisition cost of mobile network operating licenses consists of a fixed portion, which is capitalized, and a variable portion, which is expensed (equal to 1% of eligible revenues). The amortization period for the licenses begins as from the date on which the network is technically ready for effective marketing of the service and ends on the license expiration date, with the exception of the first block of spectrum under the UMTS license, for which the amortization period is effective as from the award date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

This cost includes the costs directly attributable to the transfer of the asset to its place of operation and its preparation for operation.\n\nTransfer taxes, fees or commissions and legal costs related to the acquisition are attached to the acquisition cost of the asset.\n\nThe  cost  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  also  includes  the estimated cost of dismantling and removing the fixed asset and restoring the site where it was located under the obligation incurred by Orange SA.\n\nThe cost of networks includes design and construction costs, as well as equipment and installation capacity improvement costs.\n\nMaintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, except where they serve to increase the asset's productivity or extend its useful life.\n\nThe roll-out of assets by stage, especially for network assets, does not generally require a substantial period of preparation. As a result, Orange SA does not generally capitalize the interest expense incurred during the construction and acquisition phase for its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Interest is entered under expenses in the fiscal year during which it is incurred, regardless of how the borrowed capital is used.\n\nPursuant to the component-based approach, the total cost of an asset is allocated among its different components and each component is accounted for separately when different components have different useful lives, or when the pattern in which their future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the entity varies, thereby requiring the use of different rates and methods of depreciation.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is depreciated on a basis that reflects the pattern in which the future economic benefits of each of their components are expected to be consumed according to their probable use.\n\nThe straight-line basis is usually applied over the following estimated useful lives:\n\nBuildings (including lightweight constructions),\n\nleasehold improvements and equipment\n\nInfrastructure (civil works, copper and optical\n\ncables, telephone poles, masts, mobile\n\nsite research and engineering costs)\n\n8\u00a0to 30\u00a0years\n\nEquipment (switching, transmission,\u00a0etc.)\n\nand fixed and mobile network installations,\n\nincluding inseparable underlying software\n\n5\u00a0to 20\u00a0years\n\nComputer hardware, handsets\n\n3\u00a0to 5\u00a0years\n\nOther property, plant and equipment\n\n3\u00a0to 10\u00a0years\n\n5\u00a0to 30\u00a0years\n\nLand and fixed assets in progress are not depreciated.\n\nThe depreciable amount of an asset corresponds to its gross value minus its residual value less disposal costs.\n\nOrange SA makes use of accelerated depreciation allowed under the tax regulations in force. The difference between accelerated depreciation  and  straight-line  depreciation  is  recorded  as  a regulated provision on the balance sheet.\n\n## 10.1.5 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized, on a case-by-case basis, when the fair value of an asset falls sustainably below its net carrying value due to events or circumstances arising during the period (such as obsolescence, wear and tear, significant changes to the manner in which the asset is used, worse than expected economic performance, a drop in revenues or other external indicators, revision of operating cash flows, etc.).\n\nThe fair value is the higher of market value and value in use.\n\nFor assets which are to be held and used, fair value is usually determined on the basis of value in use, which is the estimated present value of the future economic benefits expected to be derived from the use and disposal of the asset. For assets held for sale, fair value is determined on the basis of realizable value assessed by reference to market prices.\n\nIn addition, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including  the  commercial  goodwill  allocated  to  businesses  in France, are tested overall for impairment relating to all activities and sites in France.\n\nPotential reversal of impairment is examined at each closing date. Impairment on goodwill is definitive.\n\n## 10.1.6 Financial  assets\n\nEquity securities are recorded at historical purchase cost plus the share, if any, of the merger loss allocated to them pursuant to ANC Regulation No. 2015-06. Transaction costs are expensed in the income statement.\n\nTo determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized, the historical acquisition cost (including any share of merger losses allocated thereto) is compared with its present value.\n\nThe present value is equal to value in use for strategic interests. However, when an interest is due to be sold, it is measured at market value.\n\nThe value in use of equity securities is the estimated enterprise value of the component entities of those investments, less their net debt (or plus their net cash), as calculated in their currency and converted into euros at the year-end exchange rate.\n\nDue to the short-term volatility of market value and the strategic nature of its investments, Orange SA uses the discounted cash flow method to assess enterprise value (except for its banking activity). Cash flow projections are based on economic and regulatory assumptions, license renewal assumptions and operating forecasts drawn up by Orange SA's Management, as follows:",

This estimate is made on the basis of available market information, taking into account any specific circumstances.\n\nOther criteria, such as market value (assessed based on average share price over the last 20 trading days), growth and profitability outlook,  parent  company  equity,  and  proportionate  share  in the investment (on a historical basis) may be taken into account, separately or in addition to the value in use, when calculating the present value, according to the type of each investment.\n\n## Receivables related to equity investments\n\nReceivables  related  to  equity  investments  comprise  mediumor  long-term  loan  agreements  with  Group  companies.  They are  recognized  separately  from  current  accounts  with  Group subsidiaries, which are used for the daily management of their cash surpluses and requirements. Impairment is recognized according to the risk of non-recovery.\n\n## Cash collateral received\n\nOrange SA has negotiated cash collateral agreements with its main bank counterparties, which fluctuate according to the valuation of off-balance sheet transactions with these counterparties. The amount of this collateral is strongly correlated to movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.\n\nCollateral paid is recorded in financial assets and collateral received is recognized in other short-term borrowings.\n\n## 10.1.7 Inventories\n\nNetwork maintenance equipment and equipment intended for sale to customers are measured at the lower of cost and likely realizable net book value. The entry cost corresponds to the acquisition cost, which is determined by the weighted average cost method.\n\nWhen the likely realizable net book value is lower than the entry cost, a provision for impairment is recorded for the difference.\n\n## 10.1.8 Trade  receivables\n\nDue  to  its  broad  range  of  customers  (B2C  customers,  large companies, professionals and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs)), Orange SA does not consider itself to be exposed to a customer concentration risk. Impairment is recognized according to the risk of non-recovery of the receivables. It is calculated either on an individual basis or on a statistical assessment of the risk according to customer segment.\n\n## Assignment of receivables - deferred payment\n\nTrade receivables may include deferred payments over a maximum two-year period for mobile phone purchases. In 2018, Orange SA set up a program to assign these deferred payment receivables to a bank under a non-recourse factoring agreement. As the transfer of ownership was completed, the assigned receivables were no longer recognized on the balance sheet. This disposal is considered to be a straightforward disposal of receivables related to the company's ordinary activities. The difference between the notional value and the sale price of the assigned receivables is recorded in operating income.\n\n## 10.1.9 Marketable  securities\n\nMarketable securities are stated at acquisition cost. An impairment provision is recognized, where applicable, for each line of securities of the same nature, equal to the difference between their carrying value and the average stock market price during the previous month\n\n- 3\n\nor, in the case of unlisted securities, their probable trading value. However, in line with CRC Regulation No. 2008-15 of December 4, 2008, no impairment losses are recognized on marketable securities comprising shares purchased or held in respect of free share award plans: any loss arising from their removal from the balance sheet without a counterbalancing entry is accounted for by recognizing a provision (see Note 10.1.16 Other employee benefits).\n\n## 10.1.10 Other shareholders' equity\n\nWhen,  based  on  the  terms  of  the  issuance  contract  or  the economic conditions at the time of issuance, an interest-bearing financial instrument is not redeemable at the lender's option or is redeemable for equity instruments, it is recognized in Other shareholders' equity.\n\n## 10.1.11 Grants\n\nOrange SA  may  receive  non-repayable  grants,  presented  in shareholders' equity, under 'Grants,' in the form of direct or indirect funding from third parties for capital projects, mainly provided by local and regional authorities. They are recycled to profit or loss at the same rate and over the same period as the depreciation of the fixed assets financed.\n\n## 10.1.12 Bond issuance costs\n\nBond issuance costs are recorded in operating expenses in the fiscal year in which the bonds were issued. Share premiums are recognized in financial expenses over the term of the bond.\n\n## 10.1.13 Derivatives\n\nOrange SA manages the market risks related to changes in interest and exchange rates using financial instruments (derivatives), and particularly cross-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, caps,  floors,  futures  contracts  in  organized  markets,  forward currency contracts, currency swaps and currency options. These instruments are used for hedging purposes.\n\nIncome and expenses arising on these derivatives are recorded in the income statement on a symmetrical basis with the expenses and income on the hedged items:\n\n- -differences  in  interest  receivable  or  payable  on  interest rate  derivatives  and  any  premiums  or  discounts  on  these transactions are recorded in profit or loss on a symmetrical basis over the term of the hedged item;\n- -gains and losses arising on currency derivatives used to hedge balance sheet items are recorded as adjustments to the foreign exchange gain or loss of the hedged item; if the hedging instrument is unwound or matures before the hedged item, any associated gains or losses are retained on the balance sheet, as deferred income or prepaid expenses, until the transaction is unwound, and are then reclassified in profit or loss;\n- -gains and losses arising on derivatives designated as hedges of identifiable firm commitments or identifiable future transactions are deferred and recognized in the valuation of the transaction when it is unwound;\n- -some transactions which comply with Orange SA's hedging policy do not qualify for hedge accounting. In accordance with ANC Regulation No. 2015-05 of July 2, 2015 concerning forward financial instruments and hedging transactions, changes in the value of these transactions in open standalone positions appear on the balance sheet as counterparties to transitional accounts: on the asset side of the balance sheet with respect to changes related to unrealized losses and on the liabilities side with respect to changes related to unrealized gains;\n- -unrealized gains are not entered in the income statement;\n- -if  a  transaction  creates  an  unrealized  loss,  a  provision  is expensed in finance costs, net in the amount of that unrealized capital loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

It may also result from Orange SA's practices or from public commitments that have created a legitimate expectation on the part of the third parties concerned that Orange SA will assume certain responsibilities.\n\nThe amount of the provision corresponds to the amount of the outflow of resources that will probably be required for Orange SA to settle the obligation.\n\nWhen contingent liabilities are identified, they are reported in the notes to the financial statements. They correspond to:\n\n- -probable obligations arising from past events that are not recognized because their existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Company's control; or\n- -present obligations resulting from past events that are not recognized  because  it  is  not  probable  that  an  outflow  of resources  embodying  economic  benefits  without  at  least equivalent compensation will be required to settle the obligation or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\n## Litigation\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, Orange SA is involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings and administrative actions. The costs that may result from these proceedings are only accrued when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of that liability can be quantified or estimated within a reasonable range. The amount of provision recorded is based on a case-by-case assessment of the risk level, and events arising during the course of legal proceedings may require a reassessment of this risk at any time.\n\n## Dismantling and restoring sites\n\nOrange SA is required to dismantle technical equipment and restore the technical sites it occupies.\n\nWhen the obligation arises, a dismantling asset is recognized against a dismantling provision.\n\nThe provision is based on dismantling costs (on a per-unit basis for telephone booths and mobile antenna sites, or per metric ton for poles and fixed-line electrical and electronic equipment) incurred by Orange SA to meet its environmental commitments and annual estimated asset dismantling and site restoration obligations.\n\nThe provision is assessed on the basis of the identified costs for the current fiscal year, extrapolated for future years using the best estimate that will allow the obligation to be settled. It is discounted at a risk-free rate. This estimate is revised annually and adjusted where appropriate against the dismantling asset.\n\nIf the change in the estimate results in a reduction in the dismantling provision, the negative change is deducted from the cost of the dismantling asset by means of impairment. If the reduction of the provision is greater than the net carrying value of the dismantling asset, the underlying fixed asset is written down.\n\nWhen the obligation is settled, the provision is reversed against the net carrying value of the dismantling asset and the net carrying value of the underlying assets if the dismantling asset is less than the financial provision reversal.\n\nThe dismantling asset is depreciated over the forecast duration of the dismantling plan, which in theory is equal to the useful life\n\nof the asset concerned (e.g.: 28 years for poles), except for site restorations for which an assumption of the occupation period for leased sites is taken into account.\n\n## 10.1.15 Long-term employee benefit obligations\n\nEmployee benefits are offered through:\n\n- -defined-contribution plans: contributions are expensed in the fiscal year in which the employee service is rendered; or\n- -defined-benefit plans: the obligation is measured according to method 2 (b), in line with CNC Recommendation No. 2003R. 01 and ANC Recommendation No. 2013-02 as amended.\n\nIn accordance with this recommendation:\n\n- -the obligations are calculated on the basis of demographic assumptions  (employee  turnover  rate,  mortality, etc.)  and financial assumptions (rate of future salary increases, inflation rate, etc.) and are then discounted;\n- -discount rates are determined on a plan-by-plan basis by reference to market yields on high-quality long-term corporate bonds; they have been calculated based on external indices commonly used as a reference, and after analysis by Orange SA of their relevance, particularly in terms of their composition (the quality of the issuers);\n- -actuarial gains and losses on post-employment benefits are recorded in net income for the fiscal year;\n- -the past service cost recognized for the period is booked in net income for the fiscal year.\n\nOrange SA's defined-benefit plans are not generally funded. Only one plan is funded and as its assets are listed securities, their fair value was equal to their market value on the reporting date. The expected long-term return on these plan assets was determined on the basis of the discount rate used to measure the debt.\n\nEmployee benefits include post-employment benefits (essentially pension  obligations),  retirement  bonuses  and  other  long-term benefits.\n\n## Post-employment benefits\n\n## Pension plan for French civil servants\n\nCivil  servants  employed  by  Orange SA  are  covered  by  the government-sponsored civil and military pension plan. Orange SA's obligation under the plan is limited to the payment of annual contributions  (French  law  No. 96,660 dated  July 26,  1996). Consequently, Orange SA has no obligation to fund future deficits of the pension plan covering its own civil servant employees or any other civil service plans.\n\nThe civil servant pension plan is a defined-contribution plan.\n\n## Retirement bonuses and other similar bene/fits\n\nThe retirement bonuses paid by Orange SA to its employees, either as a lump sum or as an annuity, in an amount determined by their length of service and final salary at retirement age, can be considered as a defined-benefit plan.\n\n## Other post-employment bene/fits\n\nThe benefits Orange SA offers retired employees, such as handsets and coverage of certain healthcare costs, can be considered as a defined-benefit plan.\n\n## Other long-term benefits\n\nOther long-term benefits offered by Orange SA concern primarily long-term compensated absences and the French part-time for seniors plans.\n\nActuarial differences observed during the course of the fiscal year are immediately recognized in the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## 10.1.16 Other employee benefits\n\n## Stock option plans\n\nIn line with CRC Regulation No. 2008-15 of December 4, 2008, no expense is recognized in respect of stock-option plans that do not lead to an outflow of resources for Orange SA.\n\n## Free share award plans\n\nIn accordance with CRC Regulation No. 2008-15, where the award of free shares is conditional on the recipient's continued employment over a given period, the award results in the recognition in labor expenses of a provision recorded progressively over the qualifying period.\n\nThe amount of the provision relates to the cost of the shares on the date of their allocation to the plan (purchase price of the shares) or, for shares that have not yet been purchased, the probable cost of purchasing the shares measured on the reporting date (i.e. the Orange Share price at December 31).\n\n## Employee shareholding plans reserved for the employees of the Group's entities enrolled in the Group Savings Plan\n\nThese transactions are generally carried out through a disposal of existing shares which have been previously repurchased by Orange SA under its share Buyback program. The difference between  the  Orange SA  repurchase  price  and  the  sale  price to employees, notably due to the matching contribution and the discount provided for in the subscription price, is recorded as an expense under exceptional items in accordance with Article 945-50 of the French General Chart of Accounts (see Note 5.3.2 Share-based compensation).\n\n## 10.1.17 Trade  payables\n\nSupplier payment terms are mutually agreed between the suppliers and Orange in accordance with the regulations in force. However, some key suppliers and Orange SA have agreed to extend the payment term for the Company, which may be up to six months for some invoices.\n\n## 10.1.18 Tax  regime\n\nThe Company is at the head of a tax consolidation group under Articles 223A et seq. of the French General Tax Code (CGI). Income tax expenses are calculated and paid by the Company as if there was  no  tax  consolidation.  Tax  savings  or  add-ons  stemming from corrections made to overall taxable income are recognized as income or expenses at the level of the consolidating parent company, Orange SA.\n\n## 10.1.19 Consolidating company identification\n\nOrange SA,  whose  headquarters  are  located  at  111 Quai du  Pr\u00e9sident  Roosevelt  92130 Issy-les-Moulineaux  (SIREN 380,129,866), prepares the Consolidated Financial Statements of the largest group of which the Company is a part. A copy of the aforementioned Consolidated Financial Statements is available on  the  Group  website  (https://www.orange.com/en/latestconsolidated-results).\n\n## 10.2 Use of estimates\n\nIn preparing Orange SA's financial statements, Management makes estimates,  insofar  as  many  elements  included  in  the  financial statements cannot be measured precisely. Management revises these estimates if the underlying circumstances evolve or in light of new information or more experience. Consequently, the estimates made at December 31, 2023 may subsequently be changed. The assumptions on which the main estimates are based mainly relate to:\n\n- -provisions (see Notes 5.3.1 Employee benefits, 7 Litigation and 10.1.15 Long-term employee benefit obligations);\n\n- 3\n\n- -property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  (see Note 10.1.5 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets);\n- -equity securities (see Note 4.2 Financial assets);\n- -revenue recognition, where the exercise of judgment is needed to identify the components of a packaged offer or to analyze complex  contracts  which  may  have  an  effect  on  several accounting periods (see Note 10.1.2 Revenue recognition);\n- -off-balance sheet commitments for operating leases, where the exercise of judgment is necessary in particular to determine the  duration  of  the  commitment  (see  Note 6.  Contractual obligations and off-balance sheet commitments).\n\n## 10.3 Consideration of climate change risks\n\nNatural disasters and other accidental events related to climate change, such as fires, could lead to significant destruction of the Orange SA's facilities, resulting in both service interruptions and high repair costs. The frequency and intensity of weather events related to climate change (e.g. floods, storms and heat waves) continue to increase, which could aggravate claims and increase the related damage. In the medium term, rising sea levels could affect sites and facilities located near the coast more often. While coverage of claims by insurers could decrease further, the damage caused by major disasters could result in significant costs to Orange, some of which could be at the expense of the Company and thus affect its financial position and outlook.\n\nThe  Company  is  therefore  integrating  climate  change  risks more systematically into its activities. This can be seen in the assessment of these risks on the value of some of its assets through their depreciation schedule or as an event that could lead to the identification of an impairment loss indicator or on the future prospects of obtaining financing. Consideration of climate risks is also reflected in the Orange group's commitment to Net Zero Carbon by 2040. This commitment has led to changes in certain investment choices related to its activity.\n\nNumerous projects have been initiated within the Company in order to understand the impacts of climate change on its operations. The implementation of actions to limit the effects of the Company's activities on climate change is also underway. The outcome of these projects could lead the Company to review certain accounting treatments, judgments or estimates of financial risks, the impact of which is still difficult to assess reliably. Climate resilience and adaptation are fast-growing topics and will require the Company to better assess the risks to which it is exposed. The Company has begun a process of analysis in order to diagnose the exposure to climate risks of its various geographic locations based on the study  of  various  impact  scenarios  related  to  climate  change. At December 31, 2023, the Company had not identified any reliably estimated material impact on its financial statements at the stage of completion of the projects in progress.\n\n## 10.4 Changes in the macroeconomic environment\n\nThe judgment and estimates made by the Company also take into account the volatility of certain data linked to the complexity of the current macroeconomic context, and the Company has paid particular attention to:\n\n- -possible impacts on impairment testing, whether on changes in market data (discount rates, changes in inflation) or on the flows used;\n- -the consequences of changes in market data on the valuation of certain Company assets and liabilities;\n- -price volatility or the risk of supply difficulties in certain countries, particularly for electricity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

In particular, the latter does not include fixed and mobile communication services and other activities for businesses with more than 50 employees (see Section 1.4.1 Operating activities - France).\n\n## 3.4.2.1 Comments on the change in revenue\n\nOrange SA's revenue amounted to 22.3 billion euros in 2023, compared with 22.5 billion euros in 2022, i.e. a slight decrease of 0.7% (down 1.7% without the positive impact of the merger with Orange Cara\u00efbe).\n\n## Convergent services\n\nRevenue from convergent services increased by 2.8%, mainly due to the increase in ARPO. This growth in value was also accompanied by growth in volume.\n\n## Mobile-only services\n\nRevenue from mobile-only services grew by 7.9%, mainly reflecting the rise in ARPO and the increase in roaming with the growth in volumes of travelers.\n\n## Fixed-only services\n\nThe 3.1% decrease in revenues from fixed-only services is mostly linked to the continuing erosion of conventional telephony and Enterprise connectivity activities.\n\n## IT & integration services\n\nRevenue from IT & integration services decreased by 3.7%.\n\n## Services to carriers\n\nRevenue from wholesale services decreased by 8%, mainly due to the decline in revenues from unbundling on the copper network, reflecting customer migration to fixed very high-speed broadband (FTTH) and the decrease in network construction for resale, due to the progressive completion of several Public Initiative Networks.\n\n## Equipment sales\n\nRevenue from equipment sales rose by 17.3%, mainly due to the growing share of high-end handsets.\n\n## Other revenues\n\nOther revenues were down by 6.8%.\n\n## Operating indicators\n\n| Total at December 31                               | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| (quantitative data in thousands)                   |        |        |\n| Mobile services                                    |        |        |\n| Number of mobile accesses  (1)                     | 35,848 | 36,002 |\n| of which contract customers mobile accesses  (1)   | 34,878 | 34,629 |\n| of which prepaid customers mobile accesses         | 970    | 1,373  |\n| Fixed services                                     |        |        |\n| Number of fixed accesses managed by Orange SA  (1) | 27,871 | 29,428 |\n| of which fixed B2C accesses                        | 14,555 | 15,174 |\n| of which fixed B2B accesses                        | 1,002  | 1,140  |\n| of which fixed wholesale accesses                  | 12,315 | 13,114 |\n| Number of fixed broadband accesses                 | 12,542 | 12,669 |\n| Number of fixed narrowband accesses                | 3,014  | 3,645  |\n| Enterprise services                                |        |        |\n| Number of IP-VPN accesses in France                | 284    | 297    |\n\n- (1) Customers in the 'France' and 'Enterprise' business segments.\n\n## 3.4.2.2 Reintegration of overheads and extravagant expenses\n\nNo reintegration of overheads within the meaning of Article 223 quinquies of the French General Tax Code was carried out during fiscal year 2023.

These tests are performed at the level of each cash-generating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs, which generally corresponds to the operating segment, or to each country for the Africa and Middle East region and Europe. An impairment loss is recognized if the recoverable amount of the assets and liabilities of the CGU is lower than the carrying value.  To  the  exception  of  the  Belgium-Luxemburg  and Romania group of CGUs and CGU, for which the recoverable amounts are determined based on the fair value by reference to on-going transactions, the recoverable amount is determined by the Orange group and mostly corresponds to the value in use. The estimate of value in use is the present value of the future expected cash flows.\n\nThe determination of value in use requires numerous estimates and  judgements  from  the  management  as  described  in notes 2.5.2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the assessment of the competitive, political, economic and financial environment of the countries in which the Group operates, the ability to deliver the operating cash flows arising from business plans and discount and growth rates used in the calculation of recoverable amounts.\n\nIn the context of the current transformation of the Orange Business  segment's  business  model,  whose  market  is undergoing profound changes as described in Note 5.3, the determination of the recoverable amount of the Enterprises CGU (included in the Orange Business segment) is especially sensitive, as is the margin between these recoverable amounts and the carrying values tested, to the assumptions used by the management in terms of:\n\n- -future expected cash flows used in the business plans (and specifically, the revenue growth rate, the EBITDAaL margin rate);\n- -discount rate and perpetuity growth rate applied to future expected cash flows.\n\nWe therefore identified the evaluation of the goodwill for this CGU as a key audit matter.\n\nWe  have  obtained  an  understanding  of  the  procedure implemented by the Orange group for performing impairment tests  and  in  particular  estimating  the  cash  flows  used  to calculate the recoverable amount of the Enterprises CGU. For the aforementioned CGU, we evaluated the design and tested the effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Group's impairment test process, the determination of the cash flows, the estimation of the discount rate and perpetuity growth rate.\n\nTo assess the reliability of the data issued from the business plan used to determine the recoverable amount of this CGU, we have, with the assistance of our valuation professionals, in particular:\n\n- -compared the business plan projections established in 2023 with the business plans prepared in previous years;\n- -compared the business plans established in prior years with the actual results of the relevant financial years;\n- -inquired  of  the  financial  and  operational  managers  of the Orange group to gain an understanding of the main assumptions used in the business plans and compared them with the explanations obtained;\n- -analyzed the revenue growth rate, EBITDAaL margin rate underlying the forecasted cash flows, by the Orange group, by comparing them against the Group's peer companies' analyst reports and market research reports;\n- -reconciled the data used with the business plans presented to the Board of Directors.\n\nRegarding  the  model  used  to  determine  the  recoverable amount, we also involved our valuation specialists to analyse the methodologies used to determine the discount and perpetuity growth rates, compare those rates with available market data and recalculating these rates based on our own data sources. We have, in particular, verified the method used for determining and the consistency of the discount rate assumptions, based on the weighted average cost of capital per CGU, and the reasonableness of the risk-free rate and risk premium used by management by comparing them to underlying market data.\n\nFurthermore, we examined the sensitivity analyses carried out by the Orange Group and performed our own sensitivity analyses on key assumptions (forecasted cash flows as well as the discount and perpetuity growth rates) to assess the potential impacts of variances in those assumptions on the impairment test's conclusion and the appropriateness of the information disclosed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Note 10.3 also specifies that the Group makes the best estimate of the risk on these adjustments,  the  effects  of  which  are  not  significant,  as assessed by the Group's management.\n\nThe valuation of provisions relating to the main legal disputes and tax adjustments in France is largely based on management judgement, due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used, including on future events and their outcomes, given the inherent uncertainties as to how they can be resolved.\n\nGiven the Group's exposure and the high degree of judgement of management in estimating the risks relating to these main legal disputes and tax adjustments in France, we considered this subject as a key audit matter.\n\nIn order to assess the extent of the risks concerned and the estimates used in connection with the provisions relating to the main legal disputes and tax adjustments, in France, our work consisted in particular in:\n\n- -gaining an understanding of management's process to identify and gather financial risks, and, where appropriate, recognize  provisions  and  prepare  the  related  financial statement disclosures on risks' exposure;\n- -evaluating the design and testing the effectiveness of key controls put in place by management that we considered most relevant to our audit, including those relating to risk assessment based on information provided by the Group's legal and tax departments as well as by external counsels;\n- -gaining an understanding of management's analysis of these risks;\n- -inquiring of the Group's legal and tax departments and the Secretary General of the Group and analyzing available documentation (including the minutes of court hearings) in order to evaluate the assumptions used for determining the provisions for the main legal disputes and tax adjustments;\n- -analyzing the answers received to our queries: opinions from  the  Group's  external  counsel  involved  in  these procedures, related key information including their likely financial consequences;\n- -assessing whether subsequent events have been taken into account in estimating provisions and in the information provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023;\n- -comparing historical provision estimates to actual outflow of resources.\n\nIn addition, for tax adjustments in France, we involved tax professionals who assisted us in evaluating the appropriateness of management's risk assessment.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in notes 5.2, 5.7, 10.3 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

As it relates to Consolidated Financial Statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these Consolidated Financial Statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements intended to be included in the Annual Financial Report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent in macro-marking the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the unique European electronic information format, it is possible that the content of certain tags in the notes may not be identical to the Consolidated Financial Statements attached to this report.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the Consolidated Financial Statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the Annual Financial Report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Orange S.A. by the annual general meeting held on on May 27, 2015 for KPMG S.A. and on May 18, 2021 for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, KPMG S.A. was in the nineth year of total uninterrupted engagement and Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s was in the third year.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  accordance  with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur  role  is  to  issue  a  report  on  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- -Identifies  and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- -Obtains  an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- -Evaluates  the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his Audit Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

Impairment  is  recorded  when  their carrying amount is higher than fair value, which is value in use for strategic investments.\n\nAs stated in Notes 10.1.5 and 10.1.6 to the annual financial statements, value in use of equity investments comprises estimated enterprise value less net debt (or plus net liquid assets),  which  is  calculated  in  its  currency  of  origin  and converted into Euros at the exchange rate effective at the reporting date.\n\nGoodwill  is  recognized  at  acquisition  cost.  Impairment  is recorded when the carrying amount is higher than fair value, generally based on value in use.\n\nDue to the short-term volatility of market value and the strategic nature of its investments, Orange S.A. uses the discounted cash flow method to assess enterprise value (excluding for its banking activity). Discounted cash flow is calculated based on economic and regulatory assumptions, assumptions relating to license renewals and operating forecasts by Management.\n\nOther criteria, such as market value, growth and profitability prospects, parent company equity, proportionate share in the investment (historic basis) can be taken into account, separately or in addition to value in use, when calculating fair value according to the type of each investment.\n\nGiven  their  significance  on  the  balance  sheet  and  the complexity of models used and their sensitivity to changes in data and assumptions on which estimates are based, we believe that the evaluation of equity investments and goodwill is a key audit matter.\n\nWe have obtained an understanding of the procedure put in place by the Group for performing the impairment tests on equity investments and goodwill.\n\nTo assess the estimate of the values in use of equity investments and the value in use of goodwill, together with the assistance of our valuation professionals, we:\n\n- -analyzed the procedure for determining and approving business plans on which cash flow forecasts are based;\n- -compared 2023 cash flow forecasts with business plans from previous financial years;\n- -compared the business plans from prior years with the actual results of the relevant financial years;\n- -inquired  the  operational  and  finance  managers  at Orange S.A. to gain insight into the key assumptions used in business plans and assess assumptions based on the explanations obtained;\n- -evaluated the Group's forecasted revenue growth rates, operating costs and investments by comparing them to the Group's peer companies' analyst reports and market research reports;\n- -reconciled the data included in the valuation models used by the Company in the determination of recoverable values to the plans submitted to those charged with governance.\n\nRelating to the models used for the determination of enterprise values, we involved valuation professionals, who assisted us in evaluating the methodologies used to determine the discount and  perpetuity  growth  rates,  comparing  those  rates  with available market data and recalculating the rates based on our own data sources.\n\nBesides, we tested the mathematical reliability of the models, based on a sample, recalculated values in use determined by Orange and analyzed the enterprise value resulting from forecast cash flows adjusted for the net debt for each entity considered.\n\nWe have also assessed the appropriateness of the information presented in Notes 4.1.1, 4.2, 10.1.5 and 10.1.6. to the annual financial statements.",

Note 3.6 also specifies that Orange S.A. makes the best estimate of the risk on these adjustments, the effects of which are not significant, as assessed by the Company's management.\n\nThe measurement of provisions for major legal disputes and tax adjustments is largely based on management judgement, given the nature of the estimates and assumptions used, including on future events and outcomes, given the inherent uncertainty of how these can be resolved.\n\nGiven Orange S.A.'s exposure and management's high degree of judgement in estimating the risks relating to these major legal disputes and tax adjustments, we considered this subject as a key audit matter.\n\nIn order to assess the extent of the risks concerned and the estimates made in connection with the provisions relating to the main legal disputes and tax adjustments, our work notably consisted in:\n\n- -gaining an understanding of management's process to identify and gather risks, and, where appropriate, recognize provisions and prepare the financial statement disclosures on risks' exposure;\n- -evaluating the design and test the effectiveness of key controls, put in place by management, that we considered most relevant to our audit, relating to risk assessment based on information provided by the Company's legal and tax departments as well as by external counsels;\n- -gaining an understanding of management's analysis of these risks;\n- -inquiring of the legal and  tax  departments  and Orange S.A.'sSecretary  General  of  the  Company  and analyzing available documentation (including the minutes of court hearings) in order to evaluate the assumptions used for determining, where appropriate, the provisions for the main legal disputes and tax adjustments;\n- -analyzing the answers received to our queries: opinions from Orange S.A.'s external counsels involved in these procedures, related key information including their likely financial consequences;\n- -assessing whether subsequent events have been taken into account in the estimation of the provisions and the information provided in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023;\n- -comparing historical provision estimates to actual outflow of resources.\n\nIn addition, we involved tax professionals who assisted us in  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  management's  risk assessment on the tax adjustments.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in notes 3.6, 5.3, 7 and 10.1.14 to the annual financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a public takeover bid or exchange offer, provided pursuant to Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code, we have agreed this information to the source documents communicated to us. Based on these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.\n\n## Other information\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the Management Report.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Format of presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the Annual Financial Report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and Consolidated Financial Statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the Annual Financial Report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (code mon\u00e9taire et financier), prepared under the responsibility of Chief Executive Officer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the Annual Financial Report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the Annual Financial Report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Orange S.A. by the annual general meeting held on May 27, 2015 for KPMG S.A. and on May 18, 2021 for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, KPMG S.A. was in the nineth year of total uninterrupted engagement and Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s was in the third year.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- -identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.",

This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his Audit Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 821-27 to L. 821-34 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, on March 27, 2024\n\nThe statutory auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nS\u00e9bastien HAAS\n\nPartner\n\nJacques PIERRE Partner\n\nKPMG S.A.\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s Christophe PATRIER Partner\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n- 3",

For Orange, the rationale for using this approach was not to try to fully comply with ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards), nor to adapt its data collection and internal control processes to future requirements, but to prepare for them. The reference to the corresponding ESRS in each case is given in parentheses for information only.\n\nOrange's  non-financial  performance  statement  includes  the business model presented in section 1.2.1, the non-financial risk factors set out in section 2.1.4 and their control framework in section 2.2.3. The consolidated sustainability information presented below presents the Group's governance, strategy, policies and processes on sustainability issues, as well as the 2023 assessment of their deployment and effectiveness.\n\n## Organizational scope\n\nThe scope of sustainability reporting extends to all subsidiaries consolidated by the Group, unless otherwise specified. The scope covered by the reporting is therefore specified below each of the indicator tables and expressed most frequently as a percentage of the revenue covered. Orange is endeavoring to make the scope covered more comprehensive each year.\n\nOrange compiles the information at the aggregate Group level and by business sector, in accordance with the sector breakdown used for financial reporting, adapted where necessary to be as relevant as possible for the presentation of sustainability information.\n\n## Frequency of reporting\n\nThe key sustainability indicators presented are subject to quarterly reporting at the entity level, and indicators that are less material for the Group or for which data collection is more complex are reported every six months or annually. These are derived from sector-specific non-financial information systems or from manual reporting. Figures relating to the fourth quarter may be estimated in the event that the data is not available within the timeframe required for publication. Assessment methods are specified on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe changes in methodology that had a Group-level effect greater than or equal to 5% of the indicator, or a country-level effect greater than or equal to 20% of the indicator, and data updates following\n\n## 4.1.2 Listening to stakeholders\n\n## 4.1.2.1 Monitoring Orange's Purpose\n\nOrange made the decision to formalize its commitment to society by adopting a purpose, which was incorporated into its Bylaws after approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 19, 2020. Co-created  with  its  internal  stakeholders  (employees,  social partners and Directors) and external stakeholders (NGOs, think tanks, customers, elected officials, suppliers, investors, etc.), this Purpose was formalized as follows:\n\nreceipt of actual figures that had a material effect on the Group, are calculated on a comparable basis (pro forma). The data for the year (y-1) adjusted in the report are indicated in each table.\n\n## Time horizons\n\nOrange provides a description of its integrated business model, its value chain, its material issues and the sustainability goals or targets for the years ahead. The various elements are assessed over a time horizon, reflecting the processes put in place by the Group to manage its activities. For example, the short term is defined as one year, in line with the budget cycle; the medium term covers a period of more than one year and less than seven years, i.e. the time horizon covered by a strategic plan; the long term covers a period beyond the strategic plan. However, for its climate change adaptation plan, Orange has chosen different timeframes to be compatible with climate issues. The short term covers the current period until 2030, the medium term extends to 2040 and the long term to 2050.\n\n## Standards\n\nOrange takes into account the principles of inclusion, materiality, responsiveness and generated impact defined by the AA1000 APS standard (2018), an international CSR benchmark focused on taking into account the expectations of stakeholders. The Group also takes into account the principles defined by the ISO 26000 standard on the social responsibility of organizations. It aligns its publications with the recommendations of the TCFD (Taskforce on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures - see Section 4.2.7.2 Alignment with TCFD recommendations), which are gradually being incorporated into the CSRD. Furthermore, the Group publishes its non-financial information in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (1) . At the sector level, it also takes into account the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework, the expectations of which are gradually being integrated into its publications, as well as the GSMA framework. From the 2024 reporting year, Orange will be required to publish a sustainability report under the CSRD and will apply ESRS.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of the indicators and monitor the proper application of the Group's action plans in the entities, for several years Orange has had an external audit of its CSR process and achievements carried out by one of its Statutory Auditors, in order to obtain a reasonable assurance report on a sample of CSR information (see Section 4.5 Independent third party report).\n\nThis purpose comes with a mission and commitments:\n\n'Our mission is to ensure that digital services are well thought-out, made available and used in a more human, inclusive and sustainable way in all areas of our business. Orange does everything in its power to ensure that people and organizations enjoy a more autonomous and secure digital life. Through the commitment and expertise of the Group's teams, Orange rolls out innovative technologies and services everywhere, and for everyone.'\n\n'As  a  trusted  partner,  Orange  gives  everyone  the  keys  to  a responsible digital world.'",

In July 2023, this advisory body, which provided support to corporate management, recommended that Orange resume monitoring the Purpose in order to answer more complex questions, or even dilemmas, from the Group's entities.\n\nWith that in mind, the Executive Committee decided to launch 'Purpose groups' - able to call on different qualified professionals depending on the topics covered - to replace the Raison d'agir Committee, whose term had expired. The new set-up still serves as a constructive forum to help the Group ensure that its Purpose will be an effective lever for a sustainable transformation. In 2023, the Raison d'agir Committee met three times.\n\nThe strategic guidelines of the Lead the future strategic plan were presented to the Raison d'agir Committee, before the plan was finalized. The committee concluded that the Purpose had enriched the plan, as well as the new company model.\n\nOn the part relating to 'trusted partner' in the digital sector, the Raison d'agir Committee made the following recommendations:\n\n- -For business customers (B2B) and at Orange Business in particular:\n- -continue  to  develop  European  and  non-European partnerships while asserting its value added, particularly in data security and integration of complex solutions,\n- -strengthen transparency and education on the levels of risk to which Enterprise customers are exposed, with a focus on small businesses (SMEs, mid-caps),\n- -empower and help its partners: ensure that these risks, and their management (education, information, training, alerts), are addressed collectively and the costs shared;\n- -For B2C customers:\n- -strengthen Orange's educational tools to enable users to better understand and manage data protection,\n- -expand Orange's range of services,\n- -consider joint actions with other sectors such as banking, logistics, social media and government.\n\nThe recommendations fueled Orange's efforts to go further and build on Lead the future's promise on digital trust. In October 2023, Orange France increased its collaboration with Cybermalveillance. gouv.fr by launching information, awareness and support actions to better protect the public from online threats.\n\n## 4.1.2.2 Stakeholder  dialogue\n\nOrange bases its CSR approach on repeated, structured dialogue with all of its stakeholders.\n\nThis Stakeholder Dialogue engaged in by the Group is based on a structured, systematic methodology implemented throughout Orange's scope since 2008. It is aimed at identifying areas for improvement in Orange's business activities, by comparing the internal perspective with the external perspective of stakeholders.\n\nIt involves consultation with pre-identified internal and external stakeholders previously identified as representative on the topics addressed in the Orange group's CSR challenges. The questioning used provides for a semi-quantitative rating system as a way of prioritizing stakeholders' concerns and expectations. Stakeholder Dialogue incorporates an element of subjectivity, which is inherent to any consultation, into the responses received. It is an open exercise based on both real facts and perceptions.\n\nFor the Group's double materiality assessment, the results of the dialogues already used in the 2023 single materiality assessment served as a basis for discussion.\n\nMore specifically, 3,750 people have taken part in this stakeholder dialogue over the past five years in 16 countries in Europe and in Africa & Middle East, during interviews or working group sessions or through an online questionnaire. The respondents' profiles break down as follows: 47% Orange employees and their representatives; 27% representatives of civil society (non-profits, NGOs, influencers, media  and  actors  on  the  ground),  16%  representatives  of the  business  community  (suppliers,  subcontractors,  'B2B' customers, etc.); 10% government representatives (elected officials and representatives from local authorities).\n\nData  from  the  following  dialogues  were  used  for  the  double materiality assessment: 'Precariousness and digital technology' in France, 'Responsible together in a post-covid digital world' in 11 Orange countries, and 'Let's talk about the duty of vigilance,' 'Young people and the business world,' 'Diversity and equality in the workplace' in four countries, as well as a dialogue on responsible innovation conducted by Orange Business.\n\nThis approach includes other one-off initiatives, such as the citizen consultation launched in France with the help of Make.org on the topic of reducing the environmental impacts of digital technology. In total, 170,000 citizens submitted more than 6,000 proposals, which  received  more  than  2.6 million  votes.  The  topic  of  the circular economy (sustainability) was supported by nearly 60% of participants. In the spirit of this citizen consultation, Orange has set up a Sustainable Digital Usage Observatory. The results will be shared with all stakeholders who want to help change the environmental impact of digital technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n- 4",

Orange identified 25 sustainability issues derived from EFRAG reporting standards (ESRS, their topics and sub-topics), its existing materiality matrix, international standards (SASB and GRI), and issues identified by other operators.\n\nEach issue was then analyzed from a dual perspective:\n\n- -an impact perspective, i.e. the impacts of Orange's activities and organization on people, society and the environment; Orange considered the positive and negative impacts, whether actual or potential, associated with its 25 sustainability issues and linked to its direct activities, as well as its upstream and downstream value chain;\n- -a  financial  perspective,  i.e.  the  risks  and  opportunities associated with these sustainability issues that could have a positive or negative impact on Orange's business model, development, performance and position in the short, medium or long term, and create or erode value for the Group as a result. In that respect, the non-financial risk factors of Section 2.1.4  Facteurs  de  risque  extra-financiers  were  taken  into account. These contribute to the financial assessment of each sustainability issue, as well as the opportunities for Orange of each issue and the different standards used.\n\nThe impact materiality is assessed by cross-referencing the severity of the impact, determined by the scale, scope and remediable character of the impact, and its likelihood of occurrence. These various factors have been documented by several sources:\n\n- -the results of the different Stakeholder Dialogues conducted by the Group in recent years on various topics to identify the level of importance or severity of the issue (scale), the extent of the impact on the stakeholders concerned (scope) and the remediability (to what extent it can be remediated);\n- -several sector-based standards to refine the assessment of the severity and likelihood of occurrence of the issue, in particular from:\n- -the GRI G4 standard associated with the 'Media' sector, a document covering the key aspects of sustainability performance that are significant and relevant to the media sector,\n\n- -the  ENCORE  (Exploring  Natural  Capital  Opportunities, Risks and Exposure) tool associated with the 'Telecommunications'  and  'Manufacture  of  electrical equipment'  sectors,  developed  by  the  Science  Based Targets Network, which determines, for each sector, the level of impact of activities on the various stressors on biodiversity,\n- -the GSMA Sustainability Assessment Framework, designed in collaboration with Yale University, to better understand mobile operators' sustainability efforts,\n- -the UNEP-FI Sector Impact Map  tool for the 'Telecommunications'  and  'Manufacture  of  electrical equipment' sectors, which maps the positive and negative impacts of sectors and business activities on the pillars of sustainable development (economic, environmental and social);\n- -a study of academic literature and controversies (sector-specific or relating to Orange), including several documents from the ITU, IPCC, Arcep and EESC (French Economic, Social and Environmental Council).\n\nThe financial assessment was based on how critical the issues are for business continuity, considering the use of resources or access to them, and Orange's dependence on its business relationships. The analysis was based on:\n\n- -the scores from stakeholder dialogues, particularly in relation to the standard question on 'impact on the Group's business or reputation';\n- -the Group's 2023 risk mapping, including the level of impact of clusters and risks associated with sustainability issues;\n- -an analysis of the different sector-specific ESG frameworks, in particular:\n- -the SASB standard for the 'Telecommunication Services' sector, which identifies sustainability-related information that is financially material, i.e. essential to understanding how an organization creates value,\n- -Standard  &  Poor's  assessment  and  the  DJSI-CSA assessment associated with the 'TLS Telecommunication Services' sector, which assesses companies' sustainability practices annually, focusing on sustainability criteria that are both industry-specific and financially meaningful. These frameworks allow the importance of sustainability issues to be modulated by sector,\n- -the framework  proposed  by  the  MSCI  for  the 'Communications Services' and 'Information Technology' sectors,  which  assesses  the  long-term  resilience  of companies to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.\n\nThe double materiality exercise conducted in 2023 was based on the draft texts published prior to the end of 2022. It will be refined using new regulatory texts that have been published or are due for release. It will also take a fresh look at the issues from the perspective of the Orange value chain, offering a medium and long-term vision while considering the Group's development in the years ahead.",

A total of 12 issues were found to be material, i.e. with a score of more than 3 or very close to impact and financial materiality, while 10 issues were close to impact or financial materiality. Section 4.1.5 contains a Cross-reference table between the material issues from the double materiality matrix and the sections of the SNFP.\n\n## 4.1.3.2.1 Impacts, risks and opportunities of environmental issues\n\nOrange  has  identified  energy  management,  greenhouse  gas emissions and climate change adaptation (ESRS E1) as material environmental issues. By adopting a Net Zero Carbon approach, Orange is keen to play its part in supporting the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015, while preparing for changes in its infrastructure operating conditions linked to climate change.\n\nThe increasing number of customers, the growth in the number of devices and their usage are driving up energy and equipment needs,  both  for  Orange  -  which  must  plan  its  infrastructure accordingly - and for customers, who must be able to use their devices and access telecommunication services. The upward trend in greenhouse gas emissions due to higher energy consumption and  the  manufacture  of  devices  may  be  exacerbated  by  the increasing rate at which devices are replaced, given the appetite for the technical performance of new technology. In addition, climate change is triggering a rise in severe climate hazards, which requires Orange to ensure the resilience of its infrastructure to maintain business continuity. This is particularly crucial as it allows governments to organize relief for affected communities.\n\nThe impact of these issues on Orange customers is an upward pressure on the cost of devices and telecommunication services, and a possible degradation of service, or even interruption, during extreme weather events. However, by using digital communication services, they can, depending on how they use them, reduce their carbon footprint and thus contribute to the fight against climate change.\n\nThe  risks  for  Orange  are  a  rise  in  energy  costs,  an  increase in investment due to the redundancy solutions put in place to strengthen the resilience of its infrastructure and their replacement in the event of damage linked to climate risks, and the implementation of load shedding mechanisms to ensure business continuity, etc. In addition, Orange may face a reputational and financial risk linked to its sustainable bond issuances, if it fails to meet its environmental commitments, and a market risk if it is not seen to be a player in the environmental transition.\n\nHowever,  its  role  as  a  service  operator  allows  it  to  offer  its customers solutions to reduce their environmental footprint or increase their resilience to adverse weather conditions, which represents  a  business  opportunity.  In  addition,  sector-specific technological developments and infrastructure-sharing solutions make it possible to reduce the coupling between energy needs and the growth in usage, which allows the Group to manage its energy needs. The possibility of using its own renewable energy solutions, via renewable energy purchase contracts in Europe or from solar installations in the Africa & Middle East region, gives Orange the scope to decarbonize its energy supply and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).\n\n- 4\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4 -\n\nFurthermore,  Orange  has  identified  the  development  and strengthening of the circular economy (ESRS E5) as material. The circular economy contributes to the reduction of its GHG emissions, as well as the reduction of supply risks for natural resources and the environmental impacts during their extraction and processing.\n\nThe  implementation  of  circular  economy  principles  such  as eco-design, repair and refurbishment help to extend service life and reduce the need for critical metals contained in network, IT and customer equipment. This mitigates the need for extraction of minerals or rare earths through reuse, and therefore the degradation of natural ecosystems due to the extraction of new resources.\n\nFor customers, extending the lifespan of equipment and providing refurbished equipment make it easier to access digital services at a lower cost.\n\nThe implementation of the principles of the circular economy is based on an increasingly restrictive regulatory framework. This could represent a non-compliance risk for Orange, potentially leading to financial penalties and damage to its brand image.\n\nAside  from  the  complex  operational  challenges  that  require the mobilization of an entire ecosystem - which is still under construction - together with strong partnerships, the development of the circular economy is essentially an opportunity for Orange as a telecommunication operator. It contributes to the economic sustainability of the business and generates cost savings, notably through the use of refurbished equipment for its own network and IT equipment.\n\nIn addition, Orange works closely with its customers and has a distribution network for its products and services. This facilitates the recovery of end-of-life equipment to be sent for recycling.\n\n## 4.1.3.2.2 Impacts, risks and opportunities of social and societal issues\n\nFor  Orange,  the  opportunity  to  support  the  most  vulnerable customers and to defend and uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly in relation to the use of digital technology, has  a  positive  impact.  Orange  intends  to  closely  monitor  the implementation of the principles adopted by the Group throughout its value chain.\n\nFor its own employees (ESRS S1), Orange has identified several key issues, despite the fact that, taken in isolation, they are not considered material at this stage. However, the Group has opted to report on this, considering the overall financial impact of labor expenses for the Group and the skills necessary for its business. These include changes in work arrangements, equal opportunities, skills development and employee retention, occupational health, safety and security, and the right to freedom of association. As an employer, Orange seeks to develop its human capital by offering its employees an environment that allows them to thrive professionally.\n\nOther  issues  affecting  several  stakeholders,  including  its  own employees, are covered by the social role that Orange intends to play (ESRS S3 and S4). These include respect for democracy and freedom of expression, protection of personal data and privacy, and enhanced cybersecurity and data security in view of the growing threats linked to global events.\n\nFor workers within its value chain (ESRS S2), Orange has identified respect for human rights as material, particularly working conditions and forced child labor. The materials used in electronic products may require the extraction of rare earths. In addition, manufacturing and service delivery chains may be located in countries that do not systematically offer a protective social framework in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles applied by the Group.\n\nThe impact of a failure to respect human rights for employees in the value chain can jeopardize their right to integrity, their right to a safe work environment, their individual freedom, their freedom of movement, and their right to an education, etc.\n\nThe risk for Orange is non-compliance with the regulatory or legal framework. This could lead to its management being held liable and financial penalties being imposed in the event of litigation. Orange also runs the risk of defaulting on its commitments and faces a reputational risk.\n\nThe opportunity for Orange is to promote the formal economy and respect for human rights through its contractual clauses, and thus be part of a business climate conducive to trade.\n\nFor its customers or certain populations, and for society as a whole (ESRS S3 and ESRS S4), Orange has identified the issue of data security or cybersecurity and the protection of personal data and privacy as the most material, since the very essence of  the  telecommunication  operator's  business  is  to  transmit information from its customers while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of correspondence. Orange's responsibility regarding the two issues of data protection and personal data extends to all data entrusted to it by its employees, third parties with whom a contractual relationship is established, its customers and - when it acts as an essential infrastructure provider - the entire population.\n\nAny loss or disclosure of data transmitted via Orange's networks or stored in its infrastructure would amount to an invasion of its customers' privacy and could compromise their business. This could also lead to ransom demands.\n\nThe risk for Orange is that its reputation could be tarnished, and customers' trust undermined if it fails to protect the data entrusted to it. It could also face heavy fines, particularly in the event of a breach of data protection laws and regulations.\n\nThe opportunity for Orange is to offer cybersecurity and digital trust solutions, especially for enterprises via Orange Business and Orange Cyberdefense.\n\nThe physical and mental health of its users and the wider population has also been identified as a material issue. To date, the impact on public health of electromagnetic waves, especially for people living near a mobile antenna who form a community, has not been scientifically  proven,  since  exposure  to  electromagnetic  fields is below the thresholds set by international health organizations. Nevertheless, it may lead to anxiety among the public. Excessive or inappropriate use of Orange products or services may lead to screen addiction or addiction to certain content, particularly among children, who are considered at risk when it comes to managing their usage.\n\nThe risk for Orange is reputational. Furthermore, the adoption of strict regulations on the emission thresholds of its network could lead to additional infrastructure construction costs, or a deterioration in its quality of service.",

        "page_content": "The opportunity for Orange is to differentiate itself from other players in the digital world by leveraging its support for the reasonable use of digital technology through a comprehensive digital inclusion program.\n\nDigital inclusion is an issue on which Orange intends to differentiate itself  by  offering  connectivity  to  digital  services  over  a  large area,  including  rural  or  remote  areas,  with  services  adapted to  fragile  socio-economic  situations  (vulnerable  users,  people on low or irregular income, in insecure work, etc.), or for people with disabilities. In addition, inclusion extends to the provision of essential service offers such as access to energy, health, education and financial activities. This supports socio-economic development of regions and the empowerment of remote communities lacking infrastructure, also boosting employment.\n\nThese represent business opportunities for Orange, which, through its inclusive offers targeting remote communities without access to digital services, can expand its addressable market, offering more individual benefits as the number of users increases.\n\nThe  issue  of  innovation  and  ethical  and  responsible  research is material because it sets the rules for using new products and services that transform society; it lays down what is acceptable and how new digital technologies should be developed (artificial intelligence, metaverse, Web 3.0, etc.), as well as how digital products and services can be used responsibly.\n\nThe impact for society and users is that they can use products and services without discriminatory bias or ethically questionable practices, which could arise if the development of new technologies is poorly managed. Digital is an important gateway to information\n\n- 4\n\nand knowledge, boosting the productivity of organizations based on respect for fundamental freedoms.\n\nThe opportunity for Orange is to persuade the public to accept its new products and services, generating cost savings internally and for its customers by optimizing flows and better fulfilling their needs, ultimately leading to additional revenue streams.\n\n## 4.1.3.2.3 Impacts, risks and opportunities of doing business\n\nOrange  has  identified  business  ethics  and  compliance  with various laws and regulations as a material issue. This includes the prevention of corruption, fraud and anti-competitive practices. The scope of this issue covers Orange and its value chain.\n\nThe impact of non-compliance is that ultimately the greater good is sacrificed for individual gain. In the event of fraud or corruption, it also results in a lack of wealth redistribution and failure to build infrastructure and services essential for public welfare. In addition, prices of products and services are kept artificially high, while barriers to free competition stifle innovation. Lastly, concentration erodes the economic fabric of society and is detrimental to small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe risk for Orange is a loss of earnings in the event of fraud, the risk of penalties if its management is held liable, and a financial risk in the event of non-compliance, as well as reputational risk.\n\nThe  opportunity  for  Orange  consists  of  defining  a  framework for managing those risks that it can use as evidence with the authorities. It may also be an eligibility requirement in calls for tenders, particularly in the public sector.\n\n## 4.1.4 Areas of social responsibility to which Orange is committed\n\nIn response to stakeholders' expectations, the major impacts, risks and opportunities identified for Orange, and in keeping with the purpose and its strategic plan, Orange has defined its areas of commitment contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development  Goals  in  the  environmental,  social/societal  and governance fields (ESG).\n\n## 4.1.4.1 Contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nThe Group's commitment is reflected in a selection of six Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) established by the Member States of the United Nations, to which the Orange Executive Committee believes that the Group has made or should make a significant positive contribution.\n\nThe  Group  impacts  of  Orange's  environmental  commitments are  analyzed  and  measured  through  SDG 12  (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action), while its digital inclusion and trust commitments, and social and societal commitments more broadly, are measured through SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities). Orange's business conduct is backed up by SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals).\n\nEach of the SDGs selected (as well as the additional related SDGs) has  been  broken  down  by  theme  applicable  to  Orange,  with associated means and impact indicators to monitor trends. This work was carried out in 2020 and 2021 by a steering committee comprising all of the Group's major functional entities, as well as the operational entities, under the authority of the Environmental and\n\nSocietal Responsibility Executive Director. It was presented to the Group Executive Committee and approved by the CSREC and the Directors in the GCSERC.\n\n## 4.1.4.2 Environment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrange is positioned as a player in the environmental transition . Orange is combating climate change and its repercussions through its activities with a target of Net Zero Carbon by 2040, despite a strong and steady increase in uses across its networks (see Section 4.2.1.1 Environmental strategy translated into commitments). For its own emissions, this requires a sustained energy efficiency effort and increased use of renewable energies through power purchase agreement projects, plans to power its sites with solar energy, and solar farm projects. Particular emphasis has also been placed on the circular economy for customer devices, as well as for network and IT equipment. Orange encourages the decarbonization of its value chain by promoting the circular economy and phasing in CSR criteria during the selection of its suppliers and subcontractors. To neutralize its remaining greenhouse gas emissions, the Group is supplementing these measures by financing natural carbon sink projects. In addition, Orange is at the forefront of work on biodiversity,  mainly  within  the  International  Telecommunication Union (ITU), and is working to take the impacts of its activities on biodiversity into account.\n\nOrange also offers its customers solutions to reduce their own environmental  footprint,  including  through  initiatives  to  raise awareness of responsible digital use.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

At the core of Orange's business model is the geographical digital coverage, which requires investments in infrastructure and research, essential to achieving sustainable development and community empowerment in many countries. To offer its customers appropriate connectivity and new related innovative services, Orange is taking action to maximize geographical coverage.\n\nIn addition to its geographical digital coverage goals, Orange works toward inclusion to reduce inequalities by offering free workshops and training on digital technologies that will benefit 2.5 million people between 2021 and 2025 and 6 million people between 2021 and 2030. Other actions include supporting its customers, promoting responsible service offers tailored to the needs of as many people as possible, and supporting digital entrepreneurship.\n\nOrange  also  positions  itself  as  a trusted  partner ,  giving  its customers the confidence to enjoy digital experiences, offering them protection and staking its leadership claim for cybersecurity in Europe. Orange encourages companies to use data responsibly and has developed an AI ethics charter to govern the use of AI in its own activities. Orange advocates respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. For freedom of expression in particular, Orange applies net neutrality under Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 laying down measures concerning open Internet access.\n\nFor its employees and customers, Orange aims to use digital technology to further development and equal opportunities, while seeking to be an increasingly inclusive player. Orange strives to create value for its employees and all its stakeholders, with a way of doing business based on exemplary conduct in the management of human resources - maintaining the employability of its employees, upskilling, diversity policy - with a view to aligning the representation of women in management networks with that of the Group.\n\n## 4.1.4.4 Governance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrange promotes ethical business conduct within its organization and ecosystem. This is underpinned by sustainable investments and responsible purchasing, while stimulating the ecosystem and establishing a strong local presence.\n\nOrange has established a Group-wide system for anti-corruption and the promotion of ethical conduct to all stakeholders. The success of these various initiatives depends on close cooperation with the other players in its ecosystem.\n\nOrange has a responsible purchasing policy aimed at embedding the principles of social responsibility in its supplier and subcontractor relations.  It  encourages  dialogue  and  honors  its  contractual commitments, focusing in particular on the local economy and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nIn its lobbying, Orange acts transparently, and within the framework of its Code of Ethics, which prohibits the financing of political organizations.\n\n## 4.1.5 Cross-reference table between the material issues from the double materiality matrix and the sections of the SNFP\n\nThis cross-reference table lists the issues selected as 'material' with regard to their double materiality (see Section 4.1.3.2 The Orange group's double materiality matrix in 2023) or the non-financial risk factors (see section 2.1.4.

        "page_content": "## 4.1.7 Appropriation of the Group's CSR challenges and commitments by all employees\n\nThe achievement of the Group's CSR objectives and commitments requires an in-depth transformation of the company, calling for the contribution of all employees. Orange has therefore implemented awareness-raising and training programs to develop a general CSR culture and to have essential CSR skills at its disposal.\n\nThese programs are structured by a Strategic Committee and an operational committee that were set up to include representatives from different Orange group entities to identify skill needs and to prioritize and structure the development of CSR training offers. These CSR training offers are organized around three objectives:\n\n- -raise awareness among all employees of the challenges of a responsible and inclusive approach;\n- -incorporate  CSR  skills  into  the  business  approaches  to empower all employees to take action in their activity;\n- -ensure the upskilling of experts in the environmental field.\n\nAccess to CSR training is provided by a dedicated portal, accessible to all employees and structured around three pillars: Environment (carbon footprint and circular economy), Society (digital inclusion and responsible use) and Corporate policy (diversity and inclusion, ethics and compliance, duty of vigilance, human rights).\n\nIn 2023, 59,812 employees participated in 131,129 hours of CSR learning activities.\n\n## General CSR awareness training\n\nTo enable all Orange employees to take on the challenges of Corporate Social Responsibility and the commitments made by Orange in this area, an online training course, available in seven languages, was launched in October 2020. It awards a 'certificate' once the student has passed a knowledge test. From the launch date through December 2023, 62,922 CSR certificates have been awarded.\n\nThis process of acculturation has been enriched by a number of thematic training courses, in addition to the CSR certificate.\n\nOne example is the 'Equality in the Workplace' certificate, which helps recipients identify and understand the challenges of gender equality in the workplace (see Section 4.3.1.2.7 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion). Another is the Climate Fresk workshop, which is an opportunity to learn about the causes and consequences of climate change and Orange's commitments in this area, and to discuss the actions to be taken within the Group to reduce CO 2 emissions. From the launch date through December 2023, 20,541 people in the Group participated in this training course taught by more than 200 Orange employee facilitators; it is offered in person and virtually in French and English.\n\nOrange employees can also learn more about the issues around the duty of vigilance, digital accessibility, the circular economy, biodiversity, ethics and compliance, etc.\n\n## Further training specific to the businesses\n\nThe CSR 'business' training portfolio targets all technical, marketing and finance functions, among others, and helps incorporate CSR skills into the business approaches to empower all employees to take action in their activity.\n\nIt includes, for example, training on eco-design for products and services; training on circular design to optimize interfaces and the  user  experience;  training  on  responsible  purchasing;  and responsible marketing training to make sustainable development a real lever for the Group's business value added. Training for the finance functions, which play a key role in reporting and managing non-financial trajectories, was launched in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nLeadership training is also a key focus, with a special training course designed for members of Orange's Board of Directors.\n\n## 4.1.8 Financing linked to sustainable performance\n\nIn September 2020, Orange published its 'Sustainable financing framework' with a view to issuing bonds backed by its investments in social or environmental areas. Since then, Orange has issued two bonds under this program for a total amount of 1 billion euros, allowing it to broaden its investor base and pursue its financing structure optimization policy.\n\nThe published allocation and impact reports for issues describe the projects selected, as well as the investment amounts and related impacts. At the end of 2022, 855 million euros of the billion raised was used to finance or refinance:\n\n- -on the social side, the roll-out of fiber in rural France in the digital inclusion category, with more than 1,011,000 beneficiaries, and investments in 43 start-ups via Orange Ventures in the social inclusion category;\n- -on the environmental side, infrastructure sharing in Poland in the energy efficiency category, with close to 212,000 metric tons  of CO 2 emissions  avoided,  and  the  refurbishment  of Liveboxes in France in the circular economy category, with more than 11.7 million pieces of equipment concerned.\n\nIn November 2022,  Orange  refinanced  its  6-billion-euro syndicated  credit  facility  and  incorporated  environmental  and CSR performance criteria for the first time. The margin for this multi-currency syndicated revolving credit facility is notably indexed to the achievement of the CO 2 emissions objectives (scopes 1 and 2, scope 3), in line with Orange's goal of being Net Zero Carbon by 2040, and to the gender balance target.\n\nLastly, in June 2023, Orange published its 'Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework,' a charter linking its financing instruments to  sustainable  performance  goals  such  as  reductions  in  its scope 1, 2 as well as its scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in the  digital  sector,  the  participation  of  women  in  management networks,  and  the  number  of  external  beneficiaries  of  digital training.  In  September 2023,  Orange  completed  its  inaugural sustainability-linked bond issue for a nominal amount of 500 million euros.  The  bonds  are  linked  to  the  Group's  target  of  a  45% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2030 (relative to 2020) and its commitment to provide training in digital skills to external beneficiaries (6 million beneficiaries in total between 2021 and 2030).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

These will be prioritized for the two key strands of climate change mitigation and adaptation:\n\n- -climate (ESRS E1);\n- -resource use and circular economy (ESRS E5).\n\nBecause the most significant issues and impacts at Group level relate to the climate, Orange has prioritized the climate in its environmental strategy with two key components: mitigation and adaptation (see the transition plan in Section 4.2.3.1 Environmental and energy transition plan: mitigating and adapting):\n\n- -on the 'mitigation' side, the Group's priority is to reduce its carbon footprint, hence the pledge made by Orange (see Section 4.2.1.1.1 Commitments with respect to greenhouse gas emissions);\n- -on the 'adaptation' side, the Group's priority is to adapt to climate risks, with an analysis of the exposure of Orange's infrastructure  and  employees  to  unpredictable  weather conditions. This analysis provides the essential foundation for preparing local adaptation plans.\n\nThe circular economy plays a key role in the Orange group's decarbonization, potentially contributing between 20% and 30% to the scope 3 emissions reduction target by 2030.\n\nYet Orange is also aware of the other issues at stake, conducting in-depth studies on the impact that the business has on resources and biodiversity, among other topics. Beyond contributing to the goal of decarbonization, the circular economy also reduces the use of critical natural resources and the generation of waste, including hazardous waste. Orange has set up a working group to quantify the impacts linked to the use of natural resources, both on the environment and on its financial performance.\n\nAlong with its partners, Orange is involved in discussions on the development  of  the  circular  economy,  particularly  within  the Circul'R business coalition and the GSMA (Global System for Mobile Communications Association), on how to measure circularity for devices and network equipment.\n\nOrange is also mindful of the social impact of its partners and its actions. This is one of the criteria for selecting carbon sink projects for example (see Section 4.2.4.5 Implementation of the carbon sequestration program).\n\n## 4.2.1.1 Environmental strategy translated into commitments\n\nOrange's  environmental  strategy  is  translated  into  a  series  of commitments both for the climate (ESRS E1) and the resource economy (ESRS E5).\n\n## 4.2.1.1.1 Commitments with respect to greenhouse gas emissions\n\nAs a leading player in the sector, Orange is keen to build a more responsible digital world. Orange is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact aiming for an average global warming trajectory of +1.5\u00b0C compared to pre-industrial levels and, in 2019, made the commitment as part of its Engage 2025 Strategic Plan to be Net Zero Carbon in the digital sector (1) by 2040.\n\nTo  that  end,  Orange  is  committed  to  reducing  its  own CO 2 emissions, indirect ones related to its electricity consumption and those generated upstream by its suppliers and downstream by its customers, and to sequestering residual emissions by financing carbon sink projects.\n\nIts commitment relates to scopes 1, 2 and 3 (2) of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol). For this, the Group prepared a 2025 roadmap, which was approved by the SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative), an international scientific reference for assessing companies' climate goals. The Group has also defined its 2030 and 2040 roadmap, which has been submitted to the SBTi.\n\nTo be able to meet this commitment, the Group has set itself interim targets:\n\n- -reducing CO 2 eq emissions in scopes 1 and 2 by 30% in 2025 compared with the 2015 level;\n- -reducing CO 2 eq emissions in scope 3 by 14% in 2025 compared with the 2018 level;\n- -reducing CO 2 eq emissions in all three scopes by 45% in 2030 compared with the 2020 level.\n\nThese interim targets are based on reducing the gross emissions generated. Therefore, they must be achieved without taking into account negative emissions from carbon sink projects; these are only taken into account in the calculation of net emissions, used as a formula for measuring the achievement of Net Zero Carbon by 2040.\n\nThese  targets  were  developed  in  line  with  the  international methodology for the digital sector; the estimate of the impact of the Information and Communication Technologies sector on global climate is based on the work of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), together with the SBTi, the GSMA, the GeSI and the International Energy Agency, with major contributions made by Orange.  This  work  resulted  in  the  publication  of  a  document explaining the emission reduction paths to be followed by the sector in order to comply with scientific recommendations and confine the rise in temperatures to 1.5\u00b0C compared to the pre-industrial era (3) . The Net Zero Initiative (4) , in which the Orange is also taking part, formalized a standard for businesses in February 2019.",

        "page_content": "In accordance with this framework, Orange's approach relies:\n\n- -as a priority, on the maximum possible reduction of greenhouse gas emissions - scopes 1, 2 and 3. As a priority, Orange is seeking to reduce its scopes 1 and 2 emissions and the scope 3 emissions over which it has a direct influence. The Group is taking action on the other part of scope 3 emissions with its stakeholders: its suppliers, via the ITU, the GSMA and the JAC (Joint Alliance for CSR), its customers and its employees;\n- -on its contribution to carbon sequestration, for a quantity equivalent  to  the  remaining  carbon  emissions  in  2040  of scopes 1, 2 and 3 and not representing more than 10% of total emissions in the reference year. This can be done in particular through natural carbon sink projects (for example, in forests, mangroves or agroforestry).\n\nOrange also intends to contribute to avoiding emissions outside its scope, for example by marketing products and services that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors. These avoided emissions are not taken into account in the data published by Orange. To assess the carbon impact of the use of its products and services in other sectors, the Group plans to use international standard ITU L. 1480, available since January 2023 and to which its teams have contributed.\n\nIn 2019, Orange pledged to increase the percentage of renewable energy  in  the  Group's  electricity  consumption,  accounted  for in scope 2, to 50% by 2025. Orange has decided to no longer communicate externally on targets for this type of indicator because it seems less relevant in the context of implementing the strategy: on the one hand, Orange operates in sub-Saharan Africa, where continuous electricity supply is a major issue, particularly for mobile sites, and Orange uses thermal generators to ensure continuity of service. The CO 2 emissions related to the use of these generators come under scope 1 of the GHG Protocol. However, the electricity generated is not included in the calculation of the percentage of renewable energy, the denominator of which only relates to scope 2. On the other hand, more than 45% of the Group's scope 2 electricity is consumed in France, a country where the electricity mix is very low carbon (one of the lowest in Europe and indeed the world). This is because much of the country's electricity is nuclear in origin, and nuclear energy is not renewable. Therefore, it seems more appropriate for Orange to focus its commitments on the effective decarbonization of its operations on all three scopes of the GHG Protocol and to leverage its renewable electricity consumption as a means of fulfilling its commitment. In this context, the Group is working in parallel to reduce the use of fossil fuels used in generators in the MEA region.\n\n## 4.2.1.1.2 Commitments with regard to the circular economy\n\nOrange  has  also  made  the  commitment  to  integrate  circular economy principles into its organization and processes in order to limit the impact of its activities and those of its suppliers and customers on raw resources. This policy also helps reduce GHG emissions.\n\nThis commitment is broken down into the following targets by 2025:\n\n- -commit  100%  of  the  range  of  Orange-brand  electronic equipment (Liveboxes, set-top boxes, etc.) to an eco-design approach  that  reduces  the  carbon  footprint  during  their\n\n- 4\n\nmanufacture and distribution, as well as electricity consumption during their use; encourage our suppliers to eco-design the devices and accessories sold to customers by Orange;\n\n- -recover 30% of the mobile devices sold by Orange in Europe (including in France) and the equivalent in WEEE (1) volume of 20% of the mobile devices sold by Orange in Africa & Middle East; recover more than 90% of fixed devices (Liveboxes, set-top boxes, etc.) distributed by Orange and returned when customers terminate their subscriptions;\n- -achieve 10% of the overall volume sales of mobile devices in Europe with refurbished devices;\n- -offer an attractive repair service for mobile devices sold by Orange in each European country where Orange operates;\n- -use 10% of the Group's investments in active network and IT equipment to purchase refurbished equipment.\n\nOrange is also committed to always taking into account criteria relating  to  its  equipment's  carbon  footprint  throughout  its  life cycle and to the circular economy when selecting network and IT equipment.\n\nWith regard to waste, which comes under the goal of responsible consumption and production defined by Sustainable Development Goal 12, Orange has pledged to pay particular attention to WEEE and waste batteries, which are considered hazardous waste under environmental regulations.\n\n## 4.2.1.2 Environmental  strategy translated into policies\n\nTo  implement  its  environmental  strategy,  the  Group  publishes policies externally and internally, as well as guidelines that apply to all Orange entities.\n\n## Environmental policy\n\nOrange's environmental policy (2) is published on its corporate site. In terms of mitigation, it reflects Orange's commitment to play its part in the fight against climate change under the Paris Agreement. It aims to make Orange a Net Zero Carbon company by 2040 through programs to reduce scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions by tackling volumes (energy, equipment, services) and the carbon intensity  of  those  volumes  (decarbonization  of  energy  supply, equipment, circular economy). Residual emissions will be offset by 2040 by sequestration in natural carbon sinks. This will cover up to 10% of 2020 emissions, in strict compliance with scientifically established standards.\n\n## Policy for the treatment of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and waste batteries\n\nWEEE,  from  end-of-life  equipment  and  waste  batteries,  is considered  hazardous  waste  under  environmental  regulations. Orange's policy for the treatment of household and trade WEEE, as well as waste batteries, seeks to define the priority issues and identify the operational measures to address them, with regional operating practices covering:\n\n- -risk management and the Group's compliance with applicable regulations;\n- -specific commitments for equipment recovery and treatment;\n- -the management model with a view to optimizing performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This section requires that environmental criteria be incorporated into purchasing and procurement decisions, and that the relevance of the purchase be questioned by considering alternatives (internal solution, reuse, use of refurbished equipment, etc.) and, in the case of energy, by increasing purchases of decarbonized and renewable energy (see Section 4.2.4.3 Use of electricity from renewable sources).\n\n## Energy guidelines\n\nOrange  has  shared  guidelines  on  energy  purchases  with  all its European subsidiaries. The guidelines define the electricity purchasing policy with regard to the twofold challenge of controlling costs and decarbonizing the Group's electricity consumption.\n\n## 4.2.2 Governance\n\nThe  governance  described  below  applies  to  the  various environmental components that the Group addresses: climate change (ESRS E1), pollution (ESRS E2), water and marine resources (ESRS E3), biodiversity and ecosystems (ESRS E4), and resource use and circular economy (ESRS E5).\n\n## 4.2.2.1 Governance  bodies for environmental issues\n\nThe Orange Board of Directors, supported by its Governance and Corporate  Social  and  Environmental  Responsibility  Committee (GCSERC,  see  Section  5.2.1.6  Committees  of  the  Board  of Directors), oversees the strategy, risks and opportunities related to the environment (in particular climate change). These issues are examined by the Executive Committee, and specifically the Group Executive Directors for Environmental and Societal Responsibility and  the  General  Secretariat,  who  chair  the  CSR  and  Ethics Committee (CSREC, see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees). The Group's ambitions and the associated action plans are submitted and validated by the General Management and the Board of Directors within special committees. In  2023,  the  Group's  Executive  Committee  strengthened  its management  of  the  Group's  transition  plan  by  introducing  a half-yearly meeting of all its members, focusing on the issues faced by the CSR Division.\n\nThe Group's environmental objectives are broken down by division and division-specific environmental objectives are described in a commitment letter signed by the Environmental and Societal Responsibility Executive Director and by the Executive Director of the division. They are an integral part of the budgetary processes and the strategic plan (see Section 2.2.2.1 Specific Internal Control procedures  pertaining  to  the  preparation  and  processing  of accounting and financial information) and are monitored by the CSR and Ethics Committee and the Group Executive Committee under the supervision of the Audit Committee, the GCSERC and the Board of Directors. During the 2024 budget exercise, the Group's divisions received, at the same time as the financial framework, a framework for scope 1 and 2 CO 2 emissions and energy consumption in absolute  value  terms  for  their  scope.  The  Group  Investment Committee assesses the environmental impact of the main projects\n\n## Carbon sink guidelines\n\nThis policy highlights Orange's commitment to finance natural projects  that,  beyond  carbon  sequestration,  offer  co-benefits for  biodiversity  and  the  socio-economic  development  of  local communities. Orange has shared its guidelines for financing carbon sink projects, outlining the goals, challenges and selection criteria, as well as how to account for carbon credits from these projects.\n\n## Principles regarding 'environmental claims'\n\nOrange is committed to continuously improving the environmental performance  of  its  products  and  services  in  line  with  its environmental targets, reporting on that performance in a fair, transparent and open manner. With this in mind, at the end of 2023 Orange defined seven principles for environmental claims, aimed at the Group's marketing and communication communities. The principles are designed to enhance the value proposition of the Group's products and services, while avoiding the reputational, legal and judicial risks related to greenwashing. They also ensure that environmental communication is consistent across all Group entities. The principles provide the marketing and communication communities with a clear, practical guide to understanding and complying with the regulations and the Group's commitments.\n\npresented (real estate projects or projects related to the IT system and the network) and approves the investments planned under the carbon sink program (see Section 4.2.4.5 Implementation of the carbon sequestration program).\n\nThe monitoring of Orange's environmental actions is the responsibility of the Environmental and Energy Transition Department within the Group Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) division and is based on the work of various committees:\n\nThe Environmental Strategy Committee , established in 2022, is co-chaired by the Executive Director of the Orange Innovation division  and  the  Executive  Director  of  the  Environmental  and Societal Responsibility division. It meets quarterly to define the environmental strategy based on four themes: the CO 2 footprint of scopes 1, 2 and 3; carbon sinks; the Group's service offers allowing its customers to reduce their environmental footprint; and biodiversity and resource conservation. It reviews the progress of environmental programs and prioritizes and allocates resources among  the  various  programs  contributing  to  climate  change mitigation and adaptation plans. It includes members from the Orange Innovation, Group CSR and Purchasing Departments, and from the operational divisions.\n\nAn energy efficiency program was launched in 2008 for networks and information systems, which account for more than 80% of the Group's energy consumption. The coordination by business unit, now under the direct guidance of the Environmental and Energy Transition Department and the Orange Innovation Division, made it possible to strengthen the Group's existing governance in terms of energy management and ensure the control, dissemination and monitoring of programs across the Group. In this way, it increases the possibility of achieving the Group's objectives to control energy costs and reduce scope 1 and 2 CO 2 emissions.\n\nIn 2023, the Environmental Strategy Committee began modeling scope 3 CO 2 emissions by business activity under the supervision of the CSR and Ethics Committee. This strengthens the reporting of scope 3 CO 2 emissions for all categories of the GHG Protocol, while identifying the most relevant decarbonization levers for each region and division. The results were presented to the Group's Executive Committee.",

        "page_content": "The Responsible Purchasing Committee is in charge of validating the binding environmental commitments to be applied to Orange's purchases, as well as the minimum requirements for suppliers, and for overseeing the implementation of those commitments. Its role is also to ensure that regulatory changes are correctly anticipated and incorporated into purchasing processes.\n\n## 4.2.2.2 Roll-out of the environmental commitment within the Group and raising awareness\n\n## A network of dedicated liaison officers\n\nOrange's environmental commitment is one of the central pillars of its integrated business model. Its goal of being Net Zero Carbon in 2040 requires all entities and subsidiaries in countries where the Group operates to shoulder their share of this commitment.\n\nAt  the  central  level,  the  Environmental  and  Energy  Transition Department,  established  in  2023,  has  overarching  powers  of oversight  (strategic  planning,  policies,  reporting,  performance analysis) for the two areas of environment and energy. It is supported by a network of around 90 environmental liaison officers in each of the entities and business lines, with whom it liaises regularly.\n\nEach division and virtually all country subsidiaries have appointed a spokesperson for environmental issues to their Management Committee to implement the necessary transformation. These individuals  act  on  behalf  of  the  Management  Committee  in coordinating roadmaps for projects related to environmental issues within the subsidiary. Their role is to define, deploy, communicate, implement and adapt the environmental strategy in each entity and country subsidiary. The role of the Chief Climate Officer, created in 2023 within each MEA region subsidiary, forms part of this dynamic.\n\n## Development of an ecosystem with partners who are committed to the environment\n\nOrange aims to develop an entire sustainable ecosystem around energy  and  the  environmental  footprint.  Its  decision-making processes  with  regard  to  purchasing  take  into  account  the responsible engagement of suppliers and partners during calls for tender (see Section 4.3.2.2.4 Supplier selection and audit process to  ensure  compliance  with  Orange's  responsible  purchasing commitments).\n\nWorking groups with active equipment suppliers have been put in place to speed up the reduction of equipment energy consumption, to lay down the conditions for the development of the circular economy and to standardize the calculation and dissemination of life cycle analysis. These are the subject of commitments and roll-out plans, like the first project for an equipment refurbishment center, launched in Egypt with the support of UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development Organization) as part of its initiative SWITCH2CE (Switch to Circular Economy Value Chains).\n\nLastly, Orange empowers its employees to commit to reducing their carbon footprint on a daily basis, for example through its car-sharing vehicle fleet programs, eco-friendly mobility in France, the employee 'Re' program, or more specifically in reforestation actions carried out with NGOs and experts in this field.\n\n## Incorporation of environmental criteria into Orange's Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nThe  Orange  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct (1) was  updated  on March 30, 2023 to adapt to changes in CSR and compliance regulations and the Group's strategy. It describes the ethical, social and environmental commitments that the Group expects in the contracting process (see Section 4.3.2.2.3 Supplier Code of Conduct). It sets out principles including:\n\n- -support for suppliers to minimize their own energy consumption and  that  of  their  products  and  services,  develop  an Environmental Management System based on international standards and, if possible, set a carbon emissions reduction target;\n- -implementation  of  circular  economy  principles  (use  of eco-design, refurbished equipment offer, responsible waste management, etc.) and consideration of biodiversity;\n- -provision of documentation on greenhouse gas emissions for scopes 1 and 2 (and, if required by Orange, scope 3), on the treatment of waste, and on the traceability of minerals;\n- -compliance with all applicable laws and regulations on reporting the composition of products and on environmental permits, authorizations and records.\n\n## Internal communication, awareness and training\n\nOrange's  Internal  Communication  Department  regularly  raises awareness among all Group employees, enabling each of them to factor responsible objectives into their day-to-day activities. Dedicated  training  programs  are  regularly  rolled  out  (see Section 4.1.7 Appropriation of the Group's CSR challenges and commitments by all employees).\n\n## Compensation\n\nAll Orange SA employees have their collective compensation partly indexed to the CO 2 emissions reduction indicator, thus giving visibility to this commitment; similarly, Orange France Technical and Information System Department (TISD) employees have part of their annual variable compensation indexed to the scope 1 and 2 CO 2 emissions specific to their activities. In Europe, the variable compensation of each country CEO is also indexed to the scope 1 and 2 CO 2 emissions specific to their entity. For Group employees who are executives, Orange's Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) has included, since the 2020-2022 period, an environmental criterion to reduce the Group's CO 2 emissions (see Note 6.3 Share-based compensation to the Consolidated Financial Statements ).\n\n## Environmental Management System\n\nTo achieve the objectives of reducing environmental risks and impacts,  the  Group  is  progressively  rolling  out  Environmental Management Systems (EMS) in accordance with the 2015 version of ISO 14001 in its main host countries. This standard describes how  companies  should  organize  themselves  to  manage  the environmental  impact  of  their  activities.  It  has  gradually  been integrated by the Group, notably through stakeholder dialogue and by taking into account the impact of its activities throughout the life cycle of products (see Section 4.2.7.1 Environmental Management Systems (EMS)).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

Potential or actual damage to the environment that Orange considers it may have caused was addressed in its 2023 Vigilance Plan. Orange has taken steps to develop a mitigation plan for all of its activities and covering scopes 1, 2 and 3, as well as a climate change adaptation plan aimed at strengthening the resilience of its infrastructure and of its organization. The framework for this work chosen by Orange is that of the Paris Agreement and the trajectories established by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). It includes two scenarios, depending on whether or not the average increase in temperature is limited to 1.5\u00b0C, and three time horizons: 2030, 2040 and 2050. Its mitigation plan is based on its greenhouse gas emission commitment, on the action plans implemented to achieve this commitment and on the internal governance put in place to ensure its proper execution. Its adaptation plan involves cross-functional work across the Group, under the responsibility of the Group's Environmental and Energy Transition Department, in conjunction with the Strategy, Finance and Performance and Innovation Departments and with the support of the Carbone 4 firm.\n\n## 4.2.3.1 Environmental and energy transition plan: mitigating and adapting\n\nThe  climate  strategy  is  based  on  two  pillars,  mitigation  and adaptation, and consists of a mitigation plan and an adaptation plan.  The  mitigation  plan  involves  limiting  the  impact  of  the company's activities, its value chain, and its customers. Regardless of a company's mitigation efforts, the climate has already changed and will continue to do so, leading to more extreme weather events which can impact the company, its value chain and its customers (see Section 2.1.4 Non-financial risk factors and Section 4.1.3.2.1 Impacts, risks and opportunities of environmental issues). This in turn affects the rules that govern mitigation policies (taxes, regulations, transformation of energy production). Mitigation and adaptation are two interdependent aspects. All mitigation plans of economic and public actors seek to limit climate change and thus the scale of the adaptation needed.\n\nTo achieve their goal, mitigation plans mobilize levers such as reducing the consumption of resources, which alleviate the risks for the company when resources are under pressure. By contrast, improving the resilience of infrastructure leads to the redundancy of  equipment,  which  runs  counter  to  adaptation  plans.  This interdependence requires a holistic approach.\n\nTo that end, Orange is implementing a dual climate strategy based on mitigation and adaptation.\n\nOn the mitigation side, Orange has reaffirmed its commitment to be Net Zero Carbon by 2040. It has confirmed that it wants to do its utmost to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. Orange's mitigation plan is based on the measurement and assessment of emissions for scopes 1, 2 and 3 and on understanding how they change for different activities. This  enables  it  to  create  operational  decarbonization  action plans. The implementation of tools, processes and governance is also necessary for the operational management of emissions. In 2023, for scopes 1 and 2, Orange secured a significant volume of low-carbon electricity consumption for the medium term and set targets as part of the 2024 budgetary process. It also carried out an initial financial costing of the mitigation plans for the energy scope and for scopes 1 and 2. The 2024 targets are consistent with the division-specific 2025 pathway. For scope 3, Orange refined its\n\nunderstanding of its emissions and developed its first forecasting model for the various activities. The modeling is used to identify the most salient decarbonization levers and to set de-averaged targets for each Group division.\n\nOn the adaptation side, Orange prioritized adaptation to climate risks in 2023. This is based on an analysis of the exposure of Orange's infrastructure and employees to climate hazards, an essential foundation for preparing local adaptation plans as part of the risk management framework. Orange selected a market tool to conduct this analysis and launch a pilot phase with countries in Europe and the MEA region.\n\n## 4.2.3.1.1 Climate change mitigation plans\n\nOrange's  climate  change  mitigation  plan  is  supported  by  the action plans to be Net Zero Carbon in the digital sector by 2040. It relies on various simultaneous approaches aimed at reducing volumes  (energy  consumption,  purchases  of  equipment  and services) and decarbonizing throughout the value chain (suppliers, subcontractors, customer usage). The programs that contribute to the mitigation plan in the energy field (networks and IT, tertiary and vehicles) have been identified and estimated in the 2024 budget for each division. Orange is working on harmonizing the costing methodology.\n\n## Energy: reduce through energy efficiency programs in all three areas (networks and IT, tertiary and vehicles)\n\nOrange is continuing its energy efficiency drive for networks and IT, focusing on both equipment and its organization. For the equipment itself, the Group relies on the implementation of the energy efficiency functions of the mobile-access network (RAN), including advanced standby modes, the modernization of equipment and site technical environments and the eco-efficiency of Data centers. In relation to the organization of equipment, Orange is promoting greater infrastructure and equipment sharing (RAN sharing); at end-2023, 68% of the radio sites were sharing both infrastructure and energy, and 28% had expanded sharing to include radio access. Orange is also promoting the consolidation of radio modules and the reconfiguration of Data centers (grouping of servers in the most efficient Data centers). The Group is streamlining its equipment portfolio  by  decommissioning  older,  more  energy-intensive technologies.\n\nThese actions are managed under the Green ITN program, which has already avoided the emission of around 4.2 million metric tons of CO 2 between 2015 and 2023 by improving the energy efficiency of networks and information systems. By way of example, the last two Data centers commissioned in France consume on average 30% less than older Data centers with equivalent capacity, enabling a dozen Data centers to be replaced nationwide. The Data centers operate using 'free cooling,' a technology that reduces the need for artificial air conditioning by 80%. Orange is working on improving this in its laboratories, in partnership with various industrial and academic stakeholders.\n\nOrange is also implementing a specific policy for its buildings with the aim of reducing the consumption of the Group's real estate assets. This policy involves optimizing the surface area of commercial buildings and setting up '360\u00b0 management' in all its main buildings, to measure and thus to optimize and reduce energy consumption related to heating, air conditioning and lighting. In addition, Orange is working with its service providers to gradually replace the fuel oil and gas furnaces at their real estate properties with heat pumps.",

        "page_content": "In the area of mobility, Orange has created an action plan to reduce and electrify its vehicle fleets by 2025 (by installing charging stations for electric vehicles on Orange sites). In addition, Orange aims to maintain its status as Europe's biggest corporate carsharing fleet.\n\n## Energy: decarbonizing supply\n\nOrange is firmly committed to decarbonizing its energy supply. Specifically, with regard to the electricity it needs to operate its networks, Orange aims to have an energy supply which is as low carbon as possible by 2030. This target is easier to attain when the energy available on the national electricity grid is low carbon. This is the case in France, where the Group has also signed renewable energy supply contracts (Power Purchase Agreements, or PPAs).\n\nIn Europe , several subsidiaries have signed PPAs. This is particularly the case in Spain, Poland and Romania (active in Romania from 2024). In addition, Orange also purchases Guarantee of Origin certificates (separately from PPAs) for some or all of its electricity purchases in several countries, such as Belgium, Romania and Slovakia. By 2025, the Group estimates that 75% of its electricity needs in Europe (excluding France) will be met from electricity of renewable origin.\n\nIn Africa & Middle East , where the electricity mix often still relies heavily on carbon, where PPAs are not permitted and where the operation of telecommunications networks requires the use of generators to compensate for recurring power grid failures in some countries, Orange has installed solar power at its sites wherever possible by implementing its own solutions for access to renewable energy or with the help of its energy partners (Energy Service Company - ESCo). In this way, Orange MEA has been able to equip its telecom towers with solar power by paying only for the energy consumed by the tower over a defined period of time. This is currently the case for more than 7,500 sites in the MEA region, or nearly 20% of the sites. In addition, Orange has installed solar power at 10 nodal sites and Data centers - which are major consumers of energy - across the region. It has also launched studies and projects for some 50 additional sites, out of a total of 131 sites of this type. Lastly, Orange has also built three solar farms in Jordan and is developing a solar farm project in Mali. In 2023, Orange Egypt and other local operators entered into an agreement with the government to purchase Guarantee of Origin certificates from newly built solar power plants.\n\n## Scope 3: footprint measurement and reduction\n\nIn  collaboration  with  the  Carbone  4 consulting  firm,  Orange measures its scope 3 carbon footprint at the Group level for the 15 GHG Protocol categories and identifies the major areas of its purchasing that have a significant CO 2 eq impact. This exercise allows quantified environmental requirements for suppliers to be integrated during calls for tenders or in the course of the contractual relationship. The accuracy of the scope 3 calculation is steadily improving, notably by taking more precise emission factors into account.\n\nThe Group is rolling out various operational levers to help country subsidiaries and entities reduce their carbon footprint. The levers are based on managing purchase volumes and reducing the carbon intensity of purchases.\n\nMany operational levers are largely based on purchasing and procurement (including intervention services), the circular economy and the supply chain, but also on the modes of transport used by employees.\n\n## Purchasing and procurement levers\n\nThe purchasing scope represents 88% of scope 3 emissions (nearly 45% purchases of customer and technical equipment,\n\n- 4\n\n35% provision of services and 8% other purchases). Meeting the decarbonization target will require joint action with suppliers in areas such as logistics and production processes, the design and manufacture of products and the provision of services, and the way purchasing is carried out, to leverage both the management of volumes and the carbon intensity of purchases. As part of its global responsible purchasing approach, Orange has implemented a number of initiatives to increase the transparency and traceability of its supply chains' carbon footprint.\n\nThe Group's Purchasing Policy was updated in 2021 to reinforce the integration of environmental transformation challenges and incorporate the decarbonization of activities into its missions (see Section 4.3.2.2.2 Orange's Responsible Purchasing commitments).\n\nOrange held its ninth Suppliers Forum in February 2024, with more than 1,200 suppliers registered to attend. This annual event the Group hosts for its ecosystem provided an opportunity to highlight the challenges Orange would like to address with its partners. These challenges relate to performance, in terms of financial and technological competitiveness, and the reduction in the Group's carbon footprint. Key themes were discussed at 11 roundtables and the common thread was to identify the operational levers to be implemented with suppliers: stronger rules on human rights and  Orange's  inclusive  purchasing  goals;  explanation  of  the CSR criteria now taken into account when selecting suppliers; implementation of circular business models; improvement in the energy performance of technical equipment; explanation of the standardized  methodologies  being  developed  to  measure  the equipment's carbon footprint (networks and IT equipment, devices, as well as upstream and downstream transportation), etc.\n\nOrange, a founding member of the JAC, actively contributes to its working groups that are dedicated to combating climate change and developing the circular economy in the production chain (see Section 4.3.2.2.4 Supplier selection and audit process to ensure compliance with Orange's responsible purchasing commitments).\n\nOrange's approach is to work closely with its suppliers during learning and maturation phase. To date, several calls for tender have  included  environmental  requirements  (life  cycle  analysis, carbon reduction target, or energy efficiency target). These actions are reflected in life cycle analysis updates, which make it possible to obtain more accurate emission factors for the scope 3 calculation. As a result of the joint work between the Finance & Performance, Innovation and Group CSRdivisions, in late 2022 Orange decided on new rules that factor the CSR score into responses to calls for tenders (see Section 4.3.2.2.4 Supplier selection and audit process to  ensure  compliance  with  Orange's  responsible  purchasing commitments).  The  operationalization  of  this  rule  began  with all stakeholders in mid-2023 for application to all calls for tender coordinated by BuyIn, the JV between Orange and Deutsche Telekom, during the first half of 2024.\n\nFor on-site work on customer premises or on the network, initiatives to improve operational efficiency reduce both the volume of on-site work and its carbon impact. The key levers are the automation of fault diagnostics and repair (where possible), programs to optimize on-site  times  for  service  providers  and  their  commitments  to decarbonize the work carried out for Orange. In addition, Orange is actively involved in electrification tests for service vehicle fleets (electric commercial vehicles with batteries or green hydrogen fuel cells).\n\n## Circular economy levers\n\nThe  circular  economy  plays  a  key  role  in  the  Group's decarbonization, potentially contributing between 20% and 30% to the scope 3 emissions reduction target by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4 -\n\nSeveral circular economy actions are in place:\n\n- -with a view to continuous improvement to reduce the carbon intensity of customer equipment such as networks and IT, eco-design  based  on  life  cycle  analysis  is  integrated  into Orange's  product  and  service  development  processes. This reduces carbon emissions during the manufacture of equipment and energy consumption during their use. Orange is working with its suppliers to improve the eco-design of its equipment, whether for products designed by Orange (Livebox, SetTopBox) or for network and IT equipment, by introducing a circular economy score in the CSR criteria used in calls for tender. For the own-brand electronic equipment it designs, Orange is developing innovative solutions that can meet the objectives of implementing the circular economy and optimizing the consumption of resources, including energy;\n- -Orange is working on increasing the service life of customer and employee devices and of network and IT equipment to reduce purchase volumes;\n- -for network and IT system equipment in particular, in 2018 Orange  launched  a  program  aimed  at  creating  the  right operating conditions for circularity (4Rs principle: reduce, reuse, repair, recycle). This approach combines financial performance and environmental performance with specific demands placed on our suppliers. Within the GSMA, Orange helped draft a white paper (1) titled Circular economy for Network & IT, published in March 2022, which makes nine industry recommendations to extend the service life of network equipment by including them in a reuse, refurbishment and repair model. In 2023, two of the recommendations of the white paper were developed further:  these  involve  simplifying  the  Life  Cycle  Analysis (LCA)  methodology,  in  line  with  the  work  of  the  ITU  and NGME, organizations in which Orange technical experts are stakeholders, and analyzing the challenges and difficulties of creating a shared marketplace, a sign of the mass expansion of the circular economy within the industry. To guide its actions in this area, Orange relies on the OSCAR (Orange Sustainable & Circular Ambition for Recertification) program to develop an ecosystem promoting longer service life through the extension of hardware and software maintenance times, the possibility of subsidiaries reusing each other's equipment and the purchase of refurbished equipment. In addition, Orange is planning the decommissioning of equipment for reuse within the Group and coordinating the internal 'marketplace' for refurbished equipment. (see Section 4.2.3.2.2 Opportunity for Orange to make savings or avoid investments);\n- -for its equipment, Orange has been implementing Livebox and SetTopBox recovery and refurbishment processes for years. It is also developing the sale to its customers of refurbished devices in Europe, as well as repair services with the 'Re' program. The development of equipment leasing plans and new business models also contributes to reducing the impacts of services with all actors in the value chain. As part of its circular economy initiatives, Orange Business launched the Circular Mobility service in early 2024, the first telecom service with an AFNOR-verified carbon emission reduction claim. In addition, as part of the 'Re' program in European countries, Orange is promoting the sale of refurbished devices to its customers, thereby reducing the carbon intensity of the equipment sold to them.\n\n## O'GREEN supply chain program levers\n\nIn 2019, Orange set up a supply chain program O'GREEN, designed to target and stimulate the roll-out of several action plans aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of the supply chain.\n\nCoordination, training and support are provided by the Group Supply Chain Center of Excellence to the local supply chains of Orange entities participating in the program.\n\nThe program covers eight European countries (France, Spain, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Moldova, Belgium and Luxembourg), as well as four countries in the MEA region (Egypt, Morocco, Senegal and Jordan). In total, this represents more than 90% of the subsidiaries' combined revenue. In the short term, the aim is for other countries with significant purchasing volumes - such as C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Mali - to join the program. Over the 2019-2022 period, a 10% reduction in emissions was achieved for the calculated scope.\n\n## The action plans include:\n\n- -measurement of the carbon footprint of distribution flows: for its downstream distribution supply flows from warehouses to stores or to its customers, Orange assesses the carbon footprint  of  all  customer  equipment  distribution  flows  and energy  consumption  in  logistics  warehouses,  excluding Orange Business. This assessment is carried out using an external BEC (Bearing Point Emissions Calculator) tool and the results are aggregated in a dedicated information system. In 2023, the footprint measurement scope was expanded to include network equipment flows in France and Poland and to return and refurbishment flows (reverse logistics) of customer equipment in France and Spain. The MEA region has been expanded with two new countries: Senegal and Jordan;\n- -plans  to  reduce  the  carbon  impact  of  flows:  these  range from  transport,  with  the  inclusion  of  contractual  clauses setting CO 2 emission reduction targets for carriers in France, the commitment to specific government-backed environmental programs, such as the Fret 21 program backed by ADEME (Agence de l'Environnement et de la Ma\u00eetrise de l'\u00c9nergie the French Environment and Energy Management Agency) in France, and the delivery of products sold by Orange using low-emission  vehicles  in  France,  Belgium  and  Slovakia  or vehicles that run on biogas or other alternatives to diesel in France  and  Belgium,  to  alternative  solutions  for  'last  mile logistics,' with the promotion of locker deliveries in Poland and Romania, for example. These measures are enhanced by initiatives to reduce overpacking (Expeready project in France) or use reusable cardboard packaging - a solution adopted by all countries in Europe - and to reduce energy consumption in warehouses, by installing LED lighting, motion sensors and temperature sensors in Poland.\n\n## Estimating the impact of major decarbonization levers\n\nThese  levers  are  taken  into  account  in  the  development  of scope 3 pathways for 2025 and 2030.\n\nOrange has built a carbon model of its activities to quantify the impact of decarbonization levers, with the following observations compared to 2020:\n\n- -the business development forecasts, in line with the Group's projections for a fall in CAPEX, include a reduction in transaction volumes  (purchases  of  devices  and  equipment,  network roll-out). These factors reduce the carbon footprint, all other things being equal;",

        "page_content": "- -the  decarbonization  of  the  Group's  energy  supply  is  an important lever for reducing the carbon footprint;\n- -for  scope 3,  Orange's  internal  levers  make  it  possible  to reduce equipment flows beyond business-related changes (for servicing, operational efficiency and decommissioning, RAN sharing, extension of the lifespan of equipment, frequency of roll-outs) and replace equipment flows with low-carbon flows (smartphones, Liveboxes, refurbished network and IT equipment);\n- -for scope 3, the decarbonization of equipment manufacturing processes and service provision is another lever on a similar scale that Orange can influence (see purchasing, procurement and circular economy levers);\n- -lastly,  a  downward  trend  was  observed  for  levers  that are  completely  external  to  the  Group,  mainly  through  the decarbonization of the electricity mix in the countries where Orange operates (impact on emissions linked to the use of equipment sold).\n\nThe current modeling of decarbonization levers is still incomplete and therefore does not cover the entire reduction that the Group must make by 2030. Work to identify the levers is ongoing and the assumptions that Orange has made for the decarbonization of suppliers are still conservative. Orange is working with its suppliers and peers to fully quantify the changes in its value chain.\n\n## 4.2.3.1.2 Climate change adaptation plans\n\nThe first study that classified the impacts linked to climate change was conducted according to three time horizons of impact (within three years, between three and ten years and beyond ten years) and five categories:\n\n- -impacts on infrastructure, such as service interruptions or deteriorating quality of service. This category encompasses physical impacts and the most significant impacts for Orange;\n- -economic  and  financial  impacts,  such  as  supply  chain disruptions, rising energy costs, increased insurance premiums or reduced risk coverage. This category includes major key impacts within three years;\n- -strategic impacts causing uncertainty about the business model and Orange brand promises, such as service interruptions or supply disruptions;\n- -regulatory impacts making it difficult to be in compliance, an increase in the number of obligations and potentially, as a result, in the number of claims for compensation;\n- -the human and social impacts, such as increased geopolitical instability or difficulties in ensuring the health and safety of people.\n\nRisks are classified into two categories, physical risks and transition risks.\n\n## The impacts of physical risks\n\nPhysical risks essentially affect network infrastructure, buildings and people directly. Orange has made it a priority to guarantee the health and safety of the people working for and with the Group. The  asset  protection  measures  and  preventive  actions  to  be implemented aim to avoid or control the destruction of technical infrastructures, stores and other buildings, or to guarantee their access and use on a permanent or temporary basis.\n\nIn 2020, the Group conducted a study on the physical risks related to its activities in a scenario of global warming of more than 3\u00b0C in 2100 compared to the pre-industrial era. The study, initially carried out on the France scope, consisted of reviewing impacts recorded\n\n- 4\n\nin the past according to climatic hazards and network components (Data centers, optical or subscriber connection nodes, cables, poles, antennas, etc.). Climate sensitivity thresholds were thus identified, focusing on the most likely risk hazards. These climate risk hazards were then projected according to two time horizons (2030 and 2050), based on data from M\u00e9t\u00e9o France. The study was subsequently extended to the other countries in which the Group operates, with the same projection of climate hazards to 2030 and based on data from five climate hazards used in the IPCC's work (gradual increase in temperature, heat waves, droughts, rise in sea level, heavy rains and floods).\n\n## The impacts of transition risks\n\nTransition-related risks are similarly significant and require the implementation  of  adaptation  measures.  This  is  the  case,  for example, for securing supplies (network equipment, devices, poles, and other goods and services, including energy) with an adapted responsible purchasing policy (see Section 4.2.3.1.1 Climate change mitigation plans) and for transport and delivery circuits evolution. It also requires rethinking the balance between preventive and curative maintenance, as well as the energy mix of carbon-based sources and renewable sources. In addition, Orange is facing changes in the insurance market, with a decrease in coverage capacity.\n\n## Financial quali/fication of physical risks\n\nIn 2022, the Group carried out an initial financial estimate of the physical risks linked to climate change, using the 2050 horizon and a global warming scenario updated by the IPCC taking into account the physical risks with global warming above 4\u00b0C in 2100 compared to the pre-industrial era, and economic risks (SSP5-8.5 scenario). Orange's countries of operation have been classified according to their level of exposure, with a focus on strategic countries (representing more than 1% of Group revenues). The analysis was limited to the study of some infrastructures controlled by Orange and therefore did not include its direct or indirect dependencies (suppliers, energy networks, etc.). This estimate was thus refocused on the most 'sensitive' assets, those affecting a large number of customers, namely Data centers and submarine cable landings, and on three types of hazards: droughts leading to the shrinkage and swelling of clay soils, which can impact Data centers by causing soil destabilization, cracks and even the collapse of buildings, thus causing service interruptions for many customers and data loss; flooding of Data centers due to overflowing waterways and run-off from heavy rainfall, which can also cause service disruption for many customers and data loss; and coastal flooding, which can inundate Data centers and submarine cable landing points. In this sense, the most exposed Data centers have been identified in five countries, and the impact of their reconstruction has been estimated at more than 100 million euros. For facility flooding due to a rise in the sea level, there is not enough data available to establish that Data centers and landing points are at risk.\n\nTo further its knowledge of the exposure of its sites and infrastructure to climate hazards, Orange has launched a project in association with a specialist firm with climate expertise. It has acquired an analysis tool to determine the exact risk exposure of the Group's main infrastructure (around 1,000 Group sites worldwide will be analyzed). To conduct the analysis, three IPCC scenarios were selected (including SSP5 8.5, recommended by the CSRD), with three milestones: 2030, 2040 and 2050. Orange will thus have a vision of the climate risks and impacts for the entire Group over the medium, long and very long term. The climate analysis will consider three complementary approaches: a site-based approach (which will be used for priority sites, for example); a broader, regionalized approach for other sites; and an approach based on mesh networks as a whole.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The pilot should help identify the information needed to assess the vulnerability of sites and infrastructure to each of the climate hazards and to facilitate the construction of adaptation plans. The pilot should also clarify what type of organization countries need to put in place to prepare and monitor the plans. This is due to be rolled out to all Group regions by the end of 2024, so that quantified adaptation plans for local physical risks can be ready by early 2025.\n\n## Physical risk management\n\nOrange  has  a  Business  Continuity  Management  (BCM)  policy that aims to protect all the organization's activities. It builds the solutions to continue the most critical activities or resume them after an interruption caused in particular by climate change; it is operationally based on a business continuity management system, which  is  periodically  reviewed  and  approved  by  each  entity's General Management.\n\nThe  BCM  policy  of  the  Orange  group  applies  the  ISO/IEC 22301 standard  on  security  and  resilience,  and  supplements it  with  the  Group's  own  principles.  Its  governance  at  Group level is delegated to the Group Security Department (SECD). It covers the following areas: health, safety and security of people, security of tangible and intangible assets, information security and environmental security. Orange has designed its continuity plan in line with the GSMA (1) recommendations, which list the risks that operators must take into account and the key elements to consider when preparing their disaster response. The GSMA guide highlights the best industry practices to prepare for sudden natural disasters and is enhanced with case studies.\n\nThe Group also relies on ITU standard L. 1506, which describes the framework of climate change risk assessment for telecommunication and electrical facilities. It includes a risk assessment methodology and considerations for applying this methodology.\n\n## 4.2.3.1.3 Environmental compliance risk management\n\n## Facilities classified for environmental protection\n\nOrange  uses  certain  facilities,  products  and  substances  that may present environmental risks (even minor), some of which are subject to specific regulations. This is the case, for example, of fuel tanks, generators or cooling towers. In France, facilities classified for environmental protection (FCEP) are thus subject to enhanced monitoring through periodic regulatory inspections, as well as preventive and curative maintenance programs set up by the Group to supplement this regulatory oversight. The roll-out of the Environmental Management System and ISO 14001 certification audits also make it possible to ensure compliance with regulations and related controls.\n\n## Hazardous substances\n\nSome  facilities  use  regulated  products  or  substances.  These include chlorofluorocarbons (commonly known as CFCs) or other refrigerants (more specifically HCFCs or HFCs) contained in air conditioning systems.\n\nOrange requires its suppliers to comply with the European REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) regulation,\n\nand implements the necessary means to inform its customers about the presence of hazardous substances.\n\nOrange contractually requires its suppliers to apply the European RoHS II (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) directive to all products subject to it, including outside Europe, thus meeting specific producers' or distributors' obligations to limit the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (see Section 4.2.2.2 Roll-out of the environmental commitment within the Group and raising awareness).\n\n## Provisions for environmental risk\n\nIn accordance with its relevant accounting policies, Orange does not recognize provisions for the asset impairment losses that the company may incur as a result of adverse weather conditions, insofar as potential losses resulting from weather events depend on the occurrence of uncertain future events that are beyond the company's control.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Group  believes  that  its  activities  as  a telecommunication operator do not pose any serious direct risks to the environment. The Group's activities do not entail production processes  with  a  severe  impact  on  scarce  or  non-renewable resources, natural resources (water or air) or biodiversity, and in most cases do not involve any lethal risks. For this reason, no provision for environmental risk is made in the Group's financial statements.\n\nHowever, a provision is recognized to cover the dismantling costs (on a per-unit basis for poles, devices and telephone booths, and per site for mobile antennas) incurred by the Group to meet its environmental obligations (see Note 2.5.3 Accounting policies, use of judgment and estimates for consideration of the climate change risks, and Note 8.7 Dismantling provisions to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## 4.2.3.2 Opportunities\n\n## 4.2.3.2.1 customers reduce their environmental\n\n## Opportunity for Orange to help footprint\n\nOrange is developing innovative solutions for agriculture, cities and shared mobility that can satisfy the objective of implementing circular economy principles and optimizing energy consumption (see Section 4.3.3.4.5 Offering inclusive services that complement connectivity).\n\nOrange also offers and implements tools that significantly improve climate change monitoring and raise public awareness (see Section 4.2.6 Other environmental issues).\n\n## Catalog of Orange Business's bundled 'Sustainability portfolio' offers\n\nIn 2021, Orange Business (see Section 1.4.4  Orange Business) started  to  identify,  in  its  activity  portfolio,  the  products  and service offers which allow its Enterprise customers to reduce their environmental footprint, based on a customer case study or on types of offers selected by the industry as a solution to reduce the environmental footprint. These assessments are part of the Group's gradual alignment with the recommendations of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures).",

        "page_content": "Through this approach, it was possible to identify Orange Business's revenues linked to this selection of offers and services in excess of 1 billion euros in 2023, as well as in 2022 and 2021. The offers selected are listed below.\n\n- -digital information exchange solutions:\n- -secure certified data exchange solutions (trusted data), useful for setting up a circular economy involving different industry players,\n- -teleworking and conference bridge solutions, highly secure virtual rooms;\n- -solutions focused on innovation in the design of products and services:\n- -eco-design  of  website  and  mobile  app  software developments,\n- -eco-management of mobile phone fleets: introduction of a B2B refurbished mobile phone offer, a longer offer life cycle, integration of recycling into the offer's design, and mobile phone fleet leasing offers,\n- -virtualization of private infrastructures;\n- -IoT (Internet of Things) solutions:\n- -Smart Eco \u00c9nergie to monitor and optimize the energy performance  of  the  building  portfolio.  In  France,  this solution enables compliance with the tertiary decree of the ELAN Law. This decree imposes a reduction in energy consumption of 40%, 50% and 60% respectively by 2030, 2040 and 2050 for all office buildings larger than 1,000 m\u00b2, i.e. 17% of national energy consumption,\n- -the Oc\u00e9an Fleet Management solution to optimize the use of vehicle or boat fleets,\n- -smart metering: preventive management and detection of flow anomalies, monitoring of resource consumption, preservation of natural capital (avoiding water leaks, forest fires, control of environmental parameters such as air and water quality, etc.),\n- -better waste management (recycling rate), by optimizing the location of collection points, for example.\n\nTo  promote  the  use  of  digital  technology  to  help  protect  the environment, in November 2022 Orange Business thus partnered with Bearing Point to publish a booklet summarizing eight customer case studies for connected devices, with an estimated impact of their environmental benefits.\n\nTo be able to measure the positive impact of a digital service, it is necessary to quantify the environmental impact of providing that service. In 2023, Orange Business modeled the carbon impact of 30% (in value terms) of the services in its portfolio so that it could meet the demands of its customers in this respect. The aim is to model the carbon impact of 60% of services by 2024.\n\n## Environmental consulting and audit\n\nVarious Orange entities (Orange Consulting, Orange Innovation, Business & Decision, Sofrecom) are working together to support customers  in  their  environmental  transformation,  offer  them the  opportunity  to  optimize  their  carbon  footprint  and  their environmental  footprint  more  generally  by  taking  into  account the impacts on biodiversity or those related to waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), and enable them to take the environment into account in their investment decisions.\n\n- 4\n\nOrange and its subsidiary Sofrecom are helping customers define their  CSR  strategy,  introduce  an  Environmental  Management System based on standards (e.g. ISO 14001, ISO 50001) and implement the circular economy. Orange Business carries out projects on behalf of its customers aimed at improving the energy efficiency of network and IT equipment and implementing new business models based on circularity, eco-design and end-of-life management of equipment (refurbishment and recycling of WEEE).\n\nOrange, through its subsidiary Orange Consulting, also helped several  towns  and  cities  in  2023  define  and  implement  their responsible  digital  strategy  (governance,  WEEE  and  circular economy, purchasing). It leverages data as an environmental tool, for example by setting up an energy observatory to promote the green transition and manage costs.\n\nLastly, Orange tested an impact assessment on several case studies using ITU recommendation L. 1480: Enabling the Net Zero transition: Assessing how the use of information and communication technology solutions impact greenhouse gas emissions of other sectors.\n\n## Building awareness among B2C customers to create a responsible digital world\n\nOrange promotes simple, essential and useful ways that B2C customers can help save energy, raw materials, land and water (1) . Examples include:\n\n- -essential eco-gestures: switching mobile phones to use Wi-Fi at home or in the office; turning off electronic devices when not in use; enabling power saving mode for customers with Livebox 6 or Livebox 7;\n- -useful eco-gestures: doing more to save energy (disabling automatic video playback in the app's settings, reducing the quality of videos on social media, deleting unwanted emails and photos or large attachments);\n- -extending the lifetime of devices is also greener: keeping them for as long as possible and having them repaired; prioritizing recycling.\n\nIn 2023, the Sustainable Markets Initiative awarded Orange the Terra Carta 2023 Seal, which recognizes global companies that are actively leading the charge to create a climate and nature-positive future.\n\n## Energy services offered by Orange in the MEA region\n\nOrange provides clean and affordable energy in Africa & Middle East by making energy from its own solar power systems available to local communities. Orange is therefore turning its telecom structures into mini-grids (decentralized electric grids) with consumption and payment  managed  remotely.  The  Group  has  also  designed  a range of solar kits enabling everyone to have an energy solution to suit their needs and budget (see Section 4.3.3.4.5.2 Access to electricity).\n\n## Services offered by Orange to face extreme weather events\n\nOrange, an essential infrastructure provider, also contributes to the implementation of prevention solutions and emergency services to enable authorities to face extreme weather events. Orange relies on recommendations L. 1500 (2) , L.  1501 (3) , L.  1503 (4) , drafted by the ITU and to which the Group has contributed. In relation to this, Orange has implemented, in the European countries where the Group is a carrier, a real-time alert system for populations located\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The objective is to be able to send notifications by radio waves (4G 'cell broadcast' technology) to the phones of people located in the immediate vicinity of a natural disaster, a major accident or a dangerous situation. The FR-Alert system has been in place since June 2022 throughout the entire Orange France metropolitan network and in part of the overseas networks (R\u00e9union, Mayotte and the Caribbean). The BE-Alert system to which Orange Belgium contributes has been available to all Belgian authorities since 2017. The other European countries in which the Group is present, which used to use a national or local SMS alert system, will gradually migrate to this technology which offers greater resilience.\n\n## 4.2.3.2.2 Opportunity for Orange to make savings or avoid investments\n\n## Energy efficiency and hedging program\n\nWherever it operates, the Orange group seeks to improve its energy efficiency by leveraging energy savings, resulting in lower energy costs.\n\nForward electricity purchases (hedging) are made with the aim of decarbonizing and purchasing at the best possible price while maintaining the predictability of expenditure. Hedging transactions are carried out, when the markets allow it, at maturities Y+1, Y+2 and beyond, supplemented by purchases in the less than one year category. The Group's governance manages these purchases by setting price/volume targets for country subsidiaries so that they can identify purchase opportunities and limit risks. The use of PPAs is an integral part of the purchasing strategy in Europe, allowing subsidiaries in the region to access low-carbon energy, improving price visibility over the term of the PPA and decoupling purchase prices from changes in the electricity market.\n\n## OSCAR (Orange Sustainable & Circular Ambition for Recertification) program\n\nThe OSCAR program, which focuses on extending the service life of technical equipment used by Orange, and its reuse and recovery within the Group, is based on:\n\n- -collaboration and requirements with regard to its equipment suppliers in order to measure and reduce their impact on natural resources and build an ecosystem favoring re-use in order to ensure the availability of refurbished equipment; Orange is working on the contractual commitment of suppliers to provide refurbished equipment (to date, Nokia, Ericsson and Juniper are officially committed to Orange) and has been able to leverage its partnerships with BuyIn (purchasing consortium with Deutsche Telekom for network and IS equipment) and the JAC (Joint Alliance for CSR, alliance between operators initially created to pool supplier audits and whose functions have been expanded to the implementation of circular economy principles in the supply chain);\n- -planned decommissioning for reuse within the Group and the coordination of the internal 'market place' for refurbished equipment.\n\nAs  such,  the  program  makes  it  possible  to  save  on  CAPEX (purchase of refurbished equipment at a lower price than the price of new equipment) and avoid new investments in equipment already available within the Group.\n\nSeveral projects were launched in 2023 to:\n\n- -refine the list of eligible equipment in view of the product-specific conditions;\n- -define  the  decommissioning  and  destocking  processes  in order to give more visibility to the equipment available from the Group's other subsidiaries or externally.",

This performance was achieved as a result of energy consumption management and the continued use of electricity from renewable sources.\n\nPreviously published 2022 emissions amounted to 1,244,830 metric tons  of CO 2 eq  (market-based);  the  2022  comparable  base  of 1,313,371 metric tons of CO 2 eq takes into account the change in scope due to the acquisition of the operator Voo in Belgium in 2022, at 3,272 metric ton increase in CO 2 eq, and adjustments in energy consumption, particularly in the MEA region, at 65,268 metric tons of CO 2 eq.\n\nThere are three factors behind the 225,120 metric ton decrease in CO 2 eq (market-based) between 2023 and 2022 on a comparable basis: 34,281 metric ton increase due to the increase in energy consumption in the MEA region (stability of energy consumption at the Group level) and the breakdown evolution between different types of energy; the slight deterioration by 3,063 metric tons in the countries' scope 2 emission factors; and above all the sharp increase in electricity from renewable sources due to Orange's energy policy (in Poland and Romania) with a 262,465 metric ton decrease.\n\nThe Group's scopes 1 and 2 CO 2 eq emissions (location-based) reached 1,545,445 metric tons in 2023, i.e. a 4% increase from 2022 on a comparable basis.\n\nIn  2023,  the  Group's  scopes 1  and  2 energy  consumption was 5,700 GWh (+0.4% versus 2022 on a comparable basis). This consumption includes 4,860 GWh of electricity, including 1,408 GWh of electricity from renewable sources, thanks to the implementation of various Orange programs, which corresponds to 29% of total electricity consumption. This percentage has risen significantly (+10 points) from 2022 on a comparable basis.\n\nGrowing digitization of society, a trend that has accelerated since the global health crisis, once again had significant effects on traffic this year. The sharp increase in network traffic has a direct impact on mobile energy consumption due to the installation of additional capacity to relieve the traffic. The rise in energy consumption in the network and IS was only 3% between 2023 and 2022 on a comparable basis due to the effectiveness of the energy efficiency and network capacity management programs. A sharp fall was also observed in building-related energy consumption (down 17% between 2023 and 2022 on a comparable basis), together with a slight increase in vehicle-related energy consumption (1% between 2023 and 2022 on a comparable basis). The changes compared to 2015 in building- and vehicle-related energy consumption show sharp decreases, pointing to the effectiveness of the programs implemented (energy consumption reduction of 38% in buildings and of 27% in vehicles between 2015 and 2023 at Group level).\n\nFor  the  major  energy-consuming  and CO 2 -equivalent-emitting countries:\n\n- -in  France  (45%  of  the  Group's  energy  consumption  and 16% of its market-based scopes 1 and 2 CO 2 eq emissions in 2023), the stability of energy consumption in 2023 versus 2022 on a comparable basis (up +0.2%) was mainly due to the increase in energy consumption related to the networks and information system, which was kept under control at 2% as a result of efficiency improvement actions (use of standby mode  and  upgrades  to  mobile-access  networks)  and  the decommissioning of legacy networks, and despite the increase\n\n- 4\n\nin the number of mobile sites with coverage of rural areas, the continued roll-out of 4G and the gradual ramp-up of 5G. Building-related energy consumption fell by 11%, mainly due to a milder winter; vehicle-related consumption was also down 2%. Like energy consumption, CO 2 emissions were stable (down 0.2%) on a comparable basis, mainly due to energy consumption management;\n\n- -in  Poland  (10%  of  energy  consumption  and  11%  of  the Group's market-based scopes 1 and 2 CO 2 eq emissions in 2023), the 7% decline in energy consumption in 2023 versus 2022 represents an acceleration. This was due to energy consumption management of the networks and information system, as a result of the continuation of both the legacy network decommissioning plan (copper telephone network, ATM technology, etc.) and the energy efficiency action plans, including the implementation of Big Data solutions to control and manage electricity consumption, the use of standby mode in mobile-access networks during the night and the upgrading of the technical environment with the installation of free cooling. The other contributing factor was the significant decline in building-related  energy  consumption  (down  49%). CO 2 eq emissions fell sharply by 64% thanks to energy consumption management  and,  in  particular,  to  the  increasing  use  of renewable energy under Orange's programs, at 374 GWh in 2023 compared with 60 GWh in 2022, despite the adverse energy mix trend in Poland in 2023;\n- -in Egypt (6% of energy consumption and 12% of the Group's market-based scopes 1 and 2 CO 2 eq emissions in 2023), energy consumption fell slightly in 2023 (-1%), mainly due to  energy  consumption  management  of  the  network  and information system (+1%). The reduction in CO 2 eq emissions (down 18%) can be attributed mainly to the significant reduction in emissions from the network and information system (down 18%), due to the purchase of renewable electricity certificates, as well as from buildings and vehicles (down 25%);\n- -in Morocco (4% of energy consumption and 14% of the Group's market-based scopes 1 and 2 CO 2 eq emissions in 2023), energy consumption rose by 8% in 2023, driven by the increase in consumption of the network and information system. The 8% rise in CO 2 eq emissions can be attributed mainly to the increase in energy consumption.\n\n## Scopes 1 and 2 CO 2 emissions reduction target for 2025 in the digital segment\n\nAs part of its Engage 2025 Strategic Plan, Orange has committed to reduce its scopes 1 and 2 CO 2 eq emissions in the digital segment by 30% by the plan's end date, compared to 2015. At end-2023, scope 1 and 2 CO 2 eq emissions in the digital segment stood at 1,088,079 metric tons for the Group. For this scope, Orange reduced its CO 2 eq emissions by 37.4% versus 2015 on a comparable basis. In fact, 2015 base CO 2 eq emissions in the digital segment stood at 1,571,111 metric tons of CO 2 eq in 2022. After integrating the Belgian subsidiary, consolidated by the Group for the first time in 2023, and making several energy consumption adjustments (revisions and/or new estimates), 2015 base CO 2 eq emissions in the digital segment for the 2023 scope amounted to 1,739,390 metric tons. For this new scope, the Group's emissions reduction increased from 24.5% in 2022 to 37.4% in 2023.\n\nOrange has thus achieved its scopes 1 and 2 CO 2 eq emissions reduction target for 2025 in the digital segment, two years ahead of schedule.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

It relies in particular on new levers, such as the use of artificial intelligence,  advanced  standby  modes,  the  ramp-up  of  active network sharing and the decommissioning of legacy technology.\n\nIn 2023, the energy consumption of the network and the information system  represented  85%  of  the  Group's  total  consumption and  80% CO 2 equivalent  emissions  (consumption  including that of buildings housing network equipment). The action plans implemented made it possible to limit the increase in the Group's energy consumption (scopes 1 and 2) in the network and information system to 3% in 2023 versus 2022 on a comparable basis, despite new roll-outs and a significant increase in traffic in 2023.\n\nThe change in energy consumption for the mobile network is linked to the physical and spectral capacities installed on Orange's networks, which in turn are linked to the extent of coverage and\n\nthe volume of traffic to be routed on the network, as well as the technology used. On the fixed network, energy consumption is proportional to the number of ports (access) and the technology used. The migration of the copper network to fiber technology is positive from an energy standpoint as FTTH access uses 4.75 times less energy per customer than DSL access. In the mobile networks, energy consumption is heavily dependent on installed capacity. Growth in consumption is driven in equal parts by three factors: the increase in 4G capacity, the improvement in 4G coverage, and the implementation of 5G.\n\nFor equivalent use, 5G is critical to curbing growth in energy consumption: a 5G site is five times more energy efficient than a 4G site, under medium load condition with five spectrum bands. Although the addition of 5G automatically translates as an increase in  network  energy  consumption,  it  is  also  an  investment  for managing consumption in view of the steady rise in traffic.\n\nOrange is also gradually adapting the capacity of the 2G and 3G networks downward to their residual uses.\n\nThe table below shows the electricity savings for the different categories in the action plans implemented by Orange at the Group level to improve its energy efficiency (action plan impact on consumption compared with a baseline scenario where these actions are not taken; base year: 2015).\n\n| ITN electricity consumption reduced by action plan category -  (in GWh)                                                            | 2023   | 2022   |   2021 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Equipment upgrade (replacement of equipment with new, more energy-efficient equipment)                                             | 458    | 408    |    405 |\n| Data center program (restructuring of the portfolio, virtualization, natural ventilation,  optimization of mechanical rooms, etc.) | 280    | 249    |    234 |\n| Decommissioning of old technologies                                                                                                | 185    | 165    |    143 |\n| Mobile access network sharing                                                                                                      | 101    | 90     |     91 |\n| Optimization of the technical environment (smart metering, temperature management, restructuring of the equipment stock, etc.)     | 129    | 115    |     84 |\n| Total                                                                                                                              | 1,154  | 1,027  |    957 |\n\nThanks to the Green ITN program, between 2015 and 2023, more than 5.3 TWh of electricity and more than 430 million liters of fuel oil were saved across the Group's networks and information systems scope. These savings prevented the release of at least 4,26 million metric tons of CO 2 over this period. During 2023, the actions taken avoided the consumption of at least 1,154 GWh of electricity and 99 million liters of fuel oil.\n\nThese  results  were  made  possible  by  a  series  of  measures introduced and increased cooperation with equipment suppliers with a view to developing and obtaining highly energy-efficient telecommunication equipment.\n\nSharing  the  network  and  the  technical  environment  of  the mobile-access network, which generates the majority of the energy expenses of the Group's network, is a lever for reducing energy expenses. At the end of 2023, 68% of the radio sites used passive sharing (for both infrastructure and energy), of which 28% used active sharing (expanded to radio access). Based on studies carried out in Poland when active network sharing within the Networks! Joint venture was set up, energy savings of around 30% were recorded.\n\nSimilarly, the increase in new generations of radio technology in the routing of traffic greatly improves energy efficiency, although it does\n\nnot necessarily compensate for the increase in capacity needed to route the growing traffic.\n\nThe rationalization and virtualization of Data centers is continuing, with capacity rationalization and the optimization of the portfolio, their occupancy rate and their energy efficiency. Since 2012, when its first eco-efficient data center was commissioned, Orange has been undertaking large-scale work to build two new Data centers in France, and thus complete the replacement of a dozen Data centers across the country. At equivalent capacity, an eco-efficient data center consumes 30% less than the old ones. Thus, the PUE (Power Usage Efficiency) of a newly installed data center in France is less than 1.3. The average PUE of Data centers installed in France was 1.60 in 2023, compared with 1.62 in 2022, 1.64 in 2021 and 1.65 in 2020. In other European countries, Orange has also begun construction on new eco-efficient Data centers based on the same model, bringing the average PUE in the region's countries to 1.61. In Africa & Middle East, Orange is building new Data centers and continues to upgrade the existing facilities. The solarization program initially rolled out at network sites has been extended to Data centers; several data center solarization projects have been set up in France and elsewhere in Europe, as well as Africa & Middle East, some of which are now operational.",

In France, copper decommissioning trials have already taken place in various towns. The first industrial phase of decommissioning is due to start in early 2025 in a number of towns. For the mobile networks, the Group plans to gradually phase out the 2G and 3G generations in all European Union countries between 2025 and 2030.\n\nThe expansion of metering solutions is continuing, particularly on radio sites; the trials conducted in recent years using machine learning help optimize energy consumption.\n\nIn 2023, innovation efforts were also made on assessing the impact of changes in architecture and traffic on energy consumption. This involved the roll-out of 10G interfaces for optical access (XGS-PON (10 Gigabit Symmetrical PON) technology), 100G for collection and transfer and 400G on the IP core side, IP/optical synergy, etc. These new architectures reduce energy consumption up to 2.5 times for the same quantity of traffic. Similarly, studies were launched on the implementation of specific functionalities, such as placing cards on standby and the phasing out of chassis/cards/ports on fixed equipment.\n\nSince  November 2021,  Orange  has  had  a  next-generation laboratory dedicated to testing solutions to reduce the Group's energy  footprint.  This  is  a  co-innovation  initiative  with  various industrial and academic players.\n\nThis laboratory is focused on different technologies to provide an optimized technical environment that meets the specific needs of each region or country.\n\n## 4.2.4.2.2 Other energy consumption\n\n## Reducing buildings emissions\n\nIn 2023, office buildings represented 9% of the Group's energy consumption and 12% of CO 2 emissions. Building-related energy consumption  and CO 2 emissions  were  down  17%  and  18%, respectively, versus 2022 on a comparable basis. These trends are mainly due to a decrease in France and Poland (see Section 4.2.4 Targets and metrics for climate change - Summary).\n\nVarious actions were taken to improve the energy performance of buildings in France and to reduce CO 2 emissions:\n\n- -the continuation of the optimization plan for office buildings: down 9% per m\u00b2 in 2023 compared to 2022;\n- -the  continuation  of  the  energy  saving  plan,  which  saved 8.8 GWh in winter 2022-2023 and 0.6 GW in summer 2023 as a result of the energy sobriety and efficiency actions carried out:\n- -the  introduction  of  guidance  on  thermal  comfort  and maintenance of the ambient temperature at 19\u00b0C in winter and 26\u00b0C in summer. The milder winter in 2023 also allowed heating consumption to be reduced in office buildings,\n- -boiler start/stop optimized at the start and end of the season,\n- -limitation of the operating range of facilities to reflect site working hours,\n\n- 4\n\n- -management of installations with the analysis of Energy Managers and Data Managers for optimal operation, mainly on large sites;\n- -a  'boiler'  plan  with  a  policy  adapted  to  the  type  of  site (unoccupied, lightly occupied, temporary, long-term owners or tenants), ranging from the shutdown of old boilers to the replacement  of  boilers  with  heat  pumps  or  connection  to district heating;\n- -the  Building  Management  System  (BMS)  program:  BMS installed and upgraded on sites larger than 1,000m\u00b2 (Building Automation  and  Control  Systems  (BACS)  Decree)  with  a multi-year plan;\n- -the installation of more efficient equipment and upgrading of facilities during hardware replacement or site configuration work;\n- -renewable and/or low-carbon energy recommendations for the work to be carried out: district heating or heat pump, free cooling, heat recovery from extracted air, nocturnal ventilation, heat  recovery  from  cooling  units  or  chilled  water  return, photovoltaic panels.\n\n## Reducing transport emissions\n\nThe use of commercial vehicles represents 6% of the Group's energy consumption and 8% of its CO 2 emissions, a slight increase of 1% and 0.3%, respectively, compared to 2022. Orange continues to roll out its action plans aimed at increasing the share of electrified vehicles in its fleet, limiting business travel and promoting collective and shared transport methods.\n\nThe Group has a large fleet of vehicles, with France representing three-fourths of the Group's fleet.\n\nThe size of the fleet in France has been declining at a steady pace of about 5% per year on average since 2015, to stand at 14,500 vehicles at the end of 2023. The aim is to reduce the fleet further, by more than 1,000 vehicles, by 2025. When renewing its fleet, Orange in France is now making it mandatory to avoid diesel technology, which emits fine particles (NO x ), and is boosting the roll-out of electrified vehicles to control its CO 2 emissions.\n\nIn France, Orange was using more than 4,000 electrified vehicles at the end of 2023, a 33% increase in one year. Since the start of the fleet electrification program, more than 1,522 charging points have been installed and networked at 267 Orange sites, now allowing the stations concerned to be supervised and monitored. Each user of Orange's rechargeable electrified vehicles has a web tool and a mobile app, including a map of these charging stations and the ability to book them. Finally, these vehicles are equipped with cards that give them access to a network of 90,000 charging points across France. The Group aims to be equipped with 7,000 electrified vehicles by 2025.\n\nLaunched in 2013 with around 100 vehicles, the car-sharing fleet reached 3,800 vehicles at the end of 2023. It targets a large group of employees and is one of the vectors of fleet electrification. Orange thus has the largest car-sharing fleet in France and Europe, and wishes to continue optimizing this fleet with 6,000 shared vehicles by 2025.\n\nFurthermore, several Group entities have introduced plans to limit or improve the use of private cars (company travel plans, carpooling, car-sharing,  road  risk  management  and  eco-driving  training courses, etc.). For example, in France, Orange SA's Klaxit BlaBlaCar carpooling solution was offered to 27,250 employees, and about 4,500 had signed up as at December 31, 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Orange has around 300 video-conferencing rooms in France\n\nand close to an additional 100 in the rest of the world. This figure is likely to fall given the new collaborative solutions rolled out within the Group.\n\n## 4.2.4.3 Use of electricity from renewable sources\n\nTo meet the scopes 1 and 2 CO 2 emissions reduction target, a growing share of electricity needs will have to be covered by power from renewable sources by the plan's end date. Orange is  prioritizing  additional  electricity  production  from  renewable sources, with Guarantee of Origin certificates as a second choice, and is benefiting from the decarbonization of the energy mix in the countries in which it operates. At the end of 2023, Orange's own actions enabled it to cover 29% of the Group's electricity\n\nconsumption with power from renewable sources, versus 18.8% in 2022 on a comparable basis. These come from PPAs, Guarantee of  Origin  certificates  purchased  on  the  market  ('unbundled'), ESCos, solar farms, and the use of solar power at the sites, totaling 1,408 GWh in 2023. Adding in the change in electricity mix in the countries in which Orange operates, the Group met 46.6% of its electricity needs with power from renewable sources in 2023, versus 37.4% in 2022 on a comparable basis.\n\n| (in %)                                                             | 2023               | 2023               | 2023               | 2023               | 2023               | 2022  comparable  basis   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                    | France (1)         | Rest               | MEA                | Other              | Groupe             | Group                     |\n|                                                                    | of Europe entities | of Europe entities | of Europe entities | of Europe entities | of Europe entities | of Europe entities        |\n| Renewable electricity rate from Orange                             | 2.9%               | 83.6%              | 18.3%              | 27.5%              | \uf0fc\uf0fc 29.0%           | 18.8%                     |\n| Renewable electricity rate  from country mix                       | 23.8%              | 4.1%               | 21.1%              | 18.3%              | 17.7%              | 18.6%                     |\n| Total renewable electricity rate  in total electricity consumption | 26.7%              | 87.8%              | 39.5%              | 45.9%              | \uf0fc\uf0fc 46.6%           | 37.4%                     |\n\n- (1) The France scope covers Orange France, the Group's Corporate functions in France, and the Orange Business entities operating in the country.\n- The coverage rate for the reporting on the percentage of electricity from renewable sources is 97.6% of Orange's 2023 consolidated revenues, compared with 97.9% in 2022.\n- \uf0fc\uf0fc Item reviewed by an independent third party: reasonable assurance .\n\nIn  Europe,  Orange  prioritizes  the  use  of  long-term  renewable electricity contracts at a known price (Power Purchase Agreement PPA). At the end of 2023, the Group had thus entered into PPAs for a total capacity of around 1,000 GWh per year by 2025, i.e. around 27% of estimated electricity consumption in this region by 2025.\n\nIn  addition,  some  European  entities  have  used  energy  from renewable  sources  for  their  electricity  supply  by  purchasing Guarantee of Origin (GO) certificates from their providers: this was the case in 2023 for Orange Belgium (for 100% of its scope 2 electricity consumption), OB International (for 35%), Orange Moldova (27%), Orange Romania (35%) and Orange Slovensko (72%).\n\nIn the MEA region, Orange has rolled out an extensive solar energy program, with more than 7,500 mobile sites in 17 countries equipped to power the Group's infrastructure with photovoltaic solar panels at the end of 2023 (compared with 7,200 sites at the end of 2022). This represents more than 18% of all mobile sites in the MEA region. The program is carried out either through investments by Orange itself or through ESCo outsourcing programs (Solar as a Service).\n\nIn the latter cases, the aim is to outsource investments in, and installation, upgrading and operational management of, electricity generating  infrastructure  with  a  view  to  optimizing  electricity consumption,  supply  reliability,  its  environmental  impact  and energy costs. These projects have been rolled out in nine countries in  the  MEA  region:  Burkina  Faso,  Cameroon,  Central  African Republic, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Madagascar, Senegal and Sierra Leone. The roll-outs are expected to continue in other countries in the region. Orange has undertaken to extend some of these solar fields to benefit neighboring populations, with the first mini-grid operational in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in November 2021. A solarization program for Data centers and strategic technical sites has also been launched: 22 sites now have solar power, with an installed capacity of 3,000 kWp.\n\nThis program is supplemented by the implementation of hybrid generator/battery sites, significantly reducing the consumption of fuel oil thanks to the optimization of the process.\n\nOrange is also developing an electricity production program using solar plants. In Jordan, 50% of the electricity required for Orange's operations is covered by electricity from three solar plants. This solution will also be rolled out in Mali, with plans to extend it to other countries as soon as the regulatory energy framework allows for self-consumption through energy network transport and distribution (wheeling) to all of Orange's points of consumption.\n\nThrough its own actions, Orange thus has 138 GWh of electricity from renewable sources in the MEA region.\n\nIn Egypt, the government has been offering certificates backed by the production of renewable energy from assets in the country since 2023. Orange Egypt has begun purchasing these types of certificates, which equate to a volume of 71 GWh. The purchases are to be used to invest in new sources of renewable energy.\n\nTaking into account the emission factors for CO 2 derived from the energy mix of these MEA-region countries, these programs made it possible to avoid more than 209,000 metric tons of CO 2 emissions in 2023. This reduces fuel consumption by 78 million liters, i.e. up to 80%, depending on the site.\n\nIn 2023, the technical site solarization program was extended to the partial solarization of office buildings and Data centers, both in the MEA region and in Europe.\n\nFor example, in 2023, Orange implemented an Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) solution to use solar power at the Groupement Orange Services (GOS) located in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, providing pooled hosting and operation services for infrastructure, service platforms and IT to 18 subsidiaries in the MEA region through the installation of a photovoltaic plant, on the roof and on solar canopies for parking lots. The plant, with total installed power of 355 kWp, covers close to 50% of the data center's daytime consumption (7:00 am to 6:00 pm). Other Data centers and strategic sites are powered with solar energy, including in Senegal, Guinea and Cameroon. New contracts of the same type were signed in 2022 to ensure the supply of renewable energy to the Group's main Data centers in Africa: the solarization of Orange's largest data center in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and the largest in Burkina Faso. Other contracts are under negotiation.",

        "page_content": "## 4.2.4.4 Orange estimated scope 3 CO 2 emissions\n\nIn addition to monitoring its scopes 1 and 2 emissions, Orange has assessed its scope 3 emissions since 2020 for the 15 GHG Protocol categories, based on data since 2018. This allows it to identify its priority carbon-related issues for a given activity and its ecosystem, as well as its stakeholders (suppliers, customers and employees), and then to implement appropriate action plans, quantify the improvement in performance over time, and recognize dependencies vis-\u00e0-vis upstream and downstream CO 2 emissions.\n\nBased on its work with the Carbone 4 firm and the Group's divisions, Orange continued to improve the quality of its scope 3 assessments in 2023. This work consisted mainly of gradually replacing monetary flows with physical flows and is part of an iterative process that will be adjusted as the action plan is implemented and the work with suppliers helps improve the accuracy of the emission factors used. This work aims to provide:\n\n- -a more accurate calculation, to facilitate the definition and management of an action plan to reduce Orange's carbon footprint: calculations based as much as possible on physical rather than monetary flows, and use of more accurate emission factors that, to the extent possible, are specific to Orange or its suppliers;\n- -a more operational calculation, to facilitate the updating of the carbon footprint calculations and make the action plan more actionable: carbon footprint calculated from data extracted directly from Orange's tools and, where appropriate, use of an annual flow rather than a portfolio approach;\n- -a more complete calculation, to show a comprehensive picture of the Orange group's emissions so as to ensure it does not rule out any action levers: a fuller scope covering numerous categories compared with the previous estimate (e.g. equipment purchases  from  customers  (tablets,  laptops),  fixed  assets, Orange Business purchases, use of products sold, etc.).\n\nOrange has identified points of contact for data collection and methodology experts for each of the emissions categories.\n\nOrange has accordingly re-assessed scope 3 for 2018 to 2022 (2023 data will not be available before the end of the first half of 2024). In 2020, the Group's total scope 3 emissions were assessed according to the 'monetary' method and came to 7.2 million metric  tons  of CO 2 equivalent  for  2018.  The  new  approach, which incorporates physical flows (see Section 4.2.7.4 Note on methodology - Environment), re-evaluates scope 3 at 6.2 million metric tons of CO 2 eq. This difference is due primarily to the use of physical flows previously expressed by monetary flows, when they are available, and to updates to certain emission factors to better reflect the actual activities (equipment model-based assessment, distinguishing between new and refurbished equipment, product life-cycle analysis, flows of equipment sales or purchases, previously estimated from the portfolio of this equipment, etc.), despite the more  extensive  coverage  in  terms  of  the  entities  considered. Scope 3 for Orange's digital segment, for which Orange's target validated by the SBTi - is a 14% reduction in 2025 versus 2018, rose by 3.7% in 2022 versus the 2018 reference year.\n\nCategory  3.1.  'Purchased  goods  and  services'  (46%  of  total scope 3 emissions) fell by 7% in 2022 compared to the 2018 reference year. This decrease is primarily due to a 1% decline related to a slight reduction in purchases of services, as well as\n\n- 4\n\na  2%  decline  in  purchases  of  customer  premises  equipment (CPE) (Liveboxes, set-top boxes, etc.), stemming mostly from the lower carbon intensity of the new models, and to a 39% decline in smartphone purchases, related to the reduction in the number of new smartphones purchased, mainly in France and Spain.\n\nCategory 3.2. 'Capital goods' (36% of total scope 3 emissions) rose by 22% in 2022 compared to the 2018 reference year. This increase is primarily due to an increase in network purchases (MEA region and Orange Business).\n\nCategories 3.11. and 3.13. 'Use of sold and leased products' (8% of total scope 3 emissions) rose by 15% in 2022 compared to the 2018 reference year. This increase is largely due to greater use of CPE in Poland and Romania, as well as a significant increase in the MEA region in the amount of MBB (Mobile BroadBand) equipment (which allows Internet use on a personal computer via a mobile network equivalent to Internet use via a fixed network) sold in Senegal and Morocco in particular, despite the stagnation or even decline in the carbon intensity of the power grids used.\n\nIt should be noted that the energy resale activity in Poland is included in the reporting scope, although Orange publishes a 'digital segment' report that excludes this activity, as it is not part of the digital segment covered by the Group's target.\n\nOrange has developed an action plan aimed mainly at reducing sales of new devices, implementing circular economy principles in all processes (devices, Liveboxes, etc.), switching from copper to fiber in the fixed networks, drawing on the digital sector's international efforts to reduce its carbon footprint along with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the GSM Association (GSMA) and JAC, and initiating a dialogue with its suppliers so that they will, in turn, make commitments and meet targets for reducing their own scopes 1, 2 and 3 upstream emissions in line with the +1.5\u00b0C trajectories. At the end of 2023, of the 50 largest suppliers by expenditure, 30 suppliers (representing around 60% of the Group's total expenditure (1) ) were committed to the Science Based Targets initiative, 6 with 'committed' status and 24 with 'target set' status.\n\nOrange is developing models to more closely analyze emissions dynamics (mobile devices, Liveboxes, mobile- and fixed-access networks,  core  networks,  Data  centers,  on-site  work,  Orange Business purchases and other service purchases) through 2030, based on different internal and external assumptions, and to reflect these dynamics in emission development scenarios through 2030.\n\n## 4.2.4.5 Implementation of the carbon sequestration program\n\nTo deliver on the Group's commitment to be Net Zero Carbon by 2040, Orange will have to reduce its CO 2 emissions by 90% via the various programs discussed above. Despite all its efforts, there will be residual emissions that cannot be reduced, which Orange will sequester through natural carbon sink systems.\n\nOrange has set a trajectory for the carbon credits it will need by 2040, taking into account the SBTi's recommendations on how to treat these residual emissions over time. Orange has made a voluntary commitment and a pivotal choice to fund natural carbon sink projects, such as reforestation, agroforestry and mangrove restoration, and not just purchase credits on the voluntary carbon market. Given the project selection phase and the time it takes for plantings to grow, the first carbon credits are expected by around 2025-2026. Orange therefore did not have any carbon credits for 2023 from the programs described below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This financing was recently expanded in order to contribute to the major reforestation project in Landes, which was ravaged by a fire in the summer of 2023. The carbon credits that will be generated will be certified by Label bas carbone. In November 2022, Orange also made a commitment, with Sia Partners, to support Plan\u00e8te Urgence in a large-scale project to restore and sustainably manage nearly 1,000 hectares of mangroves in Cameroon. Plan\u00e8te Urgence is coordinating this project, called 'CAMERR,' alongside its local partners and experts, the communities, and the traditional local and national authorities. Cameroon's mangroves have deteriorated, but they play a key role for the local populations in  terms  of  income  and  the  fight  against  climate  change. In addition to its impact on biodiversity and the climate, this project also aims to have a significant social impact on the local communities. Workshops to raise awareness of the value of the mangroves will be organized for children and local residents to give them the resources to care for the mangroves. The project also strives to promote activities that generate sustainable income; In late January 2023, Orange also made a commitment to Canopy Energies to finance part of a project aimed at the\n\nreforestation of 5,500 hectares of degraded land in eastern Madagascar (land that was deforested more than 10 years ago and has not been cultivated since). Pongamia, a fast-growing tree that will be planted on the land, is a naturally occurring species in this country. The aim of the project is to combat soil depletion and erosion, improve the fertility of degraded soils, reproduce, conserve and enhance the status of endemic species, and reduce the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere. The fruit of the Pongamia (beans) will be used to make vegetable oil, which is a biofuel. The production of these beans and their byproducts (oil, meal, etc.) will generate additional economic activity for local communities. The project will promote the use of renewable energy in Madagascar and play a part in the country's energy transition. It also has an important social dimension, contributing to employment and education for local communities;\n\n- -projects  via  fund  structures:  in  2021,  the  Group  joined the  multi-investor  Livelihoods  Carbon  Fund  3 fund  and co-developed its own single-investor Orange Nature fund with Mirova (a Natixis subsidiary), which manages it. With Orange Nature, Orange became the first European company to create a single-investor fund offering a return in kind, in the form of carbon credits and not a financial return. The commitments to these two funds will make it possible to cover most of the  Group's  carbon  credit  needs.  Since  2022,  the  Group has participated in the selection phase for the first projects proposed, in the expert committees, by the two management companies, Livelihoods and Mirova. Given the management companies' expertise in natural capital, the diversification of the future project portfolio (species, geographic locations, etc.), the certification of the projects and the governance implemented, the fund structures offer some level of guarantee as to the various uncertainties that exist with this type of project.\n\nThe project selection criteria and the type of certification allow for alignment with the forthcoming standardization of the voluntary carbon market (see Article 6 of COP26) with, in particular, more and more controls of the quality of the carbon credits put on this market. The certification bodies are not known until the project design document (PDD) is prepared, meaning a few months after the contract is signed.",

The commitments the Group made to the circular economy in the strategic plan are presented in Section 4.2.1.1.2 Commitments with regard to the circular economy.\n\nIn 2023, the Group disposed of 59,886 metric tons of waste (+5% more than in 2022). This increase reflects better waste traceability within the scope in question. This reporting remains closely linked to the regulatory framework and to the way industrial stakeholders are organized, with a lower level of maturity in the MEA region.\n\nTo  enhance  the  quality  and  comprehensiveness  of  its  waste reporting, Orange has formalized a policy and operating procedures to improve the recovery of electronic equipment and batteries and make it more reliable. Orange adheres closely to the classification of the list established in Decision 2000/532/EC1 to ensure compliant and consistent data reporting. In the interests of harmonization, as this classification is not used by recovery service providers in countries in the MEA region, Orange has developed an equivalent framework.\n\nThe tonnage of waste electrical and electronic equipment collected from customers and employees (household WEEE) fell by 30% in 2023, with a 35% reduction for France alone, owing to an improvement in the Livebox refurbishment process.\n\nFor batteries over 3 kg, the sharp increase of 35% in 2023 at the Group level is mainly driven by France (up +30%). This is due to better waste traceability resulting from enhanced learning on the use of Trackd\u00e9chets, a public platform for hazardous waste tracking using electronic documents, as well as the expansion of Belgium's reporting scope.\n\nThe recovery rate for discarded internal hazardous waste was 91.9% in 2023, as the main disposal channels were clearly identified and tracked in European countries. This recovery rate is directly linked to the performance of service providers and their ability to provide a sufficient level of detail to ensure that waste can be tracked from recovery to end-of-life, a key issue for Orange.\n\nWaste treatment facilities are less mature in the MEA region: Orange aims, through its WEEE Clean internal program, to offer recovery and treatment solutions.\n\nThe volume of cable waste depends on the maintenance of the network and the operational projects of each site. In preparation for the decommissioning of copper, two industrial decommissioning trials were conducted in 2023 in several cities in France. The aim was to dismantle the entire copper network, thus contributing to the +17% increase in Orange France's cable waste.",

Orange is working with the UN's UNIDO program to develop a refurbishment channel in Egypt.\n\nThe Group's actions also require that equipment suppliers be asked to do their part, which is why Orange has updated the criteria for evaluating its suppliers' responses to calls for tender to include their ability to conduct life-cycle analyses and recover, refurbish and recycle equipment (see Section 4.3.2.2.4 Supplier selection and audit process to ensure compliance with Orange's responsible purchasing commitments).\n\n## Responsible use\n\nThe 'Re' program was launched in October 2020 in France and then expanded to all European countries in 2023 (with the exception of Spain). It aims to raise customers' awareness and steer them toward recycling, take-backs or purchases of refurbished products to encourage more responsible device consumption.\n\nIn February 2024, Orange Business launched a value proposition based on the circular economy to save 26% to 40% of the CO 2 emissions  related  to  the  purchase  and  use  of  an  enterprise mobile fleet. The method used to calculate the emissions savings has been approved by AFNOR, a first in France (1) (see Section 4.2.3.1.1 Climate change mitigation plans).\n\n## Recovery of used mobile phones\n\nOrange has set a target of recovering the equivalent of 30% of the mobile phones it sells or leases in Europe by 2025.\n\nThe mobile phone recovery rate in the Group's eight European countries  was  25.4%  in  2023,  including  recovery  by  African workshops financed by France, and was 18.8% excluding this recovery by France in Africa. Since 2010, Orange has teamed up with Emma\u00fcs International and Ateliers du Bocage, a company active in social and solidarity employment, to open mobile phone waste recovery workshops in Africa. In the absence of efficient local recycling structures, the recovered waste is amassed and then sent to France for recycling in accordance with European environmental standards. These workshops, which have opened in five countries (Burkina Faso, Benin, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Niger), recovered the equivalent of 480,000 mobile phones in the waste phase for recycling in 2023.\n\nOrange also aims to recover the WEEE equivalent of 20% of the mobile phones it sells or leases in the MEA region by 2025. The subsidiaries in this region have been made aware of this goal and are working with their ecosystems.\n\nThe larger increases in recovery rates in 2023 can be attributed to  awareness-raising  programs  and  attractive  Buyback  offers (in Romania, Belgium and France), such as the 'Re' program in France. This program generated a strong B2C response through eco-responsible recovery initiatives and Buyback offers, particularly during the 'Un No\u00ebl G\u00e9n\u00e9-Re' holiday advertising campaign around refurbished mobile phones.\n\nOrange also encourages the development of mobile device leasing offers among its Enterprise customers. With these offers, it is easier to recover used mobile devices than when they are sold, and to then give them a second life or recycle them. This service was expanded at the end of 2022 from key account customers to the Pro-SME scope in France. The number of devices under leasing contracts with key accounts doubled in 2023.\n\nSince 2010, more than 21 million used mobile phones have been recovered by Orange for refurbishment or recycling.\n\n## Recovery of fixed customer equipment under leases (boxes, set-top boxes, etc.)\n\nOrange is committed to recovering at least 90% of the equipment distributed under leases to B2C and Enterprise customers. It mainly recovered multimedia equipment (in particular, Liveboxes, set-top boxes, optical network terminals (ONTs) and modems) provided to customers who terminated their contract with Orange. This equipment is recovered when customers seek after-sales service, migrate from one product generation to the next, or terminate a contract.\n\nThis initiative comes under the CORE (COllection to REuse) program in Europe, which aims to improve the recovery and reuse of this equipment. It meets an Orange need for cost savings and supply chain resilience during a time of electronic component shortages, price increases, and significant delays in new equipment deliveries.\n\nThe equipment recovered under the CORE program is sorted, tested,  repaired,  reset  and  refurbished  so  it  can  be  reused several times, thereby avoiding the need to make new equipment. Equipment that does not meet the criteria for repair or refurbishment is considered waste (WEEE) and is disposed of through recycling channels so it can be recovered while also ensuring traceability.\n\nOut of the nine Group countries that offer leases on customer equipment, four European countries (France, Spain, Poland and Belgium) continue to mature in terms of recovery, sorting, testing, repairs,  resets,  refurbishment  and  recycling  while  the  other countries (Romania, Slovakia, Moldova, Senegal and Jordan) are starting to develop the structures needed to promote the recovery of this type of equipment.\n\nThe recovery rate at the Group level was 68% in 2023, with more than 3.8 million pieces of equipment recovered in all of these nine countries.\n\nSince 2022, a dashboard tool has been developed and made available to the Group's entities, in order to harmonize the data processing.\n\nEquipment is refurbished by qualified subcontractors in Europe, who are overseen by the Supply Chain and Group Marketing teams in accordance with circular economy principles. In 2023, a total volume of more than 3.5 million pieces of equipment was refurbished and returned to the portfolio.\n\n## Sale of refurbished mobile devices\n\nOrange has set itself the objective of achieving 10% of its phone handset sales in Europe with refurbished devices by 2025. In 2023, all countries in Europe had entered into purchase contracts with suppliers of refurbished mobile devices (mainly Apple-branded and, to a lesser extent, Samsung-branded devices) and were able to offer them to their customers, in a market where demand is growing.\n\nOrange is looking to position itself in this market as a trusted partner by offering its customers quality mobile phones handsets under warranty. To do this, Orange has continued to diversify its sources of  supply,  harmonized  its  refurbished  phone  grading  system (which qualifies the state of the phone), adopted the RECQ quality assurance label in France and conducted systematic quality control in France and Poland.",

        "page_content": "## Giving network equipment a second life (OSCAR program)\n\nThanks to a standardized framework for equipment that facilitates its management, streamlines configurations, and sets new criteria for replacing equipment in the networks, along with the creation of a 'marketplace' to make it easier to reuse equipment both internally at Orange and with external partners, the OSCAR program (see Section 4.2.3.2.2 Opportunity for Orange to make savings or avoid investments) has been active since December 2020. More than 725,000 batches of equipment have been offered for purchase or resale on this marketplace since then, generating 200 million euros in investment savings (CAPEX avoided or saved) for Orange. The value of equipment reused internally rose from 41 million euros in 2022 to 58 million euros in 2023. In 2023, Orange used close to 1% of its ITN active equipment investment budget to purchase refurbished equipment.\n\n## Repair service\n\nBeyond the regulatory obligation to provide a standard warranty service, Orange is committed to developing an 'attractive' repair service in each of the countries in the Europe region to help to extend the useful life of mobile devices outside their warranty periods.\n\nThe attractiveness of this repair service is assessed by Orange according to five criteria: availability of the service on different distribution channels, autonomy given to the customer to carry out diagnostic testing, predictability of the process, visibility of the status of the process, and service continuity with the loan of a mobile phone during repair. In 2023, a criterion relating to the customer's perception of the attractiveness of the repair service was added. This factor takes into account the competitive environment and changes in customer expectations in each country.\n\n## Eco-design of products and services\n\nOrange has made a commitment to implement an eco-design approach for all products marketed under the Orange brand by 2025. Eco-design is one of the levers for reducing the Orange group's carbon emissions and its environmental footprint more generally.\n\nIn 2023, Orange continued to operationalize the approach based on a Group methodological framework and a network of 'operational eco-design experts,' with new products and services and the involvement of the marketing teams. A training course for marketing targets, project managers and their teams was designed in 2023 and will be rolled out in 2024. To date, 260 people have been trained. In addition, a practical guide to eco-design completes the line-up.\n\nIn 2023, an eco-design approach was used for 9,5% of products sold under the Orange brand. Among the pilot projects, Livebox 7, which has been awarded 'Footprint Progress' certification by Bureau Veritas, is one of the latest examples of the Group's efforts to reduce the environmental impact of its products. In 2024, Orange plans to speed up the eco-design of its products with new types of certification and to apply eco-design to services more generally.\n\nTo enable customers to identify the most environmentally friendly mobile phones, Orange has joined forces with other European\n\n- 4\n\noperators to define an 'Eco Rating' index: an overall environmental footprint rating is given to each device based on five aspects: durability, reparability, recyclability, climate efficiency and resource efficiency. This initiative is open to all operators through a licensing contract. It offers customers transparency on the environmental impact of smartphones (which peaks during the manufacturing phase) and is also aimed at encouraging manufacturers to improve the eco-design of their products. By the end of 2023, more than 500 phone models from more than 20 manufacturers had been assigned a rating. The devices for sale in Orange's stores or online are rated in all of the countries in the Europe region.\n\n## 4.2.5.3 Use of scarce and critical resources\n\nTo address the issue of resource depletion, Orange has voluntarily committed  to  monitoring  the  traceability  and  transparency  of rare resources and materials regarded as critical that are used in the equipment and products related to its activity. Initial studies have been conducted around the issue of the amount of ores used  across  the  Group's  purchases.  At  the  sector  level,  the standardization work done by the International Telecommunication Union provides a common reference framework for all players to introduce this emerging reporting practice. The Eco Rating initiative, which Orange has joined, also requires the disclosure of the amount of materials, as well as the percentage that comes from recycling channels, for gold, silver, tin, tantalum, indium and cobalt for each mobile handset analyzed.\n\nSince 2011, Orange has applied a process aimed at taking into account issues associated with the scarce and critical resources used  in  network,  IT  and  customer  equipment:  an  analysis  of dependence on critical materials was carried out in 2011, updated in 2018, with material sheets, and then updated again in 2023, it served as a basis for risk analyses and the search for alternative resources.\n\nDiscussions are held with suppliers to encourage them to limit the use of these resources and favor alternative and recycled resources. In its impact analysis carried out with The Biodiversity Consultancy in 2021 and 2022, Orange more precisely identified the levels of pressure on the use of land (deforestation, loss of habitat, etc.), water consumption, different forms of pollution (by heavy metals, radioactivity, etc.) and eco-toxicity, in addition to the pollution and waste for 14 key minerals in the composition of its equipment. The risk is deemed high for five materials and medium for seven materials, according to this analysis grid.\n\nThe Group has opened discussions with industrial operators in various sectors and public authorities to support the development of efficient channels to exploit the vast reserves of critical resources contained within WEEE that may contain up to 40 times more recoverable minerals than there are underground.\n\nIn 2023, Orange set up an internal working group to assess the material footprint of its assets and define its priority commitments, particularly with regard to issues of sovereignty (see the draft European regulation on critical raw materials of March 16, 2023, also known as the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA)).\n\nOrange is also a member of Circul'R, a coalition of major French companies  pioneering  the  circular  economy,  whose  aim  is  to develop solutions for measuring the circularity of material flows and the environmental, social and economic impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This methodology uses the  MSA.km\u00b2  (mean  species  abundance  per  km\u00b2)  indicator that converts the company's impact to an area where 100% of biodiversity would be lost.\n\nThe study concludes, as was the case for the first assessment conducted by the Group in 2013, that Orange has a low direct impact on biodiversity, with a scope 1 existing land impact of 12 MSA.km\u00b2, scope 2 of 4 MSA.km\u00b2 and a near-zero existing impact for fresh water. These assessments were conducted in 2022 for 2019, the most recent year for which certain data were available. It positions the Group's biodiversity impact, as a proportion of its revenues, at less than half the average impact for scope 1 (land) of all sectors combined. To date, few sectors or companies have conducted an impact study using this methodology. A comparison of Orange's scope 1 impacts with the impacts of the sectors and companies that have undertaken such a study shows that Orange has a low impact on scope 1.\n\nThis  study  also  shows  that  Orange's  primary  existing  impact on biodiversity relates to upstream scope 3, in other words, an indirect impact where the Group has less room for maneuver. The scope 3 existing land impact was thus assessed at approximately 2,400 MSA.km\u00b2 and the existing freshwater impact at approximately 84 MSA.km\u00b2. These assessments were also conducted in 2023 for 2019, the most recent year for which certain data were available. Upstream scope 3 impacts therefore represent more than 99% of the existing impact assessed for the Orange group.\n\nThe upstream scope 3 biodiversity impact corresponds mainly to the impacts of extracting the materials used, in particular, to make fiber optics, mobile network infrastructure, servers, personal computers, boxes and mobile handsets. This includes the impacts associated with land conversions for mining and the pollution from effluents resulting from mining.\n\nWhen the study was conducted, it was estimated that the main impacts came from the mining of copper, gold, silver and tin.\n\nOrange  plans  to  initiate  discussions  with  its  main  equipment suppliers and call on them to take action and reduce their own upstream scope 3 impact on biodiversity.\n\nOrange intends to follow the detailed Science-Based Targets for Nature recommendations, taking into account the conclusions of COP 15, which was held in Montreal (Canada) at the end of 2022.\n\nA positive impact on biodiversity is also one of Orange's selection criteria for new natural carbon sink financing projects.\n\nIn 2023, Orange France signed a partnership agreement with LPO (Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux - the French League for the Protection of Birds) to identify the impacts of its activities on biodiversity. This involves mapping the most endangered bird species and reviewing processes, particularly those related to its network sites, in order to minimize their impact on the way of life of those species (nesting periods, migration, etc.). The partnership will also identify criteria defining the sites eligible for biodiversity protection and label some sites as 'bird sanctuaries,' according to the conditions defined by the LPO.\n\nAt the same time, Orange continues to support programs to better understand the impacts of climate change on biodiversity:\n\n- -as part of a partnership with the CREA (Centre de recherche sur les \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes d'altitude - Research Center for Alpine Ecosystems), through which Orange provides the CREA with its antennas, installed in high mountain areas to install sensors used to collect information on temperatures and levels of snow and ice, as well as the behavior of fauna and flora via photos and videos, on the Alpine Arc. Orange contributes to the processing and presentation of data to the scientific community and the general public, with volunteer employees who maintain the dedicated equipment and participate in observations of the flora and fauna of the Alps. This initiative received an award from the United Nations during COP23, while CREA Mont-Blanc and Orange were recipients of the United Nations Momentum for Change prize;\n- -in partnership with ARGO (an international consortium launched in 2000 by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of  UNESCO  and  the  World  Meteorological  Organization), Orange Marine helped develop and maintain a global network of profiling floats, measuring the temperature and salinity of the oceans in real time. The new buoys are soon expected to incorporate biochemical data. In January 2024, Orange Business partnered with T/.notdefnaka, a social business working to restore and preserve marine ecosystems, to develop a technology solution that will automate and improve coral reef and marine biodiversity restoration impact reports. T/.notdefnaka will benefit remotely from near real-time data from the coral reefs, allowing its scientists to spend more time on reef regeneration;\n- -in 2023, Orange France also signed a sponsorship agreement with LPO aimed at attaching GPS trackers to targeted species of birds to study their behavior in response to the degradation of their natural habitats.",

However, Orange received 97 environmental complaints (mainly noise pollution) in France related to the operation of its network in 2023, and resolved 85 of them with sound attenuators.\n\nSome  of  Orange's  facilities  are  classified  for  environmental protection (ICPE). In 2019, the Group had re-assessed the number of ICPE-classified facilities following a revision of the regulations (Section ICPE2910 - Combustion facilities), which had lowered the  classification  threshold.  The  main  facilities  classified  for environmental protection are the air-conditioning systems, heat\n\npumps, fuel oil and gas furnaces, generators, and charging areas. The risks identified for these classified technical facilities are spillage of fuel oil or other chemicals or of chemically treated water into the rainwater system, degassing or leakage resulting in the release of HFC refrigerants or FM200 or FE13 fire extinguisher gases, and fires.\n\nUntil 2022, the reporting was carried out only on the France scope. The 2023 reporting includes two countries in the Europe region (Romania and Belgium) that are also affected. Sites in Poland fall below the threshold, so are not included.\n\n|                                            | 2023      | 2023      | 2023      | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|\n|                                            | France    | Rest      | Group     | France | France |\n|                                            | of Europe | of Europe | of Europe |        |        |\n| Number of sites with classified facilities |           |           |           |        |        |\n| (ICPE A, D, DC and E)                      | 250       | 622       | 872       | 247    | 416    |\n\nMobile radiotelephone relay antennas can sometimes negatively impact  the  landscape.  In  some  countries,  the  Group  has undertaken to blend a number of antennas into the environment and landscape by adapting them to the local style and context (painting, incorporation into buildings, etc.).\n\nA  provision  is  recognized  to  cover  the  Group's  obligation  to dismantle installed technical equipment and to restore the technical sites it occupies.\n\nThe provision is valued on the basis of:\n\n- -dismantling costs (on a per-unit basis for telephone poles, devices and telephone booths, and per site for mobile antennas) borne by the Group to meet its environmental obligations;\n- -annual scheduled asset returns and departures from sites.\n\nIn the Group's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, the provision totaled 696 million euros, including 286 million euros for Orange SA. It consisted primarily of the cost of restoring mobile phone antenna sites, reprocessing telephone poles, and managing waste electrical and electronic equipment, batteries and accumulators. It increased by 22.4% compared with 2021, due mainly to higher costs.\n\n- 4\n\n4",

These indicators show the proportion of its eligible and aligned revenues, capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX) related to products and/or services associated with economic activities qualifying as sustainable within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 on the establishment of a framework to  facilitate  sustainable  investment  within  the  European  Union and its annexes, as well as Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 of July 6, 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852, for six environmental objectives:\n\n- -climate change mitigation;\n- -climate change adaptation;\n- -the  sustainable  use  and  protection  of  water  and  marine resources;\n- -the transition to a circular economy, waste prevention and recycling;\n- -pollution prevention and control;\n- -the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nIn 2023, only the publication of the eligible share of economic activities relating to the last four aforementioned environmental objectives is required.\n\nNone of Orange's activities were considered eligible under the environmental objectives for the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nThe majority of the activities for the provision of telecommunication services to B2C and B2B customers and other telecommunication operators are not, to date, included in the scope covered by Annexes 1 and 2 to the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of June 4, 2021. As a result, the majority of Orange's activities are not eligible for the EU taxonomy at this time. Analysis of the eligibility of the various sectors should evolve in line with the maturity of the European Commission's work.\n\nOrange has also identified its aligned activities, i.e. activities that i) contribute substantially to the climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation objectives; ii) do no significant harm to the other\n\nenvironmental objectives (1) ; and iii) meet the social, governance and ethics-related minimum safeguards, in order to assess the sustainability, within the meaning of the EU taxonomy, of these eligible activities.\n\nThe operational activities of the Mobile Financial Services segment were taken into account in the analysis and are not considered eligible activities. In fact, they do not contribute to the Group's revenues due to their nature, and remain insignificant in comparison to the telecommunication services activities provided by Orange (see Section 1.4.7 Mobile Financial Services and Section 3.3, Note 1.10  Definition  of  business  segments  and  performance indicators).\n\nThe  Group's  media-related  activities  (co-financing  of  movie productions, currently being disposed of, and broadcasting) were also taken into account in the analysis and are considered eligible but not-aligned activities due to their content-related focus, which does not specifically relate to climate change adaptation.\n\n## Summary\n\n| 12/31/2023                             |   (in millions of euros) | (in %)   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|\n| Eligible revenue                       |                     1466 | 3.3%     |\n| Aligned revenue                        |                        8 | 0.0%     |\n| Eligible CAPEX and right-of-use assets |                      493 | 4.6%     |\n| Aligned CAPEX and right-of-use assets  |                       19 | 0.2%     |\n| Eligible OPEX                          |                      189 | 9.0%     |\n| Aligned OPEX                           |                        2 | 0.1%     |\n\n## 4. 2 . 7. 3 .1 Determination of eligible activities within the meaning of the EU taxonomy\n\nIn a compliance approach, Orange carried out a review of its entire scope of telecommunication service activities with a view to determining which are likely to make a significant contribution to environmental objectives within the meaning of the EU taxonomy.\n\nThe list of activities eligible for the EU taxonomy was prepared based on a complete review of the portfolio of Orange's activities, mainly carried out through interviews with the finance departments of the Group entities concerned and the CSR Department.",

'Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions' cover all of the services related  to  the  Internet  of  Things  (excluding  revenues  from equipment sales), considered as services enabling other economic sectors to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Services related to the Internet of Things include solutions for the control of fluids, logistical flows and smart meters, in addition to the implementation of solutions in smart cities. These enable companies and local authorities to improve both their operational efficiency and their environmental footprint.\n\nBy contrast, connectivity, which allows Orange to deliver services related to the Internet of Things or to data processing and hosting, was not included in the performance indicators, in accordance with the provisions of Annex 1 to the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 published on July 6, 2021 and with the FAQs published on December 19, 2022 by the European Commission.\n\nAs part of the environmental objective relating to the transition to a circular economy, Orange generates revenues in France and in most European countries, as well as through Orange Business, from the sale of refurbished mobile devices (see Section 4.2.5.2 Circular economy programs) and the leasing of mobiles, boxes and routers.\n\nFor fiscal year 2023, (i) revenues (as well as capital expenditure and operating expenditure, if any) from the Orange Polska smart bikes service and (ii) revenues (as well as capital expenditure and operating expenditure, if any) from the 'Orange Energia' services offered to Orange Polska customers are no longer taken into account in activity 6.4 'Operation of personal mobility devices, cycle logistics' and activity 7.6 'Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies.'\n\nOrange  Polska  considers  that  the  smart  bikes  services  and 'Orange  Energia'  services  require  the  implementation  of  a technological component (network and Machine to Machine) which treats them as IoT services. This means that these solutions are now included in the activity 8.2 'Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions.' This change has a non-significant impact on the performance indicators presented in 2022 and has thus been implemented for the indicators for 2023 and beyond.\n\nBesides the capital expenditure and operating expenditure related to the above-mentioned eligible activities, the Orange activities giving  rise  to  capital  expenditure  and  operating  expenditure associated with economic activities which may be considered individually eligible in environmental terms are as follows:\n\n| Environmental  objective               | Activity included in the EU taxonomy                                                                                                                | Corresponding Orange activity                                                               |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Climate change  mitigation  (1)        | 6.5 Transport by motorbike, passenger  car and light commercial vehicle                                                                             | Company vehicle fleet                                                                       |\n|                                        | 6.10 Sea and coastal freight water transport,  vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities                                                 | Cable-laying vessels                                                                        |\n|                                        | 7.2 Renovation of existing buildings                                                                                                                | Renovation work in office or technical buildings                                            |\n|                                        | 7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair  of energy efficiency equipment                                                                            | Thermal insulation, replacement of windows,  replacement of heating and ventilation systems |\n|                                        | 7.4 Installation, maintenance and repair of  charging stations for electrified vehicles in buildings  (and parking spaces attached to buildings)    | Installation of charging stations for electrified  vehicles at the company's premises       |\n|                                        | 7.5 Installation, maintenance and repair of  instruments and devices for measuring, regulating  and controlling the energy performance of buildings | Installation of thermostats and sensors                                                     |\n|                                        | 7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair  of renewable energy technologies                                                                          | Installation of photovoltaic panels, heat pumps                                             |\n|                                        | 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings                                                                                                          | Leasing or acquisition of office or technical buildings                                     |\n|                                        | 9.3 Professional services related to  energy performance of buildings                                                                               | Management contract for the efficiency and  optimization of building energy performance     |\n| Transition to a  circular economy  (1) | 3.2 Renovation of existing buildings                                                                                                                | Renovation work in office or technical buildings                                            |\n| Transition to a  circular economy  (1) | 5.1 Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing 5.3 Preparation for re-use of end-of-life  products and product components                            | Refurbishment of mobiles and boxes Testing of mobiles prior to their resale                 |\n\n- (1) Allocated on a case-by-case basis according to the nature of capital expenditure and operating expenditure.",

Orange has not identified any activities falling within the scope of the EU taxonomy aligned under climate change adaptation (for more information on the adaptation plans implemented by Orange, see paragraph 4.2.3.1 Environmental and energy transition plan: mitigating and adapting).\n\nIn order to assess the alignment of the Group's activities, compliance with substantial contribution to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation criteria, as well as with do no significant harm criteria, was verified on an activity-by-activity basis.\n\nIn accordance with the October 2022 report published by the Platform on Sustainable Finance, supplemented by the European Commission's FAQs from June 2023, Orange's compliance with minimum safeguards is based on:\n\n- -implementation of Orange's commitments to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms (as described in paragraph 4.3.3.7 Human rights and fundamental freedoms);\n- -implementation of the Vigilance Plan (as described in Section 2.2.3.5 Plan de vigilance 2024);\n- -acceptance  by  the  Group's  suppliers  of  contractual  CSR clauses appended to the contracts and of the Supplier Code of Conduct (see Section 4.3.2.2.3 Supplier Code of Conduct);\n- -the roll-out of the corruption prevention program within the Group (as described in Section 4.4.2.2 Prevention and detection of corruption and influence peddling);\n- -Orange's tax policy (see Section 4.4.2.7 Tax policy);\n- -the  measures  implemented  by  the  Group  to  raise  all  its employees' awareness of compliance with antitrust laws and regulations.\n\n- 4\n\nWith regard to compliance with competition laws and regulations, the compensation proceedings between Digicel and Orange (for anti-competitive  practices  on  the  mobile  and  fixed-to-mobile markets in the French Caribbean and in French Guiana in the early 2000s and sanctioned by the French Competition Authority in 2009) described in Note 18 Litigation in Section 3.3 is not considered to call into question the alignment of Orange's activities in France, given that the Group provides awareness-raising and training on competition law for its employees and in the absence of further disputes in the same geographical region and in the same markets after the procedure initiated by Digicel.\n\n## 4.2.7.3.3 Calculation of performance indicators\n\nOrange  calculated  the  performance  indicators  in  accordance with the provisions of European Regulation 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 of July 6, 2021, based on its existing reporting processes and systems and on assumptions made by management (see Note on methodology relating to the EU taxonomy below).\n\nOrange applied the methodology described in Annex 1 to the Delegated Regulation of July 6, 2021, enabling the calculation of the eligible and aligned proportion of the Group's revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure.\n\nIn accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 on  the  establishment  of  a  framework  to  facilitate  sustainable investment (the 'Taxonomy Regulation'), Orange has implemented the necessary checks to avoid double counting between activities, the risk of double accounting being limited to capital expenditure and operating expenditure on the renovation of existing buildings eligible for both activity 7.2 of climate change mitigation and activity 3.2 of the transition to the circular economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Revenues related to activity 8.2 are therefore considered non-aligned.\n\nRevenues related to activities 8.3 'Programming and broadcasting' and 13.3 'Motion picture, video and television program production, sound recording and music publishing' are considered non-aligned, as  the  primary  objective  of  these  activities  is  not  to  make  a substantial contribution to climate change adaptation. It should be noted that for activity 13.3 'Motion picture production,' the disposal of the activities of OCS and Orange Studio was finalized on January 31, 2024.\n\nThe revenues of Orange Energia in Poland related to activities 7.4 'Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings)' and 7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies are considered aligned as they meet the technical screening and DNSH criteria for those activities.\n\nThe proportion of the Group's revenues related to aligned activities is slightly higher than 0%.\n\n## Determination of eligible and aligned capital expenditure\n\n## Proportion of capital expenditure related to eligible and individually eligible activities\n\nThe proportion of Orange's capital expenditure related to eligible and individually eligible activities is determined by dividing the sum of capital expenditure from eligible activities and capital expenditure from  individually  eligible  activities,  as  described  in  Section 4. 2.7. 3 .1  Determination of eligible activities within the meaning of the EU taxonomy, by the change in capital expenditure stated in the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  Section 3.3  (including right-of-use assets calculated pursuant to IFRS 16) in Note 8.4 Other intangible assets, Note 8.5 Property, plant and equipment and Note 9.1 Right-of-use assets.\n\nThe capital expenditure presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Orange includes:\n\n- -acquisitions of intangible assets;\n- -acquisitions of property, plant and equipment;\n- -increase in right-of-use assets (new right-of-use assets);\n- -acquisitions and increases related to changes in the scope of consolidation.",

Given the specific nature of the submarine cable-laying and maintenance activities, capital expenditure related to this cable-laying vessel cannot be considered aligned as it does not meet certain technical screening and DNSH criteria.",

This capital expenditure is considered individually aligned.\n\nThe proportion of capital expenditure related to aligned activities and to individually aligned activities is 0.2%.\n\n## Determination of eligible and aligned operating expenditure\n\n## Proportion of operating expenditure related to eligible and individually eligible activities\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Annex 1 to the Delegated Regulation published by the European Commission on July 6, 2021, the operating expenditure base to be taken into account when calculating the eligible proportion of Orange's operating expenditure is restricted to the following expenses:\n\n- -research and development expenses;\n- -building renovation expenses;\n- -short-term  leases;\n- -maintenance, servicing and repair expenses;\n- -any other direct expenses, related to the ongoing maintenance of property, plant and equipment by the company or by a third party to which these activities are outsourced, which are required for these assets to remain in good working order.\n\nIn accordance with the definition of operating expenditure in the EU taxonomy and the approach of strict compliance with Annex 1 to the Delegated Regulation published by the European Commission on July 6, 2021, Orange has not taken into account the energy expenses incurred to operate its Data centers, in particular.\n\nThe proportion of Orange's operating expenditure related to the Group's eligible and individually eligible activities is determined by dividing the sum of the Group's operating expenditure from eligible activities and operating expenditure from individually eligible activities, as described in Section 4.2.7.3.1 Determination of eligible activities within the meaning of the EU taxonomy, by the sum of operating expenditure corresponding to the definition given above.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

For information, operating expenditure related to eligible and individually eligible activities represented 0.7% of the total operating expenditure related to external purchases, other operating income and expenses, and labor expenses.\n\nThis operating expenditure forms part of the external purchases, other operating income and expenses, and labor expenses detailed in Section 3.1.2.2 Group operating results.\n\nThe proportion of operating expenditure related to eligible and individually eligible activities amounted to 9% at December 31, 2023, versus 18% at December 31, 2022. This decrease is mainly due to a more granular analysis of operating expenditure related to the activities 8.1 'Data processing, hosting and related activities,' 8.2 Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions' and 8.3 'Programming and broadcasting' for the Orange Business scope.\n\n## Proportion of operating expenditure related to aligned activities\n\nThe proportion of Orange's operating expenditure related to the Group's aligned and individually aligned activities is determined by dividing the sum of the Group's operating expenditure from aligned activities  and  operating  expenditure  from  individually  aligned activities by the sum of operating expenditure in accordance with the definition in the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, the amount of operating expenditure from aligned activities, according to the definition in the Delegated Regulation, was non-material.\n\nOperating expenditure related to activities 8.1 'Data processing, hosting and related activities,' 8.2 'Data-driven solutions for GHG\n\nemissions reductions,' 8.3 'Programming and broadcasting' and 13.3 'Motion picture, video and television program production, sound recording and music publishing' is considered non-aligned, as  the  revenues  derived  from  these  activities  are  themselves non-aligned.\n\nFor fiscal year 2023, (i) operating expenditure for Orange Polska's smart bikes and 'Orange Energia' services are no longer taken into account in activities 6.4 'Operation of personal mobility devices, cycle logistics' and 7.6 'Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies,' respectively, but in activity 8.2 'Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions.'\n\nOrange Polska considers the smart bikes and 'Orange Energia' services,  previously  included  in  activities  6.4  'Operation  of personal mobility devices, cycle logistics' and 7.6 'Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies,' to require the implementation of a technological component (network and Machine to Machine) which treats them as IoT services. This means that these solutions are now included in the activity 8.2 'Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions.' This change has a non-material impact on the performance indicators presented in 2022 and has therefore been implemented for the indicators for 2023 and beyond. Individually aligned operating expenditure, according to the definition in the Delegated Regulation, totaled 2 million euros.\n\nBased  on  the  information  provided  by  the  relevant  suppliers, operating  expenditure  related  to  activity  6.5  'Transport  by motorbike, passenger car and light commercial vehicle' meets some of the technical screening criteria and DNSH criteria, and is therefore considered partially aligned.\n\nThe real estate-related operating expenditure considered aligned mainly  concerns  the  installation,  maintenance  and  repair  of instruments and devices for measuring, regulating and monitoring the  energy  performance  of  buildings  and  the  installation  of charging stations for electric vehicles, as well as the installation and maintenance of photovoltaic panels at technical and office sites.\n\nThe proportion of operating expenditure related to aligned and individually aligned activities amounted to 0.1%. This proportion remained relatively unchanged in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, despite a fall in eligible operating expenditure due to a more granular analysis of the Orange Business scope.",

        "page_content": "## Note on methodology - EU taxonomy\n\nTo calculate the performance indicators related to the EU taxonomy, Orange used the following assumptions:\n\n- -numerator of the eligible and individually eligible operating expenditure indicator:\n- -operating  expenditure  related  to  eligible  activities  8.1 'Data processing, hosting and related activities' and 8.2 'Data-driven  solutions  for  GHG  emissions  reductions' was estimated using the tool for the allocation of direct and indirect costs to the various business lines of the Orange Business division, with a more granular analysis of the proportion of expenditure directly related to eligible activities,\n- -operating expenditure related to employees in charge of maintenance for the eligible activities within the meaning of the EU taxonomy was estimated based on an assumption of 3.3% of the payroll costs over 12 rolling months allocated to assets in the 'Operation and maintenance' employment category in the jobs classification used by the Orange group. This assumption is in line with the proportion of the Group's revenues eligible within the meaning of the EU taxonomy,\n- -operating expenditure related to activities for the transition to  a  circular  economy  mainly  includes  the  costs  of refurbishing mobiles and boxes and of testing mobiles prior to their resale;\n- -denominator of the eligible and individually eligible operating expenditure indicator:\n- -operating expenditure related to employees in charge of maintenance was estimated based on the payroll costs over 12 rolling months allocated to assets in the 'Operation and  maintenance'  employment  category  in  the  jobs classification used by Orange,\n- -the implementation of the adaptation DNSH criterion, for the relevant assets, was treated in line with the Group's consideration  of  climate  change-related  risks  and  in accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's SSP5-8.5 scenario.\n\nFor activity 5.1 'Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing,' the cost of batteries and other consumables could not be isolated from capital or operating expenditure, so these items are included in the calculation of the performance indicators.\n\nFor any links to the Group's financing strategy, see also Section 4.1.8 Financing linked to sustainable performance.\n\n## 4. 2 . 7. 4 Note on methodology - Environment\n\n## Note on carbon footprint assessment methodology\n\nScopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions are assessed in accordance with an internal methodology guide developed by the Group's CSR Department. Its key principles, scope and reporting methodologies are outlined below. This guide is updated periodically as  methodology  decisions  are  made.  A  more  comprehensive methodology  guide  has  been  developed,  in  coordination  with the  regions  and  businesses  and  with  methodological  support from Carbone 4. It aims to serve as a reference for the periodic assessments of scopes 1, 2 and 3, at the Group level as well as for the entities, countries, regions and businesses.\n\n## General principles\n\nOrange has opted to assess its scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the methodologies developed by  the  GHG  Protocol  (www.ghgprotocol.org).  It  supplements these  methodologies,  where  applicable,  with  the  International Telecommunication Union standards, in particular ITU L. 1420 and the guide to Scope 3 emissions for telecommunication operators (a joint ITU, GSMA and GeSI publication in 2023). Every year, when preparing the assessments, the Group CSR Department identifies and analyzes any deviations from the GHG Protocol's recommendations.\n\n## Frequency of reporting\n\nThe key indicators are subject to quarterly reporting at the entity level, and indicators that are less material for the Group or for which data collection is more complex are reported every six months or annually; reporting is quarterly for scopes 1 and 2, and annually for scope 3.\n\n## Organizational scope and scope of activity\n\nOrange has opted to assess its scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions using the GHG Protocol's 'Financial Control' approach. Accordingly, all the subsidiaries that are financially consolidated by the Group are included in the scopes 1, 2 and 3 assessments.\n\nCommitments with respect to CO 2 emissions concern the digital segment. Therefore, as an exception, the subsidiaries Orange Bank and Orange Energia Poland are excluded from the organizational scope of the Group's scope 1, 2 and 3 commitments, since these business lines belong to sectors that differ significantly from the digital sector. However, the scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions of Orange Bank  and  Orange  Energia  Poland  are  still  assessed  and  fall within the scope covered by the reporting. For reporting on CO 2 emissions, the Group's totals include these subsidiaries; 'digital sector' subtotals are added to make the link with the Group's commitments. Thus, for 2023, the data shown cover the entire consolidated financial scope, unless otherwise indicated. A new entity was included in the reporting on energy consumption and scope 1 and 2 emissions: VOO (operator acquired in Belgium in 2023). VOO was not included in the calculation of the Group's scope 3 emissions  in  2022  since  this  company  was  not  a subsidiary during that period. The change in the configuration of the mobile infrastructure in the Group's Europe scope, reflected in its subsidiary, TOTEM (a European TowerCo that aims to open up its passive mobile infrastructure, high points such as masts and flat rooftops, to other operators), led to a change in the reporting of the underlying environmental indicators. For fiscal year 2023, the energy consumption for TOTEM's French scope continued to be reported in the 'France' entity: the energy consumption for TOTEM's Spanish scope was reported in the TOTEM entity (scope 1 energy) and in Orange Espagne (scope 2 electricity).\n\nThe international reporting of Orange Business, for scopes 1 and 2, is limited to 11 countries (or 69 sites) out of the 67 countries (outside France) in which it operates. These countries represent 73% of Orange Business International's workforce and 64% of the occupied floor space of its buildings (in m\u00b2). The countries are Australia, Brazil, Switzerland, Egypt, Germany, India, Mauritius, Russia, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nAs regards electricity consumption, Orange Business International's reporting is based on 148 sites in 44** countries (44 countries for which the reporting is done by Accenture + Russia) where Orange Business is located.\n\nThese countries represent 89% of the occupied floor space of its buildings (in m\u00b2) outside France.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n- 4",

The figures presented, mainly energy consumption and waste, correspond to those under Orange's direct control, except for scope 3.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrange Business's international reporting for scope 3 corresponds to all countries in which Orange Business operates internationally.\n\nThe scope covered by the reporting is therefore specified below each of the scopes 1, 2 and 3 indicator tables.\n\nHistorical data for fiscal years 2015, 2021 and 2022: the historical data for these fiscal years have been adjusted to supplement the previously unavailable data and to reflect the changes in scope that occurred during fiscal year 2023:\n\n- -integration of VOO energy consumption and GHG data;\n- -integration of energy consumption and GHG data (tertiary and vehicles) of several entities in the MEA region;\n- -integration of Basefarm's historical energy consumption and GHG data;\n- -integration of energy consumption and GHG data from Orange Polska's district network;\n- -change in the heavy fuel oil emission factor for Orange Marine's business to align with the supplier's emission factor.\n\nSpecific case of the district heating network: the entities reporting the heating/cooling energy consumption of their district networks are Orange France, Orange Polska and Orange Communications Luxembourg. This indicator does not concern or is not material for other entities.\n\nSpecific cases of refrigerant leaks: the entities reporting on their refrigerant leaks are Orange Polska, Orange Espagne, Orange Romania and Orange Marine. This indicator does not concern or is not material for other entities.\n\n## Reporting methodology\n\nThe  environmental  reporting  in  this  section  is  based  on  a non-financial information system.\n\nThe changes in methodology that had a Group-level effect greater than or equal to 5% of the indicator, or a country-level effect greater than or equal to 20% of the indicator, and data updates following receipt of definitive figures that had a material effect on the Group, are calculated on a comparable basis (pro forma). The data for the year (y-1) adjusted in the report are thus indicated in the notes to each table.\n\nTo be more aligned with its financial reporting, the Group presents scopes 1 and 2 energy consumption and emissions according to the following four main divisions: France, rest of Europe, Africa & Middle East (MEA), and other (consisting of Orange Business, TOTEM, Orange Marine and Orange Bank).\n\n## Environmental Management System\n\nThe 'Group ISO 14001 certification rate' KPI is the ratio of electricity consumed by all scopes that are ISO 14001-certified over the total electricity consumed by the Group. For France, the proportion of certified electricity is measured relative to the workforce covered by ISO 14001 certification.\n\nIt  is  calculated  across  the  scope  of  the  entities  or  divisions consolidated by the Group.\n\nThe France entity consists of the following entities: Orange France + Orange Business in France.\n\nOrange France is fully certified for all its activities, products and services in mainland France.\n\nOrange France employees working on certified sites: 38,378.\n\nOrange Business employees working on certified sites in France: 6,231.\n\nOrange  Business  employees  working  on  certified  sites internationally: 9,554.\n\n## Energy\n\nThe energy used by Data centers, buildings and stores is calculated using the online control tool that measures and controls in real time  all  of  the  buildings'  systems,  including  IT  equipment,  air conditioning, UPS (uninterruptible power supply), etc.\n\nEnergy consumption is derived from the invoices supplied by the energy supply companies. It may be estimated, in particular for the fourth quarter of the year, or obtained by the extrapolation of financial data to physical data (this is notably the case for France, which estimates the fourth quarter from 2022 data):\n\n- -Orange Slovensko: energy data are estimated data;\n- -Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire: for 'network' consumption, 67.3% of electricity  consumption  and  39%  of  fuel  consumption  are estimated, since the TowerCo service provider does not provide data on the consumption of mobile sites. The data are therefore estimated by reporting the consumption from 2021, currently the last year for which invoices are available;\n- -Orange Madagascar: the fuel oil consumption data were not comprehensive or reliable in previous years. The 2023 figure includes data from previous years. The data may be adjusted retroactively in future years;\n- -Orange Romania (including its OROC subsidiary, integrated in 2022): much of the energy data for 2023 is estimated based on invoices from the previous year and the energy budget for the current year. This estimate had to be used because the energy provider had not yet sent all the invoices for 2023 at the time of the audit.\n\nThe 'fuel oil consumption (all buildings and all uses)' indicator combines the consumption (excluding vehicles) of domestic fuel oil, diesel and gasoline, as well as marine diesel for Orange Marine's fleet.\n\nTechnical sites not connected to the national grid are supplied by generators running on fuel oil. Until 2020, the coefficient for converting m\u00b3 of fuel oil into GWh, used for the ITN perimeter, came from the GHG Protocol. Since 2021, after technical analysis, the coefficient for converting m\u00b3 of fuel oil into GWh was revised in order to match the values measured and reported by Orange's monitoring systems, or extrapolated from an average of all values measured when there are no monitoring systems.\n\nIn  the  MEA  region,  the  data  for  network  and  tertiary  fuel  oil consumption may come from meters installed on sites or from the conversion of fuel oil consumption from m\u00b3 to GWh. Therefore, the fuel consumption data in MWh measured by those meters are reported directly, without using the m\u00b3 to MWh conversion factor.\n\nData on a comparable basis, including 2015 data, has been restated to account for this new methodology.\n\nWhen network sharing with a third-party operator in which the technical environment is shared, only the electricity purchased by Orange for its own sites is recorded; this rule applies due to the fairly balanced nature of the sharing.",

        "page_content": "The Group's renewable energy proportion takes into account the renewable energy proportion of each country according to the IEA (International Energy Agency) data in its updated version for 2023 in proportion to Orange's consumption in each of these countries, restated for consumption of Orange's own renewable energy (own production).\n\n## Scopes 1 and 2 assessment method\n\nScope 1 CO 2 emissions are assessed by multiplying activity data (energy consumption) by an emission factor for the year in question. The emission factor is obtained from the ADEME database or from the GHG Protocol, where available. These emission factors are subject to regular updates. The different types of energy considered in this scope are fuel oil, gas, coal, gasoline and diesel. Leakage of refrigerants (fluids used for air-conditioning) or from automatic fire suppression systems (fluids used to limit the impacts of a fire in strategic network rooms) is included in scope 1 when it is material and measurable (this is the case for five entities: Poland, Spain, Romania, Orange Marine and TOTEM Spain).\n\nSpecific case of fuel oil used by Orange Marine vessels: until now, the emission factor used by the Group to calculate greenhouse gas emissions was that of domestic fuel oil, i.e. 2.7 kg CO 2 eq per liter (source: ADEME). The Group replaced it this year with the IMO (International Maritime Organization) emission factor of 3.2 metric tons of CO 2 eq per metric ton of marine diesel.\n\nScope 2 CO 2 emissions consist of combustion emissions related to electricity consumption and district heating.\n\nThe emissions associated with scope 2 electricity consumption must be assessed, according to the GHG Protocol's recommendations, using both the market-based and location-based methods. These two methods are described in the GHG Protocol's documents at ghgprotocol.org.\n\nThe location-based method considers average emission factors for the electricity grids, which are national by default, from which electricity consumption occurs.\n\nThe  method  that  companies  present  most  frequently  is  the market-based  method,  because  it  allows  them  to  zero  out scope 2 emissions corresponding to electricity from renewable sources.  Every  year,  Orange  assesses  its  scope 2 emissions according to both methods and, like most companies, uses the market-based method for its communications.\n\nEmissions corresponding to district network consumption are not included in the calculation of location-based scope 2 emissions, but only in the calculation of market-based scope 2 emissions.\n\nFor electricity from renewable sources:\n\n- -under the market-based method, emissions corresponding to consumption of electricity from renewable sources are counted as zero;\n- -under the location-based method, activity data are multiplied by an emission factor for the consumption stage only (excluding production of generator-type equipment and excluding energy transport) for the year and the country in question. These country mix emission factors are collected by the Group CSR Department from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and are updated regularly. For the 2023 emissions related to electricity consumption, the IEA emissions factors in their updated version from September 2023 were used for all countries. Emissions from previous years have not been restated for these new emissions factors.\n\nFor electricity from non-renewable sources:\n\n- -under the market-based method, activity data are multiplied by emission factors for the consumption stage only (excluding production  of  generator-type  equipment  and  excluding transport). To align with the GHG Protocol's recommendations, the Group CSR Department and the countries must reconcile, for  each  emission  factor,  the  data  communicated  by  the countries' electricity producers and the average emission factor communicated by the International Energy Agency (IEA) or by the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) to determine which factor best represents the electricity supplied (1) . When a reliable and audited emission factor is available for a specific power purchase agreement, it may be used according to the GHG Protocol's recommendations;\n- -under the location-based method, activity data are multiplied by an emission factor for combustion only, for the year and the country in question. These emission factors are collected by the Group CSR Department from the IEA or the AIB and are updated periodically.\n\nElectricity from renewable sources includes solar, wind, green hydrogen, hydropower, biomass and biofuel.\n\nThe emission factors for the district energy networks in France are those provided by the French district heating and cooling system observatory (Observatoire des r\u00e9seaux de chaleur et de froid) and by Poland's Energy Regulatory Office (2) .\n\n## Scope 3 assessment method\n\nScope 3 emissions were assessed, for years 2018 to 2022, again with assistance and methodological guidance from Carbone 4. The assessment is based, as much as possible, on physical activity data multiplied by emission factors (EFs) from life-cycle analyses, from databases, such as those developed by ADEME (the French Agency for Ecological Transition) or the IEA, or from extrapolations, or otherwise on monetary activity data from Orange's purchasing/ fixed assets databases, multiplied by ADEME's monetary emission factors or, as much as possible, monetary emission factors specific to Orange's suppliers developed from Carbon Disclosure Project reports (supplier CDP).\n\nThe  2023  assessments  were  based  on  all  15 GHG  Protocol categories, with the exception of categories 3.8, 3.10, 3.12, 3.14 and 3.15, for which the estimates were considered not material or because they are not applicable to the Group's activity.\n\nThe activity data is preferably physical data. Monetary data was used when it was not possible to obtain reliable physical data. For 2022, the breakdown was about 45% physical data and 55% monetary data.\n\nFor monetary emission factors, inflation was taken into account in 2022 relative to 2021 with the widespread application for all Group countries of a 5.2% discount, corresponding to the average rate of inflation recorded by INSEE (Institut national de la statistique et des \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques - the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) in France. This is proposed for future calculations of rates specific to countries or regions.\n\nThe activity data was estimated for some countries and some scope 3 categories. This was the case for the following categories: building and vehicle fleet fixed assets, upstream and downstream transportation,  employee  commuting,  purchase  and  use  of fixed customer premises equipment (CPE), and purchase and use of smartphones. The estimation methods are described in a comprehensive note on methodology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n- 4",

The expenditure taken into account is annual expenditure on service purchases, for all Orange countries, classified according to the Group's purchasing category frameworks. The source file is an extraction from Smart Reporter, from which the physical data already counted has been removed.\n\nFor OB telecoms expenditure: a specific monetary emission factor is calculated for each country by adapting the French telecoms EF corresponding to electricity emissions in proportion to the electricity mix of the country in question.\n\nFor purchases of customer equipment (fixed assets (1) or OPEX), emissions are calculated by multiplying the number of pieces of equipment purchased by Orange each year per country, type and model, with specific emission factors that account as much as possible for the new/ refurbished distinction. Emission factors for manufacturing (for boxes, IoT and MBB) are based as much as possible on life-cycle analyses (LCAs) carried out by Orange or by the manufacturers. For Apple and Huawei smartphones, model-specific EFs are used. For other handsets, the EFs used come from Eco Rating. When physical data is not available, the monetary data in the Group Purchasing file is used (use of an Orange-specific monetary EF). When there is no Orange LCA for certain equipment, these Orange-specific EFs are averaged or extrapolated to cover as many situations as possible. As a last resort, Orange uses ADEME's monetary EF (Services - Electrical and optical IT and office equipment) at 400 kgCO 2 e/\u20ack.\n\nNetwork equipment : for France, the calculations are based on the number of pieces of equipment purchased each year by Orange, per type and model, with the new/refurbished distinction as well, with EFs coming as much as possible from the manufacturing phase in Orange's LCA. For the rest of the world, as the physical data is not yet usable, Orange uses monetary data corresponding to expenditure per year, by country, by type and by model, while differentiating new equipment from refurbished equipment as much as possible, with monetary EFs specific to the Orange networks. The physical EFs used come from a variety of sources (PEP Ecopassport, Orange LCAs, Carbone 4 calculations, ADEME's Carbon Database). Monetary EFs specific to the Orange networks were calculated by Carbone 4, based on the France network analyses.\n\nBuildings (fixed assets or rentals): emissions are calculated by multiplying physical data (floor space occupied by Orange) per type of building (store, office, warehouse, parking lot, etc.), no matter if the buildings are rented or owned, by ADEME's corresponding floor space EFs (in kgCO2e/m2 of net floor area). This value is then divided by 50 years, which is the period used for building depreciation in carbon accounting (consequently, buildings that are more than 50 years old are not counted in the carbon footprint calculation).\n\nVehicles : emissions are calculated by multiplying the number of vehicles used by Orange (vehicle fleet, whether owned or under long-term leases) per type (passenger car, light commercial vehicle, sedan, truck, van, etc.), by the corresponding EFs from ADEME's Carbon Database or Carbone 4's internal databases. This value is then divided by 10 years, which is the period used for vehicle depreciation in carbon accounting (consequently, vehicles that are more than 10 years old are not counted in the carbon footprint calculation). When the type of vehicle is not known, the default type applied is the sedan, because it is associated with an intermediate EF between passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.\n\nVessel : manufacturing and end-of-life emissions are calculated from Orange Marine's vessel usage data (annual energy consumption), representing 86% of emissions over the vessel's lifetime (based on an available LCA profile used for all vessels). The use of annual data is equivalent to the depreciation of the vessel's construction.",

'Materials recovery' covers the reuse, reclamation and recycling of materials extracted from waste. The new materials generated are called 'secondary raw materials' or 'recycled raw materials.' 'Energy recovery' means using the calorific value of the waste by burning it and recovering this energy in the form of heat or electricity. 'Recycling' is a method of waste recovery that aims to place some or all of the materials back into the manufacturing cycle for a similar or different product. Waste that is sent to landfill or incinerated without energy recovery is not considered recovered.\n\nOrange considers waste to be recovered when it is entrusted to a service provider or a licensed external organization, with or without a financial transaction, that is able to provide all the documents needed to ensure its traceability, from recovery to processing, and prove the waste has been recovered.\n\nIn certain countries, the public authorities manage responsibility for waste processing and issue a waste recovery certificate. This is the case for Orange's waste in Egypt and Romania, and for batteries in Jordan.\n\nAs with the 2022 reporting, the 2023 reporting is based on the list of hazardous waste established by Decision 2000/532/EC.\n\n## Scope\n\nOrange's  waste  reporting  scope  increased  in  2023  with  the integration  of  Luxembourg  and  Globecast  (Orange  Business). Orange  Belgium,  Orange  Espagne,  Orange  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire  and Jordan Telecom (since 3Q 2023 only) continued to expand their reporting scope.\n\nOrange Marine: following a change in the tool used, fourth-quarter data for vessels are not included in Orange Marine's reporting. The data will be adjusted retroactively during the 2024 reporting.\n\nIn Europe: Luxembourg will extend its reporting to trade WEEE and batteries over 3 kg by 2024. As of this year, Spain has obtained reporting for the first time from its maintenance service providers, who will continue to consolidate the data in the future.\n\nTOTEM: TOTEM France's waste is included in Orange France's reporting, unlike that of TOTEM Spain, which completed the first part of its waste reporting this year. Orange Romania's reporting includes the fixed telephony entity. VOO, which was only acquired during the fiscal year, was not included in Orange Belgium's waste reporting.\n\nSome data remain partial or are estimated by extrapolating weights. This  is  the  case  for  Orange  Mali,  Orange  Cameroun,  Jordan Telecom, Orange Maroc and Orange Egypt. The same is true, to a lesser extent, for Orange Belgium, where estimates are provided directly by the service provider.\n\nFor the MEA region, the majority of waste reporting corresponds to outgoing equipment from the fixed asset portfolio (wooden poles, cables, WEEE, mobile-access network equipment, etc.). The volume sent to service providers may therefore include waste from previous years.\n\nAt end-2023, Orange had advanced mapping of the waste identified by subsidiaries. The coverage rate for each category of waste has been expressed as a percentage of the Group's 2023 revenues. For the MEA region, the regulatory framework and the immaturity of the local waste treatment providers impact the quality of the monitoring of waste and its treatment after removal.\n\nIt is still difficult to obtain on time the information expected from service providers concerning the traceability and final treatment of  Orange's  waste  (lack  of  clear  information  on  the  types  of waste  treated,  the  associated  treatment  codes,  certificates  of recovery, etc.). This has a direct impact on the recovery rate. This is the case in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Mali, Cameroon and Belgium.\n\nFor Orange Marine, there is a lack of information on the treatment of waste from vessels when they do not return to base. Although waste is sorted on board, port authorities require ships to unload their waste, often in dumpsters, where it is then consolidated.\n\n## Mobile phones recovered\n\nThe  calculation  of  mobile  devices  recovered  takes  into consideration five recovery streams: responsible citizen recovery, recovery of mobile devices waste in Africa, B2C redemption offers, Buyback offers for businesses and after-sales service returns. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of mobile handsets recovered by the number of new mobile handsets sold by Orange over the same period.\n\nThe reporting scope for 2023 is specified below the indicator table.\n\n## Water\n\nFollowing an assessment of the volumes involved, Orange does not consider water issues to be material. Therefore, the Group does not have a quantified target for this topic. The volumes of water consumption are also not significant enough to warrant setting up a restrictive and verifiable process of collecting and consolidating data.\n\nHowever, the Group continues to report on water: in 2023, the Group's water consumption scope covered seven of the eight European  countries  (83%  of  revenues),  three  (Egypt,  Jordan and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) of the 16 countries in the MEA region (30% of revenues) and Orange Business.\n\nThe main sources of water consumption in the Orange group are water fountains, restrooms, cafeterias (when the cafeteria and the Orange building share the same water meter) and air conditioning systems for technical sites (Data centers).\n\nThe main sources of water consumption in the Orange group are water fountains, restrooms, cafeterias (when the cafeteria and the Orange building share the same water meter) and air conditioning systems for technical sites (Data centers). In France, all Data centers are within scope, except for Chartres and Val de Reuil (the estimated consumption of these two sites combined is around 0.07% of total consumption for Orange in France). Water consumption reported for  Jordan  does  not  include  water  consumed  by  data  center cooling systems. For other countries, the Group has no visibility on the inclusion or exclusion of water consumption from data center cooling processes.\n\nWater consumption can be estimated when data are not available: this  is  the  case  for  Orange  Belgium  and  Orange  Slovensko (estimated  from  2022  data)  and  for  Orange  Romania,  Jordan Telecom and Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (fourth quarter estimated based on the first three quarters of 2023).",

        "page_content": "## 4.3 Social\n\nOrange's purpose, enshrined in its Bylaws, emphasizes Orange's mission to contribute to a 'responsible' digital world. In that respect, Orange's  societal  approach  essentially  consists  of  regarding everyone - including people who may have difficulty using digital tools  -  as  potential  beneficiaries  of  its  services,  with  tailored solutions that have a positive impact on their lives. As an economic\n\nactor, Orange's responsibility extends to the support that the Group offers its value chain and the influence that Orange exerts on public and private ecosystems to foster a more inclusive economy and society. As an employer, Orange seeks to offer opportunities for employment and professional development without discrimination.\n\n## 4.3.1 Own  workforce\n\nThe challenges for Orange's HR function are, on the one hand, permanently having the skills necessary for its business in view of the accelerated development of its business lines, and on the other  hand,  ensuring  employee  engagement  and  the  health, safety and improvement in quality of life and working conditions of each employee, against a backdrop of far-reaching technological, geopolitical, social and environmental change.\n\nThe Orange HR function is responsible for all employees, interns, applicants and future hires. The HR function is also involved in managing and implementing the Vigilance Plan for all stakeholders, in particular its partners, subcontractors and people who may be affected by its activities.\n\nTo  meet  these  challenges,  the  Orange's  Human  Ressources Department has defined three priority areas:\n\nSkills : Orange is proactive in adapting its employees' skills to the requirements of its business model, while taking their ambitions into account. The Group has strategic workforce planning in place, which highlights the key skills to be developed now and in the future. It offers training and professional retraining programs.\n\nCulture and engagement : Orange is keen to foster a culture of trust and collective performance which is both responsible and compassionate. The Group has undertaken to establish a shared culture that informs day-to-day practices by putting employees front and center. HR is positioned to support management in implementing all these actions, ensuring that there is some room for maneuver locally.\n\nEfficiency : Orange  takes  a  responsible  approach  toward supporting organizational and business developments and the roll-out of the new company model, which seeks to clarify the roles of each organization and individual with a focus on improving organizational efficiency.\n\n## 4.3.1.1 Orange's governance for its human capital\n\n## 4.3.1.1.1 New company model governance\n\n## committees\n\nThe Group Human Resources Department is supported by two new company model governance committees: the Employment and Compensation Committee, and the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee.\n\nThe Employment and Compensation Committee recommends structural decisions for the Group in terms of employment and compensation, skills management and organization, which can then be submitted to the Executive Committee if necessary. It approves the overarching multi-year guidelines for employment and skills requirements and the salary increase budget to be implemented for the coming year. It supports the divisions with financial and workforce planning needed to implement the strategic plan. The Committee is chaired by the Executive Director in charge of Human Resources and members of the relevant teams. It brings together\n\nthe Executive Director of the new company model, the Group Finance and Performance Director, the Controlling Department Director and members of the Group Executive Committee in charge of a division, including their Finance Directors.\n\nThe Diversity,  Equity  and  Inclusion  Committee defines  the priorities of the equality, diversity, equity and inclusion policy and the associated indicators on the basis of the studies and analyses presented to it. It approves the launch of the programs or actions proposed to it in order to give effect to these strategic priorities and monitors their roll-out at the Group's entities, based on an annual roadmap and the associated communication plan. It is co-chaired by the Executive Directors in charge of Group Human Resources and Orange Business, and brings together members of the Executive Committee in charge of a division, the Executive Director of Communication, the Executive Director of Environmental and Societal Responsibility, and the Directors of HR Talent & Development, Sectors and Executive. It meets at least twice a year and arranges to meet with the Executive Committee once a year. The gender equality policy, with a focus on equal pay, is presented once a year to members of the GCSERC. It replaces, with a broader remit, the Strategic Committee for Equality in the Workplace, which met twice in 2023.\n\n## 4.3.1.1.2 Organization of the human resources function within Orange\n\nThe Group Human Resources Department is represented by a member of the Executive Committee, whose role it is to define and implement HR policies and strategies for the execution of the strategic plan.\n\nThe implementation of the new company model to operationalize the Lead the future strategic plan includes changes to Orange's HR organizational model, undertaken in 2023.\n\nThe Group Human Resources Department is structured around the Group's cross-cutting functions, focused on overarching sovereign and 'multi-country' policies, the HR departments of divisions/ business units, focused on the entity's activities, a business-led department for coordinating and sharing 'HR in France,' in charge of HR coordination and delivering shared services to employees and  divisions,  and  a  governance  designed  to  simplify/clarify operating procedures, notably by drafting formal HR policies to offer a common foundation and greater transparency.\n\nThe Digital, Employment and HR Strategy Management Department supports the sector with a shared HR information system. It identifies the general trends for jobs, professions and skills within the Group.\n\nThe main responsibilities of this department are to improve user experience and satisfaction and to design an employment policy together with the business lines to forecast the need for jobs, professions and skills in the light of the Group's business and technological challenges. This means relying on the business lines, redefined according to these challenges and organized on the basis of the expected trends. The relevant action plans are then developed in terms of training, attractiveness, retention and mobility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n- 4",

It implements a talent assessment and detection process at all levels of the organization and seeks to create the right conditions to attract talent externally and retain them internally. Its role is also to explain the principles that reflect Orange's culture. These underpin the management culture, based on trust and inspired by the Group's purpose.\n\nThe Diversity, Inclusion, Quality of Life and Working Conditions Department fosters an occupational health and safety culture through  the  roll-out  of  the  occupational  health  and  safety management  system,  based  on  compliance  with  international standards (ISO 45001), in all divisions and subsidiaries.\n\nIt coordinates employee feedback, manages the internal Group engagement survey and oversees the implementation of action plans and value propositions that improve the employee experience and employee engagement. It provides the framework for the Group's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policy together with the relevant objectives and programs, and ensures that the policy is implemented in the Group's entities and subsidiaries. Working closely with the Finance Department and the Environmental and Societal Responsibility Department, it coordinates the production of non-financial reports on behalf of the Group HR Department.\n\nThe Compensation and Benefits Department organizes and clarifies  compensation  and  benefits  policies  within  the  Group through shared programs. It manages labor expenses and the performance of compensation and benefits programs and lends its expertise to operational entities.\n\nThe International Social Relations Department allows the forums for international social dialogue to support Orange's strategy and facilitate its roll-out through a better understanding of the business model and the policies implemented.\n\nThese Group functions are accompanied by a dedicated support department for HR and senior executives.\n\n## 4.3.1.2 Policies and action plans for developing human capital\n\nThe HR function relies on several key levers to meet the challenges of developing the Group's human capital.\n\n## 4.3.1.2.1 Culture and employee engagement\n\nEmployee engagement and a sense of pride in working for the company stem from a strong corporate culture and the values that unite employees, regardless of their background, country, culture or profession.\n\nIn 2023, as part of the Lead the future strategic plan and to implement  its  new  company  model  more  effectively,  Orange embarked on a project to define what constitutes its culture today, and what it should look like in the future.\n\nThe  project  will  begin  with  a  questionnaire  sent  to  all  Group employees. This will give Orange an idea of what makes the company unique and where its strengths lie, and help it understand what attitudes and behaviors need to change in order to improve the corporate culture.\n\nThe project will be rolled out in the first half of 2024. It will also be an opportunity to define the leadership model (the Orange managerial model) and revisit the management culture that the company wants to instill.\n\nEmployee feedback is central to the work of HR and management. This is an important step for Quality of Life at Work, giving Orange an insight into how the progress already made within the Group and its various business lines is perceived, and enabling it to identify areas for improvement that meet employee expectations.\n\nNearly  55%  of  Orange  employees  completed  the  2022-2023 Group survey. Overall the results were positive, particularly for employee  engagement:  85%  were  proud  to  work  at  Orange, 77% recommended Orange as a great place to work and 86% recommended its products and services.\n\nThe results confirmed that the Group's strategy had meaning for employees and identified areas for improvement in business processes,  well-being  at  work,  career  prospects  and  skills development. These are taken into account in the new company model.\n\nIn January 2024, Orange introduced a new feedback process for Group employees ('Voice Up'), thereby improving the quality of analysis and peer benchmarking.\n\nThe work on the corporate culture at Orange and the results of employee feedback inform the Group's understanding of the levers of engagement. This drives improvements in the employee and manager experience and shapes the HR policies, processes and tools accordingly.\n\n## 4.3.1.2.2 Skills and skills acquisition\n\nOrange's jobs/skills policy is based on two complementary exercises.\n\n## Strategic planning of the Group's jobs and skills\n\nIn the light of its Lead the future strategic plan, Orange is conducting a Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP) exercise to forecast, prioritize and define HR policies and action plans relating to jobs, professions and skills for the Group's internal and external workforce.\n\nThe exercise is intended to deflect the qualitative and quantitative impacts of major technological, business and market disruption, such as the impact of virtualization and network automation, the continued digitalization of customer relations, and the evolution of business models in the Enterprise market. The growing and increasingly cross-cutting impact of AI, including generative AI, and the transformation of the business model by tilting more toward CSR and security are also analyzed in the various business lines and activities according to different timescales and granularities.\n\nFor  the  France  scope,  the  Employment  and  Professional Development Management exercise covers a three-year period. It supplements the strategic planning by providing a national and local vision by employment area, both to implement tailored action plans and to offer visibility to each employee.\n\nThe identification of skills is based on a business framework that has been implemented in the management tools since the start of 2020, and a skills framework that is currently being finalized; the  strategic  skills  areas  have  already  been  identified.  They include, among other things, key expertise (AI data, cybersecurity, software development, virtualization, Cloud), and 'skills for all' (listening & acting, communicating with impact, working together, demonstrating entrepreneurship, using and securing data).\n\nOrange can therefore identify the appropriate action plans, whether for recruitment, internal mobility, skills development, career progression, retraining, the make-or-buy policy or working arrangements.",

        "page_content": "The 2023-2025 fiscal year is set in a constrained economic context combining the loss of income from the Group's historical activities, the increase in operating costs in an inflationary context, and the continued need for investment in fixed, mobile and Internet networks. It demonstrates the need to continue and accelerate the reduction in the workforce in France for legacy activities, to facilitate the acquisition of new skills to strengthen the strategic areas and activities identified in Lead the future. At the same time, skills are being developed in other countries to support the development of growth regions and activities and move forward with the Group's expansion in Africa & Middle East. For example:\n\n- -in the B2C market, customer interactions increasingly take place via autonomous digital channels, facilitated by the acceleration in the use of AI; the end result is fewer jobs in telephone-based sales and customer service, coupled with a need to strengthen digital skills to improve customer excellence;\n- -in the Enterprise market, the positioning of Orange Business as a leader in new connectivity and digital services, particularly in cybersecurity, simplifying its operating model and adapting its cost structure, has resulted in fewer jobs and a radical change in the skills needed for specialist technical roles, such as cybersecurity experts;\n- -the  support  functions  are  committed  to  streamlining  and sharing services to foster synergy and assist in scaling up, thereby reducing the number of jobs, particularly in France;\n- -at  the  same  time,  Orange  is  strengthening  skills  in  all  its businesses to virtualize its networks and make CSR ambitions operational in all business lines and activities.\n\n## Skills acquisition\n\nSkills acquisition is one of the Group's core strategic challenges in  order  to  adapt  individually  and  collectively  to  changes  in professions, skills and new ways of working. This is reflected in a wide range of development options tailored to individual needs. It is based on several complementary tools:\n\n- -a training portal (Orange Learning) for Orange employees, offering  courses  ranging  from  acculturation  for  all  Group employees to certification for experts, as well as self-service content such as virtual classes and podcasts; this customized and  customizable  interface  offers  distance  or  face-to-face learning with various innovative methods for developing skills. Orange Learning thus contributes to the personal development of each employee, in line with the Group's strategy;\n- -the  network  of  Group  schools,  offering  training  based  on priority areas for the Group: data and artificial intelligence, cybersecurity,  CSR,  the  Cloud  and  network  virtualization. It allows employees to learn more about the business lines, improve  their  knowledge,  become  an  expert,  or  obtain  a certificate or diploma. It relies on its internal business experts and lead partners in the education sector;\n- -local business schools involved in activities at a regional level, as a result of which all employees can access a wide range of content enabling them to train in their professional field and develop their skills, or rapidly become operational and gain expertise in a new role.\n\n## 4.3.1.2.3 Attractiveness,  recruitment and mobility\n\nToday's  labor  market,  especially  in  the  field  of  technology,  is extremely dynamic. It is therefore vital for Orange to be an attractive employer, from recruitment through to the end of the employment relationship, if it is to be successful.\n\nOrange has identified its recruitment priorities for technological skills, particularly in the areas of cybersecurity, data processing and artificial intelligence. This applies to the Europe and Africa & Middle East regions. In 2023, Orange recruited nearly 11,000 new permanent employees, mainly from outside France.\n\nOrange builds on its 'employer attractiveness' by leveraging its ability  to  attract,  recruit,  retain  and  rehire  employees  through processes implemented locally to foster engagement and loyalty, which are applied consistently throughout the Group.\n\nThe Group has several tools at its disposal enabling it to meet its needs.\n\n## Recruitment and mobility plans\n\nProfessional  development  programs  can  take  several  forms throughout an employee's career, depending on their wishes. This can consist of job enrichment or a career change within or outside their field, a change of geographical setting, or a broadening of their activities through participation in a project or an assignment, and can be accompanied by a promotion.\n\n## Mobility within the Orange group\n\nThe internal mobility portal 'Job Opportunities,' launched in France in 2023, acts as a single point of access for all employees in their mobility journey. It highlights strategic roles and shows which entities are recruiting and the key skills required.\n\n## Recruitment\n\nIn certain activities in France, particularly in the areas of fiber network construction, copper network maintenance and customer service, outsourcing provides the necessary resources.\n\nAn intergenerational agreement covering the 2022-2024 period, resulting  from  social  dialogue  in  France,  provides  a  defined framework for end-of-career support and skills renewal. It provides for the recruitment of 8,000 employees on permanent contracts, with a particular focus on those under 30, and proposes measures to promote the integration of young people and the transmission of knowledge.\n\n## Talent management\n\nThe Group's Talent Management policy is based on the firm belief that every employee has talent and potential. It is up to managers, with the support of HR teams, to identify and develop that talent and potential by designing a personal development plan for each employee.\n\nThe Group Talent Management policy reflects the twin goals of excellence and inclusion, starting with external recruitment and continuing to the upper echelons of the Group to:\n\n- -offer genuine development prospects by facilitating career progression;\n- -fill key positions through better planning;\n- -set up a common foundation (governance, processes, tools, timetable) to provide structure for the management of leadership networks and talent spotting;\n- -ensure representativeness in management roles, key project management and high-level expertise;\n- -increase  diversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4 -\n\n## 4.3.1.2.4 Compensation  policy\n\nFive principles define how Orange rewards its employees. They are known to everyone within the Group. At the local level (country or entity), the principles are applied through the local compensation policy, which defines the specific salary arrangements for each employee (fixed and variable compensation, benefits, etc.).\n\nThe five principles involve monetary and/or non-monetary programs They  cover  all  Orange  employees,  regardless  of  their  status, gender, length of service or title. They provide guidance to ensure competitive, attractive and fair compensation and benefits policies in all entities and regions. The principles are as follows:\n\n- -place value on collective performance, so that all employees are collectively recognized for their contribution to the business through 'value sharing';\n- -recognize individual contributions through fair compensation, depending  on  the  level  of  responsibility,  expertise  and performance;\n- -attract and retain key skills, paying particular attention to market positioning and offering a competitive package to attract and retain the talent essential for Orange to fulfill its ambitions;\n- -reinforce the sense of belonging by integrating benefits for all employees, regardless of their status or level of responsibility, and by offering them career development opportunities;\n- -be  fair,  ensure  that  compensation  decisions  reflect  the differences between employees and apply the appropriate measures. Equity can be both a differentiating and harmonizing factor.\n\nThe  principles  are  implemented  on  the  basis  of  a  structured framework and tools to ensure their harmonized roll-out in all Orange entities. These include salary scales for each position to allow  differentiation,  annual  salary  and  variable  compensation increases, harmonization committees composed of HR managers and operational managers, and compensation benchmarks.\n\nIt is also based on a commitment to clarity and transparency toward employees. To that end, Orange ensures that each employee has access to clear, comprehensive information through various communication channels and documentary resources.\n\nTo  complete  this  framework,  as  well  as  the  longstanding commitments described in the global agreement on fundamental rights, Orange is continuing its work to strengthen its policy to ensure that all Group entities guarantee a decent wage based on a common definition.\n\nThe sens of belonging to the Group is also fuelled by one-off employee  share  ownership  programs,  in  France  by  annual collective compensation mechanisms (incentives and profit-sharing agreements) entitling the holder to investments in Orange shares and, for senior executives, by a conditional multi-year variable compensation plan for the allocation of shares (see section 5.4.1.3 Structure of the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board for 2024 and Note 6.3 Remuneration in shares and similar in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThese three programs contribute to strengthening the share of employees in the Group's capital (see section 6.2.1 Distribution of capital and voting rights).\n\nIn particular, in France, a profit-sharing agreement was signed with trade unions in June 2013, replacing the previous agreement. This  agreement  applies  to  employees  of  Orange SA  and  its majority-owned  French  subsidiaries  that  are  parties  to  the\n\nagreement.  Using  a  dispensatory  calculation  formula,  each company's special profit-sharing reserve is equal to 4% of its operating income (French standard), and the Group's profit sharing amounts the sum of the positive special profit-sharing reserves of the companies that are parties to the agreement. The Group's special profit-sharing reserve is distributed among all beneficiaries, 20% based on their length of service and 80% in proportion to their gross annual compensation. The sums allocated individually are, at the employees' choice, received directly or allocated to the Group's Savings Plans.\n\nIn addition, still in France, incentive agreements are signed in each company concerned. They collectively associate employees with the company's results. Most of these agreements are based on a financial indicator and operational priorities. The profit-sharing envelope, if objectives are achieved, is most often 4% of salaries. Under the agreement at Orange SA covering the years 2021 to 2023, the incentive bonus is primarily based on the achievement of an operational performance indicator (growth of revenue, control of operating expenses and optimization of investments in all markets) for a weight of 60%. This indicator is complemented by an indicator relating to the quality of service offered to customers with a weight of 30% (a measure of customer satisfaction across all universes and markets) and a social responsibility indicator relating to the reduction of CO 2 emissions generated by the activity, for a weight of 10%.\n\n## 4.3.1.2.5 Social  dialogue\n\nIn addition to the social dialogue that takes place within the Group's companies, according to locally applicable rules and practices, Orange has the means in place for international social dialogue.\n\nThese primarily consist of forums for international social dialogue, i.e. the European Works Council, the Worldwide Works Council and the Orange-UNI global union Alliance. It also encompasses three global agreements, signed by the Group and implemented under the auspices of local social dialogue: the agreement on fundamental social rights, the agreement on health and safety and the agreement on equality in the workplace.\n\n## Forums for international social dialogue\n\n## European Works Council\n\nThe  Orange  European  Works  Council  was  created  by  an agreement dated April 14, 2004. It is the representative body for the Group's employees in the European Union and EFTA (Norway and Switzerland). It is composed of employee representatives from each country included in the scope. There are currently 24 employee representatives (representing 18 countries) on the European Works Council. It is a forum for discussion and social dialogue at European level on economic, financial and social issues that concern either all of the Group's companies within its scope, or at least two companies in two member countries. Through this forum, management informs and consults European employee representatives on any major decisions at European level that could impact working or employment conditions.\n\nThe agreement governing the European Works Council provides that the Council must meet at least three times a year. In reality, it meets much more often, owing to the increasing internationalization of transformation projects. In 2023, the European Works Council met seven times. It was consulted, among other things, on the development  of  the  organizational  model  of  the  Finance  and Performance Department, on Orange's planned withdrawal from retail banking in France and Spain, and on the plan to merge the operations of Orange Espagne with those of the company M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil.",

        "page_content": "## Worldwide Works Council\n\nThe  Orange  Worldwide  Works  Council  was  created  by  an agreement dated June 23, 2010. This is a forum for social dialogue allowing information to be exchanged on economic, financial and employee-related issues with a transnational impact. It allows the Group's strategy and challenges to be shared in all regions where Orange is present and has more than 400 employees. There are currently 34 employee representatives (representing 27 countries) on the Worldwide Works Council.\n\nThis forum is part of Orange's Corporate Societal Responsibility (CSR) development strategy. It creates a space for social dialogue at  the  global  level  by  allowing  employee  representatives  and management to engage in dialogue and discuss and share the major challenges facing the Group.\n\nThe Worldwide Works Council does not replace existing national representation bodies or the European Works Council. It meets at least once a year and may be convened on an extraordinary basis if necessary. Meetings of the Worldwide Works Council are chaired by the HR Director of Orange. In 2023, the Worldwide Works Council met in April, when the Chief Executive Officer unveiled the new strategic plan and its equivalent versions for Orange Business and Orange MEA - two divisions that are central to the Group's strategy.\n\n## Orange-UNI global union Alliance\n\nApart from the two forums consisting of the European Works Council  and  the  Worldwide  Works  Council,  Orange  has  long engaged in high-quality dialogue with the UNI global union. This represents more than 20 million workers in 150 countries working in the services sector, including the telecommunication sector.\n\nAt Orange, the national unions that are members of the UNI are organized in an Alliance. In 2023, 23 trade unions present at Orange joined the Alliance (12 in Africa and 11 in Europe).\n\nThe joint declaration (known as the 'Douala Declaration') signed in 2018 governs the functioning of the Alliance and reaffirms the importance of a global social dialogue. The declaration provides for two formal annual meetings between Orange Management and the Alliance.\n\nThe  meetings  are  an  opportunity  to  take  stock  of  progress concerning the roll-out of the global agreements (see above). They also allow an open debate to take place on topics of global interest. This year, for example, the Alliance's plenary meeting addressed the subject of generative artificial intelligence and its potential impact on jobs and skills.\n\nIn addition, following a request from the Alliance's trade unions to gain more insight into Orange's Vigilance Plan, the Societal and Environmental  Responsibility  Department  and  the  International Social Relations Department held three workshops from September to November 2023, at which trade union representatives were able to express their views on issues around the duty of vigilance and their perception of the risks.\n\n## Global agreements\n\nOrange has signed three global agreements with the international trade union federation UNI. These agreements define principles that apply to all employees of Orange companies.\n\n## Global agreement on fundamental social rights within the France T\u00e9l\u00e9com group\n\nSigned in December 2006, this first global agreement defines Orange's commitments in terms of respect for fundamental human rights.\n\nAs part of the application of the fundamental conventions of the ILO, Orange undertakes to take particular care to:\n\n- -\n- prevent the use of forced labor;\n\n- -prohibit child labor and exploitation;\n- -combat  discrimination;\n- -ensure occupational health and safety;\n- -respect freedom of association and the principle of collective bargaining.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  fight  against  all  forms  of  compulsory  and forced labor and the prohibition of child labor, Orange condemns and prohibits the use of all forms of forced or compulsory labor in accordance with ILO conventions 29 and 105 on forced labor. As provided for by ILO Conventions 138 and 182 on the minimum age for entry into work, it also prohibits the employment of children under the age at which mandatory schooling ceases in the country concerned or, in any event, under 15 years of age.\n\nIn terms of non-discrimination and as a matter of principle, the Orange group does not discriminate in any way in matters of employment  relations.  In  particular,  it  hires  men  and  women according to their skills and treats everyone with dignity, in a non-discriminatory manner and with respect for their age, social origin, family situation, gender, sexual orientation, disability, political, trade union and religious opinions, and their belonging or not belonging, whether real or assumed, to an ethnic group or nation in accordance with ILO Convention 111. This theme was subsequently developed in the global agreement signed in 2019 on equality in the workplace within Orange and which reaffirms its commitment to the fight against discrimination and specifies its means of action in this regard (awareness-raising, training, reporting systems, processing of reports).\n\nIn terms of health, safety and working conditions, Orange constantly strives to ensure the health and working conditions of its employees, and ensures the medical care of its employees in compliance with local legislation. The commitment made under this agreement to implement a managed health care policy in all Orange entities was supplemented by the negotiation and signature of a separate global agreement in 2006 on the health and safety of Orange employees.\n\nIn matters of social dialogue and relations with union organizations, Orange recognizes its employees' right to freedom of association, representation and membership in a trade union, in accordance with the principles set out in ILO Convention 87 (1948) on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize. Employees are free to become members of a trade union of their choice or to choose not to do so.\n\nThe effective respect of fundamental social rights is driven by the following actions implemented by Orange and/or the UNI federation:\n\n- -trade union education provided jointly by management and the UNI in the event of the integration of a new country into the Group's scope based on Orange's signed agreements;\n- -direct dialogue during scheduled meetings or outside these meetings, with questioning (conflict resolution clause provided for in the agreement) concerning, in particular, escalations of  collective  bargaining  matters  in  Group  companies  or subcontractors' respect of social rights (example during the Covid  crisis,  concerning  the  way  in  which  subcontractors ensured the protection of their employees);\n- -in terms of purchasing, the Supplier Code of Conduct and the CSR clause incorporated into the contract remind suppliers of their obligations in terms of freedom of association, non-use of child labor, non-discrimination, diversity, inclusion, non-use of slavery and forced labor, and CSR audits (see section 4.3.2.2.3 Supplier Code of Conduct). Prior assessments or audits ensure that suppliers comply with these principles;\n- -implementation of a whistleblowing tool (called Hello Ethics), available to employees of Group entities and subcontractors, allowing them to report violations of human rights and freedom of association, or of personal health and safety (see section 4.4.2.4 Group whistleblowing system);\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

These three global agreements form a common foundation for Orange's entities, particularly in the event of the Group's expansion (as in the case of the acquisition of operators in Sierra Leone and Liberia in 2020).\n\n## Oranges global health and safety agreement\n\nSigned in November 2014, the global health and safety agreement lays down a common foundation for action for the Group in terms of occupational health and safety, quality of life at work and health protection in general.\n\nBased  on  a  participatory  approach  involving  all  stakeholders, including social dialogue in the field of occupational health and safety,  it  also  requires  particular  vigilance  with  regard  to  the occupational health and safety policy specific to Orange's partners and subcontractors that preceded the law on the duty of vigilance and the ISO 45001 international standard dated 2018.\n\n## Global agreement on gender equality in the workplace within Orange\n\nSigned in July 2019, this agreement aims to help integrate gender equality in the workplace, the fight against discrimination and violence, and work-life balance in all the Group's activities by relying on a structured local social dialogue that allows local assessments to be carried out and appropriate action plans to be defined.\n\nLastly, the agreement reiterates Orange's commitment to combating all forms of discrimination, sexism and harassment.\n\n## Social dialogue in France\n\nIn 2023,  the  Corporate  Social  and  Economic  Committee (CSEC)  of  UES  Orange  met  24 times,  mainly  for  recurring information-consultation  meetings  (strategy,  the  company's economic and financial position, social policy, employment and working conditions), for discussions on health and safety, and for ad hoc information-consultation meetings, mainly concerning changes in the organization and structure of the Group.\n\nThe French Works Council, which brings together the Group's subsidiaries in France with employees, met three times during fiscal year 2023, dealing with information relating to the Group's financial position, business and employment trends.\n\n## 4.3.1.2.6 Health, safety, quality of life and working conditions\n\nThe Group's occupational health and safety policy is integrated into the corporate strategy and is the subject of social dialogue supported by agreements. It applies to the entire Group with clearly identified means. It is based on an occupational health and safety management system rolled out by the entities and relies in particular on an annual survey conducted with all Group employees.\n\n## Organization\n\nSince July 2023, a new organization has been in place, which aims to ensure Group consistency in the health and safety, quality of life and working conditions (QLWC) approach, notably by strengthening the coordination and organization of the international scope.\n\nA new Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Quality of Life & Working Conditions  department  (DEI  &  QLWC)  addresses  these cross-cutting issues and commitments for the Group's scope. It pursues the following three main objectives:\n\n- -strengthening the culture of prevention and vigilance in order to guarantee the safety of employees, protect their health, be attentive to psychosocial risks (PSR), and continuously improve the quality of life and working conditions in all the Group's geographical locations;\n- -listening  to  employees  in  order  to  build  a  QLWC  value proposition that takes into account the diversity of profiles, career paths and local contexts;\n- -providing an inclusive environment of trust, in which each employee can turn their individuality into a strength for the community.\n\nTo this end, it coordinates a group of geographical region and business line experts spanning France and abroad. Each expert is responsible for handling these issues within their own scope by coordinating stakeholders, monitoring roll-outs, tracking indicators and sharing best practices.\n\nThroughout the Group, a large number of stakeholders are involved in occupational risk prevention, although the organization may differ from one geographical area to another. These employees work with work groups or provide individual support, with the clear objective of anticipating risks (primary prevention). Depending on their assignments, they act in support of and alongside Human Resources and managers, and some are in direct contact with employees.\n\nOperational and cross-functional coordination of the health, safety and QLWC community is provided by management or the HR departments. Depending on the entity, QLWC Operational Directors may also be appointed to carry out this role.\n\nThe main stakeholders in this community are:\n\n- -prevention specialists or other Health & Safety functions, who provide expertise and advice to management and supervisors;\n- -occupational Health and Prevention Services (or Occupational Medicine), which bring together occupational physicians (as advisors to the company), nurses and other medical specialists;\n- -social workers and support providers, who also contribute to prevention through their actions, in particular through their individual monitoring.\n\n## Health, safety, quality of life and working conditions policy\n\nOrange's  commitment  to  occupational  health  and  safety  is addressed at the highest level and is based on the global health and  safety  agreement  signed  in  November 2014,  which  lays down a common foundation for action for the Group in terms of occupational health, safety, quality of life at work and health protection in general. Its operational application benefits from the framework put in place in compliance with the French Law with extraterritorial application of March 27, 2017 on the Duty of Vigilance and the laws and regulations in force in each country.\n\nIn 2023, General Management has reaffirmed health, safety, quality of life and working conditions as an absolute priority to ensure the Group's success and sustainability. This commitment is supported by a new policy letter signed in October 2023, whose guidelines are fully in line with the new Lead the future strategic plan and meet the requirements of the new company model based on trust, performance and excellence:\n\n- -strengthen trust through safe, peaceful working conditions that promote personal fulfillment at work, thereby fostering commitment, attractiveness and loyalty;\n- -enhance the performance of initiatives to improve working conditions  and  employee  well-being  by  standardizing  and sharing best practices;",

        "page_content": "- -aim for excellence by strengthening the primary prevention culture in order to reconcile economic development and social performance against a backdrop of profound change.\n\nThe implementation of this policy remains the responsibility of the Group's Divisions and Subsidiaries. They are in charge of adapting the policy to local specificities, as well as to the business lines or activities, throughout the scope that they address; they must therefore work with their entities, subsidiaries and subcontractors, in compliance with Group policy and laws and regulations, for which each operational director is responsible.\n\n## Occupational health and safety management\n\nThe Group's policy is based on the Orange group's global health and safety agreement of November 21, 2014, which requires the roll-out of an occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS) within each Group entity.\n\nIn 2023, Orange's Internal Guidelines will be replaced by ISO 45001. The choice of these international guidelines was driven by the desire to roll out a common, coherent and consistent approach throughout the Group. It will give the approach greater visibility and clarity, both internally and externally. However, it is left to the discretion of each entity to decide whether or not to go as far as certification.\n\nCompliance  is  analyzed  on  the  basis  of  the  quantitative  and qualitative criteria set out in the agreement. OHSMSs are audited internally by expert service providers under framework agreements managed by the Group.\n\nThe analysis of indicators and the development of action plans are supported, monitored and promoted by the Group Quality of Life at Work Department, and are presented annually to the UNI global union. These indicators cover accident data (workplace and commuting accidents), sick leave, OHSMS roll-out and health campaigns. Accident data is monitored within the Group and among subcontractors.\n\nIn France, a number of agreements promote the roll-out of the Group's health, safety and quality of life and working conditions policy and the active prevention of risks to employee health and safety:\n\n- -the agreement on teleworking (2013), amended in 2017, making teleworking part of an overall financial, social and environmental performance approach, with expected benefits in terms of well-being at work and savings in commute time;\n- -the agreement on the assessment and adaptation of workloads (2016), setting out a methodological framework and common benchmarks, providing a practical understanding of workload issues in relation to changes in the workforce and skills;\n- -the agreement  on  the  assessment  and  prevention  of psychosocial  risks  at  work  (2010),  notably  endorsing  the creation of a National Stress Prevention Committee (Comit\u00e9 National Pr\u00e9vention du Stress);\n- -methodology agreement for the management of commercial real estate projects for Orange in France, signed on March 14, 2023.\n\n## Listening to employees\n\nThe policy is based on a system of listening to employees, including an  annual  survey  of  all  Group  employees,  allowing  them  to express their views on their experience working at Orange, their understanding of the Group's challenges and its transformation.\n\nIn  France,  the  National  Stress  Prevention  Committee  (Comit\u00e9 National Pr\u00e9vention du Stress - CNPS) periodically performs an assessment of psychosocial risks (PSR) as part of the three-year\n\n- 4\n\n'Work Conditions and Stress' survey, as required by the agreement on the evaluation and prevention of psychosocial risks in the workplace. The action plan that gave rise to the 2021 survey was still followed in 2023, and will continue until its next edition.\n\n## Measures in place to ensure health, safety, quality of life and working conditions\n\n## Health protection programs\n\nOrange's global health and safety agreement also promotes any initiatives to participate in health protection programs adapted to local contexts and practices. In particular, it ensures that employees are not discriminated against in terms of health, with a particular focus on population groups whose health makes them vulnerable.\n\nIt has led to the adoption of health care coverage by the company within its African entities. The financing of the construction and maintenance of Orange Villages by the Orange Foundation (active since 2005), with a school, water sources, health center and mother and child protection centers, is also part of the health promotion initiatives called for by the global health and safety agreement. In the same spirit, an annual collaboration with the World Health Organization allows Orange to be an e-health operational player alongside local bodies in a number of African countries.\n\nAs part of its efforts to promote physical activity and sport among its employees, Orange covers a portion of the cost of sport association membership in France and in most European countries, and holds many events that bring the Group's employees together, such as the Armor Cup, an official race of F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Voile (the French Sailing Federation). Nearly 300 Orange sailors participated in the 24th race held in 2023. The Orange Heroes program offers all Orange employees in France the chance to participate in a wide range of sporting and solidarity challenges.\n\n## The prevention of physical and psychosocial risks\n\nOrange pays particular attention to the prevention of both physical and psychosocial risks. Risks are identified and assessed according to a Group methodology.\n\nIn  2022  and  2023,  a  major  project  to  standardize  Single Occupational Risk Assessment documents (Documents Uniques d'Evaluation des Risques Professionnels - DUERP) was carried out within the Group's different business areas. Participants shared the dangerous situations they had encountered and the related best practices, thus contributing to the development of primary prevention.\n\nFollowing on from the 2022 theme of occupational risk assessment, in 2023 the theme of action was 'analysis of accidental events and sharing of feedback.' In this context, accident feedback sessions were held within the prevention specialists' network, with a two-fold objective:\n\n- -upskilling/maintaining  the  skills  of  Prevention  functions, particularly in scopes where accidents are rare;\n- -continuously improving the prevention measures through a more detailed and relevant analysis of events, whether they have potentially or actually led to accidents.\n\nAs part of its preventive actions, Orange is raising awareness among  its  employees  and  managers  about  workload  and hyperconnectivity. For example, in France, around forty workshops on work regulation brought together managers with the aim of better integrating workload assessments and the prevention of psychosocial risks (PSR).\n\nThese issues are also addressed formally by managers during annual one-on-one interviews in France, so that solutions can be explored in the event of an overload of activity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Where  applicable,  a  Multidisciplinary  Prevention Group (MPG) is established with work environment managers, prevention specialists, occupational physicians and occupational social workers. The MPG reviews all the changes taking place in the transformation process that impact employees. It analyzes human impacts using the Gollac grid from the French Directorate of Research, Studies and Statistics Coordination (Direction de l'Animation de la Recherche, des Etudes et des Statistiques DARES), the statistics unit that supports France's Ministry of Labor.\n\nSupplemental analyses can also be proposed, for example, by conducting human impact surveys among employees. The results enrich the analysis of the existing situation.\n\nOnce  the  project  has  been  implemented,  an  interview  phase can begin, with a view to co-developing local organizations and strengthening managerial support. Depending on needs, these may be group interviews by business line and by region, or individual interviews, which may be supplemented by work site observations carried out by those involved in prevention work.\n\nAn HR assessment takes the form of a survey offered to employees between  six  and  nine  months  after  the  roll-out  of  the  new organization, in order to assess the effectiveness of the action plans implemented by the company, and to propose any adjustments required as part of the continuous improvement process.\n\nThis long-term approach is helping familiarize project management teams  and  managers  with  psychosocial  risks,  improve  risk prevention for Orange employees, and ensure that action plans address the risks assessed.\n\nIn 2023, all organizational transformations at Orange in France took place using this methodology.\n\n## Taking health and safety into account in real estate projects\n\nOrange also supports its employees in real estate projects, with the aim of providing a safe, healthy and inclusive working environment in line with work organizations and agreements.\n\nThe management of real estate programs is evolving with a global vision and a cross-cutting, systemic approach, in order to design dynamic environments that make everyone's work a bit easier and  provide  employees  with  good  working  conditions.  Some implemented  examples  include  the  consideration  of  improved auditory  perception  by  integrating  psychoacoustics  (impact  of sound on cognitive abilities and individual interpretation of sound according to personal psychological needs).\n\n## Support for employees\n\nOrange provides support to help its employees who are caregivers, new parents or victims of domestic violence:\n\n- -for example, caregivers in France can take part in sharing workshops  (monthly  workshops  for  caregivers  of  children and parents). Fifty workshops of this type were held in 2023. In  addition,  information  sessions  are  offered  to  interested employees to guide them through the measures the Group makes available to them, administrative aspects, occasional leave and individual professional support;\n- -'New parent' support programs are also offered, and may entitle employees to additional leave;\n- -victims of domestic violence are also supported, and can, on a case-by-case basis, take advantage of occasional leave, flexible working hours and financial assistance.\n\nThese actions help to prevent absenteeism.\n\n## Support for 'complex' situations\n\n'Complex' situations are those whose nature, complexity or history require decontextualized support.\n\nSince 2011, the National Support and Mediation Mission (Mission Nationale de soutien et de m\u00e9diation) has been helping resolve complex individual and collective situations, within a collegial and multidisciplinary framework. It takes action when other HR and managerial dialogue avenues have failed. Since its creation, the Mission has assisted in over 800 situations.\n\nThrough its observations and the lessons learned from its work, the Mission also contributes to the company's vigilance with regard to these situations, and to improving risk prevention and quality of life at work.\n\nSince  2019,  the  Mission  has  had  a  Chairman  and  a  General Secretariat made up of three permanent members. It coordinates a network of ten internal mediators.\n\n## Remediation\n\nFollowing on from the 'Evaluation and Compensation Committee' - established in July 2019 - Orange assigned the review of certain claims considered to be outside its remit to Group experts assisted by two members of the Evaluation and Compensation Committee. A closing meeting was held in October 2023 in the presence of the Chief Executive Officer and representatives of the trade unions who supported the work. On this occasion, a final quantitative and qualitative report was presented to the participants. In all, 88% of complaints have been settled, and more than 1,800 interviews have been conducted with those concerned as part of the work of these two committees.\n\n## 4.3.1.2.7 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nOrange's ambition is to provide an inclusive environment of trust, in which employees can turn their individuality into a strength at the service of collective performance.\n\nThis  ambition  translates  into  the  following  major  challenges: combating  all  forms  of  discrimination;  creating  an  inclusive environment;  designing  accessible  products  and  services; increasing  competitiveness  through  talent  diversification;  and taking action for an inclusive and cohesive society by supporting guidance, skills development, integration through employment, and fostering employability for all.\n\nIn 2004, this ambition led to the signing of charters and agreements, and culminated in the establishment of our first diversity policy in 2009.",

        "page_content": "A  global  agreement (1) concluded  in  2019  strengthens  the Group's commitments and expands its scope to suppliers and subcontractors.  It  sets  common  objectives  for  equality  in  the workplace, in particular for an increased proportion of women in technical professions, gender diversity at all levels of responsibility, equal pay for comparable positions, the fight against discrimination and violence, and work-life balance.\n\nIn October 2023, the Group's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policy was amended and approved by the Executive Committee. It has expanded its principal scope from gender equality in the workplace to include all aspects of diversity, structured around three pillars: gender equality in the workplace, equal opportunities and digital equality.\n\nIn each country, local committees manage the indicators related to this agreement, contributing to a proactive and participatory approach that adapts to the national context. The global agreement is monitored via external audits to obtain the GEEIS (2) label, which confirms the commitment of the Group's entities. In 2023, this label was awarded to 11 entities, bringing the total to 24 certified entities in 20 countries.\n\nOrange  regularly  assesses  its  equality-in-the-workplace  and diversity  actions  through  international  initiatives,  rankings  and awards, as illustrated by its position on Statista and the Financial Times's 'Europe's Diversity Leaders 2024' list, on which it is ranked 35th out of 850 inclusive companies. In the international Equileap ranking on gender equality in the workplace, Orange was ranked 35th out of 4,000 companies worldwide, and 5th in its sector.\n\n## Awareness-raising and training on diversity, equity and inclusion challenges\n\nDiversity and inclusion training is crucial to creating an inclusive, high-performance work environment. To support this ambition, a dedicated and segmented training plan has been implemented, featuring specific modules in line with the Group's priorities:\n\n- -an  inclusive  management  self-assessment  tool  was  first launched  in  France  to  train  managers  on  how  to  reduce decision-making biases and stereotypes. In 2023, this system was  expanded  and  adapted  into  nine  languages  for  an international roll-out in 40 countries;\n- -an online training course on equality in the workplace, available in five languages, was also rolled out in 2018 and has been taken by 51,000 employees to date;\n- -an e-learning program has been created to raise employee awareness of the digital accessibility challenges those with disabilities face. This course, available both in French and English, has been taken by over 3,000 employees;\n- -in early 2023, content to expand knowledge on neurodiversity and its challenges in the workplace was rolled out in French and English. By the end of 2023, nearly 1,000 people had taken the course.\n\n## Gender equality in the workplace\n\nThe gender equality in the workplace pillar is based on five areas: an increased proportion of women in technical professions; equal access by women to positions of responsibility; equal pay for comparable positions; the fight against discrimination and violence; and work-life balance.\n\n## An increased proportion of women in technical professions\n\nTo meet the challenge of recruiting more women into tech and digital professions, Orange has decided to launch the Hello Women program, which has been rolled out with a number of partners. This program has been structured in a way that addresses the main obstacles encountered in this approach: raising awareness among young girls and female students of these promising careers;\n\n- 4\n\nrecruiting and retraining women in these professions; and retaining these  women  within  Orange.  Since  the  program's  launch  in 2020, 26 projects have been supported and rolled out in around 20 countries.\n\nFor example, in Slovakia in 2023, the partnership with the Aj Ty v IT association,  which  holds  awareness-raising  workshops  and provides coding education for female high school students, trained 460 girls.\n\n## Equal access by women to positions of responsibility\n\nWith regard to equal access by women to positions of responsibility, a significant step toward equality in the workplace is shown in France with Orange's rise in the 2023 SBF 120 ranking, on which it now ranks 10th (38th in 2022).\n\n## Equal pay\n\nIn order to achieve the Group's objective of equal pay for comparable work, Orange has implemented a shared methodology and tool within the Group to measure and analyze pay gaps between men and women. This allows each country to implement corrective action plans. In France, Orange scored 89 out of 100 in France's 2023 Professional Equality Index (3) .\n\n## Combating sexism, harassment and violence\n\nAs part of its proactive initiative to combat sexism, harassment and violence, Orange has implemented a comprehensive system to prevent, detect and handle all situations of harassment, sexism, and violence in the workplace, and advocates zero tolerance of such behavior.\n\nJust as in previous years, in 2023 training and awareness-raising activities were conducted to support countries in implementing their own systems to prevent and deal efficiently with such situations, while taking care to respect cultural elements and the local context. As such, over the past year, we'v e provided support in five countries: Botswana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Morocco, Romania and Senegal.\n\n## Work-life balance\n\nLastly, Orange encourages each entity to take actions that promote a  harmonious  work-life  balance.  For  example,  for  employees of Orange Belgium, new fathers have been entitled to 20 days' paternity leave since January 1, 2023.\n\n## Equal opportunities\n\nThe equal opportunities pillar aims to give everyone the chance to express and develop their potential, from the moment they're hired and throughout their career, no matter their origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, cognitive diversity or opinions. In December 2023, the Group produced an international report for the very first time on 'disability, accessibility and neurodiversity,' illustrating its 20 years of commitment with contributions from 55 entities in 39 countries. The aim of this report was to provide an overview of the Group's initiatives for the inclusion of people with disabilities. The report serves as a reference tool to identify areas for improvement, in line with the principle of continuous improvement that characterizes a responsible approach.\n\nIn  France,  the  agreement  for  the  employment  of  people  with disabilities has been extended until 2024.\n\nIn  France,  Orange  supports  a  number  of  youth  integration associations (Capital Filles, Article 1, \u00c9nergie Jeunes, NQT et Proxit\u00e9,  JOB  IRL,  Ptech)  and  participates  in  the  government program 1Jeune, 1 Mentor. In this context, Orange has helped over 37,000 young people, both individually and collectively, from disadvantaged  backgrounds,  high-priority  city  neighborhoods (quartiers prioritaires de la ville - QPV) or revitalized rural areas (zones rurales revitalis\u00e9es - ZRR), to enter the world of business. Over 600 Orange employees are involved in these partnerships.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This momentum was extended to the Orange Polska subsidiary in 2023 with the signing of the 'Declaration of Support for the LGBTQ+ Community,' and the creation of its own internal community.\n\nFinally,  with  regard  to  the  expression  of  religious  beliefs  in the  workplace,  Orange  offers  training  for  managers  and  HR departments in France. Nearly 450 people have taken part to date. A complementary guide, 'Expressing religious beliefs in the workplace: understanding and taking action at Orange in France,' is also available.\n\nOrange also fosters the relationship between France and its armed forces, with 175 employees throughout the country registered as reservists in 2023. Dedicated programs support this commitment to the reserves, such as tailored HR processes to manage occasional leave,  or  support  for  the  solidarity  initiatives  of  its  reservists, such as a reference to the recruitment of wounded servicemen and servicewomen in the disability agreement, or assistance in retraining servicemen and servicewomen or their spouses through an agreement with D\u00e9fense Mobilit\u00e9 signed in 2022.\n\n## Digital equality and the fight against digital discrimination\n\nThe digital equality and the fight against digital discrimination pillar promotes the International Charter for Inclusive Artificial Intelligence in partnership with the Arborus Endowment Fund, which had 126 signatories as of the end of 2023. In 2020, Orange, the first company to receive the international GEEIS-AI (1) label, confirmed the Group's commitment to artificial intelligence designed and\n\ndeveloped in a responsible and inclusive manner (see Section 4.3.3.5.1 Ethical and responsible artificial intelligence). In 2024, the Group will be renewing this label.\n\n## 4.3.1.3 Targets and measures\n\n## 4.3.1.3.1 Employment and skills development\n\nThis section addresses the challenges of skills development and talent retention.\n\nEmployee information is mainly taken from the information system of Orange's HR Department, which sorts information by gender and social-professional category. This data is complemented by data taken from the Group's financial information system.\n\n## 4.3.1.3.1.1 General changes in the number of Group employees\n\nIn  2023,  Orange  experienced  several  changes  in  its  scope, notably with the merger of the Orange Cara\u00efbe subsidiary into Orange SA (303 permanent contracts), the acquisition of Nehs Digital  (273 permanent  contracts)  and  Xperis  (14 permanent contracts)  by  Enovacom,  the  healthcare  subsidiary  of  Orange Business, and within the Europe division with the acquisition of VOO (1,235 permanent contracts) by Orange Belgium, the merger of A3Com (42 permanent contracts) into Orange Belgium, and the mergers of the Interkar Telewizja and Swiatlowodowa Kaszebe subsidiaries into Interkam in Poland (22 permanent contracts).\n\n| Number of employees - active employees at end of period   | 2023        | 2022 (on a  comparable  basis)   | 2022 (on a  historical  basis)   | 2021 (on a  historical  basis)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Orange SA                                                 | 60,423      | 63,067                           | 62,765                           | 66,599                           |\n| o/w CDI                                                   | 59,716      | 62,320                           | 62,028                           | 65,981                           |\n| o/w CDD                                                   | 707         | 747                              | 737                              | 618                              |\n| French subsidiaries                                       | 12,917      | 12,130                           | 12,140                           | 11,842                           |\n| o/w CDI                                                   | 12,725      | 11,796                           | 11,796                           | 11,402                           |\n| o/w CDD                                                   | 192         | 334                              | 344                              | 440                              |\n| Total France  (1)                                         | 73,340      | 75,197                           | 74,905                           | 78,441                           |\n| International subsidiaries  (1)                           | 63,754      | 62,811                           | 61,525                           | 61,257                           |\n| o/w CDI                                                   | 62,213      | 61,300                           | 60,032                           | 59,545                           |\n| o/w CDD                                                   | 1,541       | 1,511                            | 1,493                            | 1,713                            |\n| Group total                                               | \uf0fc\uf0fc  137,094 | 138,008                          | 136,430                          | 139,698                          |\n\nAt the end of 2023, the Group had 137,094 active employees, including 134,654 on permanent contracts and 2,440 on fixed-term contracts. The number of permanent contracts decreased 0.6% (i.e. by 762), and fixed-term contracts decreased 5.9% (i.e. by 152). On a comparable basis, these trends vary according to the scope of consolidation of employees.\n\nThe decrease in permanent contracts was mainly driven by the French entities with, at end-December, 72,441 employees, i.e. a decline of 1,675 employees (down 2.3%). This decrease was attributable to Orange SA (2,604 fewer permanent contracts, i.e. a 4.2% decrease) and not its subsidiaries (929 additional permanent contracts, i.e. a 7.9% increase).\n\nAt  end-2023,  62,213 permanent  employees  were  part  of  the workforce of subsidiaries outside France, an increase of 1.5% (i.e. 914 additional permanent employees). This international stability corresponds to different situations in reality, namely:\n\n- -growth in the permanent workforce (on a comparable basis) within:\n\n- -Orange Business (+891 additional permanent contracts, i.e. a +5.4% increase), in emerging markets (Madagascar, Morocco, Mauritius and India) within Equant,\n- -Orange Innovation (+533 additional permanent contracts, i.e. a +25% increase), mainly in Morocco and Tunisia,\n- -the  Orange  MEA  division  (146 additional  permanent contracts, i.e. a 1% increase);\n- -the Europe division conversely posted a decrease (660 fewer permanent contracts, i.e. a 2.3% decrease), due to a reduction in the workforce in Poland (351 fewer permanent contracts, i.e. a 4% decrease) and Romania (239 fewer permanent contracts, i.e. a 4% decrease) through voluntary departure plans to adapt skills to market challenges.\n\nThe decrease in the number of employees on fixed-term contracts was driven solely by France (182 fewer fixed-term contracts, i.e. a 17% decrease), while the number of employees on fixed-term contracts outside France rose (30 additional fixed-term contracts, i.e. a 2% increase). This additional workforce, which represented 1.8% of the workforce at the end of 2023 (0.1 point down compared to 2022), is marginal. At the end of 2023, 34% of employees on",

Over 70% of these employees benefit from one of the programs resulting from the agreements for seniors and late-career development, with the great majority opting for the\n\nFrench 'part-time for seniors' plan. More than 7,600 employees opted for the 'part-time for seniors' (TPS) plan over the 2022-2023 period, and more specifically for the 'TPS 2022' formula, introduced as part of the December 17, 2021 intergenerational agreement. This formula, which is accessible to employees taking retirement up to January 1, 2028 at the latest, provides them with a period of 'free time' before their official retirement, which can last up to four years, depending on the employee's situation. The employee remains part of the active workforce during this period.\n\n## 4.3.1.3.1.2 Recruitments and departures\n\n| Employees on permanent contracts   | December   2022  (on a  comparable basis)   | External  recruitments   | Definitive  departures   |   Balance of  movements | December   2023  (completed)   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Orange SA                          | 62,320                                      | 493                      | -3,307                   |                     210 | 59,716                         |\n| French subsidiaries                | 11,796                                      | 2,281                    | -1,124                   |                    -228 | 12,725                         |\n| Total France  (1)                  | 74,116                                      | 2,774                    | -4,431                   |                     -18 | 72,441                         |\n| International subsidiaries  (1)    | 61,300                                      | 8,140                    | -7,122                   |                    -105 | 62,213                         |\n| Group total                        | 135,416                                     | 10,914                   | -11,553                  |                    -123 | 134,654                        |\n\n| Number of permanent external recruitments   | 2023       | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|--------|--------|\n| Orange SA                                   | 493        | 667    | 499    |\n| French subsidiaries                         | 2,281      | 1,838  | 1,696  |\n| Total France  (1)                           | 2,774      | 2,505  | 2,195  |\n| International subsidiaries  (1)             | 8,140      | 9,430  | 7,005  |\n| Group total                                 | \uf0fc\uf0fc  10,914 | 11,935 | 9,200  |\n\nIn 2023, 10,914 employees were recruited on permanent contracts (8.6% down compared to 2022), 75% of them outside France. These new hires strengthen the Group's skills base, which is mainly assessed on the basis of departures, and target the business lines that drive the Group's transformation while creating a change in the average generation of employees (54% of new hires are under 30).\n\n2,774 permanent contracts were signed in France (an 11% increase, i.e. 269 additional  permanent  contracts  compared  to  2022). Over 80% of the new hires will be based in French subsidiaries, supporting the business ambitions of Orange Business subsidiaries (OBS SA, Orange Cyberdefense) and strengthening Orange Store teams as part of the project to optimize the distribution channels.\n\nOutside France, new hires totaled 8,140 in 2023, compared with 9,430 in 2022 (down 1,290, i.e. 13.7%), in line with the decrease in definitive departures (down 1,796, i.e. 20.7%). With more than 80% of new hires in the 'Innovation and Technology' and 'Customer' business areas, this decline was found in the main divisions:\n\n- -the Orange Business division saw the biggest decrease (by 809, i.e. 20%), while having 40% of new hires internationally (Equant, particularly in India, Madagascar and Morocco);\n- -the decline was slightly less pronounced in the Europe (by 347, i.e. 11%) and Orange MEA (by 149, i.e. 10%) divisions.",

This trend was found in all scopes.\n\nIn France, 4,431 departures were recorded in 2023 (1,588 fewer departures compared to 2022, i.e. down 26%), of which 58% were departures due to retirement, almost exclusively at Orange SA. There  were  a  variety  of  different  reasons  for  this  downward trend: departures due to retirement were down 33% (i.e. -1,272) due  to  a  slightly  lower  number  of  eligible  employees  than  in 2022, and above all to the impact of pension reform, which has resulted in employees having to postpone their retirement. There were also fewer resignations (down 139 versus 2022, i.e. 11%), mainly from subsidiaries in the Orange Business division, which\n\noperate  in  technology-intensive  businesses  (software  design, cyberdefense, etc.)  that  are  usually  subject  to  considerable competition  between  companies  in  the  industry.  Given  these specificities, turnover rates excluding retirements differ between Orange SA (1.3% in 2023) and the French subsidiaries (9.0%).\n\nInternationally,  the  number  of  departures  decreased  by  20%, i.e. 1,796 fewer departures than in 2022. This decline was mainly due to resignations (down 1,990, i.e. 30%), which were down significantly in all divisions except for the MEA division (up 68). Only the voluntary departure indicator rose significantly (around 318 additional departures compared to 2022), following the launch of voluntary departure plans in Poland and Romania.\n\n| Number of permanent employee resignations   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Orange SA                                   | 314    | 338    | 211    |\n| French subsidiaries                         | 828    | 943    | 604    |\n| Total France  (1)                           | 1,142  | 1,281  | 815    |\n| International subsidiaries  (1)             | 4,709  | 6,699  | 5,689  |\n| Group total                                 | 5,851  | 7,980  | 6,504  |\n\n- (1) Scope of financial consolidation: a company is assigned to the scope in which its revenues are consolidated.\n\n| Number of permanent employee dismissals   |   2023 |   2022 | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Orange SA                                 |     71 |     63 | 39     |\n| French subsidiaries                       |     51 |     62 | 58     |\n| Total France  (1)                         |    122 |    125 | 97     |\n| International subsidiaries  (1)           |    678 |    670 | 949    |\n| Group total                               |    800 |    795 | 1,046  |\n\n- (1) Scope of financial consolidation: a company is assigned to the scope in which its revenues are consolidated.\n\n## 4.3.1.3.1.3 Professional integration of young people in France\n\nIn the second year of the intergenerational agreement covering the 2022-2024 period, the Group welcomed 2,549 new students on work-study contracts in France in 2023, for a total of 3,980 at December 31, 2023, above the minimum commitment of 3,500. This brings the professional integration rate to 5.4% of permanent contracts  as  at  the  same  date.  The  Group  also  welcomed 1,882 interns in France in 2023. The professional integration rate of\n\nyoung people in France therefore exceeds Orange's commitments to the trade unions and its legal obligations (5%).\n\nKeen to capitalize on their initial professional experience and the skills acquired, the Group continues to favor these young interns or work-study students in external recruitments for permanent contracts in the professions needed for the Group's future in France. In 2023, nearly 610 of these individuals (representing more than 20% of permanent-contract recruitments in France during the year) benefited from this program.\n\n| Professional integration - Group in France  (1)                      | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of new students accepted for internships during the year  (2) | 1,882  | 2,064  | 2,129  |\n| Number of work-study contracts signed during the year  (3)           | 2,549  | 2,701  | 3,124  |\n\n- (1) Orange SA and its subsidiaries with employees in France.\n- (2) Concerns students who signed their internship agreement during the year.\n- (3) Apprenticeship and vocational training contracts.\n\n- 4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The Group recommends using temporary employees for assignments of less\n\nthan two months. This indicator is presented in full-time equivalents (FTEs) and as a monthly average over the year.\n\nIn 2023, the use of this external labor increased by 9% compared to 2022 (i.e.72 additional FTEs as an average) and represented 0.9% of the Group's total workforce in France. As in the previous year,  it  mainly  concerned  the  sales  area,  in  particular  sales to  B2C  customers  (72%),  where  business  increased  by  22% (i.e. 112 additional FTEs as an average) over the period.\n\n| Temporary employees - Group France  (1)           | 2023  (3)   | 2022      | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|--------|\n| Amount of payments made to external companies for |             |           |        |\n| employee placement (in millions of euros)         | 45.2        | 37.8  (4) | 30.1   |\n| Monthly average number of temporary workers  (2)  | 863         | 791       | 632    |\n\n- (1) Scope of financial consolidation - excludes companies with employees in France whose revenues are consolidated under the 'international' scope.\n- (2) Calculation of temporary employee expenses recorded in the Group France results.\n- (3) The 2023 figures are provisional.\n- (4) The 2022 figure has been updated.\n\n## 4.3.1.3.2.2 Subcontracting\n\nThe use of employees belonging to external companies takes the form of service contracts. In France, they are mainly used in the field of networks, in the areas of technical intervention (on the networks and on the customer's premises), research, engineering and architecture, as well as in B2B and B2C Customer Relations and customer service. They are also used in the field of information systems on design, development and integration activities.\n\nThe use of subcontracting concerned 24,809 full-time equivalent employees (monthly average over the year) at end-December 2023, compared with 29,090 FTEs in 2022, i.e. a decrease of 14.7% (-4,281 FTEs). This external labor represented 27.3% of the total Group workforce in France (Orange SA and subsidiaries operating in France). The reduction recorded mainly relates to the construction of the very high-speed broadband network, following the end of the widespread take-up of fiber.\n\n| Subcontracting - Group France  (1)                    | 2023  (3)   | 2022  (4)   | 2021    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------|\n| Amount of subcontracting (in millions of euros)       | 1,890.8     | 2,037.7     | 3,030.5 |\n| Full-time equivalent workforce (monthly average)  (2) | 24,809      | 29,090      | 32,221  |\n\n- (1) Scope of financial consolidation: it excludes companies with employees in France whose revenues are consolidated under the 'international' scope.\n- (2) Calculation based on the subcontracting expenses recorded in the statutory financial statements of the companies in the Group France scope.\n- (3) The 2023 figures are provisional.\n- (4) The 2022 figures have been updated.\n\n## Training 4.3.1.3.3\n\n| Training access rate   | 2023  (1)   | 2022  (2)   | 2021  (3)   |\n|------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Group total            | \uf0fc  97%      | 91%         | 92%         |\n| o/w Orange SA          | \uf0fc  99%      | 96%         | 92%         |\n\n- (1) The Orange group data communicated for the 2023 fiscal year covers 98% of the Group's consolidated workforce.\n\n(2)\n\nThe Orange group data communicated for the 2022 fiscal year covered 95% of the Group's consolidated workforce.\n\n- (3) The Orange group data communicated for the 2021 fiscal year covered 81% of the Group's consolidated workforce.\n- \uf0fc Item reviewed by an independent third party: limited assurance .\n\n| Number of training hours per employee   |   2023  (1) |   2022  (2) |   2021  (3) |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Group total                             |        21.1 |        20.7 |        22.9 |\n| o/w Orange SA                           |        26   |        25.3 |        25.5 |\n\n- (1) The Orange group data communicated for the 2023 fiscal year covers 98% of the Group's consolidated workforce.\n- (2) The Orange group data communicated for the 2022 fiscal year covered 95% of the Group's consolidated workforce.\n- (3) The Orange group data communicated for the 2021 fiscal year covered 81% of the Group's consolidated workforce.\n\nAgainst  a  backdrop  of  profound  technological,  economic  and environmental change, Orange has continued and stepped up its training efforts to continuously adapt its employees' skills to these new challenges, allowing them to perform their jobs efficiently and with peace of mind, while giving them the means to build their careers.\n\nOrange relies on a combination of training modes (face-to-face, synchronous and asynchronous remote learning) to facilitate access for as many people as possible.\n\nIn 2023, the training access rate rose six points compared to 2022 to reach 97%, thanks in particular to the development of the\n\nOrange Learning training portal (see Section 4.3.1.2.2 Skills and skills acquisition), which has been rolled out in over 140 countries worldwide. The number of training hours per employee also rose slightly in 2023 (+2%).\n\nAs in previous years, particular attention has been paid to equity in access to training. Thus, within Orange SA (i.e., 45% of the Group's workforce), the rate of access to training for employees over 45 years of age stood at 96% in 2023. The access rate for women is two points higher than for men.",

The same holds true for the frequency rate of occupational accidents within the Group scope which, after a slight increase in 2022, returned to the 2021 level and has remained well below that of the years preceding\n\nthe Covid period (3.62 in 2019). The decline in the frequency rate of occupational accidents was also significant for Orange SA in 2023 compared to 2022, as well as compared to 2019 (4.62 in 2019).\n\nThe severity rate of occupational accidents was relatively stable over time: the rate in 2019 was of the same order of magnitude (0.18 for the Group, 0.26 for Orange SA).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

In addition, the Strategic Committee approved a new definition of 'technical and digital roles,' allowing this indicator to be monitored and steered more precisely and in line with reality in the field. This new calculation rule will be applied to reporting and communication in 2024.\n\n- 4\n\nAgainst a backdrop of female under-representation in applications for positions in 'technical and digital professions,' Orange has succeeded in maintaining momentum via its Hello Women program, achieving a +0.7% improvement in the proportion of women in 2023.\n\nThe Group takes a proactive approach with regard to the proportion of women among external hires in the Innovation & Technology field, which stood at 28.1% at end-2023, an increase of 3 points compared to end-2022.\n\n| Compensation - Orange SA  (1)                 | 2023   | 2022       | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|------------|--------|\n| Gross average monthly compensation (in euros) | 4,855  | 4,681  (2) | 4,512  |\n| Men                                           | 4,942  | 4,772      | 4,616  |\n| Women                                         | 4,708  | 4,527      | 4,336  |\n\nIn terms of equality in the workplace, the average compensation at Orange SA increased by 3.7% in 2023, i.e. 3.6% for men and 4.0% for women.\n\nThe Group has set a target of reducing the pay gap between men and women to achieve equal pay for comparable positions by 2025 at the latest.\n\nto 2022. Orange considers that, at this level, given the changes in the number of employees between categories of responsibility (CCNT bands) and by employment situation (business categories), its policy of equal pay for comparable employment situations tends to be respected. As part of Orange SA's wage policy in 2023, measures to promote professional equality represented a budget of 0.2% of women's salaries.\n\nIn 2023, the pay gap rate between women and men in comparable employment situation for Orange SA was -1.20%, stable compared\n\n4.3.1.3.5.2 Employment and integration of people with disabilities or cognitive diversity\n\n| Employees with disabilities - Orange SA    | 2023  (4)   | 2022  (3)   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------|\n| Number of employees with disabilities  (1) | 4,019       | 3,932       | 4,363  |\n| Employment rate  (2)                       | 7.0%        | 6.46%       | 6.51%  |\n\nThe employment rate of workers with disabilities is notably increasing in 2023, linked on one hand to the fall in the total workforce (6.4%) and on the other hand to the aging of the population of employees with disabilities, benefiting from an over-valuation in the calculation.\n\nSee section 4.4.4.2 Inclusive purchasing in France for the amount and nature of acquisitions from the sheltered employment sector.\n\n## 4.3.1.3.6 Note on methodology employee-related data\n\nThe employee-related data in this section primarily comes from the HR information system and is supplemented by data from the  Group's  financial  information  system.  The  methodological specifications  or  limitations  of  some  indicators  are  provided below  and  include  a  compilation  of  the  details  given  in  the employment-related indicator tables.\n\n## The Group's workforce\n\nData is given in terms of the workforce at the end of the period. The definition covers permanent contracts and fixed-term contracts. Work-study  contracts  (apprenticeship  and  vocational  training contracts) are excluded from the data related to the number of Group employees.\n\n## Number of departures\n\nThe 'number of resignations' and 'number of dismissals' indicators only take into account departures of active employees on permanent contracts. Thus, departures of employees that are temporarily not working (inactive employees: on long-term medical leave, extended leave, unpaid leave, etc.) are not included in these indicators.\n\nThe 'number of definitive departures of permanent employees' indicator, referred to in the employment section of the Management Report,  includes  by  convention  the  balance  of  provisional recruitments into and departures from the Group, with provisional departures being higher than recruitments.\n\n## Turnover rate\n\nThe 'turnover rate' is the total number of definitive departures (resignations, retirements, lay-offs, contractual terminations, deaths and temporary entries/exits) divided by the number of permanent contracts in the previous year. This indicator is shown with or without retirements.\n\n## Gender breakdown among supervisory staff (permanent employees at the end of the period)\n\nThe rule for calculating the 'supervisory staff' indicator is based on the active workforce with permanent contracts.\n\nThe 'supervisory staff' indicator includes employees belonging to the 'senior executives' category, which corresponds to the consolidation of levels E, F and G of the French telecommunication collective bargaining agreement (Convention collective nationale des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications, or CCNT), or the equivalent level for entities outside France and French subsidiaries that do not benefit from this agreement.\n\n## Percentage of women in the management network\n\nThe management network is a network comprising 1,261 managers at  the  end  of  2023.  Its  members  all  hold  positions  of  great responsibility in the Orange group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The  figure  shown  for  2023  is provisional due to the processing time of the declarations.\n\n## Training hours\n\nThe number of training hours per employee is calculated on the basis of the number of training hours divided by the average monthly number of active employees over the year.\n\nThe data reported on Group training comes from two types of reports: one via the Orange Learning training portal, currently being rolled out in all of the Group's entities, and the other via monthly reporting from subsidiaries using their own information systems in addition to Orange Learning. Some additional training, although provided, is not included in the Group's definition.\n\nFor  the  calculation  of  indicators  relating  to  training,  the  2023 reporting scope covers 98% of the Group's consolidated workforce.\n\n## Health and safety indicators\n\nThe responses to the health, safety and quality of life at work dashboard, including data on absenteeism, cover 84% of the consolidated  Group's  workforce  in  2023.

Orange has made its own commitments to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, business ethics and the environment, and to ensure these are also respected by its value chain. To do so, Orange relies on contracts, the assessment of high-risk suppliers and on-site audits, both its own and shared with its peers, in order to build sustainable market standards.\n\nOrange's purchasing is carried out via purchase orders, the majority of which refer to contracts, with the remainder in keeping with Orange's terms and conditions of purchase.\n\nFor  purchasing  contracts,  Orange  has  implemented  a  system based on both the autonomy given to the purchasing entities of its organizations, which can conclude local contracts on subjects specific to their entity, and on sharing, through Group contracts for matters common to the various entities.\n\nWhether for local or Group contracts, the contract must follow a rigorous selection and negotiation process with the supplier, and include various clauses addressing CSR issues, in particular the\n\nThe figures given for Orange SA correspond to fiscal year 2023, recorded at December 31, 2023. The figures for the prior year (n-1) are updated with the final figures when the subsequent fiscal year (n+1) is reported, taking into account any adjustments made at a later date.\n\nThe number of theoretical hours worked over the year fluctuates by country. It is calculated based on the number of active employees (annual  average  full-time  equivalent),  the  number  of  annual theoretical working days worked, and the number of theoretical hours worked per day in each country where the Group operates (as reported by the subsidiaries).\n\nThe  definitions  of  the  'number  of  employee  days  of  absence due to illness' and 'number of employee days of absence due to  occupational  accidents'  indicators  relate  to  employees  on permanent  contracts  and  employees  on  fixed-term  contracts (including  apprentices,  students  on  work-study  contracts  and individuals on vocational training contracts), in number of calendar days.\n\nThe  'number  of  employees  whose  cases  were  classed  as occupational illness' indicator only takes into account recognized occupational illnesses declared by active employees.\n\nThe 'frequency rate of occupational accidents' is calculated as:\n\n(Number of occupational accidents with lost time x 1 million)/Total number of hours worked.\n\nThe 'severity rate of occupational accidents' is calculated as:\n\n(Number of days lost for occupational accidents x 1,000)/Total number of hours worked.\n\nobligation for contracting suppliers and subcontractors to respect human rights and working conditions, and the obligation for them to impose these same obligations on their own suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nOrange's expenditure by major purchasing category (1) was broken down as follows in 2023:\n\n- -37% networks (purchases of works for the network, equipment and maintenance for fixed and mobile networks);\n- -21% mobile handsets;\n- -20% indirect purchases (all purchases for needs specific to the operation of the company and its employees, such as communication and marketing expenses, professional logistics services, energy, etc.);\n- -13% IT (purchases of IT services, equipment and maintenance, software);\n- -6%  Digital  Home  and  platforms  (purchases  of  customer equipment such as boxes, and services);\n- -3% telecom (purchase of network capacity and traffic).",

Three times a year, it brings together representatives from the Group Procurement & Supply Chain, Group CSR, Sustainable Finance, Legal, and Group Internal Control departments.\n\nThe Responsible Purchasing Committee verifies that:\n\n- -Orange's  'Responsible  Purchasing  Commitments'  are formalized in a contract through the CSR clause, which refers to the Supplier Code of Conduct (Group and local suppliers);\n- -CSR culture is passed on to buyers through mandatory CSR training courses, buyers being supported in putting this training into practice through a skills center;\n- -CSR risk management, which is based on supplier assessments and audits, is effective.\n\nIt also promotes the active pursuit of opportunities through dialogue with subsidiaries and suppliers and ensures that there is transparent reporting on the CSR maturity of all subsidiaries.\n\nAs such, the objectives of the Responsible Purchasing Committee are to:\n\n- -validate the mandatory CSR commitments to be applied to Orange purchasing, as well as the minimum requirements Orange imposes on its suppliers, particularly in terms of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms;\n- -support the implementation of these commitments through joint actions by the Group CSR and GPS Departments;\n- -monitor the proper implementation of these commitments by tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and the effectiveness of the measures put in place;\n- -ensure that changes in CSR regulations are properly anticipated and integrated into purchasing processes.\n\nThe  sponsors  of  the  Responsible  Purchasing  Committee  are the Group Procurement & Supply Chain Director and the CSR Governance & Trust Director.\n\n## 4.3.2.1.4 Vigilance-Plan-based  management\n\nAs part of the Vigilance Plan's governance structure, GPS has appointed a Duty of Vigilance liaison officer for its management team, who is responsible for the local implementation of the plan.\n\nThis liaison officer's role is to implement the Vigilance Plan with suppliers, ensuring:\n\n- -the local application of the duty of vigilance risk mapping, focusing the impact analysis on suppliers, with the support of the entity's risk manager;\n- -the existence and relevance of mitigation policies to address these risks;\n- -raising awareness of the Vigilance Plan among buyers.\n\nThe Duty of Vigilance liaison officer also makes proposals to improve the management, assessment and monitoring of the Vigilance Plan within GPS, ensuring that the resources required to implement the action plan are committed.\n\n## 4.3.2.2 Policies and action plans\n\nThe implementation of this strategy focuses on several policies put in place to limit any sustainability risks that could have a legal, financial or reputational impact, as well as to ensure the continuity of the Group's activities.\n\n## 4.3.2.2.1 Group Purchasing Policy\n\nOrange's purchasing is carried out within the framework of an Orange's 'Group Purchasing Policy' updated at the end of 2021, which applies to the various entities responsible for procurement.\n\nThe Purchasing Policy applies to all Orange entities, with the subsidiaries having their own Purchasing department. It defines the principles to be applied in purchasing actions in order to meet three major objectives:\n\n- -strengthen  Orange's  financial  performance  by  providing customers  with  competitive  services  or  products,  pooling the needs of Group entities, favoring standard solutions, and selecting suppliers in a rigorous, fair and responsible manner;\n- -contribute to Orange's protection by integrating the Supplier Code of Conduct into contracts, applying preventive measures linked to data security, financial and sustainability risks, the fight against corruption and fraud, respect for business ethics and human rights, and supply risks; and being attentive to dependency issues (raw materials, critical resources, supply chain shortcomings, etc.);\n- -contribute  to  the  success  of  Orange's  environmental commitments by making environmental criteria a driving force in purchasing decisions, stepping up the use of the circular economy,  questioning  purchasing  needs,  and  developing renewable and low-carbon energy purchases.\n\n## 4.3.2.2.2 Orange's Responsible Purchasing commitments\n\nThis Purchasing Policy is clarified through responsible purchasing commitments, which drive the impacts, risk management and opportunities related to the upstream supply chain for Orange.\n\nFor several years now, Orange has been integrating the principles of CSR into its relationships with suppliers and subcontractors and improves the management of social, societal and environmental risks. Orange's Responsible Purchasing commitments are available at https://gallery.orange.com/CSR. They apply to the procurement and supply chain activities of the Group and its subsidiaries, as well as to the purchasing activities delegated to BuyIn, a joint venture established by Orange and Deutsche Telekom, as part of their relations with suppliers and subcontractors. They have the following major objectives:\n\n- -to develop balanced relationships with our suppliers, based on trust, respect and long-term business relationships;\n- -to contribute to financial performance by creating value and ensuring the availability of Group products and services at the best total cost;\n- -to manage the CSR risks and opportunities associated with procurement and the supply chain;\n- -to allow the Group and its customers to benefit from the know-how of innovative, high-performance suppliers.\n\nOrange requires its suppliers to meet its CSR standards and to apply them to their own purchasing processes. It does this in particular by making it a contractual requirement that Group suppliers adhere to a Supplier Code of Conduct and comply with laws and regulations, including CSR clauses in Group framework agreements and in exclusively local contracts.",

        "page_content": "## 4.3.2.2.3 Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nThe Orange Supplier Code of Conduct (1) describes the ethical, social and environmental commitments expected by the Group. A new version of the document came into force on March 30, 2023 to adapt to changes in CSR and Compliance regulations and the Group's new strategy. This update clarifies Orange's requirements in terms of human rights and working conditions, and incorporates significant  developments  in  the  environmental  field.  Specific environmental  requirements  are  described  in  section  4.2.2.2 Roll-out of the environmental commitment within the Group and raising awareness.\n\nOrange accordingly requires its partners, suppliers and their own subcontractors:\n\n- -to comply  with  all  national,  European  and  international regulations governing ethical and responsible behavior. This includes, but is not limited to, standards dealing with human rights, occupational health and safety, environmental protection, sustainable development, the fight against corruption and child protection;\n- -to adopt  and  apply  the  Group's  ethical  standards  and commitments, and make progress in these areas.\n\nOrange's Supplier Code of Conduct sets out a number of principles, including:\n\n- -the relationship with national and international law: the supplier must always comply with applicable laws and regulations, and with contractual obligations as agreed between the parties. This includes the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK  Bribery  Act  where  applicable.  The  supplier  must  also comply with any international economic sanctions (including embargoes and trade and financial restrictions); this includes any sanctions which may be in effect as a result of a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations by the UN Security Council, as well as any sanctions that may have been imposed by the European Union. The supplier must ensure that its agents, suppliers, partners, subcontractors and their respective representatives comply with the principles of the Supplier Code of Conduct insofar as they are directly or indirectly involved in the supply of products or services under the contract;\n- -respect for human rights at the international level: the supplier must  not  be  complicit  in  any  violation  of  human  rights whatsoever and must respect the dignity of people, privacy and the rights of each individual. Slavery in all its forms is prohibited. Furthermore, the supplier will do its best to comply with all the standards drafted by the International Labor Organization (ILO);\n- -freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining: the  supplier  must  endeavor  to  implement  internationally recognized standards, for example the conventions of the ILO, without violating national law. It must ensure that its employees and representatives, including temporary workers, can speak openly within their company regarding any issue relating to their working conditions;\n- -prohibition  of  child  labor:  the  supplier  is  prohibited  from employing persons under the age of 15 or the age of completion of mandatory education, or under the legal working age in the country, whichever is higher. It must take all measures to enforce this ban in its supply chain. If it is discovered that a child is working on the supplier's premises or that of one of its subcontractors, the supplier must immediately take steps\n\n- 4\n\nto remedy the situation in order to serve the best interests of the child;\n\n- -non-discrimination  and  diversity:  the  supplier  must  treat all  employees  with  respect  and  must  not  inflict  corporal punishment, use physical or moral coercion, or engage in any form of abuse, harassment or threats. It must combat all forms of discrimination in relation to ethnic origin, skin color, gender, sexual orientation, language, disability, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, or age. It must ensure compliance with gender equality in the workplace, and promote diversity, equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment and the workplace;\n- -inclusiveness: the supplier must facilitate the implementation of  inclusive  practices,  and  promote  the  integration  sector, people with disabilities, and collaborations with social economy players;\n- -prohibition  of  slavery  and  forced  labor:  the  supplier  must comply  with  the  United  Nations  Universal  Declaration  of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and all applicable regulations prohibiting slavery, including modern slavery, human trafficking, and all forms of forced or compulsory labor within the meaning of the ILO Convention on Forced Labor. In particular, all work must be voluntary and workers must be free to leave or terminate their employment with reasonable notice. Suppliers must not retain, destroy, conceal, confiscate or deny access to their employees' identification and immigration documents, such as work permits, unless required by law. In addition, suppliers must work to eliminate the risk of modern slavery in their supply chains;\n- -compensation: suppliers must provide compensation in line with national regulations on minimum wages. In the absence of national regulations, compensation must be sufficient to cover basic needs such as housing, food and health, and meet the standards of ILO Convention C131 on minimum wage fixing. The basis on which workers are paid must be clearly communicated to them. Suppliers must not resort to salary deductions as a disciplinary measure;\n- -working  hours:  working  hours,  including  overtime,  must comply with applicable national laws. In the absence of national legislation, ILO standards must apply. In particular, the normal working week must not exceed 48 hours, excluding overtime which may not exceed 12 hours. Workers must have at least one rest day in every seven-day period. Suppliers must ensure that all workers are entitled to paid leave;\n- -health and safety: suppliers must provide their workers with a working environment that protects their health and safety, particularly in terms of fire protection and the cleanliness of the premises. They must take the necessary measures to prevent  occupational  accidents  and  illnesses.  They  must regularly hold appropriate training sessions to ensure that workers have sufficient health and safety knowledge. This includes the provision of appropriate personal and collective protective  equipment  and  instructions  on  their  use.  When providing accommodation, suppliers must ensure that it is clean and safe, and that it meets the basic needs of workers and, where applicable, their families. Suppliers are encouraged to implement an occupational health and safety management system, based on international standards such as ISO 45001 or equivalent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This CSR score is broken down as follows:\n\n- -10%: Supplier Sustainability Scorecard (SSS) assessing the supplier's overall CSR maturity;\n- -10%: criteria specific to the product purchased by Orange, depending on the field (ITN, fixed customer equipment such as set-top boxes).\n\nThe weighting of CSR in the decision criteria for all purchasing projects in France led by GPS was increased in 2023 and now follows the following rules:\n\n- -20% for projects with a high/very high CSR risk and/or a significant carbon impact;\n- -for purchasing projects with a CSR risk that is not high, the recommendation  is  to  devote  10%  of  the  score  awarded to suppliers to CSR, to be decided in consultation with the advising departments.\n\n## CSR risk assessment of Orange suppliers\n\nA communication from the Director of GPS and the Executive Director  of  Group  Societal  and  Environmental  Responsibility was sent out in July 2023 to all Chief Executive Officers, Chief Procurement Officers (CPOs), CSR Directors, Duty of Vigilance Managers, CSR Purchasing Coordinators, and the Risk Managers of each entity, division and country, to remind them all of the mandatory nature of the methodology and to specify the objectives pursued, which are to:\n\n- -strengthen  the  third-party  sustainability  risk  assessment process by integrating it into the GPS Purchasing process;\n- -make this process operational across all entities and divisions, and standardize practices across all entities and divisions;\n- -systematize the application of the process.\n\nThe communication specified that the sustainability assessment must be carried out before entering into a contractual relationship for purchasing projects involving high and very high CSR risk categories (subject to the application of an estimated expenditure threshold). The 'List of CSR risk purchasing categories' has been reviewed by the Group's Duty of Vigilance Manager and GPS, taking into account:\n\n- -the non-financial impact on health and safety, human rights and the environment;\n- -the probability of risk occurrence;\n- -the specific characteristics of the geographical regions of the Orange entities making the purchase.\n\nThis list has been shared with all players involved in CSR risk assessment. In order to guarantee the independence and quality of the analysis, supplier assessments were entrusted to EcoVadis (1) , whose methodology is based on international CSR standards and guidelines such as the Global Compact, ISO 26000, ILO or GRI. As an exception, the CSR risk analysis is based on an internal Orange assessment.\n\nThe first support stage consisted of training sessions, in French and English, held by GPS for CPOs and CSR purchasing liaison officers in all regions. Specific sessions were also held at the request of certain countries in the MEA region. Several tools have been made available to entities, divisions and countries: presentation of the assessment tool and the available features, frequently asked questions (FAQ), content and videos on the document database shared within the purchasing community.\n\n## Supplier audits and compliance with JAC audits\n\nOrange helps verify compliance with CSR standards through the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC, formerly the Joint Audit Cooperation), an association of telecommunication operators (27 members as of the end of 2023, representing more than half of industry revenues worldwide), grouped together to audit, assess and develop the implementation of CSR standards in the production chain by the global ICT suppliers. The JAC has pooled the results of production site audits conducted by various members since 2010 for over 600 high-CSR-risk production sites in 45 countries and at different levels of the supply chain (tiers 1, 2, 3). These results are taken into account in the selection of suppliers within the various Orange entities, including BuyIn. Thanks to the JAC, members are not alone in managing the new sustainability challenges affecting the entire supply chain, such as climate change, the implementation of circular economy principles, and the fight against new forms of human rights violations and labor exploitation. In this respect, the JAC has established dedicated working groups in order to adopt common positions and a shared methodological approach aiming to anticipate, monitor and measure the implementation of these principles in order to respond more effectively to the new duty of vigilance regulations.\n\n## 4.3.2.2.5 Channels for suppliers and their employees to raise concerns\n\n## Communications with suppliers\n\n## Dedicated supplier portal\n\nOrange  provides  its  suppliers,  their  employees  and  potential suppliers with a supplier portal (2) , which presents the Group's Purchasing policy, Orange's expectations of its suppliers, existing digital  interfaces  between  Orange  and  its  suppliers,  suppliers forums organized by the Group, and a whistleblowing system incorporating information security.\n\nUpdated in 2023, this collaborative tool fosters communication between  Orange  and  its  suppliers,  and  allows  Purchasing  to share both major strategic messages and more specific directives, reflecting Orange's approach to addressing its challenges, and in particular those related to CSR.\n\nFinally, the Supplier portal allows any Orange supplier in a potential situation of conflict with Orange to refer the matter to an internal Orange mediator, independent of the Purchasing Department.",

Held on February 1, 2024, the  9th Suppliers  Forum  highlighted  the  key  aspects  of  the Group's policy on respect for the environment, human rights and fundamental freedoms. Backed by a number of commitments and built around a risk-based approach that complies with current standards and regulatory frameworks, this policy is aimed at all stakeholders in all territories where the Group is present, and is applied across the entire value chain.\n\n## Whistleblowing system for suppliers and their employees\n\nA  whistleblowing  system  is  available  to  suppliers  and  their employees. If a serious violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, personal health and safety or the environment, fraud or corruption, a breach of ethics, a conflict of interest, or any other violation of laws and regulations is observed, a report can be sent anonymously to Orange through the Hello Ethics (2) platform, which guarantees the whistleblower's protection. The Group CSR Department and the GPS Department review the alerts collected, following a Group-wide procedure (see Section 4.4.2.4 Group whistleblowing system). In the event of serious and consistent evidence, the suppliers concerned are contacted and asked to provide proof of plans to remedy the risks identified.\n\n## 4.3.2.3 Purchasing targets and measures\n\nThe  Group  measures  the  implementation  of  its  Responsible Purchasing commitments, notably by monitoring the widespread introduction of the CSR clause in new contracts signed (or renewed)\n\nand through the training program for buyers on CSR issues in the supply chain. The Group has set itself a target of 100% of contracts signed including the CSR clause.\n\n|                                                                                  | 2023       | 2022     | 2021     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|----------|\n| % of contracts signed including the CSR clause                                   | \uf0fc 95% (1)  | 96%  (2) | 92%  (3) |\n| % of buyers having completed dedicated CSR training during the last two years 7V | \uf0fc 59%  (4) | 50%  (5) | 96%  (6) |\n\n- (6) Data collected for a scope representing 93% of 2021 revenues and Orange Bank. The Group percentage corresponds to the simple average of the percentages of each country.\n- (7) There was a change in methodology between 2022 and 2023 for the Percentage of buyers having completed dedicated CSR training during the last two years indicator The buyer workforce in 2023 no longer includes buyers on the French part-time for seniors plans but only active buyers directly involved in purchasing transactions, unlike in previous years.\n\n## JAC audits\n\nIn 2023, the JAC conducted 150 audits, including 123 on-site audits carried out directly by the JAC, and 14 VAP (Validated Assessment Program) audits conducted by the RBA, an association The JAC also carried out 13 anonymous surveys of 10,242 workers over the phone, specifically about their working conditions.\n\nThese actions made it possible to reach the level of tier-two and tier-three suppliers (57% of audits and investigations). The JAC's\n\n## 4.3.2.2.6 CSR training for buyers\n\nIn 2023, GPS established an 'ESG capacity building' working group to define a roadmap for the upskilling of Orange buyers in environmental and social issues.\n\nThis capacity building includes training and information-sharing for the buyer community, as well as leadership methods such as sharing best practices, discussion seminars and case studies.\n\nThe working group was officially established in June 2023. Its steering committee met three times to define its objectives and action plans, and to monitor its results. These were presented to the GPS Management Committee and the Responsible Purchasing Committee in October 2023.\n\nThe first deliverables were:\n\n- -in the Group scope: organization in October 2023 of a one-hour 'Buyers Conference' webinar for all Group buyers to present the major challenges, the Group's objectives, and the main CSR actions to be taken by Purchasing;\n- -in the France scope: organization of two one-day sessions of the 'CSR and Responsible Purchasing' training program and two webinars in November 2023.\n\nThese  components  supplemented  existing  training  courses: Group CSR certificate, Finance & CSR Performance training and '30-minute CSR e-learning.'\n\n- 4\n\nactions in 2023 lead to creating 890 corrective action plans, 45% of which related to occupational health and safety conditions, 18% to excessive working hours and 11% to non-compliance with environmental standards. 18% of the sites audited achieved a JAC CSR score of 'Excellent.' 46% obtained a 'Good' JAC score but with room for improvement, 11% a 'Conditionally Acceptable' JAC score, and 24% a 'Poor' JAC score.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

It formalizes the need for sustainable business models to consider groups that are potentially discriminated against or vulnerable, so that digital technology can work in their favor. It assumes particular importance in a society filled with tension, diffraction and polarization; the Group firmly believes that digital technology is a lever in the fight against inequality, provided the conditions for access and managed use are met.\n\nThis commitment to inclusiveness is reflected in the following strategic guidelines:\n\n- -address vulnerable populations by identifying their representation,  categorizing  their  digital  needs  according to age (children, the elderly), disability (physical, mental) or neurodivergence,  origin  (social,  ethnocultural,  geographic, opinions) and gender (sex, orientations, etc.). Orange provides them with access to connectivity, information on responsible use, and training in the career potential and empowerment offered by digital technology;\n- -strengthen protection, cybersecurity and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly digital freedoms, for users and customers;\n- -promote innovation and ethical, responsible research;\n- -support the local economic fabric through the creation of value by suppliers, SMEs and start-ups.\n\nOrange's Board of Directors approves the Group's CSR strategy, particularly with regard to its social aspects, and oversees the impacts, risks and opportunities associated with Orange's social commitment through the work of the GCSERC.\n\nAt the General Management level, the CSR and Ethics Committee plays  a  key  role  in  prioritizing  programs  and  monitoring  their implementation. Other committees also play their part, depending on the societal challenges at stake (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees).\n\n## 4.3.3.1 Characterizing affected communities\n\nOrange has tailored the definition of affected communities proposed by the CSRD to match Orange's activities and their impact on its stakeholders. In its strategic guidelines, Orange has identified the following communities affected by its products and services, whether positively or negatively:\n\nWomen : in some countries and regions where Orange operates, the  lack  of  access  to  digital  technology  exacerbates  gender inequalities that are deeply rooted in society. Low levels of bank account use, computer or telephone equipment primarily reserved for men or boys, low levels of digital literacy: this explains why only 61% of the world's women of middle to low income countries are using the Internet at the end of 2022 - a gap of 19% with men; this gap was of 25% in 2017 on the same perimeter (1) . By using digital technology to take action to empower and integrate women into the workforce, they become a community that is positively affected.\n\nChildren (under  18):  by  identifying  children  as  an  affected community, Orange recognizes their particularities and vulnerabilities. The Internet is an open universe that offers children a  world  of  possibilities,  allowing  them  to  access  information, express themselves, interact and benefit from a wide range of knowledge. However, use of digital technology also exposes them to new risks that may infringe their rights (education, environment, well-being, etc.) or encourage them to adopt new reprehensible behaviors. Orange's responsibility is to provide families with access\n\nto a trusted digital world, taking into account the vulnerability of children while offering parents tools for security, protection and understanding.\n\nYoung  people  (aged  16-25) :  digital  technology  is  helping  to promote equal opportunities in education by offering content and ways of learning by doing. It also offers access to training and specialization courses in high-demand sectors (Cloud, data, AI, cybersecurity). In particular, in sub-Saharan Africa, 230 million jobs will require digital skills by 2030. As such, Orange is helping young people from all backgrounds to find employment through digital technology.\n\nPeople with disabilities : according to the latest estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), almost one in five people worldwide are affected by a disability. At a time when the mastery and use of digital tools have become essential to be able to act and interact in most everyday situations, digital companies have a responsibility to guarantee that everyone has access to their products and services. Orange is continuing its efforts to adapt or create products and services that meet everyone's needs.\n\nPeople living near antenna sites : mobile telephony technologies are designed to meet the growing needs of users. In addition to the visual nuisance of antennas, they are likely to increase the general population's exposure to electromagnetic waves. Orange holds dialogues to ensure that radio-wave-emitting installations are acceptable.\n\n## 4.3.3.2 Data security and personal data protection\n\nOrange's  strategy  is  to  make  personal  data  protection  yet another element of the trust its customers placed in it, by fully incorporating this dimension into the value proposition of its offers and by developing data protection and personal data offers for its customers.\n\nThis protection is governed by the general data security framework implemented by Orange, which covers both corporate information and personal data. It is covered by a Security Policy aimed at ensuring the continuous improvement of security based on risk management and assessment (particularly cybersecurity). It is regularly updated to mitigate the impact of incidents, or even crises, depending on the level of threat and changes in the environment. See section 2.2.3.3 Group security policy.\n\n## 4.3.3.2.1 Governance\n\nIn 2020, the Group's Board of Directors and Executive Committee validated the data security components, in particular personal data, their status and the Group's objectives.\n\nOrange has strengthened its internal governance for 2024 with the Group Security Board (GSB), which is responsible for approving the Group's security and resilience strategy and ensuring that policies and action plans are effectively implemented. It ensures that the status of threats is regularly updated, approves the key strategic security guidelines (master plans, strategies and their execution, guidance and monitoring of entity security budgets, skills centers, etc.) and the security requirements to be included in IT and network projects within the Group; it monitors global security transformation initiatives and the recommendations of audits and inspections; it develops security culture within the Group. It is co-chaired by the Executive Director of Cybersecurity activities and the Group CTIO, and also includes the CEOs of France, Orange Business, and the Europe and MEA regions (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees).",

        "page_content": "The Security Policy, specifically in relation to the protection of the Group's data, is implemented by the Group Security Department under the authority of the Executive Director of Cybersecurity. It regularly reports to the Executive Committee and proposes areas for improvement. In 2023, the Group Security Policy was updated, setting  out  the  organization  of  security  within  the  Group,  the centralized role of the Security Department and the responsibilities of each entity and individual with regard to security.\n\nThese actions are implemented by the Group's Operational Security Committee  (GOSC),  which  is  chaired  by  the  Group  Security Director and made up of all the security directors from the various entities and regions. It meets every two months to monitor the implementation of the security strategy and compliance with the requirements set out in the security standard; it also oversees the monitoring of security budgets and expenditure and the publication of new security policies.\n\nOperational monitoring of the personal data protection program is carried out by the Group Security Department and by the Personal Data and Security Department of the Group Legal Department, which ensures that the Group complies with the various legal frameworks governing the protection of personal data.\n\n## 4.3.3.2.2 Implementation  framework\n\nAll documents and processes constituting the Security Policy are communicated by the Group Security Director to the community of security officers in the entities and to the Group's Executive Directors. On a daily basis, multidisciplinary committees monitor the projects from an operational standpoint.\n\nThe  security  approach  and  its  implementation,  including  the securing of personal data, were presented every quarter in 2023 to the Group's Risk Committee and during the various Internal Control Reviews. Their application is verified as part of the annual assessment of the entities under the authority of the Group Security Department, and any deviations are addressed in action plans managed locally or monitored at Group level when they cover certain subjects, such as identity and access management and the encryption of messaging and workstations. The findings of the annual assessments focus on proposed areas of improvement, and help inform management and the relevant members of the Executive Committee. These assessments are supplemented by penetration tests to verify cyber resilience. They are the subject of a report, including a remediation plan, which is sent to the entity's CEO. These plans are monitored by the entities' CEOs.\n\nSome entities draw on the expertise and technical capabilities of Orange Cyberdefense.\n\nIn addition, to ensure the protection of personal data, an approach to compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is in place via an ad hoc organization. It is based on the Group's internal personal data protection policy. This policy applies to the entire Group.\n\n## 4.3.3.2.3 Group policy and action plans on data security and personal data protection\n\nTo guide its actions, the Group applies international standards such as ISO 27001 for information security and ISO 27005 for risk assessments. The Group holds several certifications, attesting to the quality of the resources devoted to enhancing the protection of Orange's assets and those of its customers. These certifications cover scopes as varied as Orange Money for African subsidiaries; Plazza, the Group's employee social network; and the design, engineering and support of enterprise services for Orange Business and European subsidiaries.\n\n- 4\n\nThese standards help to enhance security management at the entity  level  by  providing  a  common  Group-wide  framework; this framework anticipates the implementation of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 of December 14, 2022 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union, the 'NIS2' directive, which will come into force at the end of 2024.\n\n## Data security management\n\nThe  technical  and  organizational  mechanisms  derived  from the Group security policy are formalized in the Group Security Standard, which focuses on essential security requirements to be applied throughout the Group. Security stakeholders can then more effectively decide which measures to take to prevent threats, and even detect them more quickly, contain them and eradicate any that do occur. The following are available for security stakeholders:\n\n- -a framework covering the Group Crisis Management Policy;\n- -shared standards defined by the Group Security Standard; these include a minimum of 92 rules to be implemented in three areas: information security, physical security and personal security in the face of country risks. Each of these rules is given a score, with the average determining the overall score of the country. Each year, the entities are assessed to verify compliance with the Security Standard. The aim is to reach or maintain a score above 90% for European and MEA region countries (see section 4.3.3.2.4 Targets and measures);\n- -seminars to share regularly updated best practices in the areas of physical security, data security, crisis management and business continuity, held annually with the countries of Europe and Africa;\n- -a set of provisions enabling the implementation of the Group Security  Policy,  specifically  for  personal  data,  and  taking into  account  the  development  of  the  European  regulatory framework.\n\nSeveral security operations centers (SOCs, see below section 'Protecting  companies  against  cyber  attacks')  also  regularly monitor deviations from security policies and alerts that may be triggered in the event of suspicious activity. Any such alerts are analyzed, and remediation procedures are monitored depending on the level of criticality.\n\n## Compliance with the personal data protection framework\n\nOrange  has  developed  a  procedure  to  respond  to  any security-related event or incident involving personal data, and in particular has a personal data security guide and a security guide for sensitive data that present basic security rules and actions to follow in order to identify sensitive information and secure it end-to-end throughout its life.\n\nIn addition to personal data security, Orange is committed to meeting all the requirements set out in legal frameworks such as the European General Data Protection Regulation and, more broadly, the regulations resulting from the European Union's digital strategy or national personal data protection laws. The Group's internal policy in this area has created the conditions for a consistent approach to the responsible use of personal data. It applies to both the Group's internal relationships and to relationships with all of the Group's partners and service providers. Alongside the Group's Security Policy, it helps to create the conditions for mitigating the risk on personal data processed by Orange through various components:  governance,  documentation  on  processing  and analysis procedures, awareness-raising and training, and audits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

These include project analysis procedures, data processing mapping, informing individuals,  and  the  integration  of  the  necessary  contractual arrangements  with  partners  and  service  providers.  Ad  hoc committees  within  each  entity  are  responsible  for  supporting projects using a risk-based approach.\n\nThe roll-out of this policy is supported by a network of Data Protection  Officers  (DPO).  The  DPO  network  is  managed  by the  Group  DPO  under  the  framework  of  the  Data  Protection Committees; it meets very regularly to ensure the proper roll-out of the compliance approach in line with regulatory developments, to share best practices, and to address common challenges in the roll-out of the Group's cross-functional projects as well as legal matters relating to data protection.\n\nThe  DPOs  have  established  a  network  of  experts  comprising several hundred people with multidisciplinary backgrounds. This network assists the Group's various business lines and functions in implementing personal data processing, and in complying with requirements related to the respect of personal rights, as well as regulatory developments. The network includes new subsidiaries.\n\nFurthermore,  associated  with  this  network  are  numerous multidisciplinary committees in the entities that regularly deal with any compliance issues that may arise. The Legal Department, the DPOs and the security experts are members of these committees. This structure makes it possible to ensure that the approach is implemented down to the individual business level.\n\nFor entities in the MEA region, regional staff, like their European counterparts, are made aware of personal data protection through meetings. Legal requirements in the MEA region are monitored and sharing is organized on a regular basis for the application of texts within the above-mentioned network.\n\n## Raising awareness of personal data security and personal data protection compliance procedures\n\nThe awareness of all employees is raised through internal training courses covering both the principles of data security and personal data protection compliance requirements.\n\nAvailable in five languages, an employee data protection charter, the Group's internal data protection policy, and a general guide to personal data protection are published on the Intranet, to raise awareness of compliance practices.\n\nSince the end of 2023, the Orange Learning training portal has provided access to a training course titled 'The keys to compliance at Orange,' which covers the three areas of compliance: personal data protection, compliance with competition law, and prevention of corruption risk.\n\nIn  addition,  specific  awareness-raising  training  courses  have been developed for experts and Data Protection Officers (for the purposes of specific committees or meetings), project managers, and the HR and Legal departments.\n\nThe Cyber Ready program was launched at the beginning of 2023, with the aim of increasing and improving the behaviors of everyone in the Group with regard to cyber threats and protective actions. The program includes annual targets for the percentage of employees among whom awareness has been raised, i.e. 80% in 2023 and 100% in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, 72.3% of employees took part in cybersecurity awareness training on topics such as cybersecurity fundamentals, GDPR, encryption tools, cyber defense measures.\n\nIn 2024, security awareness will become one of themandatory training courses for all Group employees.\n\n## Digital trust for businesses\n\nOrange Business relies on its own network to create the digital services of tomorrow. This allows it to guarantee resilient, secure connectivity and a trusted digital infrastructure while also paying particular attention to the confidentiality and sovereignty of its customers' data. As a partner to vital or essential companies and public administrations, Orange Business's services aim to meet the highest standards of security, confidentiality, transparency and  resilience.  Orange  Business  addresses  needs  across  the entire digital value chain through a unique end-to-end approach: from connectivity to the Cloud; from data (data management via artificial intelligence or the blockchain) and collaborative apps to cybersecurity. Orange Business builds an environment of trust by taking into account technological, regulatory and operational aspects. Drawing on the expertise of its teams, Orange Business integrates  and  manages  its  digital  services  according  to  the criticality  of  its  customers'  activities,  considering  several  key attributes: security, resilience, regulation and the management of technological dependency risks.\n\nIn 2023, Orange Business strengthened its support for customers around digital trust by appointing a Digital Trust Director. The Digital Trust Director is responsible for implementing and rolling out the branch's digital trust strategy, with the help of a multidisciplinary team.\n\n## Supporting the challenges of a trust Cloud\n\nOrange  Business  supports  controlled  digital  transitions  to  the Cloud, from their design to their implementation, in compliance with regulations, particularly European regulations.\n\nAs such, it notably offers the Cloud Avenue solution, which is operated and managed by Orange Business experts and hosted in Orange Data centers located in France. Cloud Avenue is compatible with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is ISO 27001, ISO 20017, and ISO 27018 certified, making it a highly secure platform. This next-generation Cloud is also in the process of obtaining the SecNumCloud version 3.2 certification  from  the  French  information  systems  security agency (Agence Nationale de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 des Syst\u00e8mes d'Information - ANSSI) (1) for its private section. This represents the highest level of certification in terms of data protection security, guaranteeing risk control, as well as the compliance and reliability of the Cloud Avenue solution, both in terms of location and operation.\n\nOrange Business will also support its customers' migration to Bleu, a 'trust Cloud' designed to meet the sovereignty needs of the French government, public administrations and companies with critical infrastructure subject to specific requirements in terms of confidentiality, security and resilience. Bleu aims to offer its customers a new trust Cloud with a rich catalog of digital solutions and the best collaborative tools.",

        "page_content": "## Investing in European sovereignty\n\nOrange supports Europe's competitiveness and digital independence. That's why it takes particular care to protect the data of companies and individuals from extraterritorial laws.\n\nThe Group is one of the 22 co-founders of the GAIA-X initiative, and was recently re-elected to its Board of Directors. By allowing data to be collected and shared on the basis of European values of transparency, openness, privacy and security, GAIA-X is fully in line with the values Orange supports. The European project aims to develop secure European data sharing spaces.\n\nWith the firm belief that cooperation around these data spaces is a unique opportunity to have a positive economic impact in Europe, Orange Business is also a founding member of the AID (1) association for data intermediation.\n\n## Protecting companies against cyber attacks\n\nOrange's  ambition  is  to  offer  state-of-the-art  cybersecurity services, whether in the core network or stand-alone, to 100% of its customers by 2030. This is one of the main areas of development for its business.\n\nIn May 2018, Orange combined its cyber defense activities within the Group's Strategy and Cybersecurity Department (DSCS) in order to strengthen the security of the Group's systems and networks. The aim was both to ensure a high level of internal cyber defense and to develop Orange's commercial activities in this strategic area.\n\nOrange  Cyberdefense  (OCD)  is  responsible  for  developing commercial cyber security activities, including for Orange.\n\nOrange  Cyberdefense  combines  the  legacy  security  expertise and infrastructure of Orange Business with those of companies acquired in recent years, both in France and internationally. Orange Cyberdefense thus believes it has the critical mass needed in this consolidating market, and the capacity to support its customers locally in all their geographies.\n\nWith  18 SOCs  (Security  Operation  Centers,  platforms  for supervising and managing information system security, with tools for collecting and correlating events, and for remote intervention) and 14 CyberSOCs worldwide, an epidemiology laboratory, an internal research center, and a sovereign cyber threat analysis capability, Orange Cyberdefense's know-how has been officially recognized in France by ANSSI, which awarded Orange Cyberdefense the following three main certifications: PASSI (Prestataire d'audit de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des syst\u00e8mes d'information - information systems audit), PDIS (Prestataire de d\u00e9tection des incidents de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 - security incident detection) and PRIS (Prestataire de r\u00e9ponse aux incidents de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 - security incident response).\n\nOrange  Cyberdefense  relies  on  the  multiple  Orange  Business locations around the world, and leverages Orange's 30 years of experience in securing at-risk infrastructure for SMEs, multinational corporations  and  local  authorities.  Orange  Cyberdefense  also benefits from its presence in nine European countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland  and  the  United  Kingdom)  and  from  the  security expertise of more than 3,000 employees in France and around the world. Orange Cyberdefense has developed unique, autonomous expertise in the field of cyber threat research and knowledge. Its analyses allow it to constantly adjust its customers' security policies, and to react immediately to any cyber attack, right through to remediation if necessary. In addition, Orange Cyberdefense regularly contributes to information sharing in the form of operational or strategic publications, including the annual 'Security Navigator' (2) guide. In addition, its operational teams contribute to the general security of the Internet, for example by identifying and blocking access to over 200 malicious websites a day.\n\n- 4\n\nOrange Cyberdefense is also a training entity which, for more than  15 years,  has  provided  a  training  offer  dedicated  to cybersecurity - from regulatory compliance to threat prevention. The training modules proposed and their formats are adapted to the requirements of the entity in question (private companies, local authorities and hospitals).\n\nOrange is now positioned as a major player in the cybersecurity sector in Europe. It was rated:\n\n- -a 'Leader' in the Forrester Wave\u2122 Managed Security Services Providers (MSSPs) Report for 2022;\n- -a 'Leader' in the IDC MarketScape for European Managed Security Services;\n- -a 'Leader' in the ISG Provider Lens France, Nordics, Germany, Switzerland and UK reports;\n- -'Very Strong' in the 2023 Assessment Report of GlobalData Global Managed Security Services.\n\n## A trusted B2C operator\n\n## Protecting customer data and privacy\n\nOne of Orange's top priorities is protecting customer data entrusted to or processed by it, as well as respecting customer privacy. Given the frequency and variety of threats, customers have high expectations in this area, and as a trusted operator, Orange is committed to working alongside them to make the digital world safer.\n\nOrange acts in several areas in this regard: the technical security of customer data, pursuant to the Group's security policy; customer consent to the collection and use of their personal data, pursuant to the personal data protection policy; respect for the confidentiality of  their  communications,  pursuant  to  the  confidentiality  of correspondence obligation; and finally, transparency in the event of an incident. Orange also informs its customers of its actions, for example by providing them with a personal data charter.\n\n## Providing solutions to protect against cyber attacks\n\nOrange also offers a range of solutions to help customers protect themselves:\n\n- -antivirus services, available in most European countries. In France, the antivirus offer is enhanced with other protection services in the 'Security Suite' package. It protects against viruses,  blocks  fraudulent  websites  and  secures  all  family devices.  It  protects  customers'  privacy  when  they  are  on the Internet and their banking data when they make online purchases;\n- -filtering services for malicious sites on the Internet and mobile networks, implemented in several European countries such as Poland, Romania and Slovakia. This Cyberfilter service offers protection for Internet browsing over the mobile network, with alerts when accessing a site that Orange has identified as malicious. This solution can thus detect viruses and verify that an email address has not been the subject of a data breach on the web. It also tests URLs for the risk of phishing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

For example, in France:\n\n- -the 'Cyberfilter' service;\n- -the 'Suite de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pro' (professional security suite) protects customers' personal and professional data as well as their bank details, blocks fraudulent sites, and secures equipment against new potential threats;\n- -the  SugarSync  solution  enables  encrypted  access  to  and sharing of all types of documents. It also allows documents to be shared with employees or customers while defining the rights for each of them and any back-up rules.\n\nLastly Orange offers its B2C customers solutions and assistance to help them feel even more secure in their digital usage. For example, Orange has created:\n\n- -the free 'Orange T\u00e9l\u00e9phone' mobile app, available in many countries. It provides protection against unwanted calls by automatically detecting and blocking cold calls and malicious calls,  and  identifying  professionals  thanks  to  its  reverse directory  look-up;  it  provides  information  premium-rate numbers and their costs and enables fast and easy access to the main emergency numbers;\n- -parental  control  solutions  for  parents  giving  their  children devices, available for mobile phones and TVs in most European countries (see Section 4.3.3.3.2 Responsible use of digital technology).\n\nOrange has positioned itself as a trusted player in all its markets. Orange  Cyberdefense  is  firmly  committed  to  supporting  and complementing the security products and services offered by Orange subsidiaries.\n\n## 4.3.3.2.4 Targets and measures\n\n## Assessment of the security standard application\n\nThe approach taken by the Group Security Department is assessed annually to verify compliance with the Group Security Standard. The annual entity reviews involve exchanges of information between the Security Department and the entities' management, involving relevant members of the Executive Committee. They assess the entities in terms of data security and suggest areas for improvement. The self-assessments carried out in 2023 on the scope of entities in Europe and Africa (operator subsidiaries and Group support functions, representing more than 90% of the Group's revenues) helped, for example, to correct vulnerabilities or structure security organization systems in certain subsidiaries.\n\nIn 2023, four Group entities, of which two in the MEA region and one in France, were subject to on-site assessments to verify the proper implementation of the Group Security Standard, share best practices from other subsidiaries, and collect their own best practices.  In  2022,  the  European  countries  (Belgium,  France, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain) maintained their score for compliance with the Group Security Standard at over 90%. Efforts continue in the MEA region and the score for compliance is improving, thanks in particular to help from the shared skills center. The aim is to reach 90% by 2025.\n\nThe results are shared with the members of the Group's Executive Committee to adjust the action plans according to the areas for improvement identified.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of protection of the information created, processed and stored by the Group, more than 1,000 manual technical and non-technical audits (intrusion tests, regulatory audits, organization audits, etc.) and more than 100,000 automated audits (vulnerability scans and code audits in particular) were carried out in 2023.\n\n| Monitoring indicator                                                                                 | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| % of operator entities in Europe with a DPO                                                          | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |\n| security incidents reported to data protection authorities in Europe  (1)                            | < 600  |        |        |\n| % compliance with Group requirements: security organization  theme (Group average - 90% target)  (2) | 84%    | 82%    | 80%    |\n\n## Continuous monitoring of Group assets exposed on the Internet\n\nThe internal Cyberating program was launched at the beginning of 2023 for the entire Group to take into account Orange's own assets exposed on the Internet, in order to obtain a rating as close as possible to the Orange network. It allows entities to quantify the cyber risk to which they are exposed by establishing a 'cyber score' ranging from A to F, with A being the best.\n\nIt measures this risk by collecting and analyzing publicly accessible company information in the following areas:\n\n- -vulnerabilities present on published websites;\n- -robustness of the encryption used;\n\n- -reputation of the company's public IP addresses;\n- -protection of corporate email addresses;\n- -analysis of domain name systems (DNS);\n- -presence of company data on the Dark Web.\n\nThe aim is to give each Group entity visibility of its attack surface, the areas for improvement to reduce it, and the means to correct these vulnerabilities. Targets have been set for each year: for 2024, Orange is aiming to achieve a 'B' grade for the Group's overall score, with an expansion of the scope of control to the database and all the services that link users with the network resources they need to perform their work (active directory). By 2025, Orange is aiming to achieve an 'A' grade for the Group's overall score.",

        "page_content": "## 4.3.3.3 Physical and psychological health of users\n\n## 4.3.3.3.1 Electromagnetic  waves\n\n## Electromagnetic waves policy\n\nMobile telephony technologies are called on to meet increasing cellphone  use,  and  may  therefore  increase  the  exposure  to electromagnetic  waves  of  the  general  population  (via  new fixed transmitters) or of users (via new mobile equipment or by creating new behaviors). To best meet this demand, Orange has implemented a Group policy on radio waves and health since 2007, in which it acts to:\n\n- -apply the limits defined by the ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) and recommended by the WHO for cellphones and mobile network antennas, including in countries within Orange's scope that do not have national regulations;\n- -provide  transparent  and  identical  information  to  all  of  its stakeholders;\n- -publicize the recommendations for the use of mobile devices issued by health authorities to limit exposure to radio waves;\n- -contribute to research and standardization efforts to take these aspects into account as early as possible in product design;\n- -raise the awareness of employees working near or on antennas regarding the safety instructions provided in Directive 2013/35/ EU  of  June 26,  2013  on  the  minimum  health  and  safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields), and in French Decree 2016-1074 of August 3, 2016, even in countries not subject to the directive.\n\nThe application of this policy is monitored at the Group level by the Radio Waves and Health Committee, comprising an attorney, a public affairs expert, a doctor, a technical expert and two CSR experts; these figures meet weekly to analyze health and regulatory monitoring, propose initiatives at the Group's operational level, and draft 'Group positions' and vigilance notes. These positions are disseminated throughout the Group, and to the Group's Executive Committee when necessary.\n\n## Compliance\n\nIn France, Orange collaborates with the French Government Agency that manages the country's radio spectrum (Agence nationale des fr\u00e9quences - ANFr) and promptly applies the decisions it issues to check that radio equipment complies with the regulations governing its marketing.\n\nFor example, Orange was quick to take action when the ANFr asked Apple to take the iPhone 12 off the French market as of September 12, 2023 as this model was found to exceed the specific absorption rate (SAR) limit. Sales of this iPhone model were discontinued while appropriate measures were taken to remedy the non-conformities found in this equipment.\n\nOrange complies with the authorities' requirements by displaying the SAR for its electrical radio equipment.\n\n(2)\n\n| Specific absorption   rate (SAR) information       | 2023  (1)   | 2022  (1)   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------|\n| % of mobile phone SARs  displayed on the country's |             |             |        |\n| website - European countries                       | 68%         | 57%         | 66%    |\n\n- (1) Eight  contributing  countries  (Belgium,  France,  Luxembourg,  Moldova,  Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Spain).\n- (2) Six contributing countries (Belgium, Spain, France, Moldova, Poland, and Romania).\n\nHealth recommendations are provided to customers with new and refurbished mobile handsets sold by Orange, across all activity scopes.\n\nAntenna exposure limits are subject to international recommendations and national regulations. All antennas provided by Orange to  its  subsidiaries  are  of  the  same  type  and  meet  European standards. The company carries out controls during installation using simulation tools. Security scopes are assessed and defined around the antennas; their calculation is based on a tool made available to the subsidiaries by the Group.\n\nInternally, since 2022 Orange has made available on the Orange Learning training portal a course that introduces employees to radio waves and health; radio technicians and engineers benefit from training on safety instructions and how to wear a dosimeter as well as a very detailed and comprehensive course on radio waves and health.\n\nIn 2021, Orange introduced the risk of non-compliance with safety instructions by employees and subcontractors in its Vigilance Plan. The Group ensures that Orange technicians working on antennas in Europe are trained in safety instructions, including health aspects related to radio waves. These instructions are sent to subcontractors and recalled in the prevention plans during on-site operations.\n\n## Information channels and awareness-raising initiatives\n\nOrange keeps a close eye on the opinions issued by the authorities regarding the adequacy of the recommended limits for the public's exposure to electromagnetic waves as technologies evolve, and communicates regularly with its stakeholders.\n\nFor example, in 2023, Orange posted online the latest report from SCHEER, the European Commission's scientific committee, which published its opinion on the relevance of adopting the latest update of the international limits issued by the ICNIRP (1) in 2020 (the latest dating back to 1998), among others, in order to take into account the forthcoming possibilities of 5G frequency upgrades.\n\nOrange  has  worked  with  professional  federations  (GSMA, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  Fran\u00e7aise  des  T\u00e9l\u00e9coms  -  France's  Telecoms Federation), at national and international levels, to publish official information and educational tools online for the general public on the roll-out of networks and mobile phone use.\n\nThe orange.com website has a section on radio waves and health (2) in seven languages, in which the Group provides transparent and up-to-date information, including precautions for use, for all its stakeholders. Beyond the Group's website, actions to raise public awareness of issues relating to radio waves are implemented in each country in accordance with their culture and governance: dialogue committees organized by health and regulatory authorities, relations  with  local  authorities,  public  information  meetings  in certain countries, etc.\n\nA dialogue with local resident communities and local authorities is also key to guaranteeing acceptance of equipment that emits radio waves.\n\nThe time required to commission a site depends on the regulatory processes and the length of consultation required with stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

This has led to a reconfiguration of on-site service providers for the network, while striving to maintain roll-out times.\n\nIn 2023, six of the eight European countries took between 12 and 24 months to develop a new site. These delays are mainly due to obstacles encountered during commissioning with town halls,  lessors,  local  residents  or  other  stakeholders.  Similarly, half of European countries take 6 to 12 months to roll out new technology on an existing site. Orange's objective is to shorten these roll-out times as much as possible, while maintaining a period of consultation. The longer times required to install and commission antennas reflect the growing awareness among populations and local authorities in Eastern European countries.\n\n## Contribution to research efforts\n\nIn 2023, the Radio Waves and Health Committee noted an increase in questions about the effect of radio waves on biodiversity, and wishes to increase vigilance on these research topics. At the request of the World Health Organization (WHO), as part of its forthcoming monograph on the overall health risks associated with radio waves, an initial bibliographical study of the effect of waves on pregnancy and childbirth in non-human mammals was published in October 2023. This study concluded that there was no convincing evidence that radio frequencies had a toxic effect upon the in-utero exposure of non-human mammals.\n\nOrange, through the Mines Telecom Foundation, sponsors the C2M (characterization, modeling and management of exposure to electromagnetic waves) Chair, together with the ANFr (Agence Nationale des Fr\u00e9quences - the French Government Agency that manages the country's radio spectrum). In addition, Orange is involved in international standardization groups dealing with the assessment methods for human exposure to electromagnetic fields such as the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) and CENELEC (Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation Electrotechnique European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization).\n\nOrange carries out standards assessments on new technologies in cooperation with the entities concerned: 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers),  ETSI  (European  Telecommunications  Standards Institute), etc.\n\n## 4.3.3.3.2 Responsible use of digital technology\n\nOrange supports the responsible use of digital technology by vulnerable individuals such as children, who account for a third of Internet users.\n\nThe Internet is an open universe that offers everyone a world of possibilities, allowing to access information, express ourselves,\n\ninteract and benefit from a wide range of knowledge. However, use of digital technology also exposes children to new risks that may  infringe  their  rights  (education,  harmonious  development, well-being, etc.) or encourage them to adopt new reprehensible behaviors, such as online harassment or verbal abuse.\n\n## Responsible digital use policy for children\n\nAs a trusted operator, Orange makes its services available under responsible conditions, with the support of leading associations, to help families manage the risks and new behaviors of their children, and thus benefit from the best that digital technology has to offer.\n\nOrange  has  identified  the  principal  risks  to  children's  mental and physical health: access to inappropriate content (violent or pornographic); hyper-connectivity and screen addiction; misuse of personal data and advertising; online harassment by peers, the presence of cyber-predators; and exposure to cyber-attacks or fraud.\n\nThat's why several years ago, Orange introduced responsible digital use policy for children, which includes three components:\n\n- -giving children access to secure digital technology via parental controls  on  household  screens,  but  only  equipping  them personally with devices from the age of 9 (or another minimum age depending on local legislation). Parental control allows parents to control access time and access to age-inappropriate content;\n- -informing households and families of the main risks of the Internet via country websites; in conjunction with its partners, Orange  offers  online  resources  in  each  country  where  it operates, allowing parents and family members to learn about the main risks of the digital world for children, to find tools and advice to protect them, as well as external assistance or a phone line dedicated to children and parents;\n- -educating parents and family members on the uses and best practices to be adopted so that children become well-informed, independent  and  responsible  citizens.  In  addition,  Orange organizes activities for children to make them critical of content (fake news, the role of algorithms in social networks, etc.), independent  and  skilled  with  digital  tools  (computer coding, etc.), and aware of the impact of their equipment and digital use on the environment.\n\nTo develop this policy and monitor the action plans that make it operational,  in  2021  Orange  created  a  Children's  Rights  and Protection Operational Committee, which brings together, on a monthly basis, the heads of Children's Rights and Protection from the Europe and MEA regions, the officers from Group CSR and France CSR, and expert members from public affairs, marketing, communication  and  regulatory  affairs  in  Europe;  external stakeholders may also be called upon depending on the topics discussed.",

        "page_content": "In February 2024, Orange published a Policy on Child Protection and Children's Rights in the Digital Age (1) .\n\n## Policy implementation\n\n## Providing children with secure digital access\n\nFive of Orange's eight European countries have special offers for children, allowing parents to manage their use through features such as limited access to certain apps, parental control, blocking of multimedia purchases, or unlimited calls within the family.\n\nOrange promotes digital child protection systems in all countries where the Group is present, and offers parental control in France, Belgium, Poland, Slovakia and Spain. Orange has developed an indicator to monitor the activation of the service on mobile phones, tablets and computers. This indicator was selected to estimate adults' awareness of the need to protect children from inappropriate content based on their age and manage their usage time.\n\nThe results in Europe are as follows:\n\n| Active parental controls   in Europe   | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Number of active parental controls     | 815,465 | 675,256 | 625,976 |\n\n## Providing risk information\n\nIn most of the European countries where the Group is present, Orange has made resources available online to educate parents and children on the risks of the Internet (2) , in the form of articles or videos. Topics may include 'responsible parenting,' 'online abuse,' 'dangerous online relationships.' These sites may also offer educational material, contact information for organizations to ask for help and report irregularities, or external assistance and phone lines dedicated to children.\n\nIn 2023 in Romania, a communication campaign on cyberbullying and phishing was carried out via online workshops for customers, the media and influencers. It also announced the introduction of 119, the local emergency number for child abuse.\n\n## Training and awareness-raising\n\nOrange has created workshops and training courses for children, parents and teachers in all European countries where the Group is present. These workshops take the form of webinars and e-learning platforms with interactive content, in-person courses in schools, or educational tools and materials. They may be organized in partnership with universities, federations (soccer, rugby, depending on the target audience), children's foundations, and involve digital experts and psychologists.\n\nIn addition, Orange offers Supercoder workshops in all the countries where  the  Group  is  present,  to  help  children  become  more independent and skilled with digital technologies. This program has existed since 2014.\n\nOrange continues to reaffirm its commitment against cyberbullying with the development of Safe Zones on Fortnite and Roblox games in several countries, including France. The first goal of these Orange Safe Zones is to provide a fun and educational space where gamers can win rewards by completing a quiz on the right actions to take when faced with digital dangers. The second goal is to put gamers in touch with cyberbullying experts in a safe and trusted space. In France, gamers are given information on the 3018 telephone number and app (French helpline within the European Safer Internet program), a national, anonymous and confidential toll-free number\n\n- 4\n\nfor young victims of digital violence and their parents. The Orange Safe Zone in Fortnite received over 4 million cumulative visitors in 2023.\n\n## 4.3.3.4 Digital  inclusion\n\nDigital technologies are changing the world and contributing to the development of societies. This is occurring to such an extent that they can be considered a fundamental need.\n\nMobile network coverage continues to increase on all continents; according to the GSMA (3) , the population without coverage is estimated at 2% in Europe and central Asia, at 4% in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and at 15% in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIn  addition  to  coverage,  populations  far  removed  from  digital technology for reasons of purchasing power, technological skills or their personal situations, particularly in terms of education or training, are estimated by the GSMA at an average of 19% in Europe and central Asia, 44% in MENA and 60% in sub-Saharan Africa. The rapid digitalization of essential everyday services (employment, education, access to culture, access to social rights, etc.) creates a risk of social exclusion for populations who do not have access to online services or are not familiar with these tools. The two main obstacles identified to the use of digital technology in the world are:\n\n- -on the one hand, accessibility, whether financial or otherwise: people do not have the means to purchase data services or equipment, or the services are not adapted to their personal situation  (for  example  age,  disability  or  neurodivergence, language); and\n- -on the other hand, knowledge and skills: people are not aware of the advantages of digital technology and do not understand it, and/or have a low level of literacy and digital skills.\n\nThis is why Orange has made digital inclusion one of the pillars of its social commitment.\n\n## 4.3.3.4.1 Digital inclusion through infrastructure\n\nOrange is committed to digital inclusion and has positioned itself as a vehicle for the adoption of digital technology by all, with a view to empowering people and promoting the socio-economic development of populations. Orange's core business is geographical digital coverage, which requires investment in infrastructure and research. To offer its customers appropriate connectivity and new related innovative services, Orange is taking action to maximize geographical coverage.\n\nOrange is the leader in the fiber optic roll-out in Europe, with 43.7 million own FTTH connections rolled out at end-2023, in line with its target of 47 million own connections rolled out in Europe excluding FiberCo, and 4.1 million own connections rolled out in Africa & Middle East, in line with its target of 5.2 million connections rolled out by the end of 2025. Its two European FiberCos are committed to expanding fiber coverage in rural areas, with an additional 5.1 million connections at end-2023. The Group has adopted a targeted and responsible approach to deploying 5G in Europe and Africa focusing on busy areas with high connectivity needs and 4G networks nearing saturation. Its subsidiary TOTEM, one of the leading TowerCos in Europe, strengthens Orange's position as a manager and operator of passive mobile infrastructure. In addition, customers living in remote areas can also now access very high-speed broadband using satellite technology. The Group owns or co-owns 450,000 km of submarine cables worldwide and supports digital sovereignty in Europe through a network of Data centers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This policy is implemented by Orange subsidiaries and by its foundations: the Orange Foundation and the Cit\u00e9 des T\u00e9l\u00e9coms.\n\nAt the operational level, its Digital Inclusion Committee monitors the achievement of Orange's strategic plan target of six million people benefiting from free digital training and workshops by 2030. It brings together the 'digital inclusion' directors from Orange France, the\n\n## 4.3.3.4.2 Equip\n\nOrange provides offers and services that are accessible to families, young people and seniors in precarious situations, as well as to people with disabilities, VSBs and associations. In addition to its\n\nconnectivity offer, Orange makes essential services accessible to people with little to no access, in fields as diverse as financial services, energy, health, culture, etc.\n\n## Social offers in Europe\n\nAt end-2023, Orange had achieved its ambition of offering, by 2025, a connectivity service suited to populations with little to no access to digital technology due to economic reasons, in each of the European countries where it operates.\n\n| Country    | Offers

        "page_content": "## Affordable handsets\n\nOrange also offers affordable mobile handsets, which must offer access to the Internet. 'Affordable' is defined below. The definition differs between the Europe and Africa & Middle East regions.\n\nIn Europe, Orange considers a smartphone to be affordable if it costs less than 15% of average monthly GDP per capita. In 2023, seven  out  of  the  eight  European  countries  offered  affordable smartphones. In Moldova, the most affordable smartphone is not considered affordable as its price represents 17% of average monthly GDP per capita. All countries offer installment plans to facilitate the purchase of smartphones.\n\nIn the Africa & Middle East region, the affordable handset is part of the Sanza range or its equivalent in terms of price (1) . In 2023, at least one model in the Sanza range was available in 15 countries (2) . In Egypt and Sierra Leone, the least expensive model does not meet the above-referenced criterion. In total, 15 out of 17 countries thus offered an affordable handset in 2023. In addition, in four countries in the MEA region (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Mali, Senegal), a payment facility mechanism makes the purchase of these devices more accessible.\n\nThe 'Equip' component of Orange's digital inclusion policy also includes actions taken to facilitate access to as many essential services as possible, such as banking, energy, education and healthcare. These actions are described in Section 4.3.3.4.5 Offering inclusive services that complement connectivity.\n\n## Accessible offers for people with disabilities\n\nIn  2023,  Orange  published  a  disability  report  highlighting the  importance  of  accessibility  and  summarizing  the  actions implemented throughout the Group (3) . Orange is committed to meeting the needs of people with disabilities, the elderly and the vulnerable,  through  a  dedicated  marketing  department.  This department selects and references adapted products and services on behalf of the Group, designs innovative solutions, coordinates a distribution channel made up of 'Autonomie' branded stores and customer relationship centers, and maintains stakeholder dialogue to better identify their needs and develop partnerships.\n\nOrange is striving to develop its 'Autonomie' offer in all countries by 2025. At end-2023, 10  out of 35 business units spread over all countries had an 'Autonomie' offer. On the B2B market in France, Orange Business also offers its customers Digital Accessibility.\n\nIn addition, a skill center dedicated to digital accessibility checks all the websites in the French scope to establish declarations of compliance. At end-2023, there were 260 accessibility declarations for  Orange  websites  by  the  Orange  skill  center.  This  work  is continuing for customer and business apps and web apps. The web portals of many other Group countries were also audited (Belgium, Botswana,  Cameroon,  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire,  Jordan,  Luxembourg, Morocco, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Spain).\n\n## 4.3.3.4.3 Inform and educate a large audience on digital issues and their responsible uses\n\nOrange has implemented a global information strategy on safe and responsible digital use. Orange's initiatives in this area take the form of the publication and promotion of online content (articles, tutorials, videos, digital library, etc.) on dedicated websites, social networks or customer relations portals in each of the countries where Orange is present.\n\n- 4\n\nThrough  dedicated  websites  or  webpages  offered  by  its subsidiaries, Orange informs the general public about technological developments  and  the  major  issues  inherent  in  the  digital transformation of societies. This popularization of digital culture serves several purposes:\n\n- -it allows people with no or limited digital skills to find their way around and grasp the concepts of digital culture and its  challenges  (fake  news,  artificial  intelligence, etc.),  to receive practical advice and to acquire basic skills (handling smartphones, social networks, etc.) or to learn about specific issues such as the role of parents in the use of digital technology by  their  children  and  adolescents.  Orange  also  provides information on the tools that can help them;\n- -it  presents  the  opportunities  that  digital  technology  offers professional  integration,  particularly  for  young  people  and women (access to online rights, online reputation management, digital r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters, etc.), as well as testimonials from beneficiaries on Orange's actions and its foundation in this area;\n- -it provides professionals and small businesses with intermediate skills to incorporate digital technologies into their activities (digital marketing, data protection);\n- -it provides information on digital inclusion and the responsible uses to adopt, including those which limit its impact on the environment.\n\nIn 2023, the Group's main websites dedicated to digital skills and uses accumulated 4.6 million pieces of content viewed.\n\n## 4.3.3.4.4 Digital support and training\n\nTaking into consideration the importance of online media and services, Orange believes that providing content without support may not be enough for people who have little to no access to digital technology. The Group is therefore committed to providing free digital training and workshops to 2.5 million people by the end of 2025 (cumulative figure for 2021-2025) and 6 million people between 2021 and 2030.\n\nOrange sets up programs through its subsidiaries, foundations and partners to support different audiences in adopting digital communication tools, through workshops or training courses.\n\nOrange offers one-hour familiarization workshops with basic tools (using  your  smartphone,  protecting  your  personal  data,  using WhatsApp, etc.) in Europe. Some examples of these are the digital workshops and the digital solidarity workshops of the Foundation in France, the Orange Studios in rural areas in Poland, or the activities offered by the Garage Labs in Spain.\n\n## 4.3.3.4.4.1 The Orange Digital Centers program\n\nFor  young  adults  or  people  undergoing  retraining,  and  in particular women, Orange offers various training programs in all its geographies. Since 2019, Orange has launched the Orange Digital Centers program, which brings together several strategic programs in the same space: a coding school which offers training and events; a dedicated solidarity fablab which offers training in digital manufacturing and prototyping projects; Orange Fab, an accelerator that supports start-ups in their development; a privileged connection with Orange Ventures, the Group's investment fund which finances start-ups in Orange's areas of experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

In Europe, in addition to vocational training, the ODCs offer workshops to empower the general public to confidently use digital tools.\n\nFour new Orange Digital Centers opened in 2023, including three in Europe (Spain, Moldova and Romania) and one in Africa & Middle East (Guinea Bissau). In total, 22 Orange Digital Centers are now open out of the 25 planned (1) to be running by 2025.\n\nOrange has also teamed up with the Trace group to reach out in a different way to young people looking for guidance: with the 'Trace Academia' mobile app, mobile users can browse through guidance video modules and take part in quizzes to target the digital professions that meet their expectations, or even get in touch with Orange Digital Center advisers.\n\n## 4.3.3.4.4.2 Philanthropy and the Orange corporate Foundation\n\nThe Orange Foundation works to promote the education and the social and professional integration of young people and women in difficulty through digital technology. For the past 35 years, the Orange Foundation's actions have provided them with access to education, employment and culture, helping them integrate better into society. Orange also contributes to the democratization of culture among all sections of the population by promoting access to music, books and museums. The Foundation is currently active in all these areas, ensuring that digital skills are an integral part of equal opportunities. Thus, with the support of committed employees and more than 24.7 million euros invested in 2023 in 25 countries with its partner associations, the Orange corporate Foundation is helping its beneficiaries to make a new start.\n\nMoreover, Orange has improved the living conditions of around 500,000 people through over 100 Orange Villages spread across 12 countries in Africa, with a water source, a health center and a school.\n\nFinally, since April 2021, salary rounding has been offered to Orange employees in France, allowing them to make a micro-donation from their salary to the Orange Foundation or one of Orange's or the Orange Foundation's six partner associations. At the end of 2023, through this initiative, nearly 200,000 euros had been sent to the associations by more than 3,500 employees who were members of the program in December 2023. Through this solidarity effort, Orange doubled the amount collected.\n\nBeneficiaries of the Maisons Digitales, solidarity FabLab and Digital School programs contribute to the total number of workshop and training beneficiaries (see Section 4.3.3.4.4.5 Monitoring the target number of beneficiaries).\n\nAs  part  of  its  new  Engage  2025  Strategic  Plan,  Orange  has committed to:\n\n- -expand opportunities for Orange SA employees transferring within the Group to carry out their skills sponsorship activities in a general interest association, in one of the areas supported by the Foundation or by leading digital support workshops. Previously, this program was only available under the French part-time for seniors plans. In 2023, 499 employees chose to get involved in an association as part of their part-time for seniors  plans/skills  sponsorships,  including  232 involved with  Orange  Solidarit\u00e9,  the  Orange  corporate  Foundation association. Since 2010, 4,129 have chosen skills sponsorship through partner associations of the Foundation (868 active employees at end-2023);\n- -ensure the Foundation has a presence in each of the countries where  it  operates,  grouping  together  the  philanthropic programs  within  a  common  structure  to  promote  synergy between the different actions it performs, in particular giving vulnerable children, young people and women access to digital tools. At end-2023, the Foundation's actions take place in 25 countries, with a Group Foundation that leads 20 local (2) , operational foundations, and Foundation programs rolled out by local sponsorship teams when the country does not have a foundation.\n\n## The Foundation's digital technology initiatives\n\nThe  Orange  Foundation  conducted  training  in  2023  for 130,000 beneficiaries:\n\n- -more than 103,000 students in remote schools without books or the Internet to access educational content benefited from access to educational content in 2023, thanks to 450 new Digital Schools kits (for new schools or to bolster already-equipped schools) in the MEA region; on a cumulative basis, since the start of the program, there are 1,700 Digital Schools operational in 16 countries in the MEA region, reaching an audience of nearly 600,000 students each year;\n- -more than 11,000 women newly received digital training in 2023 in the Foundation's Maisons Digitales across 24 countries (in France, in other European countries and in Africa & Middle East); in total since the start of the program at the end of 2015, 449 Maisons Digitales created by the Foundation with partner NGOs have trained more than 60,000 women;\n- -more than 6,000 women were trained in 2023 in digital tools in order to sell their crops online, access weather forecasts, and insurance tools in the event of crop failure, as part of the Orange  Foundation's  partnership  with  the  United  Nations' 'BuyfromWomen' program. Since March 2022, the Orange Foundation has been supporting the UN Women organization in training women farmers in rural areas of Liberia and Mali to develop their resilience in the face of climate change. Over six months in 2023, more than USD163,000 in transactions were recorded on the e-commerce platform, benefiting cooperatives in Liberia;\n- -nearly 9,000 young people in total benefited in 2023 from projects supported by the Solidarity FabLabs network, through 37 projects as part of the FabLabs Solidaires Parcours Maker call for projects, and 31 projects under the M\u00e9tiers de Demain call for projects. The latter allows young people seeking to enter the workforce to be trained in environmental protection professions in order to meet local needs and thus develop their employability. The Solidarity FabLabs network includes 250 FabLabs in 24 countries, and has supported more than 88,000 young people trying to enter the workforce since 2014.\n\nFurthermore, the autism and digital technology program provides equipment and support to people with autism to improve their means of learning and communication. In 2023, 3,938 children and adults benefited from the use of these digital tools for learning, communication and to diversify their activities. In addition, the Orange  Foundation  funds  digital  projects  to  help  people  with autism spectrum disorders find the right contacts, for example, or to experiment with inclusive cities for people with cognitive difficulties. With tailored support, people with autism can study, work, have housing and a social life. In 2023, more than 460 people benefited from these inclusion programs, including 90 who will be able to access housing. These projects will ultimately benefit thousands of people and their families.",

        "page_content": "## The Foundation's culture initiatives\n\nThe Orange Foundation has two priorities in the field of music: support for young artists and disseminating music to as many people as possible. In 2023, it supported eight young professional music groups, four music academies and residencies for young artists, and helped organize three lyrical contests to discover the greatest voices of tomorrow. The Foundation also helps disseminate music by supporting nearly 40 festivals in the classical, jazz and world music repertoires in France and 16 African countries. Lastly, thanks to its partnership with the Paris Opera, the Foundation has made it possible for more than 200,000 audience members to access the opera thanks to broadcasts in movie theaters, in the open air or via the digital platform 'Paris Op\u00e9ra Play.'\n\nWith regard to access to museums, in 2023 the Orange Foundation produced,  in  partnership  with  cultural  institutions,  three  new MOOCs (free online courses open to all) and around ten educational and digital tools for facilitators, to reach audiences with little to no access to culture. More than 30,000 people have thus been able to benefit from free education that is both rigorous and user-friendly, based on quality content.\n\n## 4.3.3.4.4.3 Cit\u00e9 des T\u00e9l\u00e9com\n\nCit\u00e9 des T\u00e9l\u00e9coms is a foundation of the Group, based in Brittany, whose aim is to share scientific and technical culture related to telecoms with as many people as possible, on its own site or by touring.\n\nIn 2023, Cit\u00e9 put the spotlight on societal and digital issues by offering  visitors  a  new  interactive  temporary  exhibition  Esprit Critique: d\u00e9trompez-vous! as well as a new immersive activity involving the use of a virtual reality headset. These new ways of\n\n- 4\n\ndecoding cognitive biases and better understanding the digital environment  have  been  a  great  success:  an  8%  increase  in individual visits to the site in 2023 and over 10,000 participants in the virtual reality activity, three quarters of whom used a virtual reality headset for the first time in their lives.\n\nHaving also joined the ECSITE and ICOM international reference networks in 2023, Cit\u00e9 des T\u00e9l\u00e9coms has become a visible player in digital inclusion at the European and global level.\n\nBy their very nature, the experiences and activities offered to Cit\u00e9 des T\u00e9l\u00e9coms visitors are considered to be workshops that enhance digital and scientific knowledge; their participants thus contribute to the total number of workshop and training course beneficiaries (see Section 4.3.3.4.4.5 Monitoring the target number of beneficiaries).\n\n## 4.3.3.4.4.4 The Orange Solidarity association\n\nCreated by Orange and its Foundation, the non-profit association (as provided for in France's Loi de 1901) Orange Solidarit\u00e9 organization draws  on  the  skills  of  Orange  employees  and  volunteers  to support young people without qualifications, women in vulnerable situations and people with autism, all of whom benefit from Orange Foundation programs. In France, it helps associations (beneficiaries, supervisors, etc.) to master the use of digital technology by holding training workshops (in-person or remote) at Orange sites or those of the associations. In 2023, 53,000 people benefited from this support.\n\nIn addition, concrete steps have been taken to expand recruitment sources and ensure the future of the Orange Solidarity association.\n\nParticipants in the Orange Solidarity workshops programs contribute to the total number of workshop and training beneficiaries (see Section 4.3.3.4.4.5 Monitoring the target number of beneficiaries).\n\n4.3.3.4.4.5 Monitoring the target number of beneficiaries\n\n| Beneficiaries of digital support and training   | 2021    | 2022    | 2023        | 2025 target   | 2030 target   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Group total                                     | 356,000 | 593,000 | \uf0fc 850,000   |               |               |\n| Cumulative Group total                          | 356,000 | 949,000 | \uf0fc 1,799,000 | 2,500,000     | 6,000,000     |\n\nIn total in 2023, 850,000 people (1.8 million cumulative between 2021 and 2023) were able to benefit from the support of facilitators and trainers from Orange, its Foundation or its partners. Overall, half of them attended workshops and the other half used training modules. This increase is linked to the roll-out of the Orange Digital Centers program, with the opening of ten additional ODCs in 2022 and four additional ODCs in 2023.\n\n## 4.3.3.4.5 Offering inclusive services that complement connectivity\n\nAs part of its overall development approach, Orange offers services to cover the basic needs of populations, based on its connectivity offer. Orange has identified several areas in which it is taking action:, access to financial services, to energy, to health, to education and e-education and - in the Africa & Middle East region - to agriculture (mAgri, a range of decision making-support services for the agricultural world that also allows virtual marketplaces to be created).\n\n## 4.3.3.4.5.1 Access to online financial services\n\nIn 2023, Orange Money was present in 17 countries, with more than 90 million customers, including an active base of 34.1 million, having carried out more than 100 billion euros in transactions and generated revenues of 567 million euros.\n\nOrange Money is used by individuals, businesses and governments. Its  services  help  governments  to  pay  benefits  to  vulnerable populations,  households  to  pay  utility  bills,  members  in  the diaspora to make money transfers to other family members, and micro-entrepreneurs to run their businesses. The offer also allows international transfers, both within the MEA region and international North-South transfers, with the opening of new corridors from Europe to Africa, as well as innovative offers to develop merchant payments.\n\nTo meet the security and compliance requirements of governments and central banks, in 2015 Orange created 'Electronic Money Institutions,' entities regulated by Central Banks, in 14 countries (1) .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

In just three years, Orange Bank Africa has accumulated more than 1.3 million customers and has granted more than 261 billion CFA francs in loans, first in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and then, since 2023, in Senegal.\n\n## 4.3.3.4.5.2 Access to energy\n\nAccess to electricity is a major issue for the African continent, where Orange can play a leading role by capitalizing on its brand, its commercial presence and its technical assets. While ensuring the continuity of its own services, Orange is committed, in this area with high operational stakes, to a diversification approach that strengthens the Group's positive presence in the MEA region.\n\nUnder  the  Orange  Energies  brand,  Orange  is  developing  two separate offers for customers not connected to the national grid or with service discontinuities, and for customers connected to the national grid or to a minigrid:\n\n- -for customers not connected to the grid (generally those living in rural and remote areas), the offer consists of making the purchase of individual solar electricity production equipment affordable  with  payment  in  installments  that  replace  fossil energy expenses; these individual solar kits were distributed at end-2023 in 12 countries (1) ; the aim is to provide access to solar energy in rural areas or on the outskirts of towns and cities where the service quality of electricity providers is non-existent or insufficient. The service consists of allowing the regular use of a kit comprising a solar panel, a central unit containing a battery and a SIM card, lamps with LED bulbs, a multi-socket charging cable, a radio, a portable flashlight and  an  optional  television  set  or  fan.  Customers  become owners after a defined period. The kits are produced with partners selected by Orange for their quality and ability to offer integrated solutions and to meet large-scale demand. Payment via Mobile Money means the service can be granted or re-established automatically and remotely for the required period of time. This payment-in-installments and remote-control mechanism has been piloted since 2021 through the Pay As You Go Orange (OSE) digital platform. At end-2023, around 250,000 households had benefited from this offer; in 2023, new 'income-generating' uses were developed for commercial purposes, such as solar-powered freezers, hair salon kits, etc;\n- -for connected customers, Orange offers an 'electric wallet,' with the remote control of a smart meter connected to the Orange OSE platform and payment via Orange Money. This offer is available following an agreement between Orange and operators of the electricity distribution channels (PowerCo) or minigrids; it opens up the possibility for them to read meters remotely and improves Customer Relations in various areas: supervision, management, billing and payment, fraud reduction. For electricity operators, it is now possible to carry out readings remotely, quickly and without data loss, as well as to implement advanced  customer  management  mechanisms  such  as avoiding load shedding in entire areas and limiting power to each household instead. Two minigrid operators have opted for this solution, in Burkina Faso in 2018 and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2021.\n\n## 4.3.3.4.5.3 Digital access to healthcare\n\nIn 2020, Orange Business reorganized its health entities Enovacom (leader in interoperability in France) and Orange Healthcare, to create a single division and comprehensively meet the needs of players in this sector as it undergoes a digital transformation in France and internationally. The new structure's dedicated e-health software and services address four major challenges: protection of\n\nhealth data; exchanges and sharing between healthcare ecosystem players; the digitization of the patient pathway; and the use of health data.\n\nOrange aims to accelerate the development of new healthcare solutions  based  on  the  massive  use  of  data.  It  is  within  this framework  that  Future4care  was  launched  to  create  the  joint venture  between  Sanofi,  Capgemini,  Generali  and  Orange  to develop e-health. Future4care's aim is to unite all players in the health sphere (patients, healthcare facilities, startups, academic and institutional, public and private) to collectively invent the future of e-health, to make Europe a key player in the global scene and guarantee its sovereignty in this area. Future4care relies on the expertise of be ys, an international group specializing in digital identity, personal information flows, and the processing and hosting of sensitive data, with which it entered into an industrial partnership at the start of 2022. In December 2023, Future4care launched GenAI4care, an initiative dedicated to advancing Generative AI in the healthcare sector, to create a pioneering ecosystem in this field. On a European scale, it brings together major industrial groups, start-ups, researchers, academics and healthcare professionals in order to amplify the development of generative artificial intelligence use cases in healthcare.\n\nIn the MEA region, in close proximity with populations, and to facilitate access to healthcare in areas with the weakest healthcare structures, Orange's service offering is based on partnerships with national health authorities. It includes:\n\n- -information services via mobile phone or hotline to answer health  questions  (sexuality/contraception,  AIDS,  STDs, malaria, etc.), vaccination schedule reminders (service launched as part of the EPI (Expanded Program on Immunization) on the recommendation of the WHO), family planning service;\n- -remote advice and monitoring services (by text and/or voice messages):  M-vaccin  and  e-Vaccination  in  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire, vaccination schedule reminders in Mali, Senvitale in Senegal, Gifted Mom for maternal and infant health in Cameroon and the Central African Republic, Cycle M for family planning in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;\n- -insurance and savings services: Sini Tonon in Mali, Indemnit\u00e9s Hospitalisation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Activa Makala and AssurTous in Cameroon;\n- -geolocation  and  connection  services  (doctors,  hospitals, on-call pharmacies, appointment scheduling, etc.): Gifted Mom in Cameroon and the Central African Republic, Health First in Cameroon, geolocation of on-call pharmacies in Mali.\n\nIn order to develop innovative e-health solutions, by improving access  and  quality  of  care  through  digital  platforms  that  in particular strengthen links between healthcare professionals and patients, in October 2019 Orange signed a partnership agreement with the Global Fund for the implementation of a digital platform for healthcare professionals in Morocco, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health. Its aim is to facilitate the monitoring of patients as part of the HIV and tuberculosis care pathways. This was expanded in 2020 to other African countries including C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burkina Faso.\n\n## 4.3.3.4.5.4 Digital access to education\n\nCommitted to access to quality education for all, Orange has developed a leading interactive mobile platform to train teachers in rural areas in the African continent, in partnership with USAID (the US Agency for International Development) since 2014. From 2020 to March 2023, Orange Campus Africa, in partnership with the UVS (Universit\u00e9 Virtuelle du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal - Virtual University of Senegal), designed an online training program to bring together content from recognized education and training partners in a single place.",

        "page_content": "Orange also developed an education pass, available in seven countries  in  the  MEA  region  (Cameroon,  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire,  the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, and Senegal), which provides access to online educational content at a price negotiated within a sponsored mobile Internet contract.\n\nWith the launch of its app Max it, in the last quarter of 2023 Orange began integrating education solutions developed by start-ups from the continent. This approach will continue with a large-scale roll-out i n 2024.\n\nIn  Romania,  Poland  and  Slovakia,  Orange  offers  dedicated programs for school teachers and students (1) to develop their digital literacy and provide educational content in digital format (see also the programs described in the Section 4.3.3.3.2 Responsible use of digital technology).\n\n## 4.3.3.4.6 Impact  assessment\n\nOrange has produced several socioeconomic footprint studies since 2017, and complements this approach by implementing social impact assessments. This approach allows it to better measure and understand the impacts of its activities on beneficiaries. Several studies have been launched since 2022. They aim to evaluate the changes brought about to the beneficiaries of digital inclusion programs:\n\n- -an initial quantitative study covering all the Orange Foundation programs and involving more than 400,000 beneficiaries was initiated in 2021 and finalized in June 2022 with the IM-PROVE firm. The main results showed that the beneficiaries attributed a 91% relevance rate to the support received from the Orange Foundation. It also provided a metric of professional integration (self-confidence,  professional  network  development, etc.), access to culture and improved living conditions (reduction of the maternal and infant mortality rate, success in elementary school graduation exams, etc.);\n- -a second study concerns the 'coding school' program of the Orange Digital Centers in Senegal and Tunisia; it aims to  quantitatively  and  qualitatively  determine  the  impact  of the training received on the beneficiaries. It is carried out by Orange's SENSE (Sociology and Economics of Networks and Services) social science research department, in collaboration with local academic consultants. The study in Senegal (2) was completed in 2023. The assessment in Tunisia was completed at the end of 2023, its impact report is online (3) .\n\nIn addition, since 2022 Orange has been using a tool dedicated to measuring and managing social impact: Impact Track. This integrated tool simplifies the creation of the impact framework (4) , data collection and report production. The results were obtained through participant surveys. Thanks to this tool and the support provided, with the backing of experts from the CSR Department and the Group's research department, Orange France was able to produce an impact report on the 'Women Entrepreneurs' program (5) which, each year since 2018, provides support to 100 women for 10 months in all regions of France. Carried out in 2022, this study\n\n- 4\n\nestablished that the survival rate of companies at the end of the program was 95%, and that a total of 148 jobs had been created by these companies during the period. In addition, it shows how the program has helped this cohort of women creators increase their ability to develop their business, grow their professional network and stay motivated to pursue their project. The same approach to measuring social impact has been implemented for the 'Mayotte Talents Num\u00e9riques' (6) program, and for the program to create women's economic interest groups in Guinea (7) .\n\nThe objective of this initiative is to better qualify the social challenges in each region, the relevance of the responses provided by Orange and the effectiveness of the programs.\n\nLastly, in 2023, Orange took part in a multi-partner working group in France (companies, associations, academics) on measuring the impact of digital inclusion initiatives (8) . The aim of this group is to produce a common framework of impact indicators. As the leading structure, Impact Tank (9) will produce a report in the first half of 2024 with specific recommendations on digital inclusion initiatives and their assessment.\n\n## 4.3.3.4.7 Note on methodology - Digital inclusion\n\nThe social data in this section is based mainly on data for which reporting is still being developed. The methodological specifications or limitations of some indicators are provided below and include a compilation of the details given in the indicator tables.\n\n## Countries with social offers\n\nA social offer aims to allow people with low incomes to access and use telecommunication services, including Internet access. Taking into account the characteristics of the local market in each country, the offer must either target populations with no access to digital technology because they lack sufficient means, or enable access to low-cost or at-cost Internet service, potentially without a commitment and with a subscription. It may be supplemented by access to low-cost equipment (preferably a PC) and by training to learn basic digital skills. A country is considered to have a social offer based on its catalog offer at December 31 of the year in question.\n\n## Countries with affordable devices\n\nAn affordable mobile handset has to offer Internet access. In the Europe region, this means a handset whose purchase price is less than 15% of the monthly GDP per capita of the country in which it is marketed. In the MEA region, this means a handset in the Sanza range, or a handset that costs less than the Sanza Touch (40 US dollars). A country is considered to have an affordable device offer based on its catalog offer at December 31 of the year in question.\n\n## Countries with payment installment plans\n\nA payment installment plan can be a lease, a payment included in a subscription, a consumer credit, etc. In the MEA region, the type of plan is a loan available to eligible customers for certain models. A country is considered to have a payment installment plan based on its catalog offer at December 31 of the year in question.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This can mean workshops, training courses or MOOCs, webinars, hackathons, master classes, etc. Beneficiaries include people who benefit from programs specific to Orange and those offered by Orange's partners and the Orange Foundation, as well as organizations, such as the startups that have received support. A beneficiary is equivalent to a participant in one of the programs, and the same person can represent several beneficiaries. Orange has drawn up a list of programs eligible to contribute to the number of beneficiaries; the selection criterion for programs is that the learner is supported by Orange or its partners.\n\n## 4.3.3.5 Innovation and ethical and responsible research\n\n## 4.3.3.5.1 Ethical and responsible artificial intelligence\n\nIn  its  innovation  processes,  Orange  applies  positive-impact innovation by design, to minimize negative impacts and generate a positive impact right from the design phase and throughout the entire life cycle. The impact must be positive for Orange, its customers, society and the planet. Orange also wishes to advance the  consideration  of  social  and  environmental  expectations  in relation to technologies, and continues to collaborate with academic and digital ecosystems to define best practices and support the development of international standards.\n\n## 4.3.3.5.1.1 Policy on the use of artificial intelligence\n\nFor Orange, artificial intelligence creates economic and social value by generating new mechanisms for customer relations, innovating its products and services, and improving the quality of its decisions and operational efficiency.\n\nIn March 2021, Orange established a Data and AI Ethics Council made up of 11 external individuals, selected for their independence, neutrality,  expertise  on  these  issues,  and  for  the  diversity  of their profiles. The duties of this board include defining an ethical framework  for  AI  and  data,  beyond  regulatory  obligations,  in accordance with Orange's values and purpose. It also issues advisory  opinions  on  governance  arrangements  and  on  the concrete cases referred to it, for the Orange Executive Committee.\n\nInternally, the Data AI Board defines and monitors the implementation of procedures across the entire production chain.\n\nOrange is involved as an expert in 'The High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence' (1) (AI HLEG) of the European Commission and supports its practices. The Group takes inspiration from the key principles expressed in its Data and Artificial Intelligence Ethics Charter, designed by its Data and AI Ethics Council in 2022:\n\n- -the goal of artificial intelligence is to contribute positively to social and environmental challenges;\n- -solutions based on artificial intelligence must always respect the needs of humans, and operate under their supervision;\n- -they must respect diversity and fight against the risks of bias or discrimination;\n- -the data underpinning artificial intelligence algorithms must respect privacy and be subject to careful governance;\n- -the  robustness  and  security  of  AI-based  solutions  must correspond to the specific challenges of each application;\n- -the  functioning  of  AI-based  solutions  must  be  explained in  a  transparent  and  intelligible  manner,  and  the  chain  of responsibility must be clear.\n\nThe  Group  thus  ensures  that  the  entire  data  value  chain  is responsible and that potential discriminatory biases are identified and controlled.\n\n## 4.3.3.5.1.2 Policy  implementation\n\nIn order to manage the challenges of ethical and responsible artificial intelligence,  Orange  has  implemented  ethical  and  responsible artificial intelligence governance Group-wide and in all European countries, with ethics experts and local ethics committees. The aim is to identify artificial intelligence use cases, assess the risks and ensure particular vigilance over high-risk use cases (e.g. analysis of  video  surveillance  images,  analysis  of  r\u00e9sum\u00e9s  by  Human Resources Departments, etc.).\n\nOrange participates in numerous international think tanks and standardization bodies working on the topic of ethical artificial intelligence (GSMA's AI for Impact program, Innovation Makers Alliance). In 2020, Orange was the first company to sign the Arborus fund's  international  charter  for  inclusive  artificial  intelligence. The Group is a member of the Board of Directors of Impact AI, a collective made up of a group of stakeholders united around addressing the ethical and societal issues of artificial intelligence and supporting innovative and positive projects around the world. In 2022, Orange France also launched Positive AI, an initiative that encourages responsible artificial intelligence, along with three major partner companies. Orange is also a member of the Cercle InterL (2) for the inclusion of women in the design and regulation of AI-based digital systems.\n\nIn  2023,  Orange  conducted  several  studies  on  the  ethical challenges of artificial intelligence, notably on use cases such as video image recognition, credit scoring, or the use of generative artificial intelligence in customer relations. Orange also initiated work to comply with the new European AI Act to be implemented in 2025, and has integrated data and artificial intelligence responsibility and ethics criteria into the Group's risk management framework, taking generative artificial intelligence into account since September 2023. Finally, responsibility and ethics criteria are systematically integrated into the launch reviews of projects dealing with data and artificial intelligence.\n\nIn addition, Orange has taken a number of steps to raise employee awareness of these challenges: a training course on ethical artificial intelligence has been rolled out and has already raised awareness among 1,800 employees; and a guide to the responsible use of generative artificial intelligence has been drawn up for employees.",

        "page_content": "## 4.3.3.5.2 Web3, Metaverse and XR\n\nIn 2022, Orange Innovation and the Group's strategy department implemented a global 'Web3, Metaverse & XR' governance with the ambition to share, align and define a common positioning between  the  various  committees  and  working  groups  within Orange. Orange's ambition is to embrace the next digital disruption by integrating responsibility and sustainability into its strategy and execution as well as its innovations.\n\nFor this, the committee has defined the following six values to be respected in the choice of Orange's metaverse & XR experiments:\n\n- -reduce  the  overall  environmental  impact  (taking  into account CO 2 emissions and reductions induced by the services provided);\n- -do not generate addiction, especially among young people;\n- -manage data in a transparent, reasoned and secure manner;\n- -identify, address and stop cyberbullying;\n- -do not discriminate; respect diversity and equal opportunity;\n- -adapt content according to age; do not create exposure to inappropriate content.\n\n## 4.3.3.5.3 Social dialogue on the networks of the future\n\nIn 2023, Orange initiated discussions on the networks and uses of the future. With regard to network evolution, Orange's ambition is to develop a technology that generates value for society and its stakeholders, all while being sustainable from a social, economic and environmental point of view. Orange's Research Department is looking to organize social dialogues with its stakeholders in France (in particular local authorities and the general public) to understand their expectations regarding the networks of the future. The aim is to establish a dialogue with citizens and companies on the technological choices that underpin how modern societies function, through co-development between the telecoms ecosystem and future users. It will also provide the public debate with factual information on the development of this technology. The first six pilot workshops took place in 2023; the remaining dialogues are being planned for the first half of 2024. This initiative is part of a series of European cooperative projects on this subject. The results of these dialogues will be presented internally, to European institutions and to ecosystem partners participating in the project.\n\n## 4.3.3.6 Support for entrepreneurship and start-up ecosystems\n\nOrange's  core  business  is  to  establish  connectivity  in  all  its geographical regions, including those far from major cities. Orange is also committed to the socioeconomic development of these regions, by strengthening the economic fabric for the benefit of local communities.\n\nOrange promotes synergies between digital technology actors by creating ecosystems for support and exchange through an Open Innovation approach. Orange works hard to set up support systems at every stage in the life of start-ups, in order to train, identify, assist and promote digital talent in its innovation ecosystem.\n\nThis  is  particularly  the  role  of  the  network  of  twenty  Orange Fabs around the world, whose objective is to build commercial partnerships between the Group and start-ups. In 2023, the themes of 'artificial intelligence and sustainability,' 5G and WomenStart received particular support.\n\nThrough its numerous other calls for bids, Orange selects the start-ups most likely to lead changes in digital usage and integrates\n\nthem into the digital ecosystem. Orange provides various kinds of technical and expert support covering the spectrum from incubation to acceleration, as well as access to financing that is appropriate to the different levels of start-up maturity.\n\nThe Group supports various incubators and incubator networks in France and Africa via Orange Digital Centers (ODCs) and its subsidiaries. Lastly, Orange encourages entrepreneurial initiatives combining  employees  and  start-ups,  with  incubators  and corp-working (corporate/coworking) spaces: Villa Atlantique and Villa Occitanie in France.\n\nIn terms of digital technology and healthcare, Orange Enovacom is an active partner of Future4Care, the largest French e-health accelerator (see Section 4.3.3.4.5.3 Digital access to healthcare). Lastly, Orange is rolling out the 5G Lab program with the opening of new spaces in several major cities in France, Europe, Africa & Middle East to host companies and support them in the development of new uses.\n\nOrange  provides  financial  support  via  investment  funds  to encourage the emergence of new responsible economic models with a positive impact on the environment, inclusion or/and social support. Orange Ventures is one of Europe's leading corporate venture capital funds, with 350 million euros under management. In Europe, Africa & Middle East, it supports software solutions in the technology sector, start-ups in the seed capital phase and high-impact start-ups in various fields such as inclusion, HRtech, education-tech, e-health and the environment. Orange also supports Teranga Capital in Senegal and Como\u00e9 in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\n\nOrange has an extensive partnership policy in order to develop different modes of cooperation, particularly for Open Innovation. All partnerships that the Group enters into are subject to an analysis of the contributions of each partner, an allocation of ownership by results and the definition of a regime to utilize such results. They give rise to contracts in accordance with the Group's guidelines. Orange applies the business ethics principles defined by the Group for its partnerships. In industry partnerships that leverage other stakeholders, relationships are also established via an antitrust declaration.\n\nFinally, Orange also provides expertise and visibility, with:\n\n- -a web page (1) dedicated to promoting and supporting innovative companies in all the Group's geographies;\n- -digital tools such as Cloud Starter, a Cloud Computing platform for start-ups, and Orange Developer, which brings together all of Orange's APIs (application programming interfaces), SDKs (software development kits) and development kits;\n- -through community organizing, such as POESAM (Prix de l'Entrepreneuriat Social en Afrique et au Moyen-Orient - the Orange Social Entrepreneur Awards in Africa & Middle East), which  identify  and  assist  around  50 innovative  start-ups every year at the national and/or international level, to meet sustainable development challenges in this part of the world.\n\nIn France, through its policy of regional coverage and presence, particularly in innovation ecosystems, Orange contributes to the development of regional attractiveness and to the dynamics of responsible growth and reindustrialization driven by public policy. Orange  is  particularly  active  in  the  French  Tech  Capitals  and Communities, several competitiveness clusters and technological research  institutes,  where  the  Group's  major  co-innovation programs are implemented, including Orange Fab France, Orange Innovation Hub, Femmes Entrepreneuses, Orange 5G Lab, and Orange Venture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

All the Group's commitments are explicitly set out in its Code of Ethics, and are also included in the Orange Supplier Code of Conduct (1) .\n\nOrange thus asserts its commitment to respecting and promoting fundamental human rights in its activities and sphere of influence. It  also  confirms  its  commitment  to  ensuring  that  these  rights are respected by each of its employees and leadership, both internally through employee relations (see Section 4.3.1.2.5 Social dialogue), and in its relationships with its partners, suppliers and subcontractors (see Section 4.3.2.2.3 Supplier Code of Conduct), and customers (see Section 4.3.3.2 Data security and personal data protection, section 4.3.3.3.2 Responsible use of digital technology, section 4.3.3.5.1 Ethical and responsible artificial intelligence).\n\nSince 2017, the French law on the duty of vigilance has reinforced this framework, giving all the consolidated entities making up the Group a regulatory framework that strengthens its vigilance. This law also allows them to fine-tune their risk identification process, as well as manage and roll out their action plans on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout their value chain. Since then, Orange has published its Vigilance Plan and a report on its implementation every year (2) .\n\nLastly, Orange is subject to UK law on modern slavery (3) and as such publishes an annual statement describing the Group's actions to combat modern slavery and human trafficking within its business and supply chain.\n\nRooted  in  its  values,  Orange  long-standing  principles  and commitments to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms are part of an approach that combines compliance with laws and regulations,  risks  (reputational  risks)  and  opportunities  (brand valuation and differentiation in calls for tender, access to public contracts, employer attractiveness, etc.).\n\nThis section deals specifically with the Group's commitments and actions with regard to freedom of expression, information and privacy.\n\nAs part of its declaration of continued support for the Ten Principles of  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact,  Orange  identifies,  in particular, freedom of expression, freedom of information and protection of privacy as part of its responsibility to respect the human rights of the users of its products and services.\n\nAs a telecommunication operator, Orange also considers it is its responsibility to ensure that human rights are respected at all times when using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), with reference to Articles 12, 19 and 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (arbitrary interference, freedom of opinion and expression, rights and freedoms of others).\n\nOrange's Vigilance Plan explicitly addresses issues of interference with freedom of expression, information (in civil society) and invasion of privacy (see Section 2.2.3.5 Plan vigilance 2024).\n\n## Participation in the Global Network Initiative\n\nThe implementation of Orange's commitment to the promotion of freedom of expression and respect for privacy in the performance of its activities as a telecommunication operator is guided by its participation in the Global Network Initiative (GNI). In March 2017, along with a number of operators and equipment suppliers from the Telecom Industry Dialogue (TID) group, Orange joined the GNI (4) , of which it is now a member of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  GNI  is  a  platform  that  promotes  respect  for  freedom of  expression  and  privacy  rights  in  the  face  of  government demands  to  hand  over  user  data,  remove  content  or  restrict communications, all against the backdrop of an ever-changing geopolitical, technological, political and regulatory landscape. At end-December 2023, it was made up of 17 major global digital technology  companies,  25 universities,  38 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and 10 investors.\n\nThe GNI Principles (5) are a reference framework for the development and implementation, within Orange, of policies and processes related to freedom of expression and privacy in its activities as a telecommunication operator. These Principles are based on universally recognized human rights laws and standards, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).\n\nAccordingly, Orange strives to:\n\n- -respect and work to protect users' freedom of expression by seeking to avoid or minimize the impact of government restrictions on freedom of expression;\n- -respect  and  work  to  protect  the  privacy  rights  of  users subject to government requirements, laws and regulations that may compromise privacy in a manner inconsistent with internationally recognized laws and standards;\n- -identify  circumstances  where  freedom  of  expression  and privacy  may  be  either  compromised  or  promoted  and,  in such circumstances, integrate these Guiding Principles into decision-making;\n- -give  precedence  to  employee  safety  over  the  previous principles.\n\nTo apply these principles, Orange has conducted an annual risk assessment since 2012 in all the countries where it operates, and has rolled out a system applicable to each event resulting from a government request in order to ensure that the request is justified under local law (that it comes from a government department with the authority to make such request), in compliance with international laws. In addition, Orange issues a judgment on the proportionality of the request.\n\n## Human rights impact assessment and remediation\n\nOrange uses the countries analyses of Verisk Maplecroft (6) , a specialist external firm using a methodology based on United Nations and OECD standards, to prepare a customized assessment of the risk incurred in terms of respect for human rights in each of the countries where Orange is an operator. Orange determines more precisely the criteria corresponding to its assessment of the human rights risks incurred as a result of its activities and geographies. As such, 14 dimensions of human rights are considered in the form of risk criticality indexes to provide an aggregate rating, country",

        "page_content": "by country. These dimensions were redefined in 2022 to ensure balanced coverage of the three areas, namely:\n\n- -degree of democracy, including government stability and the degree of democratic governance, independent judiciary, rights of minorities (35.7%);\n- -basic rights of workers, including the absence of forced labor and child labor, anti-discrimination, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, protection of women (35.7%);\n- -the business climate for Orange, including business ethics, freedom of opinion and expression, right to privacy, digital access (28.6%).\n\nThe 2023 human rights impact assessment carried out for the entire Orange operator scope, using scores assigned by specialist firm Verisk Maplecroft to the three areas of democracy, workers' rights and business climate, showed that some areas in which Orange is present require sustained attention in terms of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. These countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. In total, 412 people are directly employed by Orange in these two countries, serving 14 million customers. The firm also determined that 13 other countries in the Africa & Middle East region require special attention in terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nIn total, 19,635 people are directly employed by Orange in these countries (1) , serving more than 138 million customers.\n\nIn order to fully exercise its power to oppose any unjustified request to interrupt service or requisition data, Orange also verifies the latest legal provisions allowing the authorities to request network cuts, service reductions or communication interceptions, particularly before elections are held. In fact, requests for service interruption from governments are increasingly concurrent with the electoral process (in the run-up to an election and during the election itself, including the counting period).\n\nTo  prevent  this  risk,  Orange  activates  pre-crisis  units,  jointly coordinated by the MEA region Security and Business Continuity Departments, which are operational from the pre-election periods until  the  results  are  announced.  With  the  involvement  of  the subsidiaries concerned and the support of the Group Security Department, they verify the implementation of procedures enabling employees  to  continue  their  essential  activities  in  complete safety. Despite striving for constant dialogue with the authorities, Orange is indeed sometimes prompted, in liaison with the GNI and non-governmental organizations, to challenge opinions on discriminatory behavior or behavior that undermines respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Orange may receive several different and simultaneous requests from the authorities: throttling, limit access to certain social networks and interrupt various categories of telecommunication services.\n\n## Targets and measures\n\nOver 2023, Orange received requests for service alteration or interruption that complied with the local legal procedures in force in two countries where it operates. Orange handled these incidents in accordance with GNI principles.\n\n| Monitoring indicator                                                                       |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of countries from which  requests for service alteration  or interruption originate |      2 |      1 |      4 |\n\nLike  other  GNI  member  companies,  Orange  is  regularly  and independently assessed on its progress in implementing the GNI principles. The aim of the assessment is to enable the GNI's Board of Directors to determine whether each member company is making good faith efforts to implement its principles as part of a continuous improvement approach.\n\nThe independent assessment includes both an examination of the company's processes (systems, policies and procedures) and a review of specific case studies. The findings of the assessment are published in a GNI Public Assessment Report (2) , the 2021-2022 edition of which was published in October 2023. For Orange, the report highlights the quality of the actions taken by the Group, in particular the roll-out of a specific policy for 'major events' concerning freedom of expression, which needs to be expanded to include other cases.\n\n## Promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nIn addition to strict compliance with the GNI's principles, Orange is actively involved in promoting human rights within its sphere of influence through various collective initiatives. Accordingly, in 2023, Orange:\n\n- -actively participated in the GNI 2023 Annual Learning Forum and spoke on the impact of future European regulations (AI Act, DSA, CS3D) in terms of human rights obligations, risks and opportunities;\n- -undertook  an  initiative  to  share  good  practices  between companies on these issues as part of its participation in the French  association,  EDH  (Entreprises  pour  les  Droits  de l'Homme - Businesses for Human Rights). In 2023, Orange took part in a working group that identified and grouped existing and potential indicators, based on the CSRD's Social ESRS.\n\n## Orange's commitment to the non-discriminatory use of its services\n\nOrange's strategic plan, Lead the future, makes trust a major focus of the Group's policy. Trust is expressed in several ways with regard to the responsible and non-discriminatory use of its services.\n\nIn  particular,  Orange  acts  within  the  framework  of  European Regulation 2015-2120 laying down measures concerning open Internet access, in which the non-discriminatory routing of traffic is a fundamental principle. As an operator, Orange supports the general principles of net neutrality (no discriminatory blocking or degradation of traffic, transparency of network management rules for consumers and regulators) in order to guarantee an open and unrestricted Internet, allowing users to freely choose the services and content they find interesting under conditions of comparable quality. Orange operates its networks in such a way as to guarantee their integrity, the security of communications and the management of different types of traffic according to end needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n- 4",

This service strategy is backed by offers that are secure, easy to understand, transparent and tailored to the needs of each individual; networks offering a quality of service tailored to the needs of each user; and high-quality customer relations, a key differentiator for Orange, combining digital and physical channels to ensure smooth relations across all the Group's geographical regions. The customer experience indicator is one of the indicators used to calculate the variable annual compensation of Corporate Officers (see Section 5.4.1.2 Amount of compensation paid or allocated to Corporate Officers for 2023).\n\nThe customer experience strategy is based on innovation enhanced by artificial intelligence, and puts listening to what the customer has to say at its core.\n\nTo drive customer experience performance and identify strengths and opportunities for improvement, Orange bases its analysis on four pillars:\n\n- -offers, services & network experience: understanding how offers, service and the network impact the customer experience and brand loyalty;\n- -points  of  contact:  identifying  how  customers  interact  with Orange in stores or remotely;\n- -efficient experience: improving the ease and speed with which customer needs are met;\n- -responsible experience: analyzing how the brand embodies social and environmental values and how it bolsters customer trust.\n\n## Customer experience governance\n\nOrange serves two main types of customers: individuals (B2C) and businesses (B2B). Whatever the customer type, the customer experience is a major lever for building the Orange brand.\n\nIn  the  B2C  market,  the  customer  experience  is  managed by  a  dedicated  department,  the  Customer  eXperience  and Operations (CXO) department, which in turn reports to the Group Communications department, responsible for the Orange brand policy. CXO is a cross-cutting entity that works with the entity in charge of the MEA customer experience (for the 17 countries that market Orange-branded products and services, excluding Mauritius Telecom), the entity in charge of the Europe region (seven countries), and with Orange France. In addition, each subsidiary has a local customer experience department.\n\nIts main missions are to define, along with all subsidiaries, the B2C customer experience strategy, in line with the standards of  a  leading  brand;  to  produce  tools  for  analyzing  Orange's performance in the experience it delivers to its customers across all interaction channels; and to support countries in the operational implementation of the strategy.\n\nIn the B2B market, the customer experience is managed by Orange Business, the Orange division in charge of the B2B market. It is a cross-cutting entity that collaborates with all Group countries and with CXO, the entity in charge of customer experience in the B2C market.\n\n## Strategic customer experience country reviews (CX Reviews)\n\nIn the B2C market, Orange has set up annual reviews between the CXO department and the CEO and COO of each country to strengthen the Orange brand values in its customer experience component, share the Group's vision of the country's customer experience performance, and identify improvement projects and solutions based on the relevant best practices shared.\n\nCX Reviews take stock of the health of a country's customer experience on an annual basis. They are based on data from a  common  dashboard  (CX  Tracker),  as  well  as  on  studies, benchmarks and data on a country's operational performance and customer experience in the field of customer relations. Their aim is to make recommendations to improve the customer experience in a given country. The aim is to provide a global, cross-cutting vision to better help countries address their operational and customer experience challenges.\n\n## CX Quarterly Business Reviews\n\nCX Reviews recommendations are followed up on through quarterly meetings (CX Quarterly Business Reviews), which allow action plans to be managed alongside the Customer Experience Directors in each country. To this end CXO uses dashboards to analyze the positioning of its entities in the various dimensions of the customer experience. By sharing best practices, it coordinates communities of customer experience, customer relations, digital and Orange country store managers, around key subjects such as the use of artificial intelligence, continuous improvement, the customer journey, etc.\n\n## Customer relations policies\n\nCustomer relations are a major pillar of the customer experience, after offers and networks, and Orange strives to differentiate itself through customer relations on all channels. Today, its backbone is made up of all the digital channels available to customers, giving them the option of always speaking to a human or coming into a store.\n\nChatbots are a lever in customer relations. They are written or vocal means of communication that can be positioned across all channels, and allow customer requests to be handled end-to-end, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Over the past four years, Orange has developed text and voice bots, which now account for 65% of conversational interactions with Orange. Chatbots are available in all European countries and in 12 countries in Africa & Middle East. Voice bots are available in three European countries: France, Poland and Romania.\n\nTheir performance relies on development of artificial intelligence.\n\nOrange  is  currently  stepping  up  its  development  of  artificial intelligence for customer relations. Orange is investing in Generative AI and is taking concrete action in three areas:\n\n- -augmented agents: these are conversational bots dedicated to customer advisors, which rely on summaries and search for answers in knowledge bases;\n- -augmented customers: this involves providing customers with an intelligent virtual assistant;\n- -quality management with near-real-time monitoring enabled by artificial intelligence.",

        "page_content": "## B2C customer interaction channels\n\nWhether for commercial or support purposes, customer relations are structured around a variety of interaction channels: customer service,  digital  channels  (Orange  website,  My Orange  mobile app, etc.), stores and home installation.\n\nOrange's ambition is to increase the proportion of digital interactions with its customers, with a dual objective: to allow them to carry out simple processes completely independently, with the digital channel being ideal for this type of interaction; and to satisfy them as quickly as possible, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In addition, for more complex processes, Orange still offers its customers the option of speaking to a human if they so wish.\n\n## Customer service\n\nCustomers can contact Orange by phone, chat or messaging. Customer Service mainly provides support to customers when they express a need (90% support actions vs. 10% commercial actions).\n\nCustomer  Service  is  mostly  outsourced.  To  manage  its partners,  Orange  organizes  annual  business  reviews  with  the management teams of the four main customer relations partners (Teleperformance,  Majorel,  Foundever  and  Webhelp),  with  the participation of its Customer Services directors. These reviews provide an opportunity to analyze partner performance (KPIs, country satisfaction surveys, etc.), share strategic visions, take stock of actions, and share best practices.\n\nThese partners have been selected as part of calls for tender, in part on the basis of quality of life and working conditions for their employees.  The  framework  agreements  entered  into  Orange's corporate CSR clause, which sets out the Group's respect for human rights requirements. Business reviews are followed up on throughout the year by the Operating Departments, whose project managers regularly visit sites to carry out operational monitoring of quality, processes, etc., and have many opportunities to interact with the teams. CXO also conducts on-site audits of partners, focusing on the management of operational performance and all their processes and operating methods (recruitment, training, skills development, quality monitoring, etc.). Deviations from Orange's requirements are the subject of corrective improvement plans, which are also monitored. In addition to the Group's whistleblowing system, which guarantees protection for whistleblowers, these major  partners  have  also  implemented  anonymous  reporting procedures. Orange's partner management is explained in greater detail in Section 4.3.2 Workers in the value chain.\n\n## Digital channels\n\nOrange has continued to develop its websites and apps to offer its customers even broader functional coverage, allow them to complete tasks independently if they so wish.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, 39.7 million customers (1) used My Orange (Group total), an increase of +17% compared to 2022.\n\nEfforts in this area are also focused on the increased use of artificial intelligence to streamline customer relations: personalization of the customer home page according to profile and usage; more targeted human contact for purchase advice (referral to the right department, the right skill); or even the introduction of targeted offers according to customers, their needs and their appetite.\n\n## Stores\n\nStores  handle  sales  (60%)  and  can  also  provide  support  to customers who prefer physical contact for after-sales services (40%).\n\nAt end-2023, there was a total of 4,859 points of sale, including 2,617 in Europe and France, and 2,242 in the MEA region. The number of stores was practically unchanged overall compared with 2022, with a decline in Europe and slight growth in the MEA region.\n\nThe  Smart  Store  is  Orange's  point-of-sale  concept  and  the embodiment  of  the  brand  experience,  with  an  emphasis  on customer support and advice. This concept is now widespread, and roll-out is nearing completion (the concept will be 10 years old in 2025). In 2023 in Europe, 70% of stores were converted to Smart Stores (compared with 65% in 2022). As such, the total number of stores converted to Smart Stores in 2023 was 1,830 in Europe (including France) and 186 in the MEA region.\n\n## B2C complaint channels\n\nOrange offers customers the option to make a complaint via a variety of channels (customer service, stores, My Orange app, website, etc.). For over 10 years, Orange has been working to steadily reduce the root causes of customer service complaints.\n\nThe reasons for customer contact and complaints are tracked and monitored on a quarterly basis for each subsidiary. Work is then carried out with each country to identify the causes of complaints and prevent their recurrence. For example, if a complaint regards a misunderstanding on a bill, Orange works to improve its readability and communication. Capitalizing on and sharing best practices in a given country help to nurture and facilitate the necessary changes.\n\nIn France, in addition to complaints procedures, Orange offers its customers the possibility of referring to the M\u00e9diateur des communications  \u00e9lectroniques  (Electronic  Communications Ombudsman) in the event of a disagreement, after resorting to all the internal services at their disposal. The Ombudsman is an independent third party whose role is to help the parties reach an agreement.\n\nIn all the countries in which the Group operates, the principle of believing the customer as a first step prevails.\n\n## Customer relations management dedicated to Enterprise customers\n\nEnterprise customers are classified into three market segments: 'Sohos' (Professionals), which include companies with up to nine employees; 'SMEs' with between 10 and 150/250 employees; and Key Accounts with more than 150/250 employees.\n\nIn  terms  of  customer  experience,  Sohos  are  managed  in  the same way as the B2C as they have very similar needs, both in terms of offers and customer relations. However, most of the time, they benefit from different treatment: separate number to call, prioritization for problem resolution.\n\nSMEs, and especially Key Accounts, benefit from dedicated teams who know their specific needs and propose special offers. These customers have access to a customized digital customer space from which they can manage all their contracts, invoices and fleet (of mobile phones, fixed lines, and IT&IS solutions) directly and independently. Furthermore, if they need to speak to a human, a dedicated advisor is at their disposal, and can be reached by email or telephone on a personalized number. In addition to these personalized customer relations, Orange ensures their needs are met in the shortest possible time, offering them the best possible service and maximizing their satisfaction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

It  is  a  worldwide  benchmark standard for managing and steering customer relations, focused on operational excellence. It helps improve customer satisfaction and monitor service quality. This standard addresses all aspects of a customer-centric operation, - from good metrics and solid processes to the right people and the right skills and knowledge to get the job done - while actively listening to the customer at every stage.\n\nThis approach also guarantees common language for Orange subsidiaries. Also used by other major brands around the world, it gives Orange access to the best practices and high-performance benchmarks.\n\nOrange began its performance management program using the COPC standard in 2011, with the first country certifications taking place in 2013. In 2023, 13 countries were certified: four in Europe (Moldova, Poland, Romania and Spain) and nine in the MEA region (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Egypt, Guinea, Jordan, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritius, Senegal and Tunisia).\n\n## KPIs and measures\n\n## Customer experience data collection and analysis (CX Tracker)\n\nThe CX Tracker collects and analyzes customer experience data. It measures customer relations on a quarterly basis, based on a representative sample of 100,000 B2C customers from all operators, offering Orange a vision of market positioning with a supranational scope. It is carried out in conjunction with KANTAR, which is also responsible for Orange's brand tracking tool (Brand Tracker). The Africa CX Tracker is carried out every two months, based on a sample of 130,000 customers. It is carried out by IPSOS.\n\nThe CX Tracker measures and reports the recommendation score (Net Promoter Score - NPS and Mean Recommendation Score MRS) of Orange and its main competitors. It also allows Orange to track the evolution of customer satisfaction on the main levers and attributes of the customer experience, and to identify areas for improvement.\n\nThe analysis grid includes criteria relating to value for money for different types of services; service quality criteria linked to the fixed and mobile network; customer relations such as ease of use, customized relations, response to needs, keeping promises, recognition of loyalty, etc. It also includes criteria for measuring trust and security in terms of personal data protection, and for measuring the relevance of Orange's responses to digital inclusion and respect for the environment, notably through recycling, refurbishing or repairing of equipment.\n\n## Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n\nOrange uses a common metric, the Net Promoter Score (NPS), to measure customer satisfaction across all its markets.\n\nThe calculation methodology changed in 2023. It is calculated every six months and is measured on the basis of a single generic question customers are asked in surveys: 'Would you recommend Orange to a friend or family member?'. Respondents rate their agreement with the question on a scale of 0 to 10, which makes it possible to identify promoters (score of 9-10), passives (score of\n\n7-8), and detractors (score of 0-6). The NPS is then calculated as the difference between the percentage of promoters and detractors. The score therefore ranges from -100 to 100.\n\nOrange has set itself the target of becoming the leader - or on par in customer satisfaction (NPS) in two-third (66%) of its geographical regions by 2025. In 2023, 60% or 15/25 of the countries in which it operates were NPS leaders or on par.\n\n## Customer relationship KPIs\n\nOrange measures the proportion of support actions as well as sales actions performed on digital channels in Orange's eight European countries. The KPIs are calculated quarterly.\n\n|                                                         | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Percentage of support actions  on digital channels  (1) | 67%    | 64%    |\n| Percentage of sales actions  on digital channels  (2)   | 24%    | 24%    |\n\n- (2) Annual four-quarter average.\n\nOrange also monitors indicators of the effectiveness of its customer interaction systems, such as first call resolution and customer effort score:\n\n- -First Call Resolution: This is Orange's ability to respond to customers' needs the first time they call Customer Service. This KPI is calculated quarterly for the entire European region and France. However, as the methodology for calculating this indicator changed in 2023 to take into account the specific measurement characteristics of certain countries, the historical data for previous years is not provided. Nevertheless, the First Call Resolution rate remained stable and higher than the industry benchmark;\n- -Customer  Effort  Score:  This  makes  it  possible  to  follow the  customer's  journey  through  several  channels,  and  to measure the effort expended by the customer during this journey: streamlined, simple, fast, etc. It is measured through a perception question asked to customers and covers all journeys, whatever the channel and the reason for contact with Orange. This indicator was implemented in early 2023 in Romania, Poland and Slovakia, and is measured quarterly. Support work is underway to expand this measurement across Europe.\n\n|                                      | 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|\n| Proportion of First Call Resolution  |        |\n| (average for all European countries) | 84.9%  |\n| Customer Effort Score (average       |        |\n| for Romania, Poland and Slovakia)    | 88.6%  |\n\n## 4.3.3.8.2 Group whistleblowing system\n\nOrange has established Group whistleblowing system open to all Group employees, as well as to partners, suppliers and external stakeholders, allowing them to report events of concern.\n\nThe  system  is  described  in  detail  in  Section  4.4.2.4  Group whistleblowing system.",

In exercising its governance, Orange respects two key principles:\n\n- 1. the application of a Code of Corporate Governance: Orange has chosen the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code for listed companies (1) ;\n- 2. application of the principle of balanced gender representation: the Board of Directors currently has six women out of the 15 directors who sit on it.\n\nOrange  acts  transparently  by  publishing  detailed  information on its governance (2) , the composition of its Board of Directors (3) and its Internal Guidelines (4) , which detail its role in validating the Group's strategic guidelines, as well as the roles and missions of its three specialized committees (5) . The Group's ethics and compliance program is reviewed annually by the Audit Committee and the Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC). In 2023, these reviews took place on October 12 for the GCSERC and December 4 for the Audit Committee.\n\nOrange also publishes information on its Executive Committee (6) . In accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF code, the members of the Group's Board of Directors and Executive Committee complete an annual declaration of interests.\n\nAs part of its new companymodel, the Orange Executive Committee has defined 12 Group committees to assist it in its operations. Among  these  committees  is  the  CSR  and  Ethics  Committee, co-chaired by the Executive Director of Group Environmental and Societal Responsibility and the Group Secretary General, whose role is to monitor the implementation of the Group's CSR, Ethics and Compliance strategy, as well as to identify any red flags. Their duties include:\n\n- -approving the components of the CSR, Ethics and Compliance strategy;\n- -preparing any major matters to be submitted to the Executive Committee for its decision, monitoring the implementation of the CSR, Ethics and Compliance strategy, and alerting the Executive Committee to any deviations;\n- -proposing forward-looking topics to raise awareness among Executive Committee members.\n\n## 4.4.1.2 Operational  governance of business ethics\n\nGovernance established at several levels of the company helps control risks of ethical misconduct:\n\n- -at the level of Orange's Board of Directors, through the direct involvement of the specialized committees of the Groups' Board of Directors (Audit Committee and GCSERC);\n- -at the level of the Orange Executive Committee, in particular with the Group Investment Committee, in which the Group's Chief Compliance Officer participates, and the Risk Committee including  an  annual  Risk  Committee  meeting  devoted  to compliance, attended by the Chief Executive Officer;\n- -at the level of the CSR and Ethics Committee, responsible for monitoring implementation of the Group's CSR, Ethics and Compliance strategy.\n\nThe operational organization of risk management has several levels:\n\n- -the Group Compliance department, created by a decision of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2012, acts under the authority of the Group Chief Compliance Officer, who reports to the Orange Secretary General. This team is in charge of designing, rolling out, coordinating and controlling Group-wide compliance programs. It is made up of nine people;\n- -the Compliance network, composed of the Chief Compliance Officers (CCOs) of the Group's divisions and their Compliance Officers (COs) in the divisions and subsidiaries. The CCOs are appointed by the members of the Executive Committee and have, as needed, a network of COs reporting to them. They are responsible for coordinating and supervising the roll-out of compliance risk management programs in their scope;\n- -the network of Ethics Advisors, appointed by the members of the Executive Committee and the CEOs of the subsidiaries and responsible for driving the roll-out of the ethical approach to the teams.\n\nTo perform their work, these networks rely on the expertise and resources of the Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department (DACRG) and the Group Legal Department.\n\nThis compliance process is monitored as part of the Group's Internal Control system and by audits carried out by the Group Audit Department (IFACI certified). It is also reviewed by the Statutory Auditors as part of their audits of the control environment and the certification of the financial statements.\n\n- 4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The Code of Ethics describes the principles of action with respect to stakeholders and the principles of individual behavior that must guide the conduct of employees in their professional activities. These reflect the same fundamental principles as those set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,  as  well  as  by  bodies  such  as  the  International  Labor Organization (ILO) and the OECD and the commitments undertaken by Orange in terms of social responsibility. The implementation of this ethics approach is ensured by the network of Ethics Advisors.\n\nThe  compliance  approach  is  implemented  by  the  network  of CCOs and COs. It is based on the principle of zero tolerance with respect to corruption and influence peddling, formalized in a letter of commitment signed by all members of the Executive Committee.\n\nOrange applies a comprehensive approach to managing risks of unethical behavior (fraud, corruption and influence peddling, tax  avoidance  and  violations  of  business  ethics),  aimed  at continuous improvement and built around six steps: management commitment, governance, risk analysis, policies and procedures, awareness-raising and training, and controls.\n\nOrange incorporates its integrity approach into all its activities and, in particular, into its relations with stakeholders.\n\nThe ethics and compliance approaches are based on:\n\n- -strong political commitments supported by the Chief Executive Officer, with adaptations of the Group's Code of Ethics (the first version of which was adopted in 2003), the Supplier Code of Conduct, the Data and Artificial Intelligence Ethics Charter, and a Group anti-corruption policy and its principles (2) (with local adaptations where necessary);\n- -an analysis of the risks of ethical misconduct and an analysis of corruption and influence peddling risks as applied to the Group, subsidiaries and relevant entities in order to identify the major risks and target the actions to be implemented;\n- -Group policies and procedures adapted to local situations:\n- -an  anti-corruption  policy,  which  serves  as  a  Code  of Conduct  within  the  meaning  of  the  Sapin  2 law.  It  is rolled out and/or adapted throughout the Group and its subsidiaries,\n- -a  risk-based  third-party  fraud  and  compliance  due diligence procedure applied to B2B customers, partners and intermediaries; it is regularly updated and improved, and rolled out throughout the Group and its subsidiaries. This procedure is subject to 'project reviews,' which allow for its implementation to be precisely monitored and areas for improvement to be identified in each division or country, notably through targeted training,\n- -a compliance clause included in contracts and purchase orders,\n- -a  'Gifts  and  Invitations'  policy  governing  any  benefits received or offered; dedicated apps are being rolled out in order to track declarations and manager approvals of any overruns of the established limits;\n- -principles for preventing and managing conflicts of interest, with 'guiding principles' and the implementation of a reporting tool; these principles standardize practices for reporting and handling potential conflicts of interest;\n\n- -training  and  awareness-raising  programs  on  ethics  and the prevention of corruption, using videos and a range of self-learning content (e-learning, quizzes, etc.). Educational materials for in-person sessions are made available to the CCOs, COs and Ethics Advisors, so that they can organize training and awareness-raising initiatives in line with the needs of the entities and the risks identified. These initiatives are complemented by an annual 'Ethics & Compliance Day' event;\n- -regular control measures (internal audits, project reviews, etc.) to assess the efficiency of the measures implemented and to identify areas for improvement;\n- -the  whistleblowing  system  described  below  and  local whistleblowing systems, which are monitored annually.\n\n## 4.4.2.2 Prevention and detection of corruption and influence peddling\n\nThe prevention and detection of corruption is part of the Group's Ethics and Compliance approach. In addition, in the early 2000s, Orange implemented a Group-wide corruption prevention program to prevent cases of corruption and to handle related allegations, in order to comply with various regulations, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and the French 'Sapin 2' law.\n\n## 4.4.2.3 Compliance with economic sanction programs\n\nIn 2013, the Group adopted a Group-wide economic sanctions policy, which was updated and reinforced in 2022 (3) , in order to secure its business and international development. The Group remains vigilant in the face of a changing environment and the existence of numerous, evolving economic sanctions programs and embargoes, and in particular carries out compliance due diligence on its relations with partners, suppliers and customers.\n\nAn  economic  sanctions  committee  analyzes  changes  in  the international regulations to which the Group is subject, adjusts the internal system in place accordingly, and oversees reviews aimed at assessing the Group's exposure to this risk.\n\nThe year 2023 was marked in particular by the strengthening of economic sanctions and export controls enacted by the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom against Russia and  Belarus,  and  by  the  simultaneous  reinforcement  of  the associated compliance action plans.\n\n## 4.4.2.4 Group whistleblowing system\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  French  'Sapin  2,'  'duty  of  vigilance,' and 'Waserman' laws (the latter transposing into French law the European  directive  on  protection  for  whistleblowers),  Orange has  established  a  Group  whistleblowing  system (4) open  to  all Group employees, as well as to partners, suppliers and external stakeholders.  This  system  allows  them  to  report  conduct  or situations that go against the Group's anti-corruption policy, Code of Ethics, or policies and procedures relating to accounting, internal control and auditing, that are in clear and serious violation of laws or regulations, or that seriously infringe human rights and fundamental freedoms, the health and safety of individuals or the environment.\n\nSince  June 2021,  the  external  report-collection  platform  has replaced the historical email address of the Group whistleblowing system. This secure web platform is accessible from orange.com, the Group's Intranets and search engines.",

This will also be the case for Soft at Home, Viacess-Orca and TOTEM i n 2024.\n\nEmployees  are  regularly  provided  information  on  Group  and local  whistleblowing  systems  through  training  courses  and communication campaigns (emails, Intranet, site posters, etc.).\n\nReports  are  processed  according  to  Group  and  subsidiary procedures: acknowledgment of receipt, review of the admissibility of the report and processing by authorized teams while respecting the confidentiality of the whistleblower's identity and the people concerned throughout the process.\n\n## Breakdown of whistleblowing alerts by domain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.4.2.5 Awareness-raising and training system\n\nThis system is made up of various components:\n\n- -corruption-prevention training tools and materials, extensively renewed since 2018, which have boosted training actions in 2023 (see Section 4.3.3.2.3 Group policy and action plans on data security and personal data protection), as well as training materials for teams and managers on the ethics of customer relations (guide, videos, quizzes, documents);\n- -recommendations on sensitive functions or areas, to guide Compliance Officers in identifying the people most exposed to risk so as to give them priority during training;\n\n- 4\n\nThe whistleblowing procedure provides protection for individuals who meet the legal definition of whistleblowers, in accordance with legal and regulatory provisions: Orange undertakes to ensure that no employee will be punished, dismissed or subjected to any discriminatory measure, whether direct or indirect, for having, in a disinterested manner and in good faith, reported facts of which they have personal knowledge. Orange also undertakes to ensure that the procedures implemented to collect reports guarantee that the identity of the author of the report and the information collected through the whistleblowing system remain strictly confidential.\n\nOrange has a specialized team which, at the request of management and/or compliance, carries out internal investigations in the event of a justified report or suspicion of fraud or corruption.\n\n2023 saw an increase of almost 45% in the number of alerts received on Hello Ethics (264 in 2023) and of more than 50% in the number of questions received (82 in 2023).\n\n## Distribution of alerts by entity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -presentations  given  by  the  Director  of  Compliance  and members of the Compliance team to the management teams and the Compliance teams of several entities, including in the MEA region;\n- -the 11th Ethics & Compliance Day, which gave rise to numerous actions organized locally by CCOs, COs and Ethics Advisors in divisions and countries, such as video messages or emails from  CEOs  or  CCOs,  training  sessions,  posters,  games, competitions, discussions and debates with internal or external experts; the conference organized at the Orange headquarters was broadcast live throughout the Group for the second time and dubbed in English and Polish; the recording is available online  for  educational  purposes  on  the  Group's  internal websites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Since 2022, the training courses have been enriched with the 'Prevention and detection of corruption risk' module. These training modules are available in several of the Group's languages.\n\n## 4.4.2.6 Competition law compliance policy\n\nOrange establishes its commercial policy in compliance with the legal and regulatory obligations in force in the countries where the various Group entities operate.\n\nOrange is implementing a proactive policy of compliance with competition law, which aims to meet the relevant expectations and guiding principles defined by the competition authorities. As such, compliance with the principle of fair competition in the conduct of all of Orange's business is included in the Group's Code of Ethics.\n\nThis policy of compliance with competition rules is built around the actions of the Group Legal Department, which works to raise awareness of competition rules among all Group entities and also provides advice to those with particular exposure to the risks.\n\nThe  Group  has  developed  a  program  to  raise  awareness  of competition rules which incorporates various training and support tools specific to the issues Orange faces on its markets. This program capitalizes on the high degree of integration and close involvement of the General Secretariat's legal and regulatory teams with all of the operational entities. The Group Legal Department is present or represented at all levels of the company's decision-making across all of its geographic markets.\n\nAmong  the  various  training  and  awareness-raising  tools,  all Group employees have access to a minimum knowledge base in competition law, particularly through the 'Antitrust for All' training course, which is available on the Group's training portal (Orange Learning).\n\nThis general training course aims to raise awareness among all Group employees of:\n\n- -the existence, purpose and content of Orange's program for compliance with competition rules;\n- -the meaning of competition rules and their practical scope;\n- -the importance and benefits of complying with these rules in the conduct of their business;\n- -the internal mechanisms that can be used to obtain advice or raise any questions or uncertainties about compliance with these rules.\n\nThe Group Legal Department is also implementing an annual training course for all of the Group's attorneys ('Antitrust Academy for Legal' program) to ensure top-level support for all the operational entities they assist. This broad approach is supplemented by the direct involvement of the Group Legal Department, which makes sure the program is consistent and stays up to date with competition rules.\n\nNot all categories of employees will necessarily receive the same levels of information, and each level is adjusted to the entities in question. Some training courses are thus intended specifically for  certain  operational  entities  that  are  particularly  exposed (wholesale, technical & networks, sales teams, etc.). Accordingly, a catalog that compiles the specific training courses, guidelines and documentation, categorized by business line or business scope, is made available by the Legal Department team on the Group's Intranet, and is updated regularly.\n\nThe Group Legal Department is the primary and central channel for receiving alerts on any anti-competitive practices that may be detected by the operational entities or by the local legal departments that support them.\n\nOutside of this direct channel, all Orange employees have access to a Group whistleblowing system, implemented by the Group Compliance Department (for alerts on conduct or situations that go against Orange's anti-corruption policy, Code of Ethics, or policies and procedures relating to accounting, internal control and auditing, or that are in clear and serious violation of laws or regulations) and by the Group Environmental and Social Responsibility Department (for alerts relating to serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, personal health and safety, or the environment) in full compliance with laws and regulations. If competition law alerts are reported through this channel, the Group Compliance Department, which  reports  to  the  General  Secretariat  as  does  the  Legal Department, takes the matter directly to the latter to ensure full and necessary compliance.\n\nIn all other geographies, Group teams regularly communicate on the rules and processes to be implemented, and support local teams to ensure the same level of compliance.\n\n## 4.4.2.7 Ta x  policy\n\nOwing to its business, Orange has assets and employees in a number of countries. Orange pays taxes and duties in the countries in which it operates in accordance with the laws of each of those countries. Orange publishes information relating to operating taxes and levies payables in Note 10 Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements annex, including information on the breakdown of taxes payable by geographical region or by tax consolidation group over three fiscal years (see Section 3.3 Consolidated Financial Statements), and in its annual Tax Transparency Report (1) .\n\nThe Group's approach to tax matters is based on three fundamental principles:\n\n- -comply with the laws of each country;\n- -comply with the OECD principles: Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations;\n- -regularly assess practices and compare them with existing solutions in the market to ensure their relevance.\n\nOrange in no way seeks to avoid paying taxes and duties, including through complex and opaque structures. Orange publishes the list of countries in which the Group has interests in its Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe  Group  Tax  Director,  who  reports  directly  to  the  Chief Executive Officer Finance, Performance and Development, has a dedicated team. The Group has drawn up a Code of Ethics for Tax Professionals that applies to all Group tax specialists and concerns all tax operations. The Code states that 'the Orange group's tax specialists may propose the tax options most favorable to the Orange group, knowing that their proposals must be made based on an analysis that is professional, honest, objective and lawful.'",

This control process covers Orange SA and its main subsidiaries. The work conducted by Orange and the independent assessment\n\n- 4\n\nof the Statutory Auditors both resulted in satisfactory conclusions for the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nThanks to the tax policy described above, Orange has not identified any risk of tax avoidance likely to create risks for the Group's operations or reputation.\n\n## 4.4.3 Political influence and lobbying activities\n\nFor the organization of activities representing its interests, Orange's General  Management  has  mandated  the  Group's  Secretary General, who is also Secretary of the Board of Directors, to lead lobbying activities; when necessary, this may be carried out at the country subsidiary level through their CEOs, in close coordination with the General Secretariat.\n\nThe principles of this activity are set out in Orange's guidelines on the prevention of corruption, which stipulate that 'the Orange group lobbying representative, who is in charge of following up and anticipating public policies that are likely to affect the Group's activities and of raising the awareness of public authorities on the challenges and issues faced by the company, embodies the principles defined in the Orange group Code of Ethics (1) .'\n\nThose who perform interest representation activities for the Group are clearly identified by Group governance and by their titles; in particular, they guarantee:\n\n- -transparency, by disclosing their identity and the interests defended;\n- -compliance with business ethics, by refraining from taking any steps to obtain information or decisions by fraudulent means;\n- -guaranteed quality and reliability of the information provided to public authorities, without political exclusivity; and\n- -responses to any request for information.\n\nIn addition, Orange does not donate to political parties, and prohibits any direct or indirect company contribution (cash, valuables, goods or services, loans, loan guarantees) to political parties. Similarly, the Group's representation activities forbid any political statements on behalf of the company. These individuals accordingly act in compliance with the Code of Conduct for Interest Representatives before European bodies, and in particular:\n\n- -in France, Orange acts transparently in its lobbying activities and has been registered since its founding with the High Authority for Transparency in Public Life (HATVP (2) ), in compliance with the provisions of Article 25 of Law 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 on transparency, the fight against corruption, and the modernization of economic life (known as Sapin 2) governing its relationships with national public decision-makers. Since 2023,  when  the  register  was  expanded  to  include  local decision-makers in particular, Orange has also been reporting representation activities concerning them;\n- -Orange is also listed in the European Union Transparency Register (3) , and complies with all its obligations.\n\nNo  other  country  where  Orange  operates  has  a  framework comparable to that of France, with its HATVP or European register.\n\nThe Group's positions are well known (4) , both due to their public nature at parliamentary hearings and press appearances, and through its publication of position papers for the European Union since 2014 or posts on social networks. Likewise in France, they are detailed in a directory that highlights the purpose of the position and the individuals met (5) .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The label is awarded for three years, subject to successful completion of the annual interim assessments. The first interim assessment was completed in 2023. In 2022, GPS also underwent an ISO 20400 maturity assessment and was awarded the 'significant' level (third level out of four). The label is a vehicle for progress and performance, aimed at developing lasting, trust-based, balanced relationships between customers and suppliers.\n\nMore specifically, through the 15 criteria under the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) method, it covers:\n\n- -responsible purchasing commitments and their alignment with Group policy and strategy;\n- -responsible sourcing in these processes and practices;\n- -the vocational training of buyers;\n- -supplier relations (compliance with contractual law and balance, mediation, supplier reviews, etc.).\n\nResponsible sourcing encompasses  several dimensions, including: fairness of the purchasing process; CSR specifications and performance in all aspects of respect for human rights and the environment; the circular economy; and inclusive purchasing. It aims to control financial and compliance risks, as well as CSR issues, including economic dependence and respect for financial equity. This entails:\n\n- -compliance with payment deadlines in accordance with the French Economic Modernization Law (loi de modernisation de l'\u00e9conomie - LME);\n- -advance supplier payment (ASP) for SMEs/VSEs - formerly known as collaborative reverse factoring - which consists of a collaborative and responsible short-term financing program set up by the ordering party (buyer) to support its suppliers' cash flow by paying invoices in advance through a factoring company;\n- -reduced payment periods for innovative SMEs and start-ups under experimentation contracts;\n- -taking the region into account whenever possible;\n- -the use of mediation to resolve any disputes.\n\n## 4.4.4.2 Inclusive purchasing in France\n\nIn October 2023, Orange signed the manifesto of the Collective for a More Inclusive Economy (Collectif des entreprises pour une \u00e9conomie plus inclusive). The signatory companies collectively committed to increasing their inclusive purchasing by 30% by 2025.\n\nOrange  purchases  from  nearly  300 inclusive  suppliers,  for  a purchase amount of 20 million euros in 2023, an increase of 20% compared to 2022, or its pre-health crisis level. While the basis of Orange's inclusive purchasing remains the cleaning of premises and the upkeep of green spaces, network services are on the increase, notably with the maintenance of the fiber network.\n\nLaunched in 2022, the 'Financial Performance and Social Inclusion' training course on inclusive purchasing had been taken by 60% of buyers from the Purchasing Department in France by the end of October 2023.\n\n## 4.4.4.3 Non-use of minerals from conflict areas\n\nOrange recognizes the legitimacy of concerns about sourcing materials from regions plagued by political and social conflict, and is striving to use a socially responsible supply chain. However, the supply chain for these minerals is long and complex and involves many stakeholders. Orange does not purchase minerals directly, and requires its main suppliers to perform due diligence to avoid using minerals that may directly or indirectly finance armed groups. As such, Orange contractually requires its suppliers to ensure that they themselves do not use minerals from these areas through three different levers, namely: the Supplier Code of Conduct, which is appended to all purchasing contracts; the equipment-specific CSR annex, which is of a more restrictive nature and is appended to all equipment purchasing contracts; and lastly the CSR clause appearing in purchasing contracts, which involves suppliers signing 'Orange's Responsible Purchasing Commitments.'\n\nIn addition, Orange's main electrical and electronic equipment suppliers adhere to the RBA (Responsible Business Alliance (1) ) Code of Conduct, which includes a commitment to policy and due diligence on the sourcing and traceability of tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in the products they manufacture in order to ensure they are committed to sourcing in a manner consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, or an equivalent and recognized due diligence framework.\n\nOf  the  Orange  top  150 suppliers,  which  represented  70%  of purchases  in  2023,  there  were  25 electrical  and  electronic equipment manufacturers potentially affected by the presence of materials that might have originated from conflict areas. Of these 25 suppliers, 19 are signatories to the RBA. These 19 suppliers accounted  for  96%  of  the  Group's  electrical  and  electronic equipment expenditure in 2023.\n\nSupplier assessments by EcoVadis consider the issue of non-use of minerals from conflict areas. The same applies to the audits carried out by the JAC, especially those carried out on site, which have a checkpoint on the procedure to ensure the traceability of minerals. Non-compliance on this point triggers corrective actions and their follow-up.",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\nYear ended December 31st 2023\n\nTo the annual general meeting,\n\nIn our capacity as Statutory Auditor of your company. (hereinafter the 'Entity') appointed as independent third party, and accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (COFRAC) under number 3-1884 (1) , we have undertaken a limited assurance engagement on the historical information (observed or extrapolated) in the consolidated  non-financial  statement,  prepared  in  accordance with the entity's procedures (hereinafter the 'Guidelines'), for the year ended December 31st, 2023 (hereinafter, the 'Information' and  the  'Statement'  respectively),  presented  in  the  Group's Management Report pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions of Articles L. 225 102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce).\n\nAt the request of the entity, we also performed work designed to express a reasonable assurance conclusion on the information selected by the entity and identified by the sign \uf0fc\uf0fc .\n\n## Limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we performed as described under the 'Nature and scope of procedures' paragraph and the evidence we obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement is not prepared in accordance with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.\n\n## Reasonable assurance conclusion on a selection of non-financial information\n\nIn our opinion, the information selected by the entity and identified with the symbol \uf0fc\uf0fc in the Statement has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Comments\n\nWithout modifying our conclusion and in accordance with Article A. 225-3 of the French Commercial Code, we have the following comments:\n\n- -for the calculation of health and safety indicators, reporting by local entities still needs to be improved in terms of process and tool robustness. Consolidated Group reporting at a higher frequency is being implemented;\n- -for  the  calculation  of  the  indicator  relating  to  the  number of beneficiaries of digital support and training, we identify an improvement in the organization of the data collection campaign. The Group has carried out work to identify eligible training courses serving as a basis for calculating the indicator. However, improvements are still needed in terms of traceability and consolidation of the number of beneficiaries;\n- -for  waste-related  indicators,  excluding  the  'mobile  phone collection' indicator, we see a continuous improvement in the transmission of information for the MEA zone. Efforts are still needed to ensure on the one hand the completeness and monitoring of collections, and on the other hand the treatment of waste, in a geographical context dependent on changes in policies, regulations and the development of the recycling sector.\n\n## Preparation of the extra-financial performance statement\n\nThe absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or of a significant body of established practices on which to draw to evaluate and measure the Information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently, the Information needs to be read and understood together with the Guidelines, summarized in the Statement and available on the Entity's website or on request from its headquarters.\n\n## Inherent limitations in preparing the Information\n\nAs  stated  in  the  Statement,  the  Information  may  be  subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the Statement.\n\n## Responsibility of the entity\n\nManagement of the entity is responsible for:\n\n- -selecting  or  establishing  suitable  criteria  for  preparing  the Information;\n- -preparing  a  Statement  pursuant  to  legal  and  regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented considering those risks and the outcomes of said policies, including key performance indicators, and the information set out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green Taxonomy);\n- -preparing the Statement by applying the entity's 'Guidelines' as referred above; and\n- -designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation of the Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been prepared by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor, appointed as independent third party\n\nBased  on  our  work,  our  responsibility  is  to  provide  a  report expressing a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- -the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- -the  fairness  of  the  historical  information  (observed  or extrapolated) provided pursuant to part 3 of sections I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, i.e., the outcomes of policies, including key performance indicators, and measures relating to the main risks.\n\nAs we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the Information as doing so may compromise our independence.\n\n- 4\n\n4",

At its meeting of February 7, 2024, the GCSERC took note of the annual declarations of the Directors and Officers (see Section 5.2.1.2 Independent Directors).\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge and as at the date of this Universal Registration Document, there is no potential conflict of interest between the duties of Directors or Corporate Officers with regard to Orange and their private interests or other duties.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, with the exception of the shareholders' agreement referred to in Section 6.2.1.2 of the Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document, there are no arrangements or agreements with any major shareholder, customer, supplier or any other third party under which any member of the Board of Directors or Corporate Officer has been appointed to the Board of Directors or Company's General Management (respectively).\n\n## 5.1.4.4 Shares and stock options held by members of the Executive Committee\n\nAs at the date of this document, to the best of the Company's knowledge,  the  members  of  Orange's  Executive  Committee, including Christel Heydemann, Chief Executive Officer, owned a total of 78,599 Orange shares, i.e. 0.003% of the capital.\n\nAs at the date of this document, the members of the Executive Committee do not hold any stock options, the Company has no such plans in place.",

        "page_content": "## 5.2 Operation of the management and supervisory bodies\n\n## 5.2.1 Operation of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors presides over all decisions relating to the Group's  major  strategic,  economic,  employment,  financial  or technological policies and monitors the implementation of those policies by General Management, in accordance with its corporate interest  and  taking  into  account  the  social,  environmental, cultural and sporting aspects of its operations. It also takes into consideration the Company's purpose.\n\n## 5.2.1.1 Legal and statutory rules relating to the composition of the Board of Directors\n\nIn accordance with Article 13 of the Bylaws, the Board of Directors consists of no fewer than 12 and no more than 22 members, including three Directors elected by employees and one Director appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting and representing employee shareholders. The term of office for Directors is four years.\n\nPursuant to Government Order No. 2014-948 of August 20, 2014 on the governance and capital transactions of publicly held companies, as long as the French State holds more than 10% of the Company's share capital, it is entitled to appoint a representative to the Board of Directors, and a number of positions in proportion to its stake are reserved for members that it may propose. The public sector has three representatives on the Board of Directors: one representative appointed by Ministerial Order and two Directors appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## 5.2.1.2 Independent  Directors\n\nThe annual assessment of Directors' independence was carried out by the Board of Directors' Meeting of February 14, 2024, on the basis of a proposal by the Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC). In assessing Directors' independence, the Board took into account all of the criteria of the Afep-Medef Code of Corporate Governance, which state that a Director, to be considered independent:\n\n- -must not be or have been within the last five years:\n- -an employee or executive Corporate Officer of the Company,\n- -an employee, executive Corporate Officer or Director of a consolidated subsidiary of the Company,\n- -an employee, executive Corporate Officer or Director of the parent company or a consolidated subsidiary of the parent company;\n- -must not be an executive Corporate Officer of a company in which the Company directly or indirectly holds a position on the Board of Directors or in which an employee appointed as such, or a person who is an executive Corporate Officer of the Company (or who has been in the previous five years), holds the position of Director;\n- -must  not  be  a  customer,  supplier,  commercial  banker, investment banker or advisor:\n- -that is material to the Company or its Group, or\n- -for which the Company or its Group represents a significant share of business.\n\nThe assessment of the potential materiality of the relationship with Orange or its Group must be discussed by the Board, and the qualitative and/or quantitative criteria used in this assessment (continuity,  economic  dependence,  exclusivity, etc.)  must  be explicitly stated in the Corporate Governance Report:\n\n- -must not have close family ties with a Director or Officer;\n- -must not have been a Statutory Auditor of the Company within the last five years;\n- -must not have been a Director of the Company for more than 12 years. Under this criterion, loss of the status of Independent Director occurs on the date at which this period of 12 years is reached.\n\nThe Afep-Medef Code recommends presenting a summary table of each Director's position with regard to independence criteria. The analysis of the GCSERC was thus carried out with regard to these criteria; the summary table appears at the end of this section.\n\nThe  three  Directors  representing  the  public  sector  and  the four Directors elected by employees or representing employee shareholders cannot, by definition, be deemed independent under the Afep-Medef Code. Christel Heydemann, Director and Chief Executive Officer, is furthermore considered to be non-independent due to her executive role within Orange.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  Directors  considered  to  be  independent, including the Non-Executive Chairman, the GCSERC reviewed, firstly,  their  annual  declarations  made  when  preparing  this document, including a section on potential conflicts of interest, and, secondly, any business relationships between the Orange group and these Directors or the companies that employ them, or in which they may hold office.\n\nThe  GCSERC  also  examined  the  nature  of  the  volumes  of business dealings and partnerships with listed companies in which Company Directors hold office. Given the importance attached to the independence of the Chairman of the Board of Directors when this office is separate from that of the Chief Executive Officer, the GCSERC once again reviewed the business relationship between the Company and BNP Paribas which, in 2023, involved financial flows that are not likely to call into question the Committee's past review of the independence of the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Chairman did not participate in the discussions or the vote on the Orange Bank matter. The review also indicated that some of these companies are customers of Orange Business (formerly Orange  Business  Services)  for  'business'  telecommunication services or Group suppliers in the normal course of business and for non-material amounts across the Orange group. The Board also reviewed any declared consultancy services that the Company Directors had carried out.\n\nThe Board of Directors considered, given the nature and volume of the business relationships in question and the declaration of independence made by each of the aforementioned Directors, that these existing relationships are not material either for the Orange group or for any of the Directors or groups or entities to which the Directors concerned belong. The Board of Directors concluded that these relationships are therefore not likely to compromise their independence.\n\nFollowing  the  discussions,  Val\u00e9rie  Beaulieu,  Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner, Jacques Aschenbroich, Alexandre Bompard, Gilles Grapinet, Momar Nguer and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sanchez - seven of the Board's 15 members - were deemed to be independent under the criteria of the Afep-Medef Code.\n\nWith the exception of Directors elected by employees or representing employee shareholders who are not taken into account by the Afep-Medef Code for the purpose of calculating the proportion of Independent Directors, as of the date of this document, the Board had seven Independent Directors out of 11, which is close to two-thirds of the Board - a proportion well above the Afep-Medef Code recommendation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n- 5",

detailed list of the positions held by Directors and Officers is provided in Section 5.1.4 Information on Directors, Officers and Senior Management.\n\n## 5.2.1.3 Applying the principle of diversity and balanced representation between women and men\n\nThe Board ensures that its membership complies with statutory provisions, specifically with regard to diversity and the balanced representation of women and men on the Board.\n\nAt the date of this document, the Board of Directors had a total of six women out of 15 Directors. In accordance with the criteria resulting from the laws of January 27, 2011 (on the balanced representation of women and men on Boards of Directors and supervisory boards and on professional equality) and of May 22, 2019 (on the growth and transformation of companies, known as the PACTE Act), the proportion of women on the Board was 45% (five women out of 11 members). This percentage does not take into account directors elected by employees or representing employee shareholders.\n\nFurthermore,  pursuant  to  Article  L. 22-10-10 of  the  French Commercial Code and the Afep-Medef Code, Article 13 of the Company's  Internal  Guidelines  (see  Section 5.2.1.4  Internal Guidelines) states that diversity in the composition of the Board and its committees also refers to indicators such as age, nationality, qualifications and professional experience.\n\nThis provision is consistent with the expectations of Directors expressed in the assessment of the operation of the Board and its committees conducted the end of 2023 and January 2024 regarding the need to have diverse profiles present on the Board.\n\n## Diversity of expertise on the Board\n\nAn assessment of the key skills and expertise of the members of the Board has been carried out by an external firm among the Directors and shows that the Board, due to the diversity of the profiles and experience of its members, both in France and internationally, has the necessary qualities to understand the matters presented to it.\n\nSeveral  directors,  whether  because  of  their  professional experience, initial training or years of involvement in the work of the Board of Directors, already had or have now developed technical expertise relevant to Orange's business activities (in particular in telecommunications, cybersecurity and the Cloud).\n\nWith respect to social and environmental responsibility, in the second half of 2023 the members of the Board were invited to a series of training sessions on the Group's challenges and their climate and environmental responsibility. A significant proportion of the Board's Independent Directors have also worked for companies recognized for their CSR performance. Likewise, one employee director brings specific expertise in eco-design to the Board.\n\nLastly, some directors have spent a large part of their careers abroad and add their international perspective and culture to the Board.",

They are available on the website www.orange.com, under the heading Group/Governance.\n\nThe Internal Guidelines specify, among other details, the respective responsibilities of the Board of Directors, the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, stipulating limits to their powers; they also set the rules governing the composition, powers and operating procedures of each Board committee.\n\nThe  Internal  Guidelines  also  specify  the  rules  governing  the information provided to Directors and meetings of the Board.\n\nThe Internal Guidelines have been updated several times by the Board of Directors to reflect changes in the Company's governance. The most recent adjustment was made at the Board meeting of February 14, 2024, on the recommendation of the GCSERC, and concerned implementation of the Government Order No. 2023-1142 of December 6, 2023 transposing the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (the 'CSRD') of December 16, 2022. The purpose of this change is to give the Audit Committee responsibility for monitoring the non-financial reporting process (sustainability reporting).\n\n## 5.2.1.5 Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nArticle 1 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors specifies the role and duties of the Chairman.\n\nThe Chairman represents the Board of Directors and, except in unusual circumstances, is the only person authorized to act and speak in the Board's name. The Chairman organizes and guides the\n\nwork of the Board of Directors and ensures the efficient running of the corporate bodies in line with the principles of good governance. He or she liaises between the Board of Directors and the Company's shareholders, in coordination with General Management; he or she monitors the quality of the Company's financial information. When the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer are split, he or she may, in close coordination with General Management, represent the Company in its high-level relations with the public authorities, the Group's major partners and key customers, both within France and internationally. In this case, he or she is briefed regularly by the Chief Executive Officer on the significant events and situations relating to Group operations, and he or she may seek any information from the Chief Executive Officer needed to inform the Board of Directors and its committees. The Chairman may meet with the Statutory Auditors in order to prepare the work of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee. He or she may attend meetings of Board Committees under the conditions provided for in the Internal Guidelines.\n\nIn  accordance  with  Articles  29-1  and  29-2 of  French  Law No. 90-568 of July 2, 1990 regarding the organization of the public postal service and France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, the Chairman of the Board of Directors also has the power to appoint and manage the civil servants  employed  by  the  Company.  Since  the  separation  of functions in 2022, the Chairman decided to delegate this power to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nPursuant to the Company's Bylaws, the Chairman of the Board of Directors can remain in office until the age of 70. If this age is reached by the Chairperson while in office, the age limit shall be extended in order to allow the Chairperson of the Board of Directors to carry out their required duties until their term of office expires.\n\n- 5\n\n5",

Their role is to provide informed input for the Board's discussions and assist in preparing its decisions. These committees meet as often as is necessary. Their powers and operating procedures are set out in the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors. In line with the Afep-Medef Code, significant responsibilities are given to Independent Directors. Orange also believes that it is important that each committee benefits from the\n\npresence of at least one Director representing the public sector and at least one member representing employees or employee shareholders, enabling different opinions to be taken into account in the work of the committees (see Section 5.2.1.8 Board and committee activities during the fiscal year).\n\nThus, with the exception of the Chairman, who is free to attend all committee meetings, all of the Directors sit on a committee based on the choices discussed and made by the Board.\n\n## Composition of the Board Committees as at the date of this document\n\n| Audit Committee                                                                      | Year created 1997   | Chairman Gilles Grapinet  (1) (2)   | Members Val\u00e9rie Beaulieu  (1) S\u00e9bastien Crozier C\u00e9line Fornaro                                      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Governance and Corporate  Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC) | 2003                | Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner          | Anne Lange Momar Nguer  (1) Magali Vall\u00e9e                                                           |\n| Strategy and Technology Committee (STC)                                              | 2022  (3)           | Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sanchez  (1)               | Alexandre Bompard  (1) Thierry Chatelier Vincent Gimeno Bpifrance Participations (Thierry Sommelet) |\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Audit  Committee  complies  with  the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code and with the provisions of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors. In accordance with the Internal Guidelines, the Audit Committee therefore has at least three members appointed by the Board. At least two-thirds of members must be independent (excluding Directors elected by employees or representing employee shareholders, who are not taken into account). The Chairman of the Audit Committee is chosen from among the Independent Directors.\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  May 23,  2023,  the  Board  acted  on  the recommendation of the GCSERC in appointing Gilles Grapinet, an Independent Director newly elected by the Shareholders' Meeting held the same day, as Chairman of the Audit Committee and financial expert.\n\nThe Committee does not include any Corporate Officers and its composition also complies with the provisions of Article L. 821-67 of the French Commercial Code relating to the establishment of a specialized committee to follow up on questions relating to the preparation and control of accounting and financial information.\n\nThe  French  Commercial  Code  was  revised  following  the transposition  of  the  provisions  of  the  Corporate  Sustainability Reporting  Directive  (the  'CSRD')  through  promulgation  of Government Order 2023-1142 of December 6, 2023. The changes, which took effect on January 1, 2024, are mainly as follows:\n\n- -the Audit Committee now has new sustainability responsibilities: it must expand its monitoring of the financial reporting process and  the  disclosure  of  information  to  include  sustainability aspects and, where applicable, make recommendations to ensure their integrity;\n- -with respect to sustainability reporting, the Audit Committee must monitor the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems, and of the internal audit function, where applicable;\n\n- -it must report to the Board on a regular basis on the outcome of the assurance of sustainability reporting and explain how this work contributed to the integrity of financial reporting and sustainability reporting.\n\nEvery year the Audit Committee is also given a presentation by General Management on risk mapping in the Company and in particular the effectiveness of the risk management system, the major risks facing the Group, and fraud prevention and detection mechanisms. Furthermore, it issues a recommendation regarding the Statutory Auditors nominated for appointment, organizes their selection process and submits a reasoned recommendation to the Board regarding their choice and their compensation terms and conditions. It monitors the Statutory Auditors' fulfillment of their engagement and approves, where applicable, the provision of services other than the certification of the financial statements, for such services that are not prohibited by law or Orange's rules. It also issues a recommendation regarding the independent third party nominated for appointment by the Shareholders' Meeting to certify the sustainability information. The Committee also studies all investment or divestment projects that meet the criteria set out in Article 2 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors, and prepares the relevant Board deliberations. The Audit Committee may also request that any audit or internal/external review be carried out on any matter that it considers to fall within its remit.\n\nFinally, the Chairman of the Audit Committee is assigned a particular role, and reports to the Board of Directors on a regular basis on the execution of the Committee's functions, as well as the outcome of the statutory audit and how this has contributed to the integrity of the financial reporting, and the role the Audit Committee has played in this process. It immediately informs the Board of any difficulties encountered and submits a summary of the Audit Committee's discussions.\n\nThe responsibilities of the Audit Committee are detailed in Article 7 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors.",

        "page_content": "## Financial expertise within the Audit Committee\n\nMembers  of  the  Audit  Committee  are  required  to  have  or gain financial or accounting expertise. In accordance with the provisions of Article L. 821-67 of the French Commercial Code and Section 407 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, it must also comprise at least one person with specific expertise in the field of finance, accounting or statutory auditing, who must be independent (the 'financial expert').\n\nGilles  Grapinet  was  appointed  financial  expert  to  the  Audit Committee during the Board of Directors' meeting of May 23, 2023, due mainly to his role as Financial Inspector, his past roles as economic and financial advisor to the Prime Minister and Chief of Staff to the Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry, and his current position as Chief Executive Officer of Worldline.\n\n## Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Internal  Guidelines  of  the  Board  of Directors, the Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC) has at least three members appointed by the Board. Its Chairman is chosen from among the Independent Directors.\n\nIts composition, which was changed by the Board at its meeting of May 23, 2023, was strengthened with the addition of Momar Nguer,  Independent  Director,  who  was  elected  by  the  2023 Shareholders' Meeting. The Committee's composition is in line with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, as it has two-thirds Independent Directors (excluding Directors elected by employees or representing employee shareholders, who are not included in this calculation).\n\nThe major areas of responsibility of this committee, whose creation is recommended by the Afep-Medef Code, are appointments and compensation, corporate social and environmental responsibility and  governance.  In  particular,  it  exercises  the  powers  of  the specialized  committees  responsible  for  the  appointment  and re-appointment of Directors. In these areas, it is tasked in particular with making proposals to the Board of Directors, as well as to the Chairman and, as necessary, the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer also keeps the Committee informed of any new appointments to the Group Executive Committee; the Committee may offer, upon request of the Chief Executive Officer, its opinion on the terms and conditions for calculating the compensation of these new members, or regarding of performance share plans or LTIP (Long-Term Incentive Plans). The Committee also ensures, with regard to succession plans, that a process is in place for when terms of office expire and in situations requiring particular attention. Lastly, it continuously verifies that the members of the Board meet the criteria set out in Article 20 of the Afep-Medef Code regarding the number of positions held.\n\nThe Committee also examines, in line with the Group's strategy, the main thrust of Human Resources and CSR policies, based on  dialogue  with  the  Group's  stakeholders,  and  the  Group's sustainability policy in articulation with the Audit Committee. Once a year, it reviews the Ethics Committee's report on the Group-wide actions to implement ethics practices, and is informed about the roll-out of the Group's compliance programs.\n\nThe responsibilities of the Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee are detailed in Article 8 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Strategy and Technology Committee\n\nIn accordance with the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors, the Strategy and Technology Committee has at least three members appointed by the Board.\n\nThe  Committee  notably  reviews  the  significant  multi-annual investment  programs  and  the  major  technology  partnerships entered into by the Group, the Group's strategic policies in terms of innovation and research, and its performance in this respect.\n\n- 5\n\nThe responsibilities of the Strategy and Technology Committee (STC) are detailed in Article 9 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Special committees\n\nArticle 5 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors provides that the Board may decide, for certain technical issues relating to the Company's operations and/or issues that may involve conflicts of interest and on which the Board of Directors is expected to give its view or make a decision, to establish a special committee to review these matters in consultation with the Company's General Management. Article 5 was amended at the request of the Board on December 5, 2018 in order to enable any Director to participate in such committees, provided that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Board of Directors appoints the Chairman, who is chosen from among the Committee's Independent Directors.\n\nA special committee consisting of the three committee chairs and chaired by the Chairman of the STC, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sanchez, was established by the Board on March 29, 2023 to monitor and supervise, in the Board's name, the progress made on the search for partners for Orange Bank. The Chairman of the Board did not participate in this work. Its efforts culminated in the announcement on June 28, 2023 of the conclusions of the strategic review of Orange Bank and the entry into exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas (see Section 5.2.1.8 Board and committee activities during the fiscal year).\n\n## 5.2.1.7 Lead  Director\n\nThe Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors provide for the appointment by the Board of a Lead Director from among the Independent Directors at the proposal of the GCSERC. A Lead Director must be appointed if the same person is both Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe powers of the Lead Director, if one has been appointed, are defined in Article 15.1 of the Company's Bylaws (calling and chairing of Board meetings if the Chairman is unavailable), and in Article 10 of the Internal Guidelines, which also defines the Lead Director's duties.\n\nSince the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Board has chosen not to make use of this option.\n\n## 5.2.1.8 Board and committee activities during the fiscal year\n\n## Board activities\n\nThe Board of Directors met nine times in 2023. Its meetings had a collective attendance rate of 99.4%. Individual attendance rates are presented in the table at the end of this section. Information on allocation and payment methods for Directors' compensation is presented in Section 5.4.2.1 Amount of compensation paid or allocated for 2023 activity. The typical Board meeting lasts around 3 hours, systematically followed by an executive session, without the presence of executive management representatives.\n\nEach meeting is generally preceded by a meeting of one or more of the Board's committees with a view to preparing its work and deliberations.  The  matters  discussed  by  the  committees  are reported on by their Chairperson to the Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition to overseeing the regular stages in the life of the Company (review of operating performance, quarterly results, half-year and statutory financial statements, budget review, risk factors, setting the compensation of Corporate Officers, etc.), in the first half of 2023 the Board discussed and approved the merger of Orange Cara\u00efbe into Orange and, on completion of the strategic review conducted by the Group in consultation with a special committee, announced its intention to exit the retail banking market in France and Spain and gave its approval to enter into exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

In particular, it confirmed the implementation of this proposal based notably on the nature of the remedies presented to the Board, taking into account the updated business plan and sensitivity to market conditions. It confirmed, in accordance with Article L. 225-35 of the French Commercial Code, its authority to guarantee that its Orange Participations UK subsidiary will comply with any commitments it may make under the Investment Agreement (the Framework Agreement) and the Shareholders' Agreement.\n\nIn Spain, it also authorized the acquisition of the TV distribution rights for Spanish soccer for the 2023-2024 season.\n\nIn the second half of the year, the Board of Directors noted the signature of the shareholders' agreements between the Group and Capgemini for the effective creation of Bleu, a 50/50 joint venture to provide SecNumCloud-certified 'Trust Cloud' solutions based on Microsoft technology, as well as the signature of the Definitive Agreement between Bleu and Microsoft.\n\nIt also noted the work done to finalize the documentation with the Romanian government before the completion of the merger between  Orange  Romania  Communications  (in  which  the Romanian government is a shareholder) and Orange Romania, and the restructuring actions that must be taken beforehand.\n\nIt was  also  kept  regularly  informed  of  the  Company's employee-related news (signing of agreements).\n\nAfter consultation with the Central Social and Economic Committee (CSEC) on the Group's strategic guidelines, its representative, as is the case every year, submitted a series of questions on these guidelines to the Board of Directors at its meeting on December 7, 2022. The Board approved the answers given at its meeting on March 29, 2023.\n\nThe Board proposed the renewal of the conditional performance share plan (long-term incentive plan, or LTIP) for Corporate officers for the period from 2024 to 2026 in line with the trajectory set to achieve the CSR objectives included in the variable remuneration policy. This system will be submitted to the vote of the Shareholders' Meeting of May 22, 2024 (see Section 5.4.1 Report of the Board of Directors on compensation and benefits paid to Corporate Officers). The Board of Directors' review of points related to the appointment, compensation and assessment of Corporate Officers is conducted in the absence of the interested parties. The Board also reserves the right to review the remuneration of the CEO at any time during her term of office.\n\nAt its meeting of October 23, 2023, it also verified the existence and monitoring of the effectiveness of Internal Control and financial and  non-financial  risk  management  systems  in  the  form  of  a presentation by the Chairman of the Audit Committee on the work of this Committee at a special meeting.\n\nThe Board of Directors was presented with an update of the Group Vigilance Plan and the obligations regarding the Statement of NonFinancial Performance. It also approved the information on the corporate, social and environmental issues of the Group included in the Report of the Board of Directors to the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Afep-Medef Code relating to the policy of gender balance in management bodies, the Board was presented with a progress report on the objectives that the Company has set for itself in terms of increasing the number of women in management bodies, in particular within the management network of the Group's executives and leaders. It approved the annual resolution on the policy of professional and salary equality between women and men (see Section 4.3.1.3.5 Promoting diversity and inclusion - Gender equality in the workplace).\n\nThe  Board  has  made  available  to  shareholders  and  investors appropriate  information,  particularly  in  the  preparation  of  the Shareholders' Meeting. The Chairman of the Board has reported on his discussions with them, particularly on the Group's strategy, business model, significant non-financial issues, and the long-term outlook.\n\nLastly, the Board also had the operations it had conducted (see Section 5.2.1.9 Periodic review of the operation of the Board of Directors and its committees) assessed by an independent third party and presented to the GCSERC on February 7, 2024.\n\n## Committee activities\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee met nine times in 2023. Its meetings had a collective attendance rate of 94%.\n\nIt met regularly with Orange's Senior Management and the main managers of the Group's Finance Department, as well as with the  Head  of  the  Group  Audit,  Control  and  Risk  Management Department and the Statutory Auditors, in order to review with them their respective action plans and follow-up on these plans.\n\nIn  the  first  half  of  2023,  the  Audit  Committee  reviewed  the performance of Orange's share price relative to its benchmark indices,  and  was  presented  with  a  benchmark  for  Orange's operating and financial performance for 2022. It was also presented with the Group's tax contribution in its regions and the related issues.\n\nIn the second half of the year, General Management presented the Group's insurance policy as well as the tender process for choosing an auditor for the Group's sustainability report, in accordance with the requirements of the CSRD Directive.\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, the Chairman of the Audit Committee decided to hold executive sessions of the Audit Committee, which would meet twice a year, at the same time as the work relating to  each  half-yearly  and  annual  accounts.  These  meetings  of Committee members will be attended by the Statutory Auditors, but will not be attended by Executive Management.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nIn 2023, the Committee analyzed the Statutory Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2022 fiscal year and the first-half of 2023, together with the first- and third-quarter results for 2023. At its meeting on February 14, 2024, it reviewed the results for the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as the Statutory Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2023 fiscal year. It verified that the processes for producing accounting and  financial  information  complied  with  regulatory  and  legal requirements, especially in terms of Internal Control. In this respect, the Committee reviewed the draft Management Report and heard the Statutory Auditors' Reports. It also reviewed the 2024 budget. The material risks and off-balance-sheet commitments and their accounting impacts, as well as the results of the asset impairment tests, were also discussed.\n\nThe Committee furthermore reviewed all financial communications prior to their publication, including, at its meeting of February 12, 2024, the content relating to the implementation of the Lead the future strategic plan.\n\n## Internal control and risk management, ethics\n\nBefore approving each set of financial statements, the Committee undertook a review of the significant litigation in which the Group is involved.\n\nMoreover,  the  Committee  examined  the  results  of  the  annual assessment  of  the  Financial  Internal  Control  system,  which were presented to it by Group Internal Control, and concluded that the system was effective (see Section 2.2.2.2 Summary of Internal Control work implemented pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act).\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the major risks that the Company believes could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial  position  or  earnings,  particularly  in  light  of  its  risk mapping. It also ensured that the recommendations formulated after the internal audit assignments by Group Audit, Control and Risk Management were correctly implemented.

        "page_content": "assignments are presented on a quarterly basis. At its meeting of October 4, 2023, the Audit Committee was given a presentation by General Management on risk mapping in the Company and, in particular, the effectiveness of the risk management system, the major risks facing the Group, and fraud prevention and detection mechanisms. This meeting focused on four specific risks: 'Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games,' 'Geopolitical situation,' 'Climate,' and 'Cyber' (action plan and remediation). This review was then debriefed to the Board of Directors so it could discuss these risks and propose areas for improvement and an action follow-up schedule. The description of material risks is presented in Section 2.1 Risk factors.\n\n## Management of debt and cash\n\nThe Committee regularly reviewed the Group's debt refinancing and cash management policy and was given a presentation on the annual update of the Group's derivative counterparty and cash investment limits.\n\n## Development projects and strategic plan\n\nThe Committee was informed about the position of some of the Group's equity interests in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and reviewed the asset impairment tests conducted at the end of 2023 at the Group's main subsidiaries and shareholdings, based on the entities' updated strategic plans, in order to take the 2024 budget as well as geopolitical and macroeconomic changes into account.\n\n## Statutory Auditors\n\nThe Committee reviewed the fees of the Statutory Auditors for 2023 and the financial terms of their work during the year. At the Audit Committee's meeting of June 26, 2023, the Statutory Auditors presented their external audit plan.\n\nFollowing the update to the Code of Ethics published by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA), it also reviewed the new rules on statutory auditor independence relating, in particular, to the provision of non-audit services.\n\n## Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC)\n\nThe GCSERC met seven times in 2023. Its meetings had a collective attendance rate of 96.4%.\n\n## Compensation of Directors and Of/ficers\n\nIn early 2023, the Committee discussed and defined the proposed targets and calculation methods for the variable components of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation for 2023. It reviewed the results of the votes on the say-on-pay resolutions at the 2023 Shareholders' Meeting and the comments made by investors in that context, following the contested vote at the 2022 Shareholders' Meeting. The proposed compensation and targets for Corporate Officers for 2024 were reviewed and discussed over the course of several meetings in the second half of 2023, and finally defined in March 2024 (see Section 5.4 Compensation and benefits paid to Directors, Officers and Senior Management).\n\nWith regard to multi-year variable remuneration, the Committee also monitored the implementation of performance share plans (Long Term Incentive Plans or LTIP), in particular the results of the LTIP 2021-2023. It reviewed the draft regulations for the LTIP 2023-\n\n- 5\n\n2025 for the Chief Executive Officer and the executives who are beneficiaries of the award, including the members of the Executive Committee, and the overall terms and conditions of a new LTIP for the 2024-2026 period, the principle of which will be put to a vote at the Shareholders' Meeting of May 22, 2024. To support the Company's climate objectives, the GCSERC recommended introducing a 'CO 2 emissions - scopes 1 and 2' indicator for annual variable compensation and a 'proportion of renewable energy in electricity consumption' indicator for the LTIP (see Section 5.4.1 Report of the Board of Directors on compensation and benefits paid to Corporate Officers).\n\nThe GCSERC was also given a presentation on the clawback mechanism adopted by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023. It applies to the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Executive Committee, and the Group Chief Accounting Officer, and took effect on October 2, 2023. This mechanism, originating in US regulation, requires companies listed in the United States, including foreign companies, to incorporate into their compensation policies a mechanism for recovering certain compensation from executives if such compensation is based wholly or in part on the achievement of  any  financial  reporting  measures  or  if  certain  accounting restatements are required due to material noncompliance, errors or misstatements.\n\nLastly, the Committee prepared the breakdown of compensation for Directors in respect of the 2023 fiscal year and reassessed the Director compensation policy for the 2024 fiscal year in order to account for the large volume of work done by the Board and its committees, and the lessons learned from the benchmarking on this topic (see Section 5.4.2 Board of Directors' report on Directors' compensation).\n\n## Governance and operation of the Board\n\nThe  Committee  reviewed  the  Board's  Corporate  Governance Report, which is attached to the Management Report.\n\nIt also examined, as it does every year, the situation of each of the Independent Directors with regard to the independence criteria set out in the Afep-Medef Code (see Section 5.2.1.2 Independent Directors).\n\nAt its meeting of February 7, 2024, the Committee took note of annual declarations made by Orange's Directors and Officers, in which certain information is required: the number of Orange shares held and any related-party transactions, terms of office and positions held in 2023, personal situation, potential conflicts of interest, etc.\n\nThe members of the GCSERC noted that in light of the annual declarations made by Directors and Officers, no specific conflicts of interest had been identified. This review, together with other work carried out by the Committee, led to the proposal to the Board of Directors' Meeting of February 14, 2024 that seven Directors be considered independent within the meaning of the Afep-Medef Code (see Section 5.2.1.2 Independent Directors).\n\nIn the second half of 2023, the GCSERC asked the Board to repeat the assessment of its operation and that of the three committees. As this exercise had been carried out quite recently, the external consultant who performed the previous assessment was asked to focus on the topics he deemed to be the most important.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

It enlisted General Management to develop and provide training sessions to the Board on climate risks and the adaptation strategy adopted by operators, including Orange; the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD); and operators' CO 2 emissions and their mitigation strategy.\n\nLastly, at the beginning of 2024, the Committee recommended that the Board revise the Internal Guidelines to account for the entry into force of the Government Order n\u00b0 2023-1142 of December 6, 2023 transposing the CSRD Directive on sustainability reporting (see Section 5.2.1.4 Internal Guidelines).\n\n## Nomination\n\nThroughout the fiscal year, the Committee has continued its ongoing monitoring work ('director watch') in order to be able to have a list of director profiles that may correspond to the Board's needs and thus enable it to prepare for any necessary replacement. The Committee has remained particularly attentive to any profile with expertise in the fields of innovation and technology, particularly internationally, and who is or has been in General Management. It systematically ensures that the proportion of independent directors recommended in the Afep-Medef Code be respected when directors are appointed to committees.\n\nThe  Committee  also  periodically  reviewed  the  membership  of the Board's committees and, in February 2023, recommended reappointing Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner and Alexandre Bompard as Independent Directors and Anne Lange as director elected by Orange's Shareholders' Meeting based on the recommendation of the government.\n\nIn  March 2023,  the  GCSERC  also  recommended  appointing C\u00e9line  Fornaro,  a  director  appointed  by  Ministerial  Order,  to replace St\u00e9phanie Besnier on the Audit Committee in view of her background and skills.\n\nIn addition, the GCSERC noted both the resignation of Bernard Ramanantsoa, Independent Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee,  and  the  expiration  of  the  term  of  office  of  JeanMichel Severino, Independent Director and member of the Audit Committee, at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting of May 23, 2023, and recommended that the Board appoint Gilles Grapinet and Momar Nguer as Independent Directors. After their terms of office were approved by shareholders at that Shareholders' Meeting, the GCSERC asked the Board, upon review of their background and experience, to appoint these two new directors as member and Chairman of the Audit Committee and member of the GCSERC, respectively. This proposal by the GCSERC, which was approved by the Board at its meeting of May 23, 2023, allowed the GCSERC to welcome a new independent member and implement an expected recommendation.\n\nAt the close of the Shareholders' Meeting of May 23, 2023, the GCSERC noted that Alexandre Bompard was reappointed with 73.04% of the vote. This figure appeared to reflect his attendance rate in 2022, which was 62% and below that of the other directors. In 2023, Alexandre Bompard's attendance rate at Board meetings was 100% (see table below).\n\nIn the second half of 2023 and in advance of the Shareholders' Meeting of May 22, 2024, the GCSERC recommended that both Christel Heydemann, Chief Executive Officer of Orange since April 4, 2022, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sanchez, whose first term as Independent Director expires at that Shareholders' Meeting, be reappointed as directors. It also initiated and monitored the process for appointing the next Director representing employee shareholders, as the term of this office, currently held by Thierry Chatelier, also expires at that Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nLastly, the Chairwoman of the GCSERC, in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders, verified that a succession plan is in place for Corporate Officers and General Management.\n\n## CSR\n\nThe  Committee  reviewed  the  Group's  strategy  and  important issues related to its corporate social and environmental policies. It examined the major achievements in this area in 2023, the components  of  the  Statement  of  Non-Financial  Performance ('SNFP'), the roll-out of the Group's Vigilance Plan in 2023, and the materiality matrix. The Committee reported to the Board of Directors on its work on this subject.\n\nWith regard to CSR and climate change issues, the GCSERC wanted to strengthen the skills of the members of the Board of Directors in this area and, to that end, suggested that they undergo training on the topic in 2023, as detailed in the 'Governance and operation of the Board' section above. The Chairwoman of the GCSERC also suggested that a training plan should be developed and that the societal aspect of the CSR discussions should be more in-depth, and she proposed a list of topics in this respect.\n\nIn the first half of the year, the GCSERC was given a presentation focused  on  Orange's  'Scope 3'  strategy  and  the  Committee dedicated one of its meetings to climate strategy, sustainability-linked bonds and digital inclusion. The annual allocation and impact report for the funds raised under Orange's sustainable finance program was presented to the Committee.\n\nLastly, the tender process for choosing an auditor for the Group's sustainability report, in accordance with the requirements of the CSRD Directive, was also presented.\n\n## Ethics and compliance\n\nThe  GCSERC  monitored  the  progress  of  the  roll-out  of  the Group's corruption prevention program, in particular relating to the implementation of measures resulting from the French Law of December 9, 2016, known as the Sapin II Law, and Government Order  No. 2017-1180  of  July 19,  2017  on  the  publication  of non-financial information. In particular, the Committee reviewed the roll-out of the code of conduct ('Group Code of Ethics'). The Committee also examined the annual report on ethics and compliance  and  studied  the  Group-wide  actions  resulting  in the implementation of the ethics and compliance program (see Section 2.2  Activity and risk management framework).  It  was also given a refresher on stock trading conduct and on the rules applicable to permanent insiders with respect to their transactions in the Group's financial instruments.\n\nThe GCSERC was also presented with the steps taken in response to  the  findings  of  the  report  by  the  AFA  (Agence  fran\u00e7aise anticorruption  -  French  Anti-Corruption  Agency)  received  on June 16, 2023 further to the inspection initiated in October 2021, which concerns the operations of 'Orange Business Services.'\n\nLastly, the Committee continued to discuss the development and monitoring of the succession plan for Corporate Officers.\n\n## Employment\n\nThe Committee monitored changes in the yearly indicators of the employee satisfaction survey. At its meeting of November 20, 2023, the Committee was presented with a detailed annual report on workplace gender equality and equal pay at Orange, specifically covering the proportion of women in the workforce, an analysis of pay gaps, and the awareness-raising and training initiatives undertaken in 2023. It prepared the relevant Board resolution, stressing to General Management the need to ensure that this policy be uniformly applied in all Group entities. The gender balance policy within the governing bodies was reviewed by the GCSERC and was the subject of a recommendation to the Board, which, in accordance with the new provisions of the Afep-Medef Code, determines the gender balance objectives within these bodies. This policy is supplemented by the special attention paid to the proportion of women on the Boards of Directors of the Group's subsidiaries and on the specialized committees reporting to the Executive Committee.",

Its meetings had a collective attendance rate of 95%.\n\nOver the course of 2023, the STC focused on issues relating to the multi-service strategy and to changes in the economic models in the telecom sector. It then devoted one meeting to submarine cables and satellite networks. Lastly, it had extensive discussions about strategies in the B2B segment and, more specifically, within the Orange Business and Orange Cyberdefense divisions.\n\nLastly, at its meetings in early January 2024, the STC focused on the topic of innovation at Orange, and then of clod strategy.\n\n## Special committee\n\nA special committee, as provided for by Article 5 of the Internal Guidelines, consisting of the three committee chairs and chaired by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sanchez, Chairman of the STC, was established by the\n\n- 5\n\nBoard on March 29, 2023 to monitor and supervise, in the Board's name, the progress made on the search for partners for Orange Bank. The work of this special committee, in which the Chairman did not participate, was spread over the months of April, May and June and ended with the announcement on June 28, 2023 of the findings of the strategic review of Orange Bank and the entry into exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas.\n\n## Strategic seminar\n\nAll members of the Board of Directors met on January 22 and 23, 2024 for a strategic seminar. This meeting gave the Directors an opportunity to provide an initial update on the implementation of the Lead the future strategic plan announced in February 2023, in particular on topics related to the business activities and the market in France and on the African continent, Orange Business's business model, cybersecurity, innovation, and the human and financial challenges.\n\n## Individual

assessed internally via self-assessment and externally with the help of an independent consultant.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the GCSERC nevertheless asked the Board to hire an external consultant to perform another assessment, after the exercise conducted at the end of 2022, in order to consolidate the results of the previous assessment and account for the addition\n\nof three new Directors during the year. As in the past, this exercise was based on the responses to a questionnaire and a one-on-one interview. All the Directors participated in this exercise.\n\nThe assessor appointed by the Board was chosen after a review by the GCSERC, due to their recognized skills and knowledge of the issuers listed on the Paris market. No conflicts of interest were identified during this review that were likely to call this assessor's independence into question.\n\nThe Board reviewed the GCSERC's report on the results of this latest assessment at its meeting of February 14, 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

        "page_content": "5 -\n\nThe report by the external assessor shows that that almost all the Directors believe that, since the assessment conducted at the end of 2022, but also since the change in governance implemented in May 2022, the operation of the Board of Directors has continued to improve in a number of areas, in particular:\n\n- -the Directors' strong commitment to the Company;\n- -a supportive environment for work and for dialogue on all topics, strengthened by regular executive sessions;\n- -a successful working relationship between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer;\n- -the quality of the information provided, backed by benchmarks, allowing Directors to make a positive contribution to General Management.\n\nThe Directors also expressed their satisfaction with the quality of the presentations made at the annual strategic seminar.\n\nRegarding the specific operation of the committees, the Directors highlighted an improvement in the work, particularly on the risk monitoring side, and in the reporting by the Audit Committee. They also appreciated the quality of the work done by the GCSERC, in particular on the compensation policy, and that of the STC's work on the Group's strategy and strategy seminar. The work of this committee enabled the Board to provide substantive input and to prepare the Group's major decisions.\n\nTheir recommendations included requests that the content of the presentations be more concise and that they be made available to Directors further in advance of the meetings, whenever possible. The Directors would also like certain topics to be addressed more regularly, in particular those that touch on major challenges, such as the Group's changing needs in terms of skills, innovation and IT, and on mature markets. Lastly, a number of Directors expect the compensation they are awarded to be more in line with the work that they do, and would like additional efforts to be made to prepare the Company for crisis situations and to respect the confidentiality of the discussions.\n\nThis assessment was used to evaluate the actual contribution made by all members of the Board of Directors, and they each received an individual report.\n\n## 5.2.1.10 Description of the procedure in place for assessing usual related-party transactions\n\na procedure to regularly assess whether agreements relating to current operations and entered into on an arm's length basis meet these conditions.\n\nOn December 3, 2019, the Orange SA Board of Directors adopted an internal procedure to assess whether the agreements concluded between  (i) Orange SA  and  (ii) the  Directors  and  Officers  of Orange SA or the public sector (including the French government, Bpifrance Participations, central government administrations and companies controlled by the government) or any company in which an Orange SA Director or Officer holds a position, can continue to be described as agreements 'relating to current operations and entered into on an arm's length basis.'\n\nAs  part  of  the  procedure,  the  Group  Legal  Department  is responsible for (i) centralizing the recording of these freely negotiated agreements with the Legal Departments of the Orange SA divisions, and (ii) carrying out subsequent assessments.\n\nThis  involves  assessing  agreements  prior  to  their  signature, agreements being classified on a case-by-case basis by the Legal Department  in  question,  with  the  support  of  the  Operational, Finance and Compliance Departments of the Group, on the basis of cumulative criteria (the operation must be both current and entered into on an arm's length basis), and a re-examination of these agreements is planned on an annual basis. An annual in-depth check is also carried out on material agreements to ensure that they continue to meet the criteria for current agreements and arm's length conditions at the level of Orange SA. Material agreements are those subject to significant commitments for Orange SA or decisions made in the Group Investment Committee.\n\nA report on this procedure is presented annually to the Board of Directors for approval. The Board will examine the effectiveness of the procedure for evaluating current agreements entered into on an arm's length basis within the Group.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the above-mentioned report established that the agreements identified, subject to the procedure, could continue to be classified as current agreements entered into on an arm's length basis. The report was presented to the Audit Committee on February 12, 2024  and was approved by the Board of Directors' Meeting of February 14, 2024  on the recommendation of the Audit Committee. Its review led to the conclusion that the internal procedure was effective and that it was implemented under the same conditions in 2023.\n\nPursuant to Article L. 22-10-12 of the French Commercial Code, the Boards of Directors of listed companies are required to implement\n\n## 5.2.2 Operation of General Management\n\n## 5.2.2.1 Management  structure\n\nSince April 4, 2022, Orange has operated under a governance structure that separates the offices of Chairman of the Board of  Directors  and  Chief  Executive  Officer.  Accordingly,  Christel Heydemann has served as Chief Executive Officer since that date. At the close of the Shareholders' Meeting of May 19, 2022, the Board of Directors confirmed it was maintaining the way in which General Management was organized, as decided on January 28, 2022, and resolved to entrust the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors to Jacques Aschenbroich and to reappoint the Chief Executive Officer for a term equal to that of the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Alongside her appointment as Chief Executive Officer, Christel Heydemann retained her position as Director.\n\n5.2.2.2\n\nRestrictions on the powers of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn accordance with the law and the Company's Bylaws, the Chief Executive Officer is vested with extensive powers to act in the Company's name. He exercises these powers within the limits of the corporate scope and subject to those powers expressly attributed by the law and the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors. He is supported in this task by the Executive Committee and any Delegate CEOs.\n\nArticle 2 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors provides that the Chief Executive Officer must obtain the Board's prior authorization before committing the Company to:\n\n- -investments or divestments exceeding 200 million euros per transaction falling within the consolidation scope, and when the total consolidated exposure exceeds the Board's prior authorization for such an investment; or",

Where relevant, the Board of Directors must be kept informed of any significant new developments regarding such transactions.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer must also obtain the authorization of the Board of Directors annually, within caps determined by the latter, to issue sureties, endorsements or guarantees or for the Company to issue bonds or similar securities or arrange syndicated bank loans.\n\n## 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees\n\nThe Executive Committee, under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for managing the Group and coordinating the  implementation  of  its  strategic  guidelines.  It  oversees  the\n\n- 5\n\nachievement  of  operational,  employee-related  and  technical objectives, as well as those relating to the allocation of financial resources. Its meetings are generally held weekly. In addition, given the importance of issues relating to France, the Executive Committee meets regularly as the 'France Territory Committee' to deal with issues specific to this country. The composition of the Executive Committee is set out in Section 5.1.3 Executive Committee.\n\nWithin the Company, a series of powers and signing authorities is established by the Chief Executive Officer for each of the members of the Executive Committee, each of whom has applied them in their respective area of expertise.\n\nSeveral  specialized  committees  reporting  to  the  Executive Committee were created to apply or oversee the implementation of its directives throughout the Group. As part of the 'New Company Model' project, which is the core of the Lead the future strategy, the Group's committee structure was reviewed with an eye to simplification and streamlining.\n\nThe Group's governance is now supported by 10 key committees: the  Development  Committee;  the  Workforce  &  Com&Ben Committee; the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee; the CSR and Ethics Committee; the Commitments Committee; the Supplier Industrial Strategy Committee; the Group Investment Committee; the Group Risk Committee; the Group Security Committee; and the Brand, Communications and Customer Experience Committee. Each committee has adopted a charter defining its operating and resolution procedures. These committees are also responsible for monitoring risk management with regard to financial liabilities, thereby helping limit the Group's overall exposure.\n\n| Name and frequency   |    | Composition (permanent members)                               | Roles                                |\n|----------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Development          | -  | Chief Executive Officer (Chairwoman)                          | Coordinate between BUs/M&A/Group     |\n| Committee            | -  | Group Strategy Director (Secretary)                           | Strategy Director in the upstream    |\n| (every six weeks)    | -  | Group Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development | phases of M&A projects to facilitate |\n|                      | -  | Executive Director of Human Resources for the Group           | interactions and ensure the overall  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

        "page_content": "## 5.4 Compensation and benefits paid to Directors, Officers and Senior Management\n\n## 5.4.1 Report of the Board of Directors on compensation and benefits paid to Corporate Officers\n\nThe Company refers in general, and in particular with regard to compensation, to the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code for listed companies in its revised version of December 2022.\n\nThis report presents the itemized total compensation and benefits of any kind paid to Directors and Officers during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, or awarded in respect of that same fiscal year, as well as the compensation policy for Directors and Officers for their terms of office, pursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 I. of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThis report was prepared under the aegis of the Governance and Corporate  Social  and  Environmental  Responsibility  Committee (GCSERC).\n\n## 5.4.1.1 Compensation policy for executive and non-executive Corporate Officers\n\nThe compensation policy for executive Corporate Officers is in line with the Group's strategic guidelines. It is not only a management tool for attracting, motivating, and retaining the talent the Company needs, but also meets the expectations of shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nThe compensation policy for Corporate Officers is set by the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the GCSERC, while taking into account applicable laws (particularly Articles L. 22-10-8 and L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code), and recommendations from the Afep-Medef Code.\n\nIt includes a clawback mechanism that came into effect in 2023 as  required  by  the  US  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission (SEC), mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act and incorporated into the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) regulations concerning the listing standards relating to recovery of erroneously awarded compensation.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe  general  principles  and  criteria  for  the  compensation  and assessment of Directors and Officers are prepared and examined by the GCSERC, which then makes recommendations to the Board of Directors for decision.\n\nThe  GCSERC  may  use  external  benchmarks  to  evaluate  the positioning  of  the  compensation  of  Directors  and  Officers.  In this respect, surveys are periodically conducted with the help of a firm specializing in executive compensation to ensure that compensation levels and structures are competitive in relation to a panel of comparable companies in size and complexity, including companies based in France and internationally that are the Group's competitors in telecommunications and the digital transformation, as well as services companies where the French State holds less than a majority of the capital.\n\nThe GCSERC ensures the proper alignment of the compensation policies for the Company's executive Corporate Officers and other Senior Management in terms of the annual variable compensation and Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) involving the awarding of performance shares, and more generally the balance of Orange's compensation packages with the analysis of changes in internal pay ratios.\n\nCorporate Officers do not participate in discussions of the Board of Directors about their own compensation.\n\n## Compensation structure for executive Corporate Officers (Chief Executive Officer and any Delegate Chief Executive Officers)\n\nThe compensation structure for executive Corporate Officers mainly consists of fixed compensation, annual variable compensation, multi-year variable compensation and a supplemental retirement plan.\n\n## Fixed compensation\n\nThe fixed compensation of Corporate Officers is based on:\n\n- -the importance and complexity of their responsibilities;\n- -the experience and background of the individuals holding the various positions;\n- -market analyses for comparable positions.\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\nThe purpose of annual variable compensation is to inspire executive Corporate Officers to achieve the annual performance targets set for them by the Board of Directors, in line with the Group's strategic guidelines. Pursuant to the Afep-Medef Code, the potential amount of variable compensation is expressed as a percentage of fixed compensation.\n\nVariable compensation depends on performance levels applied to financial and non-financial indicators, with both reflecting the overall performance expected. The entire variable compensation is based on a quantitative performance measurement, including for the non-financial indicators.\n\n## Multi-year variable compensation\n\nOrange offers executive Corporate Officers a performance share plan (Long Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP) for their multi-year variable compensation, subject to the achievement of financial, market, social and environmental objectives, to retain talent and further align their compensation with that of the company's shareholders, in line with market practices. The members of the Executive Committee and some employees holding key positions within the Orange group are also eligible for the plan.\n\nIn addition to the performance conditions, the vesting of the shares is subject to the executive Corporate Officers still being in office on the date the performance conditions assessment is completed. Beneficiaries must hold in registered form at least 50% of the shares thus granted to them until the end of their term of office.\n\nIn the event that a beneficiary's corporate office comes to an end, the Board may decide whether or not they may keep an unvested performance share plan, in which case, the maximum number of performance shares that may be granted will be prorated to the length of time the employee was with the company.\n\nThe use of a multi-year cash incentive variable compensation plan may again be considered in the future if regulatory changes or any other circumstances were to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to use a performance-based share plan.\n\n- 5\n\n5",

In such cases, they do not receive compensation (e.g. 'attendance compensation') for the offices held.\n\n## Clawback mechanism\n\nFollowing changes in US regulations for companies listed in the United  States,  a  clawback  mechanism  for  recovering  certain incentive-based compensation, both annual and multi-year, partially or wholly contingent on the attainment of financial performance indicators, came into effect in 2023. It will affect the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee, in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with a financial reporting requirement, or to an error that would be material in this context or could lead to a material misstatement.\n\n## Supplemental retirement plan\n\nIn addition to the mandatory and supplementary pension plans, a supplemental retirement plan has been set up for executive Corporate Officers. Under this plan, the Company pays an annual matching contribution, half of which comprises premiums paid to a third-party organization under a defined-contribution retirement plan (an 'Article 82' plan) and half consists of a cash sum, since enrollment  in  the  plan  gives  rise  to  immediate  taxation.  This contribution is calculated on the basis of 20% of fixed plus variable compensation. The premium paid to the third-party organization is considered as salary and therefore treated as a benefit in kind.\n\n## Plans related to involuntary termination of service or involuntary loss of corporate office\n\nWhen recruiting the Chief Executive Officer, the Company realized that the compensation package of her predecessor, who was not under an employment contract with the Company in accordance with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, as is also the case for Christel Heydemann, did not include any severance pay should he lose his corporate office (including income replacement benefits equal to unemployment benefits), which does not align with market practices. This led the Board to decide, based on the recommendation of the GCSERC, to institute severance pay, non-compete compensation, and Compensation Insurance for Business Owners and Executive Officers (private unemployment insurance set up with Association pour la Garantie Sociale des Chefs et Dirigeants d'Enterprise - GSC) for Christel Heydemann, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn  accordance  with  Afep-Medef  Code  recommendations,  the total amount of severance pay, non-compete compensation, and Compensation  Insurance  for  Business  Owners  and  Executive\n\nOfficers may not exceed two years of compensation (annual fixed and variable).\n\nNote that the insurance premium paid to GSC for involuntary loss of office is considered as salary and treated in payroll as a benefit in kind.\n\n## Compensation structure for non-executive Corporate Officers (separated Chairman of the Board of Directors)\n\n## Fixed compensation\n\nThe fixed compensation of the separated Chairman of the Board of Directors is established by comparing the compensation levels and structures of a panel of comparable companies.\n\n## Compensation allocated to Directors (e.g. 'attendance compensation')\n\nThe Board of Directors determines how compensation is allocated among Directors for their work (e.g. 'attendance compensation'). The Board may decide that the separated Chairman of the Board will not receive compensation as a Director (see Section 5.4.2.2 Directors' compensation policy).\n\nThe non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors does not receive any other compensation (particularly variable compensation or performance shares).\n\n## Other items\n\n## Benefits in kind\n\nCorporate Officers are provided, if they so desire, with a company car  and  driver,  consulting  services  providing  personal  legal assistance related to their duties, an annual health check, and Internet/telephone access and equipment, including IT equipment, necessary to perform their duties.\n\nNote that the premiums paid by the Company under the 'Article 82' supplemental retirement plan for executive Corporate Officers, together with the insurance premiums for involuntary loss of office paid to GSC, are considered as salary and treated in payroll as a benefit in kind.\n\nFurthermore, expenses incurred by Corporate Officers in the course of their duties are reimbursed by the Company upon presentation of receipts.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nExecutive Corporate Officers are enrolled in the Orange group's death and disability and supplementary health insurance plans under the same conditions as enrolled employees.",

Christel Heydemann was allocated 'attendance compensation' for her role as Company Director until she was appointed Orange's Chief Executive Officer.\n- (2) As part of the defined-contribution retirement plan ('Article 82' plan), Christel Heydemann has benefitted from a cash sum since April 4, 2022, because enrollment in the plan gives rise to immediate taxation. This cash sum represents 50% of the contribution which is calculated on the basis of 20% of her fixed plus variable compensation (see Section 5.4.1.1 Compensation policy for executive and non-executive Corporate Officers).\n\n## Annual fixed compensation\n\nIn accordance with the resolutions approved by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 23, 2023, the compensation of Christel Heydemann was set at 900,000 euros annually.\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\nIn respect of fiscal year 2022, Christel Heydemann received variable compensation in 2023 of 616,970 euros. These amounts were approved by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 23, 2023 (ex post say-on-pay).\n\nFor  fiscal  year  2022,  Christel  Heydemann  received  variable performance-related compensation of 100% of her annual fixed compensation, and up to 150% for over performance.\n\n## Reminder of targets and results achieved for 2023\n\nFor fiscal year 2023, executive Corporate Officers' annual variable compensation  was  based  on  the  weighted  average  of  five indicators focusing on the Group's growth (organic revenue growth rate),  profitability  (organic  cash  flow  from  telecom  activities  &\n\nEBITDAaL), quality of service, and CSR performance. The expected performance levels were set by the Board of Directors, with financial indicators based on the Group's budget.\n\nAnnual  variable  compensation  for  2023  was  calculated  using a flexible payout curve whereby each indicator was assigned an achievement rate based on actual performance.\n\n## Organic revenue growth (for 15%)\n\nThe revenue growth target (on a comparable basis) set for the executive Corporate Officers for 2023 was in line with the Group's budget. With results exceeding the budget by 20 million euros, the achievement rate of this indicator is at 103.7%.\n\n## Organic cash /flow from telecom activities (for 15%)\n\nThe  target  for  organic  cash  flow  of  telecom  activities  set  for the executive Corporate Officers for 2023 was in line with the Group's budget. With organic cash flow from telecom activities of 3,661 million euros, the achievement rate of this indicator is at 140.3%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

These surveys are conducted in  several  countries:  in  France,  in  the  Europe  region  and  the MEA region, and with the B2B customers of Orange Business. Geographic and functional measurement scopes are relatively unchanged from fiscal year 2022.\n\nFor 2023, the target for the B2C indicator was 82.20 and the actual was 81.90.

The flexible payout curve put the achievement rate for the B2B indicator is at 20.00%.\n\n## CSR performance (for 33%)\n\nThe aim was to achieve overall progress in three CSR components:\n\n- -16.50% for the employee survey; this CSR performance criterion remains critically important for a group such as Orange, which will continue to use an independent firm to measure it. The result is examined on the basis of two themes:\n- -8.25% for the participation rate.\n\nThis indicator gave a score of 100.00%;\n\n- -8.25% for the results of the employee survey.\n\nThis indicator gave a score of 50.00%;\n\n- 8.25% for the proportion of women in management networks. This indicator gave a score of 133.30%;\n- -\n- -8.25% for access to training.\n\nThis indicator gave a score of 150.00%.",

The Board has, however, looked into the components of this remuneration, and in order to better reflect the Group's priorities for the Chief Executive Officer, has made modifications:\n\n- -in the annual variable remuneration:\n- -modification of the balance between Revenue (from 15% to 10%) and organic cash flow (from 15% to 20%);\n- -removal of the management network feminization rate, which represented a weight of 8.25%, as it is already present in the LTIP;\n- -introduction  of  a CO 2 emissions  reduction  indicator  scopes 1 and 2, with a weight of 8.25%;\n- -refocusing of the access rate to training on strategic skills training for the Group (Compliance and Cybersecurity);\n\n-\n\n- in the multi-year variable remuneration:\n- -introduction of an indicator 'Renewable energy share in electricity  consumption',  replacing  the CO 2 emissions reduction indicator - scopes 1 and 2, which has been introduced in the annual variable remuneration;\n- -modification  of  the  comparison  reference  of  the  Total Shareholder Return (TSR) indicator, to compare with a 'peer group' of European groups in the Telecommunications sector;\n- -within the limit of the maximum allocation level (see below), if  the  Orange  TSR  indicator  or  the  organic  cash  flow indicator of telecom activities exceed the target at 100% but the composite indicator target is not achieved at 100%, the overall performance will take these results into account while maintaining a global acquisition rate capped at 100%.\n\n## Annual fixed compensation\n\nThe Board of Directors has not made any changes to the levels of annual fixed compensation for the Corporate Officers:\n\n- -the annual fixed compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, Christel Heydemann, remains unchanged at 900,000 euros;\n- -the annual fixed compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Jacques Aschenbroich, remains unchanged at 450,000 euros.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code, this fixed compensation for Corporate Officers is subject to resolutions that will be submitted for a vote by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 23, 2023 (ex-ante 'say-on-pay') (see  Section 6.5  Draft resolutions, twelfth through fourteenth resolutions).",

This LTIP is the subject of a resolution aimed at authorizing the Board to grant free shares to executive corporate officers and certain employees of the Company or of companies or groups linked to the Company, the vote on which will be submitted for the approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders on May 22, 2024 (see section 6.5 Draft resolutions, twenty-eighth-nineteenth resolution). The total number of shares granted free of charge may not represent more than 0.12% of the capital, it being specified that the total number of shares granted free of charge to the Chief Executive Officer may not exceed 70,000 shares.\n\nIn the event that the General Meeting of Shareholders of May 22, 2024 does not approve the seventeenth resolution, the Board of Directors may decide to grant the LTIP 2024-2026 in cash.\n\n## Conditions of performance\n\nThe definitive acquisition of the shares is subject to the achievement of performance conditions. The Board of Directors has selected the following performance indicators for the LTIP 2024-2026, the duration of which remains set at three years:\n\n- -a market indicator, the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) based on the relative performance of the total return for the shareholder over three financial years, compared to a panel of European groups  in  the  Telecommunications  sector  included  in  the Stoxx Europe 600 Telecommunications reference index, with a weighting of 30%. The TSR appreciation period compares the respective values of the indicators in the fourth quarter of 2023 (last quarter preceding the plan) and in the fourth quarter of 2026 (last quarter of the plan);\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

This applies in case the TSR or the organic cash flow for telecom activities targets are overachieved, it being noted that this level of fixed outperformance limits the effects of an offsetting, if any, where the other thresholds are not reached while remaining incentive for all the beneficiaries.\n\nThe total vesting for all of the above-mentioned indicators will in any case be capped at 100% for the CEO, Christel Heydemann, which corresponds to a maximum of 70,000 performance shares. The possibility to outperform such criteria applies in a transitory manner to the 2024-2026 LTIP, and the Board reserves the possibility to review the remuneration of the CEO in the future during her mandate as board member.\n\n## Presence Condition\n\nThe definitive acquisition of shares is subject to the condition that the executive corporate officers who are beneficiaries are still in office on the date of assessment of the performance conditions.\n\nHowever, in the event of termination of the beneficiary's duties before the expiry of a three-year LTIP application period, the Board may decide to maintain the unacquired performance share plans under the following conditions:\n\n- -if the termination of the beneficiary's duties results from death or disability, the TSR, organic cash flow and CSR indicator objectives will be deemed to have been met over the 3-year period;\n- -if the termination of the beneficiary's duties results from the loss of his or her corporate mandate leading to his or her departure from the Group:\n- -performance  conditions  will  be  assessed  taking  into account the changes validated for each year until the end of the plan, i.e. without modification of the performance conditions,\n- -the allocation of shares will be made pro rata temporis based on his or her actual presence in the company as an executive corporate officer.\n\nIt is specified, if necessary, that if the beneficiary is no longer an executive corporate officer but remains in the Group during the LTIP period, he or she retains his or her right to share allocation under the plan.\n\n## Peer group\n\nThe peer group considered for the LTIP 2024-2026 will consist, apart from Orange SA, of the following 16 companies, which are currently included in the Stoxx Europe 600 T\u00e9l\u00e9communications index: BT Group Plc, Cellnex Telecom, Deutsche Telekom AG, Elisa Corp., Freenet, Inwit (Infrastrutture Wireless Italiane SpA), KPN,  Millicom  Intl.,  Swisscom  AG,  Tele2,  Telecom  Italia  SpA, Telef\u00f3nica SA, Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland, Telenor ASA, Telia Co. AB and Vodafone Group Plc.\n\n## Maximum award\n\nThe  number  of  performance  shares  awarded  under  the  LTIP 2024-2026 will be 70,000 for the Chief Executive Officer, Christel Heydemann. This is the maximum amount that can be awarded, subject to performance and continued employment conditions.\n\n## Lock-up period\n\nWhen  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  authorizes  the  award  of performance shares, executive Corporate Officers must keep at least 50% of the shares they receive as registered shares until the end of their terms of office.",

        "page_content": "## Plans related to termination of service or loss of corporate office\n\n## Loss of corporate office\n\nThe  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  May 19,  2022  approved  the compensation  policy  for  executive  Corporate  Officers,  which includes measures related to the termination of duties or loss of corporate  office  (severance  pay,  non-compete  compensation, and Compensation Insurance for Business Owners and Executive Officers). These measures have not been revised since then nor undergone any material changes within the meaning of Article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code, and therefore remain valid and in force with respect to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## Severance pay\n\nIf her corporate office is revoked or not renewed and this is not due to gross misconduct or gross negligence, the Company will pay the Chief Executive Officer gross severance pay equal to 12 months of fixed compensation and annual variable compensation, calculated based on the last fixed compensation plus the annual variable compensation paid, with the latter being calculated based on the average annual variable compensation paid for the last 24 months prior to departure from the Company. This compensation will only be due if the performance conditions for annual variable compensation for the two years prior to departure from the Company were achieved at an average of at least 90%. In accordance with AfepMedef Code recommendations, the total amount of severance pay, non-compete compensation, and Compensation Insurance for Business Owners and Executive Officers may not exceed two years of compensation (annual fixed and variable).\n\n## Non-compete agreement\n\nIn order to protect the Group's legitimate interests, and considering her duties and the strategic information to which she has access as the Chief Executive Officer, undertakes, for a period of one year starting from the day she ceases to perform her functions, not to work for or manage a telecommunication operator in the European Union, directly or indirectly, personally or through a third party, in any way or for any purpose, on her own behalf or on behalf of a third party.\n\nThe  non-compete  compensation  will  be  a  gross  amount equal to 12 months of fixed compensation and annual variable compensation, with the variable compensation being calculated based on the average annual variable compensation paid for the last 24 months prior to leaving the Company. Subject to the Board of Directors' approval, the Company may decide to release the CEO from this commitment at its sole discretion.\n\nOrange  has  taken  out  Compensation  Insurance  for  Business Owners and Executive Officers for its Chief Executive Officer. This policy will provide the Chief Executive Officer with replacement income (subject to the policy's terms and conditions) if the Company ever decides to revoke her corporate office. Orange is paying the full amount of the contribution and it is treated as a benefit in kind.\n\nThis  unemployment  insurance  provides  for  the  payment  of compensation in proportion to the Corporate Officer's previous income in the event of involuntary loss of corporate office.\n\nIn the event that the Chief Executive Officer involuntarily loses her corporate office, she will receive compensation once 12 months have elapsed since the effective date of enrollment in the policy. This is known as the waiting period.\n\n## Clawback mechanism\n\nAnnual and multi-year variable compensation paid to the Chief Executive Officer is subject to a clawback mechanism which, if triggered, would require the Chief Executive Officer to return all or some of her variable compensation, partially or wholly contingent on the achievement of financial performance indicators, for the periods concerned (within the retroactive limit of three fiscal years from the date of the decision to publish the restated financial statements or the date of an administrative or judicial decision to do so). This mechanism will apply in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to omissions or misstatements which, individually or collectively, are material and could influence economic decisions made on the basis of published financial statements. The share of this compensation to be recovered is the amount received in excess of what would have been awarded, paid or been due had there not been any such accounting restatements.\n\n## Supplemental retirement plan\n\nIn 2022, the Board of Directors decided to set up what is called an 'Article 82' (defined-contribution) supplemental retirement plan for executive Corporate Officers. Under this plan, the Company pays an annual matching contribution, half of which comprises premiums paid to a third-party organization under a defined-contribution retirement plan (an 'Article 82' plan) and half consists of a cash sum, since enrollment in the plan gives rise to immediate taxation. This contribution is calculated on the basis of 20% of fixed plus variable compensation. The premium paid to the third-party organization is considered as salary and therefore treated as a benefit in kind.\n\n## Benefits in kind\n\nIn  addition  to  paying  the  contribution  for  the  Compensation Insurance for Business Owners and Executive Officers for the Chief Executive Officer, and premiums for the supplemental retirement plan (see above), she may also receive, if she wishes, a company car with driver, personal legal assistance related to her duties, an annual health check, and Internet/telephone access and equipment, including IT equipment, necessary to perform her duties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n- 5",

The Chairman of the Board of Directors also receives annual fixed compensation and the Chief Executive Officer waived her right to receive the compensation that\n\nwould have been allocated to her in respect of her directorship. The variable share of this compensation, linked to attendance and participation in the work of the Board and its committees, represents 79.02% of the sums to be paid in respect of fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe compensation of Directors who are not Corporate Officers will be paid in the month following the Shareholders' Meeting of May 22, 2024, subject to approval. Compensation allocated to Directors representing the French State will be paid to the State budget. In addition, the Directors elected by employees have requested that the compensation for their corporate offices be paid to their trade union.\n\n| Compensation for activity  (in euros)   | Gross

For Directors who are not deemed independent under this Code, in 2016 Orange issued an Orange 'governance policy' and a 'Directors charter' under its internal 'Orange Directors' program. As such, the Chief Executive Officer/Director and employee Directors who may hold a corporate office in a Group subsidiary included in the scope of consolidation within the meaning of Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code will not receive any compensation in this respect.\n\nThe proposed compensation policy will apply from January 1, 2024, subject to approval by the Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of May 22, 2024.\n\n## 5.4.2.3 Other  compensation\n\nThe following table sets out the prorata compensation paid, for the duration of their office over the fiscal year, to the Directors elected by employees and the Directors representing employee shareholders, excluding compensation for their activities as Directors who are not Corporate Officers (as mentioned above).\n\n| Gross amounts  (in euros)   | Amounts  paid in 2023   | Amounts  paid in 2022   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Thierry Chatelier  (1)      | 151,393                 | 65,322                  |\n| S\u00e9bastien Crozier           | 219,833                 | 218,884                 |\n| Vincent Gimeno              | 126,092                 | 114,098                 |\n| Magali Vall\u00e9e               | 45,592                  | 42,305                  |\n\nThis amount includes all compensation paid in respect of the 2023 fiscal year: gross salaries, bonuses (including annual variable compensation),  benefits  in  kind,  profit  sharing  and  incentives (excluding any employer's matching contribution as regards the last two items) and, where applicable, LTIP shares awarded.\n\nThe Directors elected by employees and the Directors representing employee  shareholders  are  employed  by  Orange SA  as  civil servants or private company employees contractually covered by the French telecommunication collective bargaining agreement.\n\nWith the exception of this compensation, Directors who are not Corporate Officers receive no compensation other than that paid for their office.\n\nFurthermore, there are no contracts linking any member of the Board of Directors to Orange SA or any of its subsidiaries that provide for the granting of any benefits to this Director at the end of his or her term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n- 5",

Executive Committee.\n\nThe  overall  gross  amount,  excluding  employer  social  security contributions, of compensation due for the 2023 fiscal year from Orange SA and the controlled companies to all members of the Orange Executive Committee is 14,981,117 euros .\n\nThis amount includes all compensation due in respect of the 2023 fiscal  year:  gross  salaries,  bonuses  (including  annual  variable compensation),  benefits  in  kind,  profit  sharing  and  incentives (excluding any employer's matching contribution as regards the last two items) and LTIP shares awarded.\n\nFor members who were not part of the Executive Committee for the full year 2023, compensation has been calculated prorata temporis for reasons of comparability.\n\nThe  annual  variable  compensation  taken  into  account  for  the members of the Executive Committee excluding Directors and Officers is the target amount for 2023 to be paid in 2024. For Directors and Officers, the variable portion included is the part due for 2023, to be paid in 2024.\n\nThe  employment  contracts  of  the  members  of  the  Executive Committee (excluding Corporate Officers), signed from January 1, 2015, include a clause providing for contractual severance pay not exceeding 15 months of salary based on total gross annual compensation  (including  any  termination  pay  provided  for  by contractual agreements).\n\nThe 'claw-back' mechanism (see Section 5.4.1.1 Compensation policy for executive and non-executive Corporate Officers)  for recovering certain incentive-based compensation shall apply to\n\nmembers of the Executive Committee, subject to compliance with applicable local laws, within the same timeframe.\n\nThe members of the Executive Committee do not receive any compensation  for  the  corporate  offices  they  hold  in  Orange subsidiaries.\n\nThey did not receive any stock options during the 2023 fiscal year, as Orange did not award any stock options to employees.\n\nExecutive Committee members also benefit from performance share plans (LTIP).\n\nUnder the LTIP 2021-2023, a maximum of 216,000 Orange shares were available for award to all Executive Committee members.\n\nThe Board of Directors, called upon to award free shares under the LTIP 2024-2026, which is the subject of the seventeenth resolution to be voted on by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 22, 2024, will determine the maximum number of shares available to each member of the Executive Committee, subject to approval of said resolution, with the exception of the Chief Executive Officer for whom the maximum is voted on by the Shareholders' Meeting under the ex-ante 'say-on-pay' mechanism.\n\n## Stock options awarded to the top ten employees and options exercised by them\n\nDuring the 2023 fiscal year, neither Orange SA nor any other Group company awarded any stock options to employees.\n\nThere have been no stock option plans in effect since 2017, when the last Orange SA stock option plan matured. Therefore, no stock options were exercised during the fiscal year.",

The regulations governing the mutual funds state that voting rights attached to securities held as fund assets are exercised by the Supervisory Boards of these funds. In the absence of an express reference in the regulations to cases where the Supervisory Boards must gather the prior opinions of holders, the Supervisory Boards decide whether or not to take securities held as fund assets to public tender or exchange offers, in accordance with Article L. 214-164 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.\n\nAs of the date of this document, to Orange's knowledge, no shareholder other than the French State, Bpifrance Participations and Group employees (in particular via the Orange Actions mutual fund) held, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the capital or voting rights.\n\n## 6.2.1.1\n\n## Changes in the distribution of capital held by major shareholders over the last three fiscal years\n\nIn the last three fiscal years, the Company has bought and sold treasury shares and, in particular, in December 2023 it bought 1,300,000 treasury shares under its 2023 share Buyback program (see Section 6.1.4 Treasury shares - Share Buyback program). These  purchases  were  made  to  meet  obligations  related  to employee share allocation programs. To Orange's knowledge, there has been no major change in the distribution of capital and voting rights since December 31, 2023.\n\n## 6.2.1.2 Information on shareholders' agreements\n\nOn February 23, 2016, the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorit\u00e9  des  march\u00e9s  financiers  -  AMF)  was  notified  of  the execution, on February 18, 2016, of a new shareholders' agreement between the French Republic and Bpifrance Participations. This agreement replaces the previous shareholders' agreement signed between the same parties on December 24, 2012, formalizing their existing concerted action with respect to their shareholdings in Orange.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 6\n\n6",

At December 19, 2023, institutional investors held 62.16% of the capital (down 0.39 points compared with 2022) and individual investors held 6.86% (up 0.07 points compared with 2022).\n\n## Geographical distribution of institutional investors at December 19, 2023\n\n| France                   | 26%   |\n|--------------------------|-------|\n| United Kingdom           | 19%   |\n| Other European countries | 17%   |\n| Europe total             | 62%   |\n| North America            | 34%   |\n| Rest of the world        | 4%    |\n| Total                    | 100%  |\n\nSource: IBS survey.\n\n## 6.2.2 Direct or indirect control of Orange SA\n\nAs of the date of this document, the public sector (French State and Bpifrance Participations) has three representatives out of a total of 15 members on the Board of Directors of Orange (see Section 5.1.1 Board of Directors).\n\nOrange's major shareholder is the public sector: the French State, which, in concert with Bpifrance Participations, held 22.95% of the share capital and 28.94% of voting rights at December 31, 2023. As is the case with all Orange's shareholders, these shares carry double voting rights when held in registered form for over two years (see  Section 6.2.1.2  Information on shareholders' agreements and Section 6.2.1 Distribution of capital and voting rights above). While not giving it as such the ability to exercise control over the Company, this level of holding could, based on the attendance rate at Shareholders' Meetings in the past, allow the public sector to block the adoption of resolutions requiring a qualified majority vote by the shareholders.\n\nIn light of the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, Orange has put in place Corporate Governance rules to ensure the proper operation of the Board of Directors and its specialist committees in respecting the interests of all shareholders. The Board of Directors comprises seven Independent Directors, one of whom serves as Chairman (see Section 5.2 Operation of the management and supervisory bodies). Orange therefore feels there is no risk that the French State may exercise control in an abusive manner.\n\nNo other natural or legal persons exercise or could exercise control over Orange, either directly or indirectly, or individually, jointly or in concert.\n\nTo Orange's knowledge, there is no agreement which, if implemented, could, at a later date, entail a change in its control.\n\n## 6.3 Dividend distribution policy\n\nThe  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  May 23,  2023  decided  on  the distribution of a dividend of 0.70 euros per share for the fiscal year 2022. Taking into account the 0.30-euro interim dividend paid on December 7, 2022, the balance of the dividend distributed by the Shareholders' Meeting was 0.40 euros per share and was paid in cash on June 7, 2023.\n\nOn July 25, 2023, the Board of Directors decided on the distribution of an interim dividend of 0.30 euros per share in respect of 2023. The interim dividend was paid in cash on December 6, 2023.\n\nIn line with the solid growth in its organic cash flow, Orange intends, subject  to  shareholders'  approval,  to  increase  its  dividend  to\n\n0.72 euros per share for fiscal year 2023 (including the distribution of an interim dividend of 0.30 euros per share in December 2023) and to reach a new floor of 0.75 euros per share in respect of the 2024 fiscal year.\n\n## Past dividend payments\n\n| Fiscal year                    |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Dividend per  share (in euros) |    0.7 |    0.7 |    0.9 |    0.5 |    0.7 |",

        "page_content": "## 6.4 Statutory information on shares and Shareholders' Meetings\n\n## 6.4.1 Rights, preferences and restrictions attached to shares\n\nOrange has only issued ordinary shares. Each share entitles its holder to a portion of the corporate profits and assets proportional to the amount of capital represented thereby. Furthermore, each share entitles its holder to vote and be represented in the Shareholders' Meetings in accordance with the provisions of the law and of the Bylaws. Ownership of one share implies, ipso jure, adherence to the Bylaws and the decisions of the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThere is no clause in the Bylaws providing for double or multiple voting rights for Orange shareholders. However, in accordance with the law, double voting rights are automatically granted to all shares held in registered form by the same holder for at least two years.\n\nThe shareholders are only liable for losses within the limits of their contributions to the Company's capital.\n\n## Payment of dividends\n\nThe terms and conditions for the payment of the dividends approved by the Shareholders' Meeting are determined by the Shareholders' Meeting, or failing this, by the Board of Directors. However, cash dividends must be paid within a maximum of nine months after the close of the fiscal year, unless extended by court order. The\n\nOrdinary Shareholders' Meeting may grant each shareholder, for all or part of the dividends to be distributed, an option of payment of the dividends either in cash or in shares, subject to legal requirements.\n\nInterim dividends may be distributed before the approval of the financial statements for the fiscal year when the balance sheet established during or at the end of a fiscal year and certified by a Statutory Auditor shows that the Company has made a profit since the close of the last fiscal year, after recognizing the necessary depreciation, amortization and provisions and after deducting prior losses, if any, and the sums to be allocated to reserves, as required by law or the Bylaws, and including any retained earnings. The amount of such interim dividends may not exceed the amount of the profit thus defined.\n\nDividends not claimed within five years after the payment date revert to the French State.\n\n## Disposal and transfer of shares\n\nShares are freely tradable, subject to applicable legal and regulatory provisions.  They  are  registered  in  a  share  account  and  are transferred by means of a transfer order from account to account.\n\n## 6.4.2 Actions necessary to modify shareholders' rights\n\nShareholders' rights may be modified as allowed by law. Only the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting is authorized to amend any and all provisions of the Bylaws. The Meeting may not, however,\n\nincrease shareholder commitments, except for properly executed transactions resulting from a share consolidation.\n\n## 6.4.3 Rules for participation in and notice of Shareholders' Meetings\n\n## Access to, participation in and voting rights at Shareholders' Meetings\n\nShareholders'  Meetings  are  composed  of  all  shareholders whose shares are fully paid-up and for whom a right to attend Shareholders' Meetings has been established by registration of their shares in an account in the name either of the shareholder or of the intermediary holding their account, where the shareholder is not resident in France, by midnight (Paris time) on the second business day preceding the Meeting.\n\nThe shares must be registered within the time limit specified above, either in an account in their own name maintained by the Company, or in the bearer share accounts maintained by an authorized intermediary.\n\nIf  it  sees  fit  to  do  so,  the  Board  of  Directors  may  distribute personalized admission cards to shareholders and require them to produce these cards at the Meeting.\n\nShareholders participating via video-conferencing or other means of telecommunication which meet legal and regulatory conditions and allow identification shall be deemed present for the calculation of the quorum and majority at Shareholders' Meetings. The Board of Directors organizes, in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, the participation and voting of these shareholders at\n\nthe Shareholders' Meeting, assuring, in particular, the effectiveness of the means of identification.\n\nAny shareholder may, in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, vote remotely or grant a proxy to any other natural or legal person of his or her choice. Shareholders may, in accordance with  legal  and  regulatory  requirements,  send  their  ballot  or proxy, either in hard copy or via electronic means, no later than 3.00 pm (Paris time) on the day before the Shareholders' Meeting. Transmission methods are specified by the Board of Directors in the meeting notice and the convocation notice.\n\nShareholders voting remotely, within the time limit specified in the Bylaws, by means of the ballot provided by the Company to shareholders, are deemed present or represented at the Meeting.\n\nThe remote or proxy ballots and the certificate of attendance may be completed in electronic format duly signed under the conditions provided for in the applicable laws and regulations. For this purpose, the ballot can be filled in and electronically signed directly on the website established by the organizer of the Meeting.\n\nShareholders not resident in France may be represented at a Shareholders'  Meeting  by  a  registered  intermediary  who  may participate subject to legal requirements.\n\n- 6\n\n6",

Meetings are held at the headquarters or at any other location indicated in the convocation notice. Subject to exceptions provided by law, notice must be given at least 15 days before the date of the Shareholders' Meeting. When the Shareholders' Meeting cannot deliberate due to the lack of the required quorum, the second Meeting and, if applicable, the second postponed Meeting, must be convened at least ten days in advance in the same manner as the first.\n\n## Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting\n\nOrdinary Shareholders' Meetings are called to make any and all decisions that do not amend the Bylaws. An Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting is convened at least once a year within six months of the end of each fiscal year in order to approve the Statutory Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year in question or, in the case of postponement, within the period established by court order. When convened for the first time, the\n\nMeeting only validly deliberates if the shareholders present or represented by proxy or voting remotely represent at least one-fifth of the shares with voting rights. When the Meeting is convened for the second time, no quorum is required. Decisions are made by a majority of the votes held by the shareholders present, represented by proxy or voting remotely.\n\n## Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting\n\nOnly the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting is authorized to amend any and all provisions of the Bylaws. Subject to the legal provisions governing capital increases by capitalization of reserves, profits or premiums, the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting only validly deliberates if the shareholders present, represented by proxy or voting remotely represent at least one-fourth of all shares with voting rights when convened for the first time, or one-fifth when convened for the second time. If the latter quorum is not reached, the second Meeting may be postponed to a date no later than two months after the date for which it was convened. Subject to the same condition, the second Meeting makes decisions by a two-thirds majority of the shareholders present, represented by proxy, or voting remotely.\n\n## 6.4.4 Declarations of threshold crossing\n\nIn addition to the legal obligation to inform the Company and the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF) when thresholds of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 33 1/3%, 50%, 66 2/3%, 90% and 95% of the capital and voting rights are crossed, any natural or legal person, acting alone or in concert with others, that acquires, directly or indirectly, as defined by Articles L. 233-7 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, a number of shares, voting rights or securities representing shares equal to 0.5% of the capital or voting rights in Orange is required, no later than before the close of trading on the fourth trading day following the day such threshold is crossed, to declare to Orange by registered letter with return receipt, the total number of shares, voting rights and securities giving access to the capital that such natural or legal person holds.\n\nThis  declaration  must  be  repeated  in  accordance  with  the conditions indicated above each time a new 0.5% threshold is reached or crossed, whether crossing above or below, for any reason whatsoever, including beyond the 5% threshold.\n\nIn the event of failure to comply with any of the provisions set forth above, the shareholder or shareholders in question are stripped of the voting rights attached to any securities in excess of the thresholds, subject to legal provisions and limits, if one or more shareholders holding at least 0.5% of the capital or voting rights so requests at a Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## 6.5 Draft resolutions to be submitted to the Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of May 22, 2024\n\nThe draft resolutions presented below were approved by the Board of Directors at meeting of February 14, 2024. Additional draft resolutions may be included in the agenda of the Shareholders' Meeting pursuant to Article L. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe final draft of the resolutions put to the vote at the Shareholders' Meeting will be published on the website at www.orange.com, under  the  heading  Group/Finance/Shareholders'  Meeting, and in the notice provided for in Article R. 225-66 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## Resolutions within the competence of the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting\n\n## First resolution\n\n## Approval of the Statutory Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023\n\nThe Shareholders' Meeting, acting under the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary Shareholders' Meetings, having reviewed the Board of Directors' Management Report and the Statutory  Auditors'  Report,  approves  the  Statutory  Financial Statements presented for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023,  as  well  as  the  transactions  reflected  in  those  financial\n\nstatements and summarized in those reports.

Subject to the approval of this payment by the Shareholders' Meeting, and in view of the payment of an interim dividend of 0.30 euros per share on December 6, 2023, the balance of the dividend to be paid is 0.42 euros per share. It will be paid in cash.\n\nThis balance will be paid on June 6, 2024 to holders of shares entitled to receive a dividend, i.e. those holding Orange shares with dividend rights for fiscal year 2023 on the ex-dividend date (in France, that being two business days before the payment date, i.e. June 4, 2024).\n\n- 6\n\n6",

Treasury shares do not have dividends.\n\nAs the number of shares with dividends may change up until the payment date, the Shareholders' Meeting grants full powers to the Board of Directors to determine the final total amount of the dividend, plus the balance of distributable profit and, consequently, the amount to be entered under 'retained earnings.'\n\nPursuant to Article 117-quater of the French General Tax Code, natural persons domiciled in France for tax purposes are subject to a flat-rate tax on dividends received (currently 12.8%), plus the contribution provided for in Article L. 136-7 of the French Social Security Code (currently 17.2%). However, as an express and irrevocable option, such natural persons may request that the dividend be included in their overall income under the conditions provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 200 A of the French General Tax Code in order to benefit from the 40% tax allowance pursuant to Article 158-3-2 of the French General Tax Code.\n\nThe table below summarizes the amount of dividends paid with respect to the last three fiscal years, which were fully eligible for the tax allowance provided for in Article 158-3-2 of the French General Tax Code:\n\n|   Fiscal year | Number of shares  (excluding treasury  shares)   | Dividend per share   | Portion of dividend eligible for the  40% tax allowance   |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n|          2020 | 2,659,279,906                                    | 0.90 euros           | 100%                                                      |\n|          2021 | 2,658,638,101                                    | 0.70 euros           | 100%                                                      |\n|          2022 | 2,659,411,292                                    | 0.70 euros           | 100%                                                      |\n\n## Fourth resolution\n\n## Agreements provided for in Articles L. 225-38 et seq. of the French Commercial Code\n\nThe  fourth  resolution  asks  the  Shareholders'  Meeting,  having reviewed  the  Statutory  Auditors'  Special  Report  on  regulated agreements provided for in Articles L. 225-38 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, to approve a new agreement entered into by your Company.\n\nAt its meeting of June 28, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the entry into an agreement for exclusive negotiations between Orange SA and BNP Paribas relating, among others, to the referral of  Orange  Bank's  customers,  the  takeover  of  Orange  Bank's business in Spain, and the development of a partnership to finance handsets in France and Spain. The purpose of this agreement is to continue, within an exclusive framework and in the context of the potential gradual winding down of Orange Bank's business, the assessment and analysis of:\n\n- (i) a solution that offers Orange Bank's customers an alternative to terminating their banking relationship, through a referral to Hello Bank, under negotiated terms and conditions;\n- (ii) the takeover of the banking business in Spain, commitments to  support  Orange  Bank  employees,  and  any  additional financing; and\n- (iii) a strategic partnership to develop financial services.\n\nThe  details  of  this  regulated  agreement  can  be  found  in  the Statutory Auditors' Special Report (Section 6.7 of the Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document).\n\nAs such, Mr. Jacques Aschenbroich did not participate in the Board of Directors' deliberations on this agreement and will not participate in the vote on the fourth resolution proposed at the Shareholders' Meeting pursuant to Article L. 225-40 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nWith regard to previous fiscal years, no regulated agreements remained in effect in fiscal year 2023.\n\n## Fifth resolution\n\n## Reappointment of Ms. Christel Heydemann as director\n\nChristel Heydemann's term of office as director expires at the end of the Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nYou are asked to reappoint her under the conditions provided for in Article 13 of the Bylaws for a four-year term, i.e. until the end of the 2028 Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2027.\n\nMs. Christel Heydemann has simultaneously held the office of Chief Executive Officer since April 4, 2022, for a term equal to that of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, i.e. until the end of the Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2026 to approve the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025.\n\nThe meeting of Orange's Board of Directors of February 14, 2024 decided in favor of reappointing Christel Heydemann as Director of Orange.\n\nThe Board thus reaffirmed its position that her role as director is a useful and necessary complement to her position as Chief Executive Officer. It allows the Chief Executive Officer to join her peers around the Board's table, and the Board to benefit from her presence.\n\nA detailed biography of Christel Heydemann can be found in Section 5.1.1 of the Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document.\n\nChristel Heydemann has served on the Board of Directors since July 26, 2017.\n\nChristel Heydemann , born in 1974, was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Orange group on April 4, 2022.

In light of the information presented and in its possession at the time of the discussions, the Board of Directors proposes to appoint the pairing who obtained the highest number of votes in the second round, Mr. Thierry Chatelier as director representing employee shareholders, with Ms. Mireille Garcia as his replacement, for a four-year term, i.e. until the end of the Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2027.\n\nThierry Chatelier, born in 1975, is a member of the Supervisory Board of the FCPE Orange Actions mutual fund.

Should  the  replacement's  seat  become vacant, a new consultation will be held as soon as possible under the conditions set by the Bylaws.\n\n## Eighth and ninth resolutions\n\n## Appointment of Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and KPMG as sustainability reporting auditors\n\nThe selection of the auditor or auditors responsible for verifying the  compliance  of  the  sustainability  reporting  (statutory  and consolidated) as well as the information required by Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council, whose appointment is proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting, was carried out, even though this was not mandatory, using a tender process based on the recommendations for statutory auditors found in the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code for listed companies.\n\nWithout necessarily intending to engage a statutory auditor, the Audit Committee and the Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee, in conjunction with General Management, reviewed the tender process for choosing a statutory auditor, in particular the bidding process and the specifications, and monitored the review of the written applications and the interviews with the candidates. This is the context in which the candidates selected  for  appointment  by  your  Shareholders'  Meeting  were proposed to the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 14, 2024. The candidates selected were Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and KPMG which, if they are appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting, would jointly certify the sustainability reporting.\n\nTo be eligible to participate in the tender process, candidates had to have a large enough network of legally autonomous and independent entities to audit the sustainability reporting of a group with Orange's geographic footprint, as well as a high international reputation and the professional skills and qualifications needed to serve as sustainability reporting auditor. The candidates submitted for your vote unquestionably meet these requirements.\n\nThe main criteria used when choosing the candidates, for both the written applications and the in-person interviews, were an understanding  of  the  Group's  business  activities,  their  teams' expertise, the future approach to sustainability auditing that builds on the work already done for past Statements of Non-Financial Performance (SNFP), the implementation of the sustainability audit work, and the price of the bid.\n\nThe recommendation submitted to the Board of Directors aimed to jointly appoint two sustainability reporting auditors in order to ensure:\n\n- -given the novelty of the regulatory framework, dual expertise in  the  interpretation  of  texts  and  positions,  given  the complementary nature of Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and KPMG,\n\nwhich could also be an asset in promoting sector-specific positions with standardization bodies;\n\n- -there is no duplication of some of the controls, particularly in the countries, given the work done in parallel by the statutory auditors on the financial side;\n- -that KPMG's experience can be capitalized on (it has been auditing the SNFP since 2018), while bringing on another auditor (Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s), which would facilitate the transition in the event that, when the terms of office of the current statutory auditors expire in three years' time, the statutory auditors are rotated;\n- -that the Group select a lower responsible jointly presented financial bid for the Group than the bid from Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s or KPMG alone.\n\nThe potential sustainability reporting auditors have already informed the Company that they will accept this mission should there be a vote in favor of this resolution.\n\n## Tenth to twelfth resolutions\n\nApproval of the information mentioned in Article L. 22-10-9 I. of the French Commercial Code relating to the compensation of Directors and Officers presented in the Report on Corporate Governance approved by the Board of Directors, as presented in the Universal Registration Document\n\nPursuant to Article L. 22-10-34 I. of the French Commercial Code, shareholders are asked to vote on certain information included in the Report on Corporate Governance approved by the Board of Directors' Meeting of March 27, 2024 and mentioned in Article L. 22-10-9 I. of the French Commercial Code. The purpose of the tenth resolution is therefore to ask the shareholders to approve this information in particular relating to the compensation paid to all Directors and Officers during or awarded in respect of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as presented in Sections 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 of the Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document.\n\nApproval of the components of compensation paid to the Chief Executive Officer and to the Chairman of the Board of Directors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 or allocated in respect of the same fiscal year\n\nPursuant  to  Article  L. 22-10-34 II.  of  the  French  Commercial Code,  shareholders  are  asked  to  vote  on  the  compensation paid to Corporate Officers during or awarded in respect of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 by means of resolutions to be submitted to the Shareholders' Meeting for approval. In this respect, shareholders are asked to vote on a resolution regarding the individual compensation of each of the Corporate Officers:\n\n- -Christel Heydemann, Chief Executive Officer (eleventh resolution);\n- -Jacques Aschenbroich, Chairman of the Board of Directors (twelfth resolution).",

Christel Heydemann was allocated 'attendance compensation' for her role as Company Director until she was appointed Orange's Chief Executive Officer.\n- (2) As part of the defined-contribution retirement plan ('Article 82' plan), Christel Heydemann has benefitted from a cash sum since April 4, 2022, because enrollment in the plan gives rise to immediate taxation. This cash sum represents 50% of the contribution which is calculated on the basis of 20% of the fixed plus variable compensation (see Section 5.4.1.1 Compensation policy for executive and non-executive Corporate Officers).\n- (3) For welcome bonuses or payments for termination of service, see Section 5.4.1.3 of the Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document.\n- (4) For the supplemental retirement plan, see Section 5.4.1.3 of the Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document.\n- (5) For the allocation of stock options, performance shares or any components of long-term compensation, see Section 5.4.1.2 of the Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document.\n\nA detailed presentation of the compensation of Executive Corporate Officers is shown in Section 5.4.1.2 Amount of compensation paid or allocated to Executive Corporate Officers for 2023, and Section 5.4.1.3  Compensation  policy  for  the  Chief  Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors for 2024, of the Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Thirteenth to fifteenth resolutions\n\n## Approval of the compensation policy for Directors and Officers\n\nPursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code, shareholders are required to approve in a Shareholders' Meeting the compensation policy for all Directors and Officers for the fiscal year 2024.\n\nThe purpose of the thirteenth and fourteenth resolutions is to ask shareholders to vote on the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer (thirteenth resolution) and the Chairman of the Board of Directors (fourteenth resolution).\n\nThe purpose of the fifteenth resolution is to ask shareholders to vote on the compensation policy for Directors.\n\nDetails  of  this  policy  are  shown  in  the  Report  on  Corporate Governance drawn up by your Board of Directors and in particular in Sections 5.4.1.3 Compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors for 2024 and Section 5.4.2.2 Directors' compensation policy of the Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Sixteenth resolution\n\n## Authorization to be granted to the Board of Directors to purchase or transfer Orange shares\n\nYour Board of Directors asks that you authorize it to buy back Company shares within the limit of a number of shares representing 10% of the capital and at the maximum price of 24 euros per share (this price may be adjusted in the event of capital transactions). The maximum amount of funds allocated to the share Buyback program is therefore set at 6,384,135,837.60 euros.\n\nThis authorization would be valid for a period of 18 months from the date of the Shareholders' Meeting and may be implemented at any time except during a public tender offer period relating to the Company shares.\n\nThe purpose of the Buyback program would be to (i) enable the Company to fulfill obligations related to securities giving access to the capital or to stock option programs or any other type of share allocation to employees (in particular, free share awards or employee shareholding  plans),  (ii) ensure  the  liquidity  of  Orange  shares pursuant to a liquidity contract with an investment services provider in compliance with French Financial Markets Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF) Decision no. 2021-01 of June 22, 2021, (iii)  retain shares to deliver in exchange or in payment for external growth transactions, and (iv) reduce the Company's capital, and (v) to carry out any market practice that may be authorized by the French Financial Markets Authority and, more generally, perform any other transaction in accordance with the laws and regulations in force.\n\nThe Board of Directors will have full powers to implement this delegation and set its terms.\n\nThe adoption of this resolution would terminate the authorization to  buy  back  shares  granted  by  the  Combined  Ordinary  and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of May 23, 2023 (nineteenth resolution).\n\nThis authorization was used to purchase and sell treasury shares to honor obligations related to the share allocation programs for employees and in the context of the liquidity contract with the independent investment service provider (ISP) (Rothschild). That contract was revised in February 2019 following changes to the regulations governing liquidity contracts (see Section 6.1.4 Treasury shares - Share Buyback program of the Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document).\n\nThe Board of Directors will inform you, in its Annual Report, of share purchases, transfers or cancellations and, as the case may be, of the allocation of shares vested to the various objectives pursued.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 6\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Presentation of resolutions within the competence of the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting\n\n## Seventeenth resolution\n\nAuthorization granted to the Board of Directors to award free he Company shares to Executive Corporate Officers and certain Orange group employees and involving the waiver of shareholders' preferential subscription rights\n\nYou are once again asked this year to authorize the allocation of free Orange shares in the form of performance shares to Executive Corporate Officers and certain employees of the Company or companies or groups affiliated with the Company (subsidiaries and shareholdings). This scheme is intended to offer managers who perform key functions within the Orange group comparable schemes  to  those  offered  to  managers  holding  comparable positions in other major groups.\n\nAwards of this nature would fall within the framework of the long-term incentive plan (LTIP) for the 2024-2026 period. This LTIP, other than the Executive Corporate Officers of the Company and members of the Executive Committee who are not Executive Corporate Officers, may concern certain employees of Orange or its subsidiaries who perform key functions within the Group, subject to the same performance conditions but in the proportions to be decided by the Board of Directors following the Shareholders' Meeting of May 22, 2024 and within the limit of the overall amount approved by that meeting. These terms and conditions are described in the Report on Compensation and Benefits of Corporate Officers drawn up by your Board (see Section 5.4.1.3 Compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors for 2024).\n\nThe  characteristics  of  this  allocation  have  been  reviewed and  approved  by  your  Board  on  the  basis  of  the  GCSERC's recommendations:\n\n- -the number of shares granted is limited to 0.12% of the share capital including the shares awarded to Executive Corporate Officers of the Company, it being specified that the total number of the latter shares would be capped at 100,000;\n- -they will either be existing shares or newly issued shares;\n- -the duration of the authorization is limited to 12 months. The Board of Directors' aim is to award the free shares soon after the Shareholders' Meeting in order to allow an assessment of the performance conditions over the 2024-2026 period.\n\nThis authorization is subject to performance conditions related to:\n\n- -the amount of organic cash flow (for 40% of the final vesting amount);\n- -the level of the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) (for 30% of the final vesting amount); and\n- -CSR  criteria  (for  30%  of  the  final  vesting  amount),  which relate to the increase in the proportion of renewable energy in electricity consumption (20% of the final vesting amount) and to the increase in the proportion of women in the Group's management networks (10% of the final vesting amount) (see below).\n\nThe achievement of the organic cash flow target will be assessed on  a  multi-year  basis  over  the  entire  2024-2026  period,  its achievement will be measured in relation to the organic cash flow target established for that period to the budget. This criterion will be verified by applying a graduated system where achieving or exceeding this organic cash flow target over the period will result in 100% of the final vesting amount for this criterion.\n\nThe level of the Orange Total Shareholder Return (TSR) will be assessed:\n\n- -by comparing the Orange TSR with the TSRs of a panel of European groups in the telecommunication sector included in  the  Stoxx  Europe  600 Telecommunications  benchmark index (or any other index that might replace it) at the end of a three-year period (including the year in which the free shares are allocated);\n- -by comparing the average share price of Orange and of the companies in the panel between September 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023 (with dividends reinvested) (i.e. 10.93 euros for Orange) and the average share price of Orange and of these companies between September 1, 2026 and December 31, 2026 (with dividends reinvested);\n- -based on Orange's position relative to this comparison. Ranking at the median of the panel including Orange will result in 100% of the final vesting amount for this criterion.\n\nThe increase in the proportion of renewable energy in electricity consumption is assessed by calculating the share of renewable electricity  acquired  by  the  Group  through  Power  Purchase Agreements for renewable energy, solarization and guarantees of origin, plus that from the country mix, compared to the total electricity consumption (1) . Goals are set by region (subject to the country mix and the capacity for Power Purchase Agreements). The target is 50% by December 31, 2026, in line with the trajectory toward an electricity mix that is almost entirely low carbon in Europe and two-thirds low carbon in the MEA region in 2030.\n\nThe criterion of increasing the proportion of women in the Group's management networks will be established using the proportion of women who occupy identified key positions and who are part of the 'Leaders' and 'Executives' management networks, with the target of reaching 36% by December 31, 2026 compared with 34.1% at December 31, 2023. The proportion of women in the entire workforce at Group level was 36.2% at the end of 2023. This criterion reflects Orange's firm intention to manage and prioritize this change. It necessitates specific efforts by the Group in terms of support and training, including technical training, for the Company's female employees, both in France and abroad, and confirms the positioning of diversity and gender balance as levers for value creation.\n\nThe vesting of shares (delivery of these shares to beneficiaries) cannot occur before the vesting date, set at March 31, 2027, and under any circumstance may not be less than two years, with no mandatory minimum lock-up period for beneficiaries. However, the Company's Executive Corporate Officer beneficiaries must hold at least 50% of the shares they receive until the end of their terms of office.\n\n## Eighteenth resolution\n\nDelegation of authority to the Board of Directors to issue shares or complex securities reserved for members of savings plans and involving the waiver of shareholders' preferential subscription rights\n\nThe purpose of this resolution is to permit the issue of shares or securities giving access to Company shares, to be subscribed in cash, in favor of members of the Orange group company savings plan. Where applicable, in the event of such an issue, shares or securities giving access to Company shares could be allocated free of charge, to replace all or part of the discount provided for hereinafter and/or the employer's contributions.",

At December 31, 2023, some employees also held Orange registered shares resulting from previous transactions (in particular the free share award plan), representing 0.56% of the capital and 0.90% of the voting rights.\n\n## Nineteenth resolution\n\n## Authorization to cancel repurchased shares\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes that you authorize, for a period of 18 months from the date of the Shareholders' Meeting, the cancellation of all or part of the Orange shares that may have been  acquired,  whether  under  the  share  Buyback  program authorized under the sixteenth resolution, or under share Buyback programs prior or subsequent to the Shareholders' Meeting, and consequently, to reduce the capital.\n\nBy law, the total shares canceled per 24-month period may not exceed 10% of the Company's capital.\n\n## Twentieth resolution\n\n## Powers for formalities\n\nIt is proposed, as is customary, that the Shareholders' Meeting confer full powers on the holder of an original, a copy, or an extract of the minutes of the Shareholders' Meeting for the purposes of carrying out all legal or administrative formalities and completing all filings and public disclosures provided for under current law with respect to the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nIf the Board of Directors' proposals meet your approval, we request that you approve them by voting on the resolutions submitted to you, having reviewed the reports drawn up by the Statutory Auditors in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Additional reports in the event delegations are used\n\n## Applicable rules\n\nIf the Board of Directors uses the delegations that your Shareholders' Meeting has granted, it will draw up an additional report or, if such an additional report is not required, will inform you thereof in its Annual Report, in accordance with the laws and regulations in effect when the delegation is used.\n\nIn addition, when securities are issued pursuant to said delegations, the Statutory Auditors must draw up a report for the Board of Directors in accordance with the laws and regulations in effect when the delegation is used.\n\n## Current use\n\nThe table attached to this report shows the use made by the Board of Directors of the delegations granted for capital increases.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n- 6",
