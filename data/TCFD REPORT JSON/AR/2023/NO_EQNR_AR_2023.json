        "page_content": "## Message to stakeholders\n\n2023 was marked by energy markets becoming more complex and less predictable. Against the backdrop of geopolitical instability, supply chain bottlenecks and inflation, energy companies face di/fficult trade-o/ffs in delivering reliable, a/ffordable and sustainable energy. As the largest energy provider to Europe, Equinor continues to develop its broad portfolio to contribute to energy security. Our ambition is to be a leading company in the energy transition.\n\nSafety is our number one priority. Over the years, our safety performance has seen a positive trend. In 2023, the serious incident frequency per million hours worked (SIF) was 0.4. The number of serious incidents were measured at the lowest level so far. Tragically, however, we had a fatality on a contracted tanker in Malaysia. We also recorded two incidents with major accident potential. This is a stark reminder of the importance of our continuous improvement e/ffort to ensure that all our people return safely home from work. To safeguard our people and to meet increased geopolitical tensions and security risks, we have further reinforced the protection of assets and operations.\n\nIn 2023, we delivered strong financial results, with adjusted earnings* of USD 36 billion before tax. This is the second-best result in the history of the company, only beaten by the record results of 2022. The delivery of a solid global operational performance in 2023 resulted in a total liquids and gas production of around 2,100 mboe per day, a 2.1% growth from 2022. The strong cash flow and competitive capital distribution in the year of USD 17 billion, including share buy backs, support our goal of creating shareholder value.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nWe continued to optimise the oil and gas portfolio, both in Norway and internationally, delivering strong results. Equinor expects to deliver above 5% production growth for oil and gas from 2023 - 2026 and maintain production of around 2 million barrels per day in 2030. The outlook for Norwegian continental shelf is extended, expecting around 1.2 million barrels a day in 2035. With major projects under development, the cash flow from the international portfolio is expected to increase by 50% by 2030. With a robust financial position, we are well positioned for growth and transition.\n\nThe year included several milestones for the company. The investment decisions on Raia and Rosebank, and the increased ownership in the Linnorm discovery, show how we continued to optimise our oil and gas portfolio. The acquisition of an interest in Bayou Bend and continued maturation of carbon capture and storage projects shows how we create new market opportunities in low carbon solutions. The long-term gas sales agreement with SEFE (Germany's state-owned energy company) is one of the largest gas sales agreements that we have made, demonstrating the long-term attractiveness of natural gas to Europe. Finally, first power from Dogger Bank, the world's biggest o/ffshore wind farm, and the opening of the floating wind farm Hywind Tampen, demonstrate our capabilities to create high value growth in renewables.\n\nFor Equinor's energy transition, 2023 was marked by a focus on capacity building. Last year, 20% of our investments were directed towards renewables and low carbon solutions. We are on track to reach our ambition to invest more than 50% in profitable\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrenewables and low carbon solutions by 2030. We also strengthened our renewables portfolio, adding 8 GW to our renewables pipeline. Important milestones were the acquisitions of onshore renewables platforms BeGreen and Rio Energy. In the short term, we will see an increase in oil and gas production, but the company will alongside provide a broader energy o/ffering.\n\nOil and gas will continue to be the foundation for our value creation, supplying the energy needed and contributing to energy security. We will continue to reduce emissions from the production of oil and gas and developing a pipeline of renewable and low carbon projects. With this we will increase both the production of low carbon energy and our capacity for CO\u2082\n\ntransport and storage. We are delivering the energy needed today, while developing the energy solutions for tomorrow.\n\nIn 2023, we welcomed over 2,000 new employees to the company, renewing competence and replacing retirement. The energy transition requires skills and dedication, and we are proud of the strong e/fforts made across Equinor to deliver our results. We would also like to thank Equinor's shareholders for their continued investments and commitment.\n\nJon Erik Reinhardsen , Chair of the board Anders Opedal , President and CEO",

Our role was to be the state's financial, commercial and industrial instrument in the development of the Norwegian oil and gas resources. In the early years, our operations were focused on the exploration, development and production of oil and gas assets on the NCS. By 1979, the Statfjord field was discovered in the North Sea and production commenced.\n\n## 2000s\n\n## An ambitious and innovative operator\n\nIn 2001, we were listed on Oslo B\u00f8rs and New York Stock Exchange under the name Statoil ASA, with the Norwegian State retaining a 67% stake. In 2007, Statoil merged with Norsk Hydro's oil and gas division. By the end of the decade, Equinor's international exploration and partnerships included Angola, Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Tanzania and onshore and o/ffshore in the US.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## 1980s\n\n## An o/ffshore pioneer\n\nThe 1980s was a decade of strong growth, with discoveries and the development of large fields on the NCS. In 1981, we gained operatorship of the Gullfaks development in the North Sea, as the first Norwegian operator. In 1987 Equinor took over the operatorship of Statfjord.\n\n## 2010s\n\n## An eye to the future\n\nThe 2010s started with international growth, with acquisitions leading to a large position in the growing production onshore in the US and the start-up of the Peregrino field in 2011, making us an operator in Brazil. Later, we began positioning ourselves for the energy transition, announcing a strategy to become a broader energy company in 2017. At the AGM in 2018 Statoil ASA became Equinor ASA, reflecting the strategic direction. In October 2019 the Johan Sverdrup field came on stream - powered by electricity from shore, it is one of the world's most carbon-e/fficient fields.\n\nABOUT US\n\n## 1990s\n\n## An international player\n\nIn the 1990s Equinor grew internationally. We became a major supplier to the European gas market, entering large-sales contracts for the development and operation of gas transport systems and terminals. In 1992 Equinor entered an alliance with BP to grow internationally. We expanded manufacturing and marketing across Scandinavia and established a comprehensive network of service stations. Statoil fuel and retail was later listed and fully divested in 2012.\n\n## 2020s\n\n## A company in the energy transition\n\nFor the 2020s, Equinor set out its ambition to become a netzero company by 2050. In 2022, Equinor presented its Energy transitional plan. This action plan includes the short- and medium-term actions necessary to realise our ambition of becoming a net zero company. The plan was endorsed with 97.5% shareholder vote at our annual general meeting in 2022.",

Two thirds of our equity production comes from the Norwegian continental shelf. Equinor operates around 70% of the total Norwegian oil and gas production. One third of the equity production comes from outside of Norway, a share that is expected to increase over the coming years. The Peregrino field in Brazil and the Mariner field in the UK are our largest operatorships outside of Norway.\n\n## Carbon capture and storage (CCS)\n\nEquinor is pursuing new business models to make carbon capture, transport and storage commercially viable. We have decades of experience from CCS projects of various sizes, successfully maturing the technology from the Research & Development (R&D) stage to operations. We are progressing on the CO\u2082 transport and storage projects Northern Lights and Smeaheia in Norway and Bayou Bend in the US.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## A technology leader\n\nWe have a strong and proven ability to develop and apply new technologies and digital solutions. As we pursue our ambition to be a leading company in the energy transition, technology leadership will be a key enabler.\n\n## An o/ffshore pioneer\n\nOur fifty years of experience of building the oil and gas industry in Norway represents a competitive advantage for the company today. Examples of our work include piped gas infrastructure network, and the world's first subsea gas compression plant. Equinor is a global o/ffshore wind major and the world's leading floating o/ffshore wind developer and operator.\n\n## An early mover and industry shaper\n\nWe seek to create value as an early mover and industry shaper. Examples of our approach include the development of CCS at the Sleipner field in the 1990s and the testing of floating o/ffshore wind for the Hywind demo in the 2000s which have contributed to our latest technology developments of Northern Lights and Hywind Tampen.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Refining, processing and marketing\n\nOur refinery, processing plants and terminals transform crude oil and natural gas into everyday commodities such as petrol, diesel, heating oil and consumer-ready natural gas. The transportation, marketing, and trading of our products maximises value creation. Most of our output is exported to continental Europe, but we also export to the UK, North America and Asia.\n\nEquinor also markets and sells the Norwegian State's share of the natural gas and crude oil produced on the NCS. Danske Commodities is a leading energy trading house fully owned by Equinor.\n\n## Renewable energy\n\nEquinor currently provides more than one million European homes with renewable power. We develop some of the world's largest o/ffshore wind farms, located in Europe and the US, and are in the process of building positions within onshore renewable and energy storage in the UK, the US, Poland, Denmark and Brazil. By 2030, we aim to have grown our installed renewables capacity from 2023's 0.9 GW to 12-16 GW.",

        "page_content": "## 1.4 The world in which we operate\n\nIn recent years, energy markets have become significantly more complex and less predictable. Although society continues to take major steps forward in the transition towards lower carbon energy sources, recent geopolitical uncertainty and economic headwinds present new challenges to delivering energy security, energy a/ffordability and energy sustainability. Solving this 'energy trilemma' (see diagram) requires that policy makers, industries and consumers work together to find the best short and long-term balance between its three dimensions.\n\nAs countries look to find the best balance across these three dimensions, they are pushed to make trade-o/ffs between them. For example, in 2022 and 2023, the war in Ukraine demanded trade-o/ffs from sustainability towards security and a/ffordability. It is therefore necessary for energy companies, including Equinor, to adapt accordingly, while pursuing a resilient longterm business strategy on the journey towards a low-carbon future.\n\n## Key considerations include:\n\n## \u00b7  A need to respond to a challenging geopolitical situation\n\nThe turbulent geopolitical environment including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the increased tensions between the US and China has led to a somewhat reprioritised focal point in the trilemma. The weaponisation of energy means that energy projects and assets require additional physical and cybersecurity, as well as alternative supply sources. The urgency for Europe to rapidly replace Russian oil and gas has necessitated increased supply from producers in other regions, but also impacted emissions, industrial activity and economic growth.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## \u00b7  A lack of stable decarbonisation policies and commercial frameworks\n\nWhilst the energy transition creates business opportunities for new technologies and value chains, the supporting policies and frameworks needed to drive large scale investment are lagging in many countries and regions. Choosing where to invest and how fast to transition therefore pose significant strategic risk which must be balanced with needs for financial stability, resilience, and shareholder value.\n\n## \u00b7  An added incentive to accelerate renewables growth\n\nIn parallel with meeting short-term energy supply needs, and to increase energy security, there is an accelerated drive to transition into renewable energy. This presents long-term business opportunities for energy companies, but the faster pace may increase reliance on currently non-diversified supply chains with lower standards of social and environmental practices (e.g. human rights).\n\n## \u00b7  An acute cost-of-living crisis could have broad fallout\n\nEnergy a/ffordability remains a key concern for many, potentially leading to social unrest and policy backtracking on decarbonisation ambitions, and poses uncertainties for investors in terms of future political intervention. Inflation levels were high in most regions in 2023 and growing activity across the energy industry means that many sectors are capacity constrained and experiencing supply chain pressures.\n\nDespite global challenges, Equinor's strategic beliefs stand firm. The energy industry has a key role to play in the energy transition, and oil and gas will continue to be needed while the transition happens on the back of massive investments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The energy trilemma\n\nEnergy a/ffordability - access to a/ffordable energy for domestic and commercial use.\n\nEnergy security - capacity to meet current and future energy demand while maintaining resilience to system shocks.\n\nEnergy decarbonisation - transition towards lower carbon energy systems through substituting use of fossil fuels and increase energy e/fficiency.",

Oil and gas will stay in our long-term energy mix, but only the most robust upstream projects can be expected to be developed, and carbon considerations will continue to influence all our portfolio choices. For renewables and low carbon solutions, close collaboration with customers, regulators and industry will be key to develop new markets and lay the foundation for future value creation.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nThe world's energy systems are in a transition to meet the challenge of climate change. As Equinor transforms, we must strike the right balance between being a safe and reliable provider of energy and generating cash flow to enable the energy transition, while supporting our purpose of providing energy and progress to society and continuing to be an attractive investment for our shareholders. We have a strong financial position and a solid balance sheet. This enables us to seize opportunities provided by the energy transition. Despite the current turbulence, our strategic beliefs - the foundation of our strategy - remain firm.\n\n## Net-zero ambition gives rise to new industry opportunities\n\nClimate change and the energy transition have become mainstream concerns for governments, societies and investors. Therefore, functioning markets for low carbon solutions will emerge and new opportunities will arise for developers of these solutions. As policy and regulations shape energy markets, the social licence to operate and the ability to run a profitable business will be closely tied to how companies act on their net-zero ambitions.\n\n## Technological excellence and innovation will define winners\n\nAs the magnitude and speed of change intensify, technology, digitisation and innovation will be key enablers. New ways of working will evolve. We will continue to build on our existing competence and experience and develop capabilities in new areas. A culture of innovation, learning and empowerment is needed to stay competitive.\n\n## The emerging market dynamics put margins under pressure\n\nWorldwide energy demand is expected to grow in the short to medium term. However, an abundance of energy from intermittent sources could lead to an increased volatility in energy prices, exposing the industry to new competition and increasing the pressure on margins. The energy landscape is transforming, with innovative technologies, new customers, new competitors, and new ways of creating value.",

Additionally, the approval of the Sn\u00f8hvit Future project by the Norwegian government was a major milestone. The project aims to fully electrify the Hammerfest LNG facility by 2030, resulting in an approximate annual reduction of 850,000 tonnes of CO\u2082 emissions. As outlined in our Energy transition plan, rapid reductions in operated emissions from our oil and gas activities in Norway depend on the availability of, and access to, electricity supplies.\n\nIn 2023, we maintained our focus on the carbon e/fficiency of our upstream production. Upstream CO\u2082 intensity was 6.7kg CO\u2082/boe, which is a slight improvement from the level achieved in 2022 and below\n\n## Upstream CO\u2082 intensity\n\n(kg CO\u2082 per boe, 100% operated basis)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUpstream: All operations from exploration to production, excluding onshore gas processing and LNG facilities.\n\nABOUT US\n\nour target of 7.0kg CO\u2082/boe for 2025.

The average methane intensity of our operated assets held steady at 0.02%, roughly one-tenth of the OGCI (Oil and Gas Climate Imitative) industry average of 0.2%.\n\n## Investing in the transition\n\nWe are targeting high-value growth in renewables. Our ambition is that over 50% of our annual gross capex will be invested in renewables and low carbon solution by 2030, and 30% by 2025, subject to availability of robust projects.\n\nIn 2023 we invested 20% of our gross capex* into renewable energy and low carbon solutions, which is a 50% increase from the previous year.

As Equinor grows and transforms, we expect to invest more to renewables and low carbon solutions, subject to an attractive su/fficient access to opportunities and to deliver profitable growth.\n\nOur investment strategy paves the way to a broader energy mix for the company. While less than one percent of the total energy we delivered in 2023 was from renewables and low carbon solutions such as hydrogen, this figure is estimated to reach between 8-10% in 2030 and between 15-20% in 2035\u00b9.\n\n1) Using a fossil equivalency basis for renewable energy\n\n## Energy production by source\n\n<!-- image -->",

The year-on-year rise is attributable to an increase in the ratio of oil to gas in our production portfolio as the energy security crisis in Europe stabilised and the extraordinary increase in demand for Equinor's gas seen in 2022 subsided. An increase in the overall oil and gas production from 2,039 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d) in 2022 to 2,082 (mboe/d) in 2023, resulted in a 3% increase in absolute scope 3 emissions to 250 million tonnes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8\n\nGW\n\nRenewables pipeline additions Equinor share, unrisked\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n~9\n\nMTPA\n\nCCS storage volumes added, equity to Equinor\n\nEquinor 2023 Integrated annual report Equinor 2023 Integrated annual report\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nWhile renewables represented a small fraction of our total energy output in 2023, we made progress in building a foundation for these sources to play an increasingly important role in our future portfolio as a broad energy company.

Our acquisition of Rio Energy, a leading onshore renewables company in Brazil, and the closing of the acquisition of Danish solar company BeGreen, added around 8 GW of capacity to our pipeline in 2023.\n\nIn addition to progress on renewables, we saw an increase in the volume of CO\u2082 stored from our operated assets Sn\u00f8hvit and Sleipner in 2023 to 0.8 million tonnes, up from 0.5 million tonnes in 2022. Accumulated, Equinor has stored 27.1 million tonnes of CO\u2082 on the NCS since 1996. We saw two major developments in our CCS portfolio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCaapacitcy yd\n\nABOUT US\n\nin 2023. Our acquisition of a 25% stake in Bayou Bend, a major CCS project in the US Gulf Coast with gross potential storage resources of more than a billion metric tonnes, provides us with an opportunity to engage in the decarbonisation of a key industrial region and adds 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of transport and storage to our portfolio. In the UK, Equinor and its partners secured additional CCS storage licenses in the Northern Endurance Partnership, adding up to 4mtpa to our annual storage capacity in the project, which comprises six CO\u2082 storage sites in the southern North Sea. These projects will be important contributors to our increased ambition of 30-50mtpa of transport and CO\u2082 storage by 2035.\n\nAs deployment of renewables and CCS accelerates in the coming years, we expect to see greater progress in NCI reductions, with the majority of progress towards the 20% reduction ambition in 2030 expected in the second half of this decade.\n\nAs outlined in our Energy transition plan, the transition will require an approach that takes account of impacts on our employees, nature, and society. In this respect, 2023 was also a year of capacity building. The launch of our new renewables organisation in May, aimed at focusing the competence and capacity needed to maximise value creation in our fastest growing business area, resulted in a 94% increase in the number of colleagues formally working in renewables, with most reallocated from roles in other parts of the company. On nature, we continued to expand our activities, including implementation of site-specific inventories of key biodiversity features for 35 existing sites. In 2023, we also continued to integrate human rights practices into the way we work, including engagement with peers and suppliers to address systemic issues, the development of new internal monitoring indicators for forced labour in our supply chain, and adoption of global Equinor working requirements for human rights due diligence.\n\n## Relevant information:\n\n- \u00b7 The energy transition plan\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity position\n- \u00b7 Human Rights Policy\n- \u00b7 A just energy transition",

Every individual makes a di/fference by contributing their skills, experiences, ideas, and perspectives to the common goals of delivering reliable energy and reaching net zero by 2050.\n\nOur culture is firmly rooted in a shared understanding that safety is our number one priority. Our values guide us in how we work and deliver on our goals together. We have clear requirements and expectations towards our employees to ensure that our company culture continues to develop and thrive.\n\nWe work systematically to integrate diversity and inclusion (D&I) in our human resources (HR) processes, from recruitment, career development, and succession planning to leadership deployment.\n\n## Developing our people capabilities\n\nIn 2023, we further strengthened our workforce planning process in collaboration with leaders and employee representatives. The reinforced framework aims to ensure a robust connection between our strategy, business plans, and the development of people's capabilities. We continuously address gaps between current and future workforce needs using various tools and new technologies. Our recruitment strategies comply with statutory requirements for the use of temporary hires.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nFocusing on both short-term and long-term development planning, we enable employees to cultivate the necessary skills to meet present and future objectives. Our ongoing performance development process, based on continuous feedback, allows leaders and employees to prioritise and align their expectations throughout the year.\n\n## Building and utilising our collective competence\n\nOur collective competence is a key enabler for Equinor to deliver on current and future ambitions. Employees have opportunities to learn and grow through our Equinor university courses, partnerships with top universities for training and research, and our internal job market. We monitor the participation of all formal learning to secure continuous management focus and a relevant learning portfolio.\n\n## Creating a great place to work\n\nIn Equinor, everyone is involved in the development of the company. This includes internal crossfunctional collaboration, liaising with union representatives and safety delegates according to local law and practice, and following up on the results from our annual global people survey (GPS). We respect employees' rights to organise and to voice their opinions, and we have the same clear expectations for our suppliers and partners. In 2023, union representatives and safety\n\ndelegates were involved in discussions on the further optimisation of our operating model, the hire-in regulations in Norway, and model for career development in the company.\n\nIn 2023, we worked further on implementing our flexible work principles. Our continuous goal is to achieve a good balance in supporting the diverse needs of our people in their daily working lives and ensuring that time and e/ffort are directed to prioritised activities.\n\n## Performance and reward framework\n\nIn Equinor, how we deliver is as important as what we deliver. Our performance and reward framework measures progress and results, and rewards individual performance in a holistic way, attributing equal weight to business delivery and behaviour. The performance of the CEO, his direct reports and Equinor's broader leadership is assessed based on results within a wide range of behavioral, financial, operational and sustainability topics.\n\nA comprehensive set of performance indicators and monitoring reports are made available to all employees in Equinor's management information system. The performing indicators are reported on a regular basis from operational levels to the governing bodies to ensure transparency in risk and performance management - this is how we keep employees accountable for the development of our company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Broadly, the aim is to help us build support for policies that align with our strategy, as well as to create value in collaboration with partners, suppliers and local communities.\n\n## Engaging with policymakers\n\nEquinor engages with policymakers to ensure our license to operate, to express our position on important industry issues, and to promote policies in line with our strategy and our Energy transition plan. We have a dialogue with government through our Chairman, Chief Executive O/fficer and other senior leaders - as well as through consultation responses and cross-industry initiatives. We work with key government entities to reach common goals in line with our ambitions, promote adequate framework conditions that drive investments in necessary energy sources and technologies - and deliver projects necessary for the transition.\n\nIn Equinor, our political and public a/ffairs team manages relationships with governments and policymakers. We engage primarily with decision makers in countries where we have significant operations, such as Norway, Brazil, the UK and the US, as well as with regional structures like the European Union. These interactions are mainly related to developing competitive, stable and predictable industry framework conditions, taxes and legislation that a/ffect our activities. We also collaborate on developing new value chains needed in a low carbon future, such as hydrogen and CCS.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nOur public policy work covers a wide territory, including oil and gas, low carbon solutions and renewables. Achieving the necessary decarbonisation and political will to ensure a/ffordability, and at the same time maintain security of supply will be a key political and industrial challenge going forward. To achieve our corporate strategic priorities for the energy transition it is important to work with policymakers in key markets. Further information on our sustainability governance activities can be found in section 2.2 Sustainability Performance.\n\n## Our partners and suppliers\n\nThe values we create are to a large extent dependent on our relationships with business partners and suppliers. We believe our e/fforts to ensure close collaboration and active engagement has the potential to impact health and safety standards, supplier diversity and inclusion and promote responsible supply among others. We regularly engage in meetings with our partners to support safe and e/fficient operations and drive potential to improve e/fficiencies. Our suppliers constitute a key part of our value chain, for example in engineering, construction and installation of plants and platforms. We aim for fair competition and enabling e/fficient and sustainable supply chains in support of both their and our own performance.\n\n## Local communities\n\nWe believe that we can bring a range of positive benefits to the societies where we operate, when these are pursued in collaboration and based on good communication with those potentially impacted by our planned or ongoing activities.\n\nTroll A visit with NATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, Norwegian Prime Minister, Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re and Equinor CEO, Anders Opedal.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Good corporate governance is a prerequisite for a sound and sustainable company, and to ensure that we run our business in a justifiable and profitable manner for the benefit of employees, shareholders, partners, customers and society.\n\nAs a public limited liability company with shares listed in Oslo and New York, Equinor adheres to relevant regulations and applicable corporate governance codes, including the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance.\n\nFor a comprehensive account of our corporate governance framework, please refer to the Board statement on corporate governance report.\n\n## Governing bodies\n\nThe general meeting of shareholders is Equinor's supreme corporate body. It serves as a democratic and e/ffective forum for interaction between the company's shareholders, the board of directors (BoD) and management. At Equinor's AGM on 11 May 2023, 78.02% of the share capital was represented.\n\nThe corporate assembly is Equinor's body for supervision of the BoD and the management of the company. They represent a broad cross-section of\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nthe company's shareholders and stakeholders, and one of their main duties is to elect the company's BoD. The corporate assembly consists of 18 members and three observers, of which 12 members are nominated by the nomination committee and elected by the general meeting, while six members and the observers are elected by and among employees in Equinor ASA or a subsidiary in Norway. More information on the corporate assembly can be found in the Board statement on corporate governance report.\n\nThe BoD has the overriding responsibility for supervising Equinor's management and operations and establishing control systems. The work of the BoD is based on its rules of procedures and applicable legislation describing its responsibility, duties and administrative procedures. This includes a duty to decide the company's strategy, ensure adequate control of the company's overall risk management and to appoint the chief executive o/fficer (CEO). For a more detailed description, see the rules of procedures available at www.equinor.com/board\n\nThe BoD shall consist of nine to eleven board members and as of 31 December 2023 had ten members of which seven were shareholder representatives and three were employee representatives. Of the board members six are men, four are women and two are nonNorwegians resident outside of Norway. The nomination committee nominates the shareholder-representatives, and all board members are elected by the corporate assembly. The BoD has determined that, in its judgment, all the shareholder representatives on the board are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconsidered independent as under Norwegian law.\n\nThe BoD has adopted an annual plan for its work which is revised with regular intervals. Recurring items on the board's annual plan are: safety, security, sustainability and climate, corporate strategy, business plans and targets, quarterly and annual results, annual reporting, ethics and compliance, management's performance reporting, management leadership assessment and compensation and succession planning, project status review, people and organisation strategy and\n\npriorities, and an annual review of the board's governing documentation. The board has dedicated strategy and risk sessions twice a year where the corporate executive committee presents, and they align on the strategy going forward. The board discusses climate change and the energy transition in all ordinary board meetings either as integral parts of strategy and investment discussions or as separate topics.\n\nThe work of the board is set out in detail in the Board statement on corporate governance report.\n\nABOUT US",

Equinor places a high focus on fostering alignment between the interests of its executive management and those of its owners and other stakeholders. Variable remuneration is aimed at driving performance in line with the company's strategy and securing long-term commitment and retention with the company.\n\nThe receipt of variable remuneration depends on individual and company performance and is subject to a holding period requirement for some elements.

Risk, which refers to both threats and opportunities, is assessed as part of strategy selection and managed through execution to deliver the strategic pillars and objectives throughout the company. The constantly changing internal and external business context means that risks can emerge and evolve quickly, underpinning the need for well-designed, adaptive and e/ffective risk management approaches. The current most material enterprise risks and risk factors are described in section 5.2 Risk factors.\n\nEquinor's ERM framework is integrated across all our business activities with a focus on creating value and avoiding unwanted incidents. We consider risks in shorter and longer-term perspectives, and across enduring risks, dynamic risks as well as more immature or emerging risk issues that can impact our business ambitions. Through BAC the BoD oversees the ERM framework and reviews its e/ffectiveness.\n\nThe ERM approach enables risk-informed decisions and risk response in a way that supports delivering value in a sustainable frame. This means that we consider the overall value upside or downside of risks for Equinor, whilst ensuring we live up to our principles for avoiding safety, security, sustainability, human rights and business integrity incidents, such as accidents, fraud and corruption.\n\nIn general, risks are managed in the business line as an integral part of employee and manager tasks. The business areas and corporate functions regularly identify and evaluate risk using established procedures, assess the need for risk-adjusting actions, and review overall risk management performance. Some risks, such as oil and natural gas price risks and interest and currency risks,\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nABOUT US\n\nare managed at the corporate level to provide optimal solutions. A holistic corporate risk perspective is also applied in strategy development, portfolio prioritisation processes, and capital structure discussions. Throughout the year, the CEO and the Board Audit Committee maintain oversight of the risk management framework, processes, top enterprise risks and the overall risk picture. Areas of particular risk oversight currently include IT and cyber security, progress on net-zero, low-carbon value proposition, political and regulatory frameworks, human rights, and capacity and capability constraints.\n\nEquinor's risk management process is based on ISO 31000 risk management and seeks to ensure that risks are identified, analysed, evaluated, and appropriately managed. A standardised risk process across Equinor supports consistency and e/fficiency that informs key decisions. Risk is integrated into the company's management information system (IT tool), where it is linked with Equinor's purpose, vision and strategy and associated strategic objectives and KPIs. This tool is used to capture risks, follow up riskadjusting actions and related assurance activities, and supports a risk-based approach in the context of a three lines model.\n\nWhilst our approach includes continuous improvement of risk management practices, Equinor has recognised a need to strengthen resilience to global uncertainty and volatility that a/ffect our business. With support from the CEO, CFO and BAC, Equinor has initiated focused activities to strengthen a future-fit ERM framework. This includes further development of the corporate risk appetite framework supported by strengthened governance for executive follow-up of the top enterprise risks.\n\nEquinor risk management can be broadly considered across the following enterprise impact areas. More detail on specific themes is provided in relevant material topics sections of this report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Strategic and commercial risks\n\nEquinor needs to navigate uncertainty and manage risk to deliver value, transition its portfolio, and remain financially robust through the changing energy context. Climate and other sustainability related factors influence many aspects of our strategy selection and execution. Global, regional and national political developments can change the operating environment and economic outcomes. Market conditions related to supply and demand, technological change, customer preferences and global economic conditions can significantly impact company financial performance. Our ability to deliver value from projects and operations can be impacted by factors related to partners, contractors, global supply chains as well as public stakeholders and regulatory frameworks. Digital and cyber threats are constantly evolving and can cause major disruption across our value chains.\n\n## Strategic and commercial risk factors\n\n- \u00b7 Prices and markets\n- \u00b7 Hydrocarbon resource base and renewable and low carbon opportunities\n- \u00b7 Climate change and transition to a lower carbon economy\n- \u00b7 International politics and geopolitical change\n- \u00b7 Digital and cyber security\n- \u00b7 Project delivery and operations\n- \u00b7 Joint arrangements and contractors\n- \u00b7 Competition and technological innovation\n- \u00b7 Ownership and actions by the Norwegian State\n- \u00b7 Policies and legislation\n- \u00b7 Financial risks, liquidity and capital management\n- \u00b7 Trading and commercial supply activities\n- \u00b7 Workforce capabilities and organisational change\n- \u00b7 Crisis management, business continuity and insurance coverage\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Strategic and commercial risk management\n\nOverall, Equinor manages risk through portfolio selection, robust financial framework, stress-testing and business planning, investment, and review processes. We take a longterm view of energy supply and demand, ensuring robustness of our oil and gas portfolio, developing and investing in low carbon businesses of the future whilst seeking to safeguard shareholder returns.\n\nThe company is exposed to oil and gas market price levels. Corporate hedges may be entered into to reduce the cash flow volatility generated from the price levels risk. Equinor has an insurance-based approach to this hedging, securing downside protection only while keeping the upside in price exposure open. For the trading business, derivatives risk is managed through Value at Risk and trader mandates, loss limitation systems and daily monitoring of trading profit and loss. Equinor's liquidity framework is based on a forwardlooking risk management approach to assure that Equinor's strategic liquidity reserve will cover both expected and unexpected cash outflows over the subsequent six months, including a potential crisis event and significant collateral needs.\n\nRisks related to low carbon solutions, climate change and transition to a lower carbon economy, workforce and organisation, cyber security, and actions by the Norwegian State are included within top enterprise risks and have direct follow-up at the executive level. Top enterprise risks are assessed in relation to risk appetite statements that represent the company's willingness to take on risk exposure. Actions to manage exposure are implemented and assessed based\n\non their e/ffectiveness. Risks are reviewed by both the first line (risk owner) and second line (Corporate risk) with regards to risk management and followed up by the CEC and the BoD.\n\nWe recognise the importance of ESG matters in our current and future business, and seek to be open around ESG matters related to our activities through recognised ESG reporting methodologies. To support portfolio resilience in multiple energy pathways, we have a financial framework in place addressing climate-related risks, we stress test our portfolio across di/fferent energy scenarios, and assess climaterelated physical risks. Risks relating to policies and regulatory frameworks, international politics and geopolitical change, together with competition and technological innovation are regularly assessed, monitored and managed to improve outcomes for the company as part of the Equinor's risk update.\n\nRisks related to projects and operations are managed at many levels, including through quality assurance processes (competence area reviews, e.g., facilities, safety and security, environment, commercial and country risk) within the investment phase, quality and risk management within the project execution risk phase, and continuous improvement programs in operations. Crisis management, business continuity and insurance coverage are included in the evaluation of actions to reduce the impact of unwanted incidents. Digital security and cyber security remain in high focus through a cyber security improvement programme to maintain and strengthen cyber security capability and reduce cyber risk.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic financial framework\n\nEquinor's financial framework is underpinned by four principles that we believe will allow us to develop our company and drive capital discipline.\n\n## Value over volume\n\nValue creation is a key priority for Equinor and is an integral part of how we steer our company. By being value driven, we expect to deliver a return on average capital employed* of above 15% from 2024 to 2030 2 .\n\n## Robust to lower prices\n\nGiven the cyclical nature of our industry, we aim to remain robust to lower prices and continue to deliver value through the cycles. Our current portfolio is estimated to be net cash flow* neutral between 2024 and 2030 at around 55 USD/bbl 3 . Robustness is developed through a balanced portfolio composition in addition to low break-even prices on projects. Ensuring a base line of stable returns from the upstream business coupled with a targeted high value renewable and LCS portfolio we seek to create robustness through cycles and seasons. By remaining disciplined and utilising our flexible investment program, we aim to ensure resilience in a low-price scenario.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Robust capital structure\n\nEnsuring a solid balance sheet and necessary financial flexibility is important to support a dynamic strategy through economic and market cycles. We also aim to maintain a credit rating within the single A category on a stand-alone basis as a key objective 4 Equinor expects a long-term net debt to capital employed* ratio between 15-30% (20-35% including IFRS \u00ae Accounting Standards - IFRS 16 leases) to be consistent with this.\n\n.\n\n## Energy transition plan\n\nIn line with Equinor's Energy transition plan, we are focusing on high-value growth in renewables and aim to invest over 30% of gross capex* to renewables and low carbon solutions by 2025, growing to over 50% by 2030, subject to the availability of robust projects. We also aim to reduce operated net scope 1+2 emissions by 50% by 2030 and reduce our net carbon intensity by 20% by 2030 and 40% by 2035 5 .\n\n## Growing cash flows from operations\n\nIt is expected that this financial framework will enable Equinor to generate a strong cash flow from operations after taxes paid* (CFFO after taxes paid*). We aim to deliver a CFFO after taxes paid* of around USD 20 billion annually from oil and gas activities between 2024 and 2035 and around USD 3 billion from the renewables and low carbon solutions portfolio by 2030, growing to USD 6 billion by 2035 2, 6 .\n\n2) Based on reference case 75 USD/bbl scenario using USD/NOK exchange rate of 10 and price assumptions: Brent Blend 75 USD/bbl, Henry Hub 3.5 USD/mmbtu and European gas price 13 USD/mmbtu for 2024 and 2025, thereafter 9 USD/mmbtu. 3) Net cash flow* neutral before capital distribution, based on lower case 55 USD/bbl scenario (excluding 2023 tax lag) using USD/NOK exchange rate of 10 and price assumptions: Brent Blend 55 USD/bbl, Henry Hub 2.5 USD/mmbtu and European gas price 8 USD/mmbtu for 2024 and 2025, thereafter 6 USD/mmbtu. 4) Without uplift in rating due to state ownership. 5) See equinor.com for more details around Equinor's Energy transition plan. 6) Oil and gas activities defined as being from E&P Norway and/or E&P International including MMP (with the exception of LCS) and other group elements. Renewables and low carbon solutions portfolio defined as being from REN and LCS including relevant trading.\n\nThis cash flow will be allocated to create shareholder value, following three capital allocation priorities:\n\n## Stable oil and gas investments while growing investment to transition\n\nBy continuing to reinvest in our oil and gas activities towards 2035, in an attractive project portfolio with low break-even prices, we aim to build a strong foundation of profitable stability to keep the business steady as we transform. Capital will also continue to be allocated towards investing in our growing project portfolio within renewables and low-carbon solutions in line with our Energy transition plan.\n\n## Competitive, growing ordinary cash dividend through the cycles\n\nInvesting in high-value projects should enable Equinor to maintain a competitive capital distribution through the energy transition. Equinor has an ambition to grow the annual ordinary cash dividend through the cycles in line with long-term underlying earnings, at a minimum of 2 cents per share per year.\n\n## Share buy-backs as flexible tool for capital distribution\n\nAs part of our shareholder distribution programme, Equinor also buys back shares. The share buy-back programme is a flexible means of additional capital distribution, where the ambition is to maintain a minimum of USD 1.2 billion in annual share buy-backs in the longer term.",

        "page_content": "## Our market perspective\n\nAt the start of 2023, the global economy wrestled with the interplay of recovery from the pandemic-induced downturn and geopolitical challenges. In particular, the war in Ukraine continued to distort energy market dynamics and global trade patterns, pushing upward prices that were already inflated in the aftermath of the pandemic.\n\nAs 2023 progressed, central banks responded to high inflation with tight monetary policy. In Europe, political attention was also focused on Ukraine's counter-o/ffensive, which did not yield the anticipated gains and prompted a shift towards greater realism. With this backdrop, and in contrast to the cautious optimism for consumers and service industry worldwide, capital and energy-intensive industries faced headwinds. The industrial sector in the Eurozone was hit, and EU GDP growth decelerated to 0.5% year-on-year.\n\nIn October, Hamas' surprise terrorist attack on Israel triggered a new crisis in the Middle East - one that directly impacted global energy flows and raised the prospects of further escalation.\n\nDespite these challenges global GDP surprised with an estimated growth of 2.7% in 2023, partially driven by economic resilience in the US, reflecting declining inflation, a robust labor market and strong private consumption.\n\nWhile the outlook for 2024 indicates declining inflation rates and policy rate cuts, the global economy is expected to continue on a path of moderation. Geopolitical\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\ndevelopments, as well as the trajectory of inflation and interest rates, will be key factors shaping global markets also in 2024.\n\n## Global oil prices\n\nThe oil market was quite balanced in 2023 with some oversupply in the first half and undersupply in the second half. The price for Dated Brent crude oil averaged 82.6 USD/bbl in 2023, with the second half of the year stronger than the first half. This marked a significant drop from an average price of 101 USD/bbl in 2022.\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, Dated Brent crude prices fluctuated within the range of 72-88 USD/bbl. The EU and G7 sanctions on oil imports from Russia did not lead to major supply disruptions, and interest rate hikes among global central banks, as well as inflation and recession concerns, kept prices mu/ffled.\n\nBy the second half of 2023, oil prices responded to the e/ffects of the Opec+ oil production cuts. The Brent price reached its highest point for the year at 98 USD/bbl in September. Prospects for slower economic growth and oil demand and the higher-than-expected supply from non-Opec+ producers pushed prices down towards yearend. The Israel-Hamas conflict led to a short-lived price increase in October, but prices fell again as fears of supply disruptions eased.\n\nMid-December, concerns about shipping disruptions in the Red Sea due to attacks from Houthi rebels, lifted oil prices briefly. Brent averaged 78.2 USD/bbl in December 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Global gas prices\n\nEuropean natural gas prices (TTF) decreased by 66% from the extraordinary levels in 2022 caused by the war in Ukraine, averaging 12.8 USD/MMBtu. The year was marked by a historical European gas storage surplus at the end of the winter with lower gas demand across Europe and NorthEast Asia. Several factors played a role, such as the mild winter weather, higher renewable and nuclear output, persistent end-user energy savings, sluggish industrial demand and slower than expected economic growth in China. New import terminals across Europe allowed for larger and better distribution of LNG volumes across the region. Russian gas volumes were further reduced by about 59% year-on-year. Long-term contracts returned to the horizon, with German players very active in signing several new contracts with US producers, Qatar and Norway, while other big players also moved to secure more LNG volumes from US and Qatar. The European joint gas purchases platform was launched in May with mixed feedback and limited market impact.\n\nThe US natural gas market in 2023 was uneventful, after the soar in prices in 2021/22 in response to the European energy crisis. Looking ahead, Henry Hub is expected to continue to play a crucial role in balancing both domestic and international demand, as the US solidifies its leading position in global LNG export. With rising awareness of climate change, energy a/ffordability, and escalation of geopolitical tensions, US natural gas will remain an important topic in the global energy discussions.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nGlobal LNG spot prices were volatile in 2023, with the Asian LNG price (JKM) averaging 13.8 USD/ MMBtu, down from 34 USD/MMBtu in 2022. The lower price was driven by lower demand in Europe and Asia compared to 2022 and the high storage levels amid healthy supply in both regions. The volatility in prices was due to the structural market tightness related to the extended maintenance in Norway in September, the Australian LNG workers strikes in October, and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East since October. Although 30 bcm lower than 2022, a relatively high global LNG contracting activity continued in 2023, with long-term supply agreements (10+ years) reaching 100 bcm.\n\n## European electricity and CO\u2082 prices\n\nCompared to the extraordinary levels seen in 2022, power prices in major West European markets (UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, and Italy) decreased by 60% to 101 EUR/ MWh as the market was able to cope with the lack of Russian gas into the system. In addition, the high price environment kept pushing European demand downwards (-3.1% vs 2022, -6.5% vs 2017-21). More precipitation in North-west Europe, the improvement of French nuclear availability and a strong increase in wind and solar capacity additions led to a substantial decrease in coal and gas generation in 2023.\n\nThe EU ETS followed a volatile downwards price trend from its 100 EUR/t historical peak back in February, ending the year at 69 EUR/t. ETS was driven by low emissions in power and industry and an influx of frontloaded allowances as part of REPowerEU regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFrom a policy perspective, there were three main legislative e/fforts in Europe to be highlighted:\n\n(1) the EU Commission (EC) announced its proposal on electricity market design in March as a response to the high price environment resulting from the European energy security situation. The key focus of the proposal is on consumer protection, improving market transparency and security of supply.\n\n(2) In late October the EC presented the 'European\n\nWind Power Action Plan' which aims at accelerating wind deployment through increased predictability and faster permitting, and the creation of a European wind supply chain.\n\n(3) In the UK, after the disappointing Contract for Di/fference auction results, the government announced additional funds and slight changes to the subsidy allocation mechanism with the aim of attracting more applications for the upcoming auctions.",

Internationally, Peregrino in Brazil and a strong performance from the US o/ffshore assets supported production growth, which was also buoyed relative to 2022 with new volumes from Buzzard in the UK following the Suncor Energy UK Limited acquisition and the ramp-up of partneroperated Vito in the US.\n\nOperational challenges, turnarounds, and extended maintenance activities, particularly a/ffecting NCS gas assets contributed to the decline in gas production year-on-year and partially o/ffset the total production increases.\n\nEquinor's prior year divestments in Martin Linge and Ekofisk also partially o/ffset production levels compared to the prior year.\n\nPower generation from the Brazilian acquisition, Rio Energy in 2023 and Triton Power in the UK acquired in the second half of 2022, contributed well to Equinor's power generation in 2023. These additions coupled with continued maturation of both onshore and o/ffshore projects within the Renewable portfolio resulted in an increase in power generation compared to the prior year.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Results\n\n| Condensed income statement                              | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| (in USD million)                                        | 2023                             | 2022                             | Change                           |\n| Revenues                                                | 106,848                          | 149,004                          | (28%)                            |\n| Net income/(loss) from equity accounted investments     | (1)                              | 620                              | N/A                              |\n| Other income                                            | 327                              | 1,182                            | (72%)                            |\n| Total revenues and other income                         | 107,174                          | 150,806                          | (29%)                            |\n| Purchases [net of inventory variation]                  | (48,175)                         | (53,806)                         | (10%)                            |\n| Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses | (11,800)                         | (10,593)                         | 11%                              |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and net impairments          | (10,634)                         | (6,391)                          | 66%                              |\n| Exploration expenses                                    | (795)                            | (1,205)                          | (34%)                            |\n| Net operating income/(loss)                             | 35,770                           | 78,811                           | (55%)                            |\n| Net financial items                                     | 2,114                            | (207)                            | N/A                              |\n| Income/(loss) before tax                                | 37,884                           | 78,604                           | (52%)                            |\n| Income tax                                              | (25,980)                         | (49,861)                         | (48%)                            |\n| Net income/(loss)                                       | 11,904                           | 28,744                           | (59%)                            |\n\nSolid production increases combined with high realised prices drove strong revenue and results for 2023. Realised commodity prices, particularly gas, were markedly reduced from the elevated levels in 2022, and as such more than offset the production increase, resulting in a decline in revenue relative to the prior year.\n\nIn contrast to the extraordinary market conditions in the prior year, a reduction in gas market volatility and declined geographical spreads limited favourable opportunities to capture value within Gas and Power trading compared to 2022. However, Crude, product and liquid results in MMP were strong for 2023, effectively capturing financial and physical market\n\nABOUT US\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nopportunities in addition to optimisation of the shipping portfolio, contributing well to total results.\n\nThe additions to production capacity throughout the year and resulting increased production, coupled with prevailing inflationary pressures drove an increase in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses compared to 2022 levels. In contrast, a reduction in energy prices from 2022 contributed to a reduction in transportation tariffs relative to the prior year partially offsetting the increase. The overall growth in operating expenditure was partially masked by the strengthening of the USD against the NOK.\n\nDepreciation, amortisation and net impairments increased by 66% in 2023, impacted significantly by net impairments totaling USD 1,260 million in the year. This included the recognition of an impairment to our o/ffshore wind project on the US North East Coast following rejection of petitions related to o/fftake agreements, and the planned exit from Azerbaijan announced at the end of the year. The prior year in contrast included net impairment reversals of USD 2,487 million mainly due to updated estimates of value in use of property, plant and equipment impacted by internal forecasts on cost, production profiles and commodity prices, partially offset by the impairment recognised in relation to the exit from Russia. For more information, see note 14 Impairments to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe positive trend in net financial items from a loss in 2022 to income of USD 2,114 million in 2023 is driven by an increase in interest income from liquidity management reflecting the upward movement of interest rates over the year. There was, however, a decrease in long-term interest rates resulting in a gain on derivative financial instruments in the year, also contributing to the year-onyear movement.",

This is equivalent to a positive tax rate of 68.6% for 2023, an increase of 5.2 percentage points compared to 63.4% in 2022. The tax rate in 2022 was impacted by the recognition of a deferred tax asset in the US of USD 2.7 billion.\n\nA successful net income result of USD 11,904 million was recorded for 2023. While this is a significant reduction from the extraordinary year of 2022, it is a historically high result for Equinor driven by a solid production delivery.\n\n## Capital management and distribution\n\nEquinor's ambition is to grow the annual cash dividend in line with long-term underlying earnings, in addition to buying back shares.\n\nWhen deciding the interim dividends and recommending the total annual dividend level, the BoD takes into consideration a range of factors, including the macro environment, expected cash flow, capital expenditure plans, financing requirements and appropriate financial flexibility. Dividends are declared in USD. For further details on Equinor's dividend policy see the Board statement on corporate governance at Equinor.com/reports.\n\nAs part of our distribution of capital to shareholders, Equinor also buys back shares. The purpose of the share buyback programme is to reduce the issued share capital of the company. All shares repurchased as part of the programme are cancelled. According to a separate agreement between Equinor and the Norwegian State, a proportionate share of the Norwegian State's shares will be redeemed and annulled at the annual general meeting, ensuring that the State's ownership interest in Equinor remains unchanged at 67%. Execution of share buy-backs after the 2024 annual general meeting is subject to a renewed authorisation, including renewal of the agreement with the Norwegian State. Share buy-backs will be executed within applicable safe harbour provisions.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

Loans or equity are then extended to subsidiaries to fund their capital requirements. Project financing may be used for risk mitigation, access to projects and to facilitate for farm down. The aim is to always have access to a variety of funding sources across di/fferent markets and instruments, as well as maintain relationships with a core group of international banks that provide a wide range of banking services.\n\nOur credit rating target is within the single A category on a stand-alone basis. This rating ensures access to relevant capital markets at favourable terms and conditions.\n\nThe Group's borrowing needs are usually covered through the issuance of short-, medium- and long-term securities, including utilisation of a US Commercial Paper Programme (programme limit USD 5.0 billion) and issuances under a Shelf Registration Statement filed with the SEC in the US and a Euro Medium-Term Note (EMTN) Programme (programme limit EUR 20 billion) listed on the London Stock Exchange. In addition, Equinor has a multicurrency revolving credit facility of USD 6 billion, including a USD 3 billion swing line (same day value) option. The credit facility is used as a backstop for the group's US Commercial Paper Programme and has a sustainability linked financing element included in the loan agreement related to\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nEquinor's CO\u2082 upstream intensity target. Equinor believes that given its current liquidity reserves, including the committed revolving credit facility of USD 6 billion and its access to global capital markets, Equinor will have su/fficient funds available to meet its liquidity and working capital requirements.\n\n## Maturity profile of bonds issued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEquinor did not issue any new bonds in 2023 and 2022. The redemption profile of previously issued bonds by currency denomination is shown above. This includes bonds issued in the US and European bond markets. All the bonds are unconditionally guaranteed\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nby Equinor Energy AS. The long-term debt portfolio is partially swapped to floating USD interest rate. Equinor manages its interest rate exposure on its bond debt based on risk and reward considerations from an enterprise risk management perspective. This means that the fixed/floating mix on interest rate exposure may vary from time to time. After the e/ffect of currency swaps, the major part of Equinor's borrowings is in USD.\n\nThe management of financial assets and liabilities takes into consideration funding sources, the maturity profile of long-term debt, interest rate risk, currency risk and available liquid assets. In addition, interest rate derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risk of the long-term debt portfolio.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, Equinor had a long-term credit rating of Aa2 (Moody's Investors Service) and AA- (Standard & Poor's Global Ratings), including an uplift due to state ownership (two notches from Moody's Investors Service and one notch from Standard & Poor's Global Ratings compared to their respective standalone credit rating assessments of Equinor). This rating is well above our rating target and ensures su/fficient predictability when it comes to funding access at attractive terms and conditions.\n\n## Liquidity management\n\nEquinor diversifies its cash investments across a range of financial instruments and counterparties to avoid\n\nconcentrating risk in any one type of investment or any single country. As of 31 December 2023, approximately 39% of Equinor's liquid assets were held in NOKdenominated assets, 35% in EUR, 15% in USD, 7% in SEK, 3% in AUD and 1% in GBP before the e/ffect of currency swaps and forward contracts. Approximately 53% of Equinor's liquid assets were held in time deposits, 23% in treasury bills and commercial papers, 14% in corporate bonds, 5% in money market funds and 1% in current accounts.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, approximately 4% of Equinor's liquid assets were classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents (including collateral deposits).",

The following adjustment is made in calculating the net debt to capital employed adjusted*, including lease liabilities ratio* and the net debt to capital employed adjusted ratio*: collateral deposits (classified as Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated balance sheet), and financial investments held in Equinor Insurance AS (classified as Current financial investments in the Consolidated balance sheet) are treated as non-cash and excluded from the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. Collateral deposits are excluded since they relate to certain requirements of exchanges where Equinor is trading and presented as restricted cash and cash equivalents. Financial investments in Equinor Insurance are excluded as these investments are not readily available for the group to meet short term commitments. This adjustment results in a higher net debt figure and in Equinor's view provides a more prudent measure of the net debt to capital employed ratio* than would be the case without such exclusions.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\ntransaction and the renewable companies BeGreen and Rio Energy, are the primary contributors to this increase relative to the prior year.

The USD 0.4 billion net decrease from 2022 to 2023 was due to the decline in finance debt and lease liabilities. Current finance debt and lease liabilities increased by USD 1.7 billion, mainly due to an increase in the utilisation of the US Commercial Paper programme. Non-current finance debt decreased by USD 2.0 billion due to reclassification of non-current debt to current debt and currency e/ffects. The weighted average annual interest rate on finance debt was 3.41% and 3.29% at 31 December 2023 and 2022, respectively. Equinor's weighted average maturity on finance debt was nine years at 31 December 2023 and nine years at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Net interest-bearing debt\n\nNet interest-bearing debt before adjustments was negative USD 7.1 billion and negative USD 13.3 billion at 31 December 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of USD 6.2 billion from 2022 to 2023 was mainly related to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of USD 5.9 billion, a USD 0.7 billion decrease in current financial investments and a decrease in gross interest-bearing debt of USD 0.4 billion.\n\n## The net debt to capital employed ratio*\n\nThe net debt to capital employed ratio* before adjustments was negative 17.1% and negative 32.6% in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted* was negative 21.6% and negative 23.9% in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe 15.5 percentage point increase in net debt to capital employed ratio* before adjustments from 2022 to 2023 was mainly related to the reduction of net interest-bearing debt of USD 6.2 billion.\n\nThe 2.3 percentage points increase in net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted* from 2022 to 2023 was related to the decline in net interest-bearing debt adjusted of USD 1.8 billion and a decrease in capital employed adjusted* of USD 3.7 billion.\n\n## Return on average capital employed (ROACE)*\n\nThe return on average capital employed (ROACE)* was 24.9% in 2023, compared to 55.1% in 2022. The change from 2022 was mainly due to the decrease in adjusted earnings* after tax.\n\n## Cash, cash equivalents and current financial investments\n\nCash and cash equivalents were USD 9.6 billion and USD 15.6 billion at 31 December 2023 and 2022, respectively. See note 19 Cash and cash equivalents to the Consolidated financial statements for information concerning restricted cash and cash equivalents. Current financial investments, which are part of Equinor's liquidity management, amounted to USD 29.2 billion and USD 29.9 billion at 31 December 2023 and 2022, respectively.",

TSR is the sum of a share's price growth and dividends for the same period, divided by the share price at the beginning of the period and is provided by a thirdparty service provider.\n\nThe chart below shows TSR for 2023. Equinor is number eight with a TSR of -0.2% (measured in USD).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2023 was a relatively strong year for global equity markets, but not specifically strong for oil and gas equities. Other sectors had experienced di/fficulties over the last years, not least due to covid and its aftermath, while energy companies had seen high profits in 2022 when energy prices surged after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. There was a certain rebalance in 2023 as it became clear that energy prices were drifting back to more normal levels. In the European gas market in 2023, gas prices were much below the abnormal prices experienced in the year before, with the full gas storage and mild winter, which had an impact on Equinor.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nThe graph below shows the relative performance of Equinor over five years from 2019 until 2023. Over this period, Equinor ranks number 2 with a TSR of 102%.\n\n## Total shareholder return* in %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEquinor's peer group consists of the following companies:\n\nAker BP, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Eni, ExxonMobil, Galp, Repsol, Shell, TotalEnergies and \u00d8rsted.\n\n## Continued operation\n\nIn accordance with \u00a73-3a of the Norwegian Accounting Act, the BoD confirms that the going concern assumption on which the financial statements were prepared is appropriate.\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n## Group outlook\n\n- \u00b7 Organic capital expenditures* are estimated at around USD 13 billion for 2024 7 .\n- \u00b7 Oil & gas production for 2024 is estimated to be stable compared to the 2023 level.\n- \u00b7 Renewable power generation for 2024 is estimated to double compared to the 2023 level.\n- \u00b7 Equinor's ambition is to keep the unit of production cost in the top quartile of its peer group.\n- \u00b7 Scheduled maintenance activity is estimated to reduce equity production by around 60 mboe per day for the full year of 2024.\n\nThese forward-looking statements reflect current views about future events and are, by their nature, subject to\n\nsignificant risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. Deferral of production to create future value, gas o/ff-take, timing of new capacity coming on stream and operational regularity and levels of industry product supply, demand and pricing represent the most significant risks related to the foregoing production guidance. Our future financial performance, including cash flow and liquidity, will be a/ffected by the extent and duration of the current market conditions, the development in realised prices, including price di/fferentials and other factors discussed elsewhere in the report.

In addition to Equinor's own volumes, we market and sell oil and gas owned by the Norwegian State through the Norwegian State's share in production licences. This is known as the State's Direct Financial Interest or SDFI.

These changes are the result of continuous business processes and can be expected to continue to affect proved reserves estimates in the future.\n\nProved reserves can also be added or subtracted through purchases and sales of reserves-in-place or factors outside management control.\n\nChanges in product prices can affect the quantities of oil and gas that can be recovered from the accumulations. Higher oil and gas prices will normally allow more oil and gas to be recovered, while lower prices will normally result in reduced recovery. However, for fields with production sharing agreements (PSA), higher prices may result in reduced entitlement to produced volumes and lower prices may result in increased entitlement to produced volumes. These described changes are included in the revisions and improved recovery category in the tables that follow in this report.\n\nThe principles for booking proved gas reserves are limited to contracted gas sales or gas with access to a robust gas market.\n\nEquinor prepares its disclosures for oil and gas reserves and certain other supplemental oil and gas disclosures by geographical area, as required by the SEC. The geographical areas are defined by country and continent. In 2023 these are Norway, Eurasia excluding Norway, Africa, the USA and the Americas excluding USA.\n\n- 8)  Volumes related to the planned exit from Azerbaijan are included in the proved oil and gas reserves at year end 2023.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nIn Norway and other countries where there is a reasonable certainty that the authorities will approve the plan for development and operation (PDO), Equinor recognises reserves as proved undeveloped reserves when the PDO is submitted to the authorities. Otherwise, reserves are generally booked as proved undeveloped reserves when regulatory approval is received, or when such approval is imminent. Undrilled well locations in onshore assets in the USA are generally booked as proved undeveloped reserves when a development plan has been adopted and the well locations are scheduled to be drilled within five years.\n\nApproximately 83% of Equinor's proved reserves are located in countries that are members of the Organisation of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). Norway is by far the most important contributor in this category, followed by the USA. Of Equinor's total proved reserves, 5% are related to PSAs in non-OECD countries such as Angola, Brazil, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Libya and Nigeria. Other proved non-OECD reserves are related to concession fields in Brazil and Argentina, representing together 12% of Equinor's total proved reserves.\n\n## Distribution of proved reserves\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1)  Volumes related to the planned exit from Azerbaijan are\n\nincluded in the proved oil and gas reserves at year end 2023.\n\n## Changes in proved reserves\n\nThe total volume of proved reserves increased by 23 million boe in 2023.\n\n## Changes in proved reserves\n\n(in million boe)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Revisions and improved recovery\n\nRevisions of previously booked reserves, including the e/ffect of improved recovery, increased the proved reserves by net 232 million boe in 2023. The increase is the result of 366 million boe in positive revisions and increased recovery, partially o/ffset by 135 million boe in negative revisions. Many producing assets had positive revisions due to better performance, new drilling targets and improved recovery measures, as well as reduced uncertainty due to further drilling and production experience. Increased entitlement volumes from several fields with PSAs added to the positive revisions. The negative revisions were mainly related to unforeseen events and operational challenges resulting in reduced production potential on some assets. The negative revisions also included a direct e/ffect of lower commodity prices, decreasing the proved reserves by approximately 17 million boe through decreased economic lifetime on several assets.\n\n## Extensions and discoveries\n\nA total of 507 million boe of new proved reserves were added through extensions and discoveries. The Raia field in Brazil, the Rosebank field in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Sparta field in the USA are the main contributors in this category and are included in the proved reserves for the first time this year. In addition, this category includes extension of the proved area through continuous drilling of new wells in previously undrilled areas in the Appalachian basin assets in the USA and in Argentina.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Purchases and sales of reserves-in-place\n\nA total of 31 million boe of proved reserves were added through the purchase of Suncor Energy UK Limited in 2023 which included a working interest in the producing Buzzard field.\n\nA total of 35 million boe of sales of reserves-in-place in 2023 are related to the sale of a 28% working interest in the Statfjord area on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) and the sale of our interests in the Corrib field in Ireland.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Equinor entered into an agreement to divest our interests in the AzeriChirag-Gunashli (ACG) field in Azerbaijan. Closing is subject to regulatory and contractual approvals and is expected to take place in mid 2024. The sale will result in an estimated reduction in proved reserves of approximately 45 million boe.\n\n## Production\n\nThe 2023 entitlement production was 711 million boe, compared to 695 million boe in 2022. The increase was mainly due to ramp up to plateau production at the Johan Sverdrup field in Norway and the Peregrino field in Brazil.\n\n## Development of reserves\n\nIn 2023, 325 million boe were matured from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves mainly due to continued drilling in major o/ffshore assets, Johan Sverdrup being the largest contributor, and in the Appalachian basin in the USA. The production start of Vito in the USA in addition to Breidablikk and\n\nABOUT US\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nBauge in Norway added to the maturation of proved undeveloped reserves. The positive revision and improved recovery of proved undeveloped reserves of 90 million boe is related to large o/ffshore fields in Norway such as the Oseberg area, Visund, Johan Sverdrup and Snorre due to continued high activity level and planned future infill wells. Finally, 475 million\n\nboe was added to proved undeveloped reserves through extensions and discoveries. The largest additions in this category are related to the sanctions of Raia in Brazil, Rosebank in the UK and Sparta in the USA, in addition to further development in the Appalachian basin.\n\n## Proved developed and undeveloped reserves\n\n| At 31 December 2023               | Oil and condensate  (mmboe)   | NGL  (mmboe)   | Natural gas  (mmmcf)   | Total oil and  gas (mmboe)   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Developed                         |                               |                |                        |                              |\n| Norway                            | 720                           | 124            | 9,131                  | 2,470                        |\n| Eurasia excluding Norway          | 57                            | 1              | 16                     | 61                           |\n| Africa                            | 107                           | 7              | 70                     | 126                          |\n| USA                               | 201                           | 51             | 1,859                  | 583                          |\n| Americas excluding USA            | 211                           | -              | 42                     | 219                          |\n| Total proved developed reserves   | 1,296                         | 182            | 11,118                 | 3,459                        |\n| Undeveloped                       |                               |                |                        |                              |\n| Norway                            | 426                           | 57             | 2,175                  | 871                          |\n| Eurasia excluding Norway          | 156                           | 2              | 55                     | 168                          |\n| Africa                            | 16                            | 1              | 4                      | 18                           |\n| USA                               | 79                            | 10             | 408                    | 162                          |\n| Americas excluding USA            | 410                           | -              | 710                    | 537                          |\n| Total proved undeveloped reserves | 1,089                         | 69             | 3,353                  | 1,755                        |\n| Total proved reserves             | 2,384                         | 251            | 14,471                 | 5,214                        |",

        "page_content": "As of 31 December 2023, the total proved undeveloped reserves amounted to 1,755 million boe, close to 50% of which are related to fields in Norway. The Oseberg area, Sn\u00f8hvit and Johan Sverdrup fields, which have continuous development activities, together with fields not yet in production, such as Johan Castberg, Munin and Ormen Lange Phase 3, have the largest proved undeveloped reserves in Norway. The largest assets with proved undeveloped reserves outside Norway, are Raia, Bacalhau, Peregrino and Roncador in Brazil, Rosebank and Mariner in the UK, Sparta and the Appalachian basin in the USA, and ACG in Azerbaijan. All these assets are either currently in the production phase or will start production within the next five years.\n\nFor assets with proved reserves where production has not yet started, investment decisions have already been sanctioned and investments in infrastructure and facilities have commenced. There are no material development projects, that would require a separate future investment decision by management, included in our proved reserves estimates. Some o/ffshore development activities will take place more than five years from the disclosure date on many assets, but these are mainly related to incremental type of spending, such as drilling of additional wells from existing facilities, in order to secure continued production.\n\nFor projects under development, the Covid-19 pandemic impacted the progress due to personnel limitations on\n\no/ffshore as well as onshore facilities and yards. The pandemic has delayed production start at the Johan Castberg field in Norway. The field was originally planned to start production in 2022, four years after the field development was sanctioned, but the start-up is delayed to the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nFor our onshore assets, all proved undeveloped reserves are limited to wells that are scheduled to be drilled within five years.\n\nIn 2023, Equinor incurred USD 8.1 billion in development costs relating to assets carrying proved reserves, of which USD 6.7 billion was related to proved undeveloped reserves.\n\n## Reserves replacement\n\nThe reserves replacement ratio is defined as the net amount of proved reserves added for a given period divided by produced volumes in the same period.\n\nThe 2023 reserves replacement ratio was 103% and the corresponding three-year average was 98%, compared to 76% and 62% respectively at the end of 2022.\n\nThe organic reserves replacement ratio, excluding sales and purchases, was 104% in 2023 compared to 89% in 2022. The organic three-year average replacement ratio was 107% at the end of 2023 compared to 70% at the end of 2022.\n\n## Reserves replacement ratio\n\n|                    | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                    | 2023                             | 2022                             | 2021                             |\n| Annual             | 103%                             | 76%                              | 113%                             |\n| Three-year average | 98%                              | 62%                              | 61%                              |\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Expected oil and gas reserves\n\nThis section presents an overview of Equinor's expected oil and gas reserves as of 31 December 2023. Equinor's expected reserves are the result of internal work processes and requirements that follow established industry standards. The definition of expected oil and gas reserves di/ffers from the proved reserves as defined by the SEC. Equinor's expected reserves are estimated quantities of future production in which future increases and decreases are just as likely, while the proved reserves are lower volume estimates which are much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease with time. The expected reserves estimates are economic to produce based on Equinor's internal economic planning assumptions where product prices vary with time, while our proved reserves estimates are based on average first-day-of-month prices for the reporting year, applied flat for all future years, in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rule 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulations S-X of the SEC.\n\nProved reserves are presented as entitlement volumes, while the expected reserves are presented as equity volumes in line with how production is reported on Equinor.com and how our expected reserves estimates in Norway are reported to the Norwegian government through the annual Revised National Budget reporting.\n\nEquinor classifies both reserves and resources according to The Norwegian O/ffshore Directorate's resource classification system 2016. This classification system is comparable to the Petroleum Resources Management System issued by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and others. According to the Norwegian classification system, reserves comprise the remaining, recoverable, marketable petroleum\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n## Classification of reserves and resources according to the Norwegian O/ffshore Directorate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nresources which the licensees have decided to develop and for which the authorities have approved a PDO or have granted exemption from the PDO requirement. Reserves also comprise petroleum resources which the licensees have decided to develop but for which the authorities have not yet approved a PDO or granted a PDO exemption.\n\nThe volumes presented in the following table are the sum of expected future production from 1 January\n\n2024, from sanctioned projects and producing assets, that fulfil these requirements. Expected reserves are further divided into three resource sub-classes; Producing (RC1), Approved for production (RC2) and Decided for production (RC3).\n\nExpected oil and gas reserves were estimated to be 8,935 million boe at year end 2023, whereof 5,632 million boe were in assets in resource sub-class RC1.\n\n## Reference to Reserves report\n\nA separate reserves report is included as Exibit 15.5 to the 2023 annual report on Form 20-F.

        "page_content": "## Working with partners and suppliers\n\nEquinor has ownership shares in many assets operated by other companies. Similarly, other companies have ownership stakes in assets that we operate. The way we work and follow up on partner-operated assets seeks to ensure that governance, risk and performance management is compatible with our own requirements and practices. Through the applicable committee structures in the partnerships, we follow up and support the management of risks and performance related to safety, security, ethics, integrity and sustainability including climate, nature, and social performance.\n\nA significant part of our value chain consists of activities carried out by suppliers working under contracts awarded by Equinor. The suppliers generate considerable value to us, our partners and customers, and we believe in strong relationships with high-quality suppliers. They help us to maintain safe and e/fficient operation at our facilities, realise new projects and create local supplier and employment opportunities. We aim to cooperate with suppliers that operate in accordance with our values and who maintain high standards for health, safety, sustainability and business conduct.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nWe expect that our suppliers meet our expectations related to ethics and compliance, climate and human rights. Details of our climate and human rights expectations are shown below.\n\n## Climate-related expectations for suppliers\n\nTo support our net-zero ambition, we expect our suppliers to:\n\n- \u00b7 Have net-zero ambitions and near-term emissions reduction targets.\n- \u00b7 Publicly disclose scope 1 & 2 emissions and scope 3 emission estimates.\n- \u00b7 Engage with their suppliers on emission disclosure and net-zero plans.\n- \u00b7 Report to CDP Supply Chain Program if requested by Equinor.\n\n## Human rights-related expectations for suppliers\n\nTo support our human rights commitment, we expect our suppliers to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure fair treatment and non-discrimination.\n- \u00b7 Provide safe, healthy and secure workplace and accommodation.\n- \u00b7 Provide fair wages and reasonable working hours.\n- \u00b7 Respect freedom of assembly, association and the right to collective bargaining.\n- \u00b7 Prevent modern slavery, child labour and protecting young workers.\n- \u00b7 Respect a/ffected community members and providing access to remedy.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nIn line with our values of being open and collaborative, we actively engage with internal and external stakeholders to discuss our strategy, approach, and performance. Regular engagement with our stakeholders enrich and challenge our priorities and positions, and contributes to continuously improvement in our performance and strategic direction.\n\nThroughout 2023, we engaged with numerous stakeholders, including investors, governments, regulators, business partners and suppliers, customers, local communities, academic institutions, and nongovernmental organisations. The chair of the BoD, the CEO and senior managers, amongst others, regularly engage in stakeholder dialogues. We consult stakeholders both directly and indirectly, and we seek to reduce potential language, social and geographical barriers. In 2023, we saw a continued interest in our climate-related, safety and human rights practices, rising concern over biodiversity and ecosystem impacts, and increased focus on circular solutions in our stakeholder interactions.\n\nEquinor participates in a wide range of relevant associations and industry initiatives to engage in dialogue, share knowledge and learn from others. The following are some of the associations that we worked with in 2023:\n\nCCSA, G+ Global o/ffshore wind health and safety organisation and Global Wind O/ffshore (GWO), Hydrogen UK, the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP), Ipieca, Methane Guiding Principles, O/ffshore Norge, Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), Oil and Gas Methane partnership, Renewable UK, Sustainability Hub Norway, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures, United Nations Global Compact, Wind Europe, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.",

        "page_content": "## Materiality assessment\n\nA materiality assessment was performed to identify and determine Equinor's material sustainability topics for 2023. The basis for the materiality assessment is the approach described in the GRI standard 3 Material topics 2021 universal standard issued by the Global Sustainability Standards Board, but expanded to a double materiality assessment informed by the approach described in the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS 1). The process included involvement of Equinor subject matter experts, engagement with external stakeholders and calibration and validation by executive management and board committees.\n\nBuilding on more than 20 years of sustainability reporting and topics included in ESRS 1 appendix A, internal subject matter experts participated in topicrelated workshops to assess our impacts on nature and society, while sustainability-related financial upside and downside risks were assessed together with our risk assessment experts. For each topic assessed, an overall impact materiality score and a financial impact score was given based on the guidance in ESRS 1, enabling a ranking of the topics in a two-dimensional plot for further discussion and calibration.\n\nThe views of external stakeholders were included in the assessment based on feedback received through dialogue with di/fferent stakeholder groups. Further we conducted a stakeholder survey, covering a broad range of stakeholder groups representing industry, suppliers, investors, lenders, non-governmental organisations, academia, and trade unions, in which they were asked to provide feedback on the impact and financial materiality of the material topics reported\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nin our 2022 annual report. They were also asked to provide other improvement proposals and additional topics to be considered. The survey, with about 40% response rate, showed a large degree of alignment with our internal assessment on relative materiality of the di/fferent topics. Through the survey we also received feedback that contributed to the decision to have Respecting human rights as a separate topic and include Diversity and inclusion in Workforce for the future. The survey also contributed to merging the two low carbon topics; Net-zero pathway and Emissions reductions, into a single Net-zero pathway topic for current year reporting.\n\nBuilding on the initial assessment and ranking by Equinor subject matter experts and input from the stakeholder survey, relevant functional leadership teams and the executive management committee, including the CEO, were engaged through workshops for calibration and further refinement of the materiality assessment and relative importance of the topics considered. Finally, the Board's Audit Committee and the Boards Safety, Sustainability and Ethics Committee were engaged in a joint workshop for the same purpose. Prior to several of these meetings, participants, including executive management and board members, were asked to do individual survey-based assessments to provide starting points for the workshops.\n\nThe material topics concluded for 2023 are listed in the Material topics table, including assessment of relative impact materiality and financial materiality for each topic. The topics are grouped into our three strategic pillars: always safe, high value and low carbon.\n\n## Material topics\n\n| Strategic pillars   | Material topics                                 | Impact  materiality   | Financial  materiality   |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|\n|                     | Safe and secure operations                      |                       |                          |\n|                     | Protecting nature                               |                       |                          |\n|                     | Respecting human rights                         |                       |                          |\n|                     | Workforce for the future                        |                       |                          |\n|                     | Profitable portfolio                            |                       |                          |\n| High value          | Energy provision and value creation for society |                       |                          |\n|                     | Integrity and anti-corruption                   |                       |                          |\n| Low carbon          | Net-zero pathway                                |                       |                          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaterial\n\nMore material\n\nMost material\n\n<!-- image -->",

Much of our work is intrinsically hazardous and represent major accident risks. About two thirds of our activities are undertaken by contractors, and we are fully committed to strong collaboration with our contractors to safeguard people, the environment, assets, and the societies in which we operate.\n\nWe aspire for zero harm and believe that all accidents related to people, environment and assets can be prevented and all work-related illnesses are avoidable. We therefore aim to embed a proactive safety culture, where we continuously learn from our own experiences and those of our peers, and where safety and security are factored into everything we do. We align our requirements and guidance with international standards and best practices and aim to comply with relevant legislation and regulations.\n\nEquinor benefits from a long history of safe and secure operations within the oil and gas sector. With a growing portfolio and ambitions within renewable energies and lowcarbon solutions, we aim to capitalise on our safety-related knowledge and expertise, and extend it to new value chains.\n\nThe focus for 2023 was to continue to strengthen safety and security barriers and drive awareness and engagement throughout our extended teams, and to remain attentive to the risks posed by the prevailing geopolitical environment.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n## Indicators/Metrics\n\nSerious Incident Frequency (SIF) (number per million hours worked)\n\nTotal Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) (number per million hours worked)\n\nCompletion of cyber security awareness training for employees - since commenced June 2021 (%)\n\n## Key impacts on nature and society\n\nEquinor's operating activities may have actual and potential impacts on people, the environment and assets.

        "page_content": "## Management approach\n\nTo guide us in our journey towards zero harm, we have at a corporate level selected serious incident frequency (SIF) as a performance indicator and total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) as a monitoring indicator. The SIF indicator measures the number of actual and potential unintentional serious incidents and is therefore a good indication of our overall safety performance. TRIF includes injuries involving both Equinor personnel and contractors. In 2023, we enhanced our internal monitoring processes with a wider set of leading indicators, available across the company via an online dashboard.\n\n## Major accident framework\n\nA framework for major accident prevention was developed based on learning from incidents, and recognised industry practice for high-risk industries. The framework applies to all parts of our business that a/ffect major accident risk, and it is built on three pillars: safety barriers, safe practices and design, and leadership, culture and organisational frame conditions. Human and organisational performance principles are embedded in the framework, emphasising the interaction between people, technology, organisations and processes, and how they can influence the causes of human errors.\n\nPrevention of major accidents is about protecting people and the environment, as well as avoiding serious economic and reputational damage to Equinor. In 2023, to further implement the framework, we stepped up our awareness and training programmes for our own employees and have made e-learning training available to suppliers. Also, senior leaders participated in a series of major accident prevention workshops to increase their competence and focus on major accident prevention.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n<!-- image -->",

The main pillars in the 'I am safety' roadmap are safety visibility, leadership & behaviour, learning & follow up and safety indicators. These pillars guide the safety work in the company and are based on learnings from best performers in the industry.\n\nHuman and organisational performance (HOP) principles underpin the way in which we develop a proactive and visible safety culture. The HOP approach provides guidance on how people, technology, organisations and processes interact as a system, and how these conditions can influence the causes of human errors. HOP is implemented in leadership training across the company.\n\n## Safety industry collaboration\n\nEquinor works closely with suppliers and contractors to achieve a standardised approach across our operations.

We therefore maintain appropriate emergency response capabilities to limit the consequences of incidents, should they occur. For example, our oil spill response capabilities are in line with good international practice, and, through membership of local and international oil spill response organisations, we are able to call on the expertise and resources of the wider industry.\n\nTo ensure key people are prepared, we routinely engage in training and simulation exercises involving the emergency services, several of which were carried out during 2023.\n\n## Security Management\n\nGiven the geopolitical environment in 2023, we maintained a heightened level of security awareness and preparedness, both within Norway and across parts of our international operations. The Norwegian government has decided that the Norwegian Security Act will apply to Equinor, as an undertaking handling classified information and controlling infrastructure and engaging in activities which are of vital importance to fundamental national functions. We continue to assess the impacts of these obligations.\n\nIn 2023, we enhanced our security awareness and leadership training to cover insider risk, both for our own employees and in collaboration with suppliers. We also continued to strengthen cyber security barriers and improve our response and recovery capabilities. To identify, assess and manage risks from cyber security\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nthreats, we use a variety of tools and processes. Our aim is to ensure shared situational awareness and common prioritisation across di/fferent business areas related to management of risks from cyber security threats. In addition to assessing our own cyber security preparedness, we also evaluate cyber security risks associated with our use of third-party service providers. During the year there were no cyber-attacks which had a material impact on Equinor.\n\n## Occupational health and safety\n\nThe working environment is integral to our e/fforts to safeguard our people.

Last year we identified two incidents with major accident potential. One of the incidents was a leak from the gas import pipeline to Peregrino C platform on the Peregrino o/ffshore field in Brazil. The other incident was a well control incident while performing well intervention\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\noperations onshore within the Appalachia operated asset, USA. Both incidents were investigated, and work is ongoing to evaluate lessons learned, and to assess the need for revision of our major accident prevention training.\n\nIn our framework for major accident prevention, a major accident is in general defined as an unplanned event causing four or more fatalities or injury/illness cases with significant life-shortening e/ffects and/or major impact on the environment including population of species, ecosystems, and sensitive areas and/or damage to material assets and/or production shut\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n## Serious incident frequency (SIF)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndown, leading to major economic consequences for Equinor. In 2023, we experienced no events defined as actual major accidents.\n\nOur serious incident frequency (SIF), which includes near misses, ended at 0.4 incidents per million work hours. This is at the same level as the two previous years, hence the 2023 target of 0.3 was not achieved. However, there was an improvement over the five-year period 2019-2023 from 0.6 to 0.4, and the number of serious incidents in 2023 is at a record low.\n\n## Process safety\n\nIn 2023 there were 10 serious oil and gas leaks (with a leakage rate \u2265 0.1 kg per second). These 10 incidents include the two incidents with major accident\n\n## Serious oil and gas leakages\n\n/fffi\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- /fffi\u2082flGLYPH<27>GLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<24>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<23>fl\u2082GLYPH<22>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<21>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<22>GLYPH<23>\n\n/fffi\u2082flGLYPH<27>GLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<22>\n\npotential. Number of gas leaks was stable over the last five years, and the target of maximum six leakages in 2023 was not met.\n\nThere was an improvement in number of the more severe (Tier 1) process safety incidents that includes loss of primary containment. A total of eight incidents were classified as Tier 1 in 2023 while the number for 2022 was 14.\n\nA significant e/ffort was made on safety-critical maintenance on the company's installations and plants. At the end of 2023, the backlog in safety-critical maintenance work was reduced by 80% from 2022. This is a continuation of the trend in the past few years. Reducing this backlog is an important part of the work to prevent major accidents.\n\n/fffi",

Since 2017, while there was a positive development for Equinor employees, TRIF for contractors has shown\n\nlittle improvement and strong collaboration with our contractors is essential.\n\nBased on our 2023 performance, we see an overall improvement on safety indicators, but recognise the need to continue to improve our safety performance. Given the measures reinforced in 2023, we believe our approach is adequate to improve our performance and close the gap on our health and safety targets. Security training and awareness will continue as mitigating action to reduce risks from security threats. These objectives remain a top priority for Equinor's management.",

Historically our operated onshore activities were limited to oil and gas, including the drilling and fracturing of wells in the US. Our growing o/ffshore wind portfolio, our recent investments in - and our ambitions for - CCS, solar, hydrogen and battery storage projects underline the increasing importance of our management of onshore environments. Our operations have actual or potential impacts on nature through pollution, including both regular and uncontrolled discharges to sea or land and emissions to air.\n\nOur use of land and sea areas and related disturbances, for example noise, collisions and barrier e/ffects, and introduction of alien invasive species, may also negatively impact biodiversity and ecosystems. This is particularly important if our activities are in or near protected areas or areas of high biodiversity value. Many potential impacts on nature are highly location dependent, and we make information from project-specific impact assessments available on our website. Our locations with the largest freshwater consumption are in Norwegian coastal areas with high annual precipitation and in the Appalachian where water for our well fracturing and clean-up is sourced from the water-rich Ohio river. Freshwater use is therefore not considered among the most material topics to us.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nThrough our partners and suppliers, we can also have indirect impacts on nature, for example in activities where large quantities of materials like metals, cement and chemicals are used. The shift to a more resourcee/fficient, circular economy is a key opportunity to reduce impacts, and this is increasingly being reflected in stakeholder expectations and requirements, for example in the context of the EU Taxonomy and auction criteria for new wind farm developments. Growth in renewables is core to our Energy transition plan, and we work to understand how best to achieve this ambition while avoiding adverse impacts on nature, for example through land/sea use change.\n\nCertain dependencies on nature and ecosystem services have direct relevance for Equinor. For example, healthy oceans provide bioremediation services when we discharge produced water containing minor fractions of oil and chemicals to sea from some of our o/ffshore platforms. Access to natural resources such as wind, sun and hydrocarbons for our energy production can also be regarded as a dependency of nature. Our most important dependencies are assessed to be indirect dependencies through natural resources used in our supply chains.\n\nRelevant nature-related risks for Equinor include: risks related to new policy development, laws and regulations; reputational impacts related to our performance; and market risks including access to acreage for\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndevelopment of new projects. The development of the nature agenda also provides important opportunities. Strong performance can and should be a competitive advantage. We acknowledge the increased focus on nature from consenting authorities, particularly seen in Europe related to the bidding criteria for renewable projects.\n\n## Indicators/Metrics\n\nSerious accidental spills (number of)\n\nNew projects with net positive impact plans (NPI) (number of projects)\n\nSites with site-specific inventory of key biodiversity features (number of assets)\n\n## Key impacts on nature and society\n\nEquinor's operating activities have actual and potential impacts on nature. Impact drivers include potentially serious uncontrolled discharges and operations in or near protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value.\n\n## Financial materiality\n\nSocietal and policy shifts related to protection of nature can a/ffect for instance our access to capital markets and finance, reduce availability and attractiveness of opportunities, lead to diminishing returns and a/ffect our financial performance.\n\nReputational impacts associated with our performance on nature-related issues can support or damage our competitiveness and licence to operate.\n\nFailure to comply with environmental laws or regulations could for instance lead to legal liability, fines, loss of business and materially impact our financial results.\n\n\"Protecting nature\" pertains to the following GRI standards: GRI 301; GRI 303; GRI 304; GRI 305; GRI 306\n\nFor more information regarding our risk factors, please visit 5.2 Risk factors.",

As indicated in our Energy transition plan and set out in our Biodiversity Position, we now aim to go beyond this principle by pursuing a net-positive biodiversity approach. Since 2023, new Equinoroperated development projects located in protected areas or areas of high biodiversity value, are required to develop a plan containing measures for mitigating negative e/ffects and measures aiming to demonstrate net-positive direct impacts on biodiversity.\n\nTo manage our impacts on nature, and comply with applicable laws and regulations, we aim to apply recognised environmental management practices, such as the mitigation hierarchy, the waste hierarchy, the precautionary approach, best available techniques, and the ISO 14001 environmental management principles. These environmental management practices are embedded in our governance, risk and performance framework.\n\nIn the planning phase of all our assets, before construction or operations can commence, a key part of our management approach is environmental, social risk and impact assessments. This is of particular importance when planning for operations in or near sensitive areas, which for example are present in the Arctic. In addition to stakeholder engagement, these processes include baseline studies, surveys, monitoring programmes, and collaborative research projects.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Collaborating in and learning from global initiatives\n\nTo enhance our approach to the protection of nature, we take part in and/or closely follow a range of industry initiatives and, in 2023, there were many important developments on the global nature agenda. For example:\n\n- \u00b7 The Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) published its recommendations in September 2023. We are a member of the TNFD Forum, and work with peers to further our understanding of the related risks, opportunities and specific disclosures for the energy sector.\n- \u00b7 Through our membership of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), we supported its development of a Roadmap to Nature Positive for the energy system.\n- \u00b7 We contributed to various public consultations exercises, such as the Norwegian government's expert commission on nature risk.\n- \u00b7 We continued to support a project led by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) which aims to identify good practices for renewable energy development, specifically addressing the assessment of cumulative impacts and spatial planning.\n\n## Reducing pollution and other adverse impacts on nature\n\nOur governance, risk and performance framework seek to enable us to systematically manage environmental\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\naspects. Our priority is to avoid or minimise potential adverse impacts. For example, substitution of chemicals for less environmentally harmful ones is part of our continual improvement e/fforts.\n\nIn 2023, we continued our focus on environmental regulatory compliance and made improvements at our Norwegian oil and gas assets. This included strengthened management focus, with new competence requirements for operational leaders, development of new training programmes, and related operational measures.\n\nWe also worked with the Norwegian authorities to map and monitor the spread of Didemnum vexillum - an invasive species commonly known as sea vomit - and established our own ongoing monitoring programme. While the species was not observed at any of our installations or harbours, we made an important contribution by monitoring its development and implementing measures to prevent its spread.\n\n## Improving responsible resource use and circularity\n\nIn locations where freshwater resources might be at risk, we are committed to avoiding irreversible harm to these. Through the supply chains for both our oil and gas and renewables activities, we purchase large quantities of steel, cement and other metals and materials. In 2023 we matured our understanding of what circularity may imply for Equinor. We conducted an assessment to identify the most material circularityrelated topics, and where the most immediate\n\nopportunities lie. These include our approach to waste management in general and in decommissioning in particular, embedding circular options in design of facilities, sourcing of secondary materials, extending the useful life of facilities, and pursuing partnerships to achieve more circular value chains. Specific recycling opportunities include wind turbine blades, critical raw materials, and materials from the decommissioning and removal of o/ffshore facilities.\n\n## Pursuing positive impacts on nature\n\nIn line with our Biodiversity Position, in 2023 we started to implement a novel site-specific inventory and netpositive impact (NPI) plans. The site-specific inventory is a company-wide overview of key biodiversity features near our installations. When developing our net-positive approach, it was useful to draw on our participation in research programmes and industry partnerships, such as the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre's (UNEPWCMC) Proteus Partnership.\n\nWe recognise that there are currently no global standards for net-positive approaches, and that there are certain knowledge gaps, for example, related to the feasibility and costs of potential measures and how to monitor e/ffects, particularly in a dynamic marine environment. For this reason, we continue to invest in research and development projects, and examples from 2023 include research on naturebased solutions, nature-inclusive design of o/ffshore wind farms, and metrics and indicators for nature.",

The total number of accidental oil spills and other spills increased from 2022 to 2023. However, the total volume of accidental oil spills decreased. The main reason for the increased volume of other accidental spills was an unintended discharge of 155 m\u00b3 from a drain tank at Njord A due to ejector suction e/ffects from wind and waves during bad weather.\n\nLand- and sea-use change - A summary of our presence in relation to protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value is shown below and a complete overview is available in the Sustainability Data Hub on equinor.com.

We otherwise did not operate within other sites on the WHS list or sites in the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) category 1a ('Strict nature reserve') or category 1b ('Wilderness area').\n\n## Resource use, circularity and waste\n\nHazardous waste quantities increased from 2022, mainly due to increased volumes of water dispatched from Mongstad for further treatment. This water stems from well cleaning at o/ffshore platforms. Drill cuttings and solids exempt waste quantities for our US onshore operations increased due to higher drilling activity, while the produced and flowback water quantity was low due to no well fracturing activity.\n\nWithdrawal and consumption of freshwater in 2023 was 6 million m\u00b3, the same level as in 2022. We had no oil and gas production in areas of high or extremely high baseline water stress as defined by the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct\u00ae tool. Four solar and wind assets in Poland are in such areas. However, water consumption for these assets is insignificant.\n\n## Pursuing positive impacts on nature\n\nNPI plans are being developed for several assets, for which the Rosebank project in the UK and the Empire Wind project in the US are first in scope. The development of the NPI plan for Rosebank was planned completed in 2023, but it was delayed and will continue into 2024.\n\nIn 2023 we developed our site-specific inventory of key biodiversity features for our operated oil and gas and o/ffshore wind assets.

However, we saw improvements relating to better cleaning of produced water and increasing use of renewable electricity as a cleaner energy source for power generation at some platforms.\n\nFor the last two years, we have avoided the large spill volumes we experienced in 2019 to 2021. However, we are not satisfied with not seeing a downward trend in the number and volume of accidental spills from 2022 to 2023. Although we see a decreasing occurrence of breaches of permits since the previous year, the improvement activity addressing governance, competence, awareness and performance in this area, continues.\n\nThe increased number of assets and licences in the proximity of protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value, related to our onshore renewables activity, shows the importance of good management approaches aiming to avoid adverse impacts on these. Improvement activities are ongoing to update internal requirements and practices and improve mapping and understanding of biodiversity features around our facilities.\n\n## Resource use, circularity and waste\n\nThe increased volumes of hazardous water arising from well cleaning at o/ffshore platforms, and dispatched for further third-party treatment, is an issue we are addressing and aim to manage better.

        "page_content": "## Management approach\n\nOur Human Rights Policy and the Code of Conduct apply to all our activities. Further internal requirements and work processes for conducting human rights due diligence are part of our management system. Through our risk management system, we work to identify adverse human rights risks and impacts, and seek to prevent, mitigate or remediate such, as relevant in each situation.\n\nTo further guide our e/fforts in line with the Human Rights Policy, we define general and specific human rights priorities for di/fferent parts of our business, and when deciding where to focus, the concept of severity and likelihood is applied.\n\nGovernance of human rights issues is multi-tiered. Assessing and addressing human rights risks in our daily operations is a business line responsibility. Defining priorities is based on regular risk and portfolio assessments and supported by a corporate team of human rights experts to ensure alignment across the portfolio.\n\nThe executive-level human rights steering committee continues to serve as an advisory group tasked with providing guidance and facilitate experience transfer and good practice, supporting actions to address Equinor's human rights risks, and facilitating engagement with and reporting to the CEC and BoD.\n\nTo understand risks related to our new activities at large, we perform environmental and social impact assessments. These are an essential part of our project development process and include consultation with potentially a/ffected stakeholders. What we learn through\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nthese consultations is used to inform our understanding of and address potential impacts on local stakeholders and communities, including indigenous peoples. Impact assessments in the early phases of project planning inform decision making and allow for more e/ffective mitigation.\n\n## Working conditions in our supply chains\n\nManaging the risk of forced labour and poor working conditions in our supply chains, which was increased by global instability and rising inequality, is a priority. Accordingly, a set of 'Human Rights Expectations of Suppliers' was developed. We continue to actively look for indications of forced labour and unacceptable working conditions in our supply chains, with a particular focus on fabrication and construction activities across Asia and in our core countries such as Brazil. For certain high-risk activities, we may also perform specific human rights risk assessments, typically supported by external human rights experts. Worker dialogue allows us to gain a better understanding of potential issues and to respond with appropriate actions. We follow up with suppliers based on identified risks, including through verifications, tracking of actions and ongoing dialogue. We expect all current and future suppliers to be familiar with and meet our general human rights expectations. Based on factors like scope and location of delivery, which help define risk level, we seek to include specific human rights clauses in our contracts.\n\n## Relevant policies and standards\n\n- \u00b7 Human rights policy\n- \u00b7 The Equinor Book   Who We Are   Commitments\n- \u00b7 Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7 Human Rights Expectations of Suppliers\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n## Performance disclosure\n\n| ALWAYS SAFE                                              | 2023 Ambition                                                       |        | Performance   |      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------------|------|\n| Indicators/metrics                                       | (target year)                                                       | Status | 2023          | 2022 |\n| Respecting human rights                                  |                                                                     |        |               |      |\n| No relevant monitoring indicator available 1             | Determine a suitable human  rights indicator (2023)                 | \uf06c      | Completed     | n/r  |\n| 1)                                                       | Developed two internal monitoring indicators to be piloted in 2024. |        |               |      |\n| \uf06c Ambition met in 2023.                                  | \uf06c Ambition not met in 2023.                                         |        |               |      |\n| \uf06c Plan in place, on track to reach longer-term ambition. | \uf06c Plan in place, not on track to reach longer-term ambition.        |        |               |      |\n\nDuring 2023, we continued our e/fforts to further integrate human rights practices into the way we work, supported by regular senior leadership engagement. We further strengthened our management system and adopted global Equinor working requirements for human rights due diligence. We continued our work to improve our internal framework for recording and monitoring human rights data. In our e/fforts to address our most salient issue, forced labour like conditions in our supply chain, we developed two indicators for internal monitoring that will be tested from 2024.\n\n## Labour rights and decent work\n\nWe require new suppliers to be screened for social criteria. In line with our approach to performing risk assessments in the early phases of our projects, we assessed 303 suppliers for social impacts in 2023. From this, 124 suppliers were identified as having significant gaps. 85% of these suppliers have through closing of gaps become qualified, while the rest of the suppliers\n\nare yet to complete their improvement plans. If we find that a supplier is not willing or able to implement necessary improvements, the supplier might not be awarded a contract. On one occasion, a supplier did not follow up Equinor's requirements to become qualified, and the relationship was discontinued.\n\nWe continued to prioritise HRDD work in project planning and procurement, as we believe early engagement with possible suppliers is key to e/ffectively avoid or mitigate potential adverse impacts and facilitate compliance with our human rights expectations.\n\nBased on our priorities, in 2023, we performed 25 onsite supplier assessments supported by external human rights experts, resulting in 642 workers interviewed and a total sum of 283 total findings in seven countries (Angola, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Norway, South-Korea, USA).

Although all such findings are concerning, our primary focus was towards payment of recruitment fees, retention of identity papers and lack of freedom of movement. The reason for this is that we consider presence of these indicators to exacerbate the risk of forced labour. No actual impacts related to the three priority forced labour indicators noted above were identified in 2023.\n\nIn addition to the assessments referenced above, several of our direct suppliers have started to perform third party on-site assessments including worker interviews. Equinor does not currently have reporting procedures in place to be able to track findings and outcomes of such assessments. However, we engage on a case-by-case basis with the supplier in addressing findings and follow-up actions are taken accordingly.\n\nAt times, the risk of adverse human rights impacts we encounter is not specific to our supply chains, partners, or projects. Rather, such risk can be more systemic in nature and form an integral part of an economy, a particular sector, or an industry. Such systemic challenges are often too large for one company alone to take on successfully. In 2023, we continued our e/fforts to address systemic challenges related to our supply chains. Such initiatives are further described in the Annual Human Rights Statement for 2023.\n\n## Community risks and impacts\n\nEquinor has set up community grievance mechanisms in countries where we have activities, within oil and gas and renewables, such as Argentina, Brazil Poland and South-Korea. Equinor received 14 grievances through our local grievance mechanisms in Tanzania and Brazil,\n\nall of which were handled and are now closed. Further, no actual adverse impacts of indigenous peoples' rights were identified during 2023.\n\nEquinor, together with Shell, continued in 2023 to work towards mitigating human rights risks and impacts associated with the potential LNG site in Tanzania. Since finalising the resettlement of families from the land designated for the project, Shell and Equinor have contracted a third-party service provider to run a post-compensation livelihood programme available to all those that were resettled. The agricultural livelihood programme has commenced, and other subprogrammes are being planned. This was followed up with monitoring and evaluation and is supported by a local grievance mechanism.\n\nEquinor has over the course of the development process for planned o/ffshore wind projects in the US worked to address concerns regarding the potential impact of these activities on local communities. This includes engagement with potentially a/ffected fishing communities and assessing potential impacts that may disturb ancient, submerged landforms culturally significant to tribal nations. Equinor has agreed to more than 15 measures to avoid or minimise impacts to tribal communities during construction and operation of Empire Wind.\n\n## Governance and capacity building\n\nThe BoD's Safety, Sustainability and Ethics Committee received an in-depth human rights report in 2023 related to the risk of forced labour in our supply chain.\n\nThe human rights steering committee has continued meeting regularly and topics of discussion include",

The final statement was issued following extensive but ultimately unsuccessful mediations. The NCP Norway statement did not identify any violations of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises by Equinor but did include a set of recommendations to the group of companies involved in the complaint process.

As we outlined in the 2022 Integrated annual report, these e/fforts were aimed at further integrating human rights practices into the way we work. The consistent implementation of these processes will enable greater systematic and documented due diligence across the portfolio.\n\nOur e/fforts to improve our internal practices for recording data related to our human rights due diligence e/fforts are over time intended to improve our ability to monitor and evaluate performance, and to prepare for upcoming legislation on sustainability reporting.\n\nWe continue to see risk of adverse human rights impacts within our supply chains, particularly related to poor working conditions and indicators of forced labour. Within significant parts of our portfolio, typically major construction projects where there is good visibility and extensive experience, we consider that our e/fforts and performance have improved over time and are currently adequate.\n\nHowever, we acknowledge that within newer value chains, such as low carbon solutions and renewables, and on lower-level tiers of the supply chain, we currently have less insight and active engagement. We seek to gradually increase the coverage of our human rights due diligence e/fforts as we evolve our business, while improving consistency in how we work.\n\nA key priority in the coming year is to initiate a review of our Human Rights Policy considering the external context, our strategy and our portfolio of business activities. As part of this initiative, we intend to perform a corporate-wide saliency review to guide our future e/fforts and facilitate e/ffective human rights due diligence within key areas of risk.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2023, we initiated the development of new HR IT technology that will assist us to further operationalise our D&I strategy by enabling fair HR processes. The new technology will empower employees to develop skills in careers that inspire them, while also providing developmental opportunities. We are planning to begin implementation of the new technology in 2024.\n\nIn Equinor, we aim to empower all employees' development and provide diverse learning opportunities. In 2023, employees spent over 624,000 hours on formal learning. These learnings aim to improve competence development and facilitate innovation and digitalisation. Externally, we actively interact with students and young individuals in Norway to promote the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), along with other competencies crucial for our future needs.\n\nEquinor's workforce includes diverse professional disciplines crucial to our portfolio. In 2023, we strengthened operational leadership through training and reviewed our senior professional network to ensure that our expertise aligns with the energy transition. Based on the findings, we plan to expand our internal and external networks to reapply our expertise in new areas such as low carbon solutions and renewables. This year, we began implementing\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\ninitiatives to identify and address any gaps in commercial and technical competencies related to low carbon solutions and renewable energy.\n\nOne of the strategies to address the growing need for low carbon solutions and renewable energy, is acquisition of and investment in relevant production and technology companies within our industry. Between 2021 and 2023, we invested in five companies within onshore renewables, welcoming more than 300 new colleagues with renewables competencies and local market knowledge to the Equinor group.\n\nInteracting with companies in the energy industry in new ways enables us to transfer specific competence. Within the Equinor & Techstars Energy Accelerator programme run in 2023, mentors, experts, and senior leadership in Equinor supported nine start-ups from six di/fferent countries in accelerating their development in shaping and serving the energy sector.\n\n## Fair and objective recruitment\n\nEquinor recruits new employees across our locations, including graduates, interns, apprentices, and experienced workers. We continuously use our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nannual workforce planning process to pinpoint where today's workforce needs to be developed to meet future ambitions. We are dedicated to maintaining a transparent talent marketplace, embedding the Equality and Anti-Discrimination Act into people processes to promote equality and ensure equal opportunities for all. One of our goals as a global organisation is to join forces with local institutions to develop local talent pools. This is becoming increasingly important as we see a scarcity of people in the market.\n\nIn preparation for recruitment processes, we normally engage hiring managers with recruitment training to ensure fair and unbiased assessment of all applicants. We currently have a global ambition of a 50:50 balance in gender and nationality (Norwegian and other than Norwegian) when hiring for our corporate graduate programme, and an ambition of one-third female for our apprenticeship programme in Norway. We are further re-evaluating our D&I recruitment strategy, and these targets ensure that we build a diverse and robust pipeline of talent to make up our workforce of the future. Prioritising fair and objective recruitment practices in combination with a strong safety culture can help us to establish a solid foundation for a healthy and successful workforce.\n\n## Relevant policies and standards\n\n- \u2022 The Equinor Book   Who We Are   Commitments\n- \u2022 The Equinor Book   Who We Are   People\n- \u2022 Code of Conduct",

Our agreement with unions (Likestillingsavtalen) applies to all employees in Equinor ASA to ensure equal treatment regarding recruitment, pay, working conditions, training, and career development. We continuously use the global annual people survey (GPS), our ethics helpline, and leadership to identify and manage risks, obstacles, causes and measures of discrimination in the workplace. To deliver on our purpose of turning natural resources into energy for people and progress for society, we rely on diversity of thought to find the best solutions and make good decisions, which is stated in the functional requirements for HR, part of our governing documentation. We believe initiatives to build skills and prepare our people for the future should be equally available to all Equinor employees, regardless of diversity characteristics like age, gender, ethnicity, disabilities, sexual orientation and more. As outlined in our Code of Conduct, we do not tolerate any discrimination or harassment of colleagues, or others a/ffected by our operations, and require everyone to be treated with fairness, respect, and dignity.\n\n## Strengthening an inclusive culture\n\nIn 2022, we updated our D&I strategy and ambition, with the aim to further integrate D&I into our systems and processes and continue to strengthen an inclusive culture. Our ambition is 'We are a diverse and inclusive organisation where everyone feels valued and that they belong'. We value diversity of thought and believe in creating an inclusive and psychologically safe work environment, ensuring fair and equal opportunities for all, also beyond our own organisation. To achieve our ambition, we rely on three key enablers: global ambition with a local approach, transparency in data and processes, and leadership coupled with culture. Throughout 2023, we took concrete steps to advance these enablers, and this e/ffort will continue in 2024.\n\nOur D&I strategy empowering the organisation to drive impactful initiatives aligned with local context and legislative requirements. Our employee resource groups (ERGs) gained more members and exposure in 2023, and CEC members have actively partaken in activities to promote internationally recognised awareness days. This year, the ERGs helped raise awareness about the importance of several topics. Through hosting seminars, workshops and di/fferent types of sessions, several employee groups discussed gender balance in the workplace, di/fferent ethnicities in a multicultural global company, and the need to stand up against racial discrimination. Through events focused on expanding our knowledge and awareness, we aim to increase the understanding of and break stigmas around mental health, inclusion of the LGBTQ+ community, and visible and non-visible disabilities.\n\nERGs are voluntary, employee-led groups that come together with the aim to create a diverse and inclusive workplace, with a particular focus on a common diversity characteristic, cause, or goal. The establishment and support for ERGs is important for Equinor to learn about opportunities and challenges linked to equality and equity, and to ensure that we set actions that remove barriers for individuals who identify as part of underrepresented groups.\n\n## Statement on equality and anti-discrimination\n\nEquinor's statement on the actual gender equality in numbers and the work related to the activity duty (statement on equality and anti-discrimination) is included in pages 77-83.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## International Awareness Day annual wheel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We focus on diversity in our early talent programs and have set targets in terms of gender and nationality. In 2023, we welcomed 162 graduates, representing 35 nationalities and 41% females. In Norway, we welcomed 162 apprentices. This year we saw an increase in female apprentices with 39% of the apprentices being female, exceeding our gender target of 33% female. We also o/ffered a summer internship programme to 204 students, representing 28 nationalities and 41% female candidates.\n\nIn 2023, Equinor was chosen as the preferred employer for the 27th time in a row by engineering students in Norway and recognised as one of the three most popular employers in the main categories within finance and IT by students. For professionals, we were recognised as top employer amongst engineers and business professionals and third amongst IT professionals in 'Universum's annual ranking'. In addition, the company was awarded Norway's most attractive technology workplace 2023 in the 'Tekjobb-indeksen' among 70 technology companies.\n\n|                  | Gender balance   (female:male)   | Gender balance   (female:male)   | Nationality balance   (non-Norwegian: Norwegian)   | Nationality balance   (non-Norwegian: Norwegian)   |\n|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Programme        | Hired                            | Target                           | Hired                                              | Target                                             |\n| Graduates 2023   | 41:59                            | 50:50                            | 46:54                                              | 50:50                                              |\n| Apprentices 2023 | 39:61                            | 33/66\u00b9                           | N/A                                                | N/A                                                |\n\n- \u00b9 The apprenticeship programme targets are set aligned to the gender share studying technical fields in Norwegian upper secondary schools.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\n## Workforce composition\n\nEquinor welcomed 2,350 new employees in 2023, Our e/fforts to recruit new talent into renewables and low carbon solutions supports our ambition of being a leader in the energy transition and our goal of being an attractive employer within these areas. As a result of our apprenticeship programmes, recruitment e/fforts, and initiatives for experience transfer and development within our workforce, the average age for Equinor employees in Norway was 46 in 2023. We are encouraged by the work being done by all new and existing employees to build competence that meets our strategic needs, and we are confident that we are building a talent pipeline that enables Equinor's business ambitions.\n\n## 1. Inclusion Index\n\nTo leverage the diversity of thought we have in Equinor, we actively work to increase our employees' sense of belonging, inclusion, and psychological safety. Since the establishment of the inclusion index in 2019, Equinor has used this data to determine actions and opportunities to strengthen our culture and make people feel safe to speak up and report inappropriate actions and behaviour. Equinor D&I roadmap in 2023 focused on actions to ensure inclusion of people with disabilities or caring responsibilities, people belonging to di/fferent ethnicities, the LGBTQ+ community, and people on pregnancy/parental leave. We will continue to work systematically on inclusion across diversity dimensions in 2024 to expand and build stronger competence and deeper understanding of what D&I means across Equinor globally.\n\nIn 2023, Equinor had significant positive engagement on D&I activities supported by the work done by our ERGs. For the first time, we raised global awareness on ethnicity together with the Black in Equinor ERG, and on disabilities with the Able ERG. Together with the newly established Healthy Mind ERG we made mental health resources and activities available for all employees, and focused on building healthy work environments. The Pride Makers ERG increased its internal and external activity, gaining more members, generating safety focused deliverables, and organising local pride events. The Women in Equinor ERG established two new chapters in UK and Canada during 2023, and held events and workshops throughout the year with support from colleagues, senior management, and HR. All these e/fforts have jointly contributed to better understanding of diversity, a safer and more inclusive workplace, increased employee well-being, and progress towards a more gender-balanced workplace.\n\nEquinor has worked systematically with D&I since 2019. Overall, our performance in 2023 was satisfactory, with a focus on operationalising the D&I strategy and ambition. We have strengthened metrics relevant to further integrate D&I in our business and strengthening our future performance. Awareness about various diversity topics were raised, and our 2024 focus is to continue to build more knowledge and understanding about di/fferent diversity dimensions and importance of an inclusive work environment across the locations where we operate.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Diversity in leadership\n\nEquinor works systematically to build a sustainable, robust, and diverse leadership pipeline that feeds through to diverse leadership teams. Our focus was on monitoring gender balance and nationality, while continually working to set up teams that, together, represent diversity beyond these two dimensions. Our systematic focus on developing female leaders is reflected in the continued increase in female leadership over the years, with 45% females among leaders reporting to the CEC in 2023. We continue to focus on representation of nationalities other than Norwegian in our leadership to ensure we represent our global operations.\n\n## 3. Gender pay gap\n\nWe monitor our progress on D&I using available diversity data on gender balance and nationality. Equinor reports the earnings ratio between males and females for both total compensation and base pay. Norwegian authorities require reporting on full breakdown of earning ratios in all major Equinor locations by Equinor's job structure every other year. Equinor will report on this data annually to strengthen transparency on our gender pay gap. Further details on our gender pay gap reporting are available in the Equinor data hub. For 2023, we are pleased to see that the gender pay gap for base pay is 0 for Equinor ASA. We note that there is a gender pay gap in total compensation than in base pay in all our locations. This is largely driven by additional compensation items linked to roles where there is a higher representation of men than women, for example o/ffshore roles receiving o/ffshore allowances. We have partnered\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nwith Mercer to perform regression analysis in Norway, UK, US and Brazil to better understand the adjusted total pay gap which is a better reflection of di/fferences in pay for like work. The results of this study show an adjusted total pay gap of 0.73% in favour of men across those four major locations, and an adjusted total pay gap of 0.63% in Equinor ASA in favour of men. During 2024, Equinor will work to better understand the drivers for these di/fferences and identify potential remedial actions to address them.\n\n## 4. Monitoring our D&I progress\n\nThe number of sexual harassment cases in 2023 remained stable compared to 2022. By openly discussing sexual harassment in the workplace through sessions and safety moments available for the organisation globally, as well as specific leadership workshops, we attained an increased awareness and deeper understanding of the seriousness of the topic in 2023 across the orginisation. Our Code of Conduct was updated with a strengthened emphasis on the expectation for leaders and employees to contribute to a working environment free from harassment and discrimination through improved guidelines to prevent these cases. The 2023 GPS results are strong and show significant improvement in the scores for the question about our employees feeling safe to speak up without fear of retaliation. This is particularly important evidence of our ambitions to prevent sexual harassment or any similar inappropriate actions and behaviours. We will continue to keep the topic high on our agenda for 2024 by actively promoting existing initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sustaining a profitable portfolio and reliably supply energy through the transition, Equinor is transforming its portfolio to become a broad energy company. Equinor believes that by being a leading company in the energy transition, we can not only reduce our own CO\u2082 footprint, but also maximise value for both society and our shareholders. Building a portfolio that has robust profitability through future cycles will be essential for us to deliver on our Energy transition plan and provide shareholder value.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nREPORTING SEGMENT PERFORMANCE\n\n## Indicators/Metrics\n\nRelative Total Shareholder Return (Relative TSR) (quartile)\n\nRelative ROACE* (peer group rank)\n\nReturn on Average Capital Employed* (ROACE) (%)\n\nOrganic Capex* (USD billion)\n\nEquity production liquids and gas (mboe per day)\n\n## Key impacts on nature and society\n\nWe aim to have a profitable and robust portfolio to provide long-term value to our employees, shareholders and societies where we operate, as well as supporting ongoing investments to create future value from energy transition opportunities.\n\n## Financial materiality\n\nMarket conditions such as fluctuating commodity prices, as well as exchange rates and general macroeconomic outlook could significantly a/ffect financial performance of our investments.\n\nGeopolitical and political factors, including legal and policy changes, could impact our business plans, including access to resources, and financial performance.\n\nPhysical e/ffects of climate change could disrupt our operations or increase costs and impact financial performance.\n\nChanges to Equinor's hydrocarbon resource base estimates and ability to access low carbon opportunities can impact future production, revenues and expenditures as well as delivery of our strategy.\n\n\"Profitable portfolio\" pertains to the following GRI standards: GRI 201; GRI 302\n\nFor more information regarding our risk factors, please visit 5.2 Risk factors.",

Future commodity prices are uncertain and Equinor believes it is positioned to capture the upside and withstand the downside.\n\nAs illustrated by the following graph, the gross capex* share to renewables and low-carbon solutions increased from 14% in 2022 to 20% in 2023. Based on current portfolio forecasts, we are progressing on\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour ambitions to have more than 30% of annual gross capex* to renewables and low-carbon solutions in 2025 and above 50% in 2030. Our capital allocation will be contingent on access and profitability, aligning with our ambition of maintaining an average return on capital employed of around 15% in 2035.\n\n## Renewables & Low Carbon Solutions share of gross CAPEX*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1) For 2023, over 90% of the share to REN/LCS was allocated to renewables\n\nDue to the long-term nature of investments in energy projects, the increasing proportion of our investments in renewable projects is expected to have a growing impact on oil, gas and renewable production ratios as projects come into operation. In 2023 Equinor produced a total of 4.4 million TJ of energy, of which 18 thousand TJ was from renewables. By 2030, we have an ambition to have a total of 12-16 GW of installed net renewable capacity, expected to produce between 35 and 60 TWh annually, while maintaining our energy production from oil and gas at around the same level as today. By 2035 we aim to produce more than 80 TWh of renewable power and decarbonised energy\u00b9, of which above 65 TWh is aimed to be renewable power.\n\n1) Decarbonised energy defined as hydrogen, ammonia and gas to power with CCS.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n## Energy production indicator\n\n(Equinor production, expressed as fossil fuel equivalents)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n[1] Energy delivered to grid from gas fired power plants based on third party gas.\n\n[2] The primary energy of fossil based electricity is equal to the energy content of the combusted fuel. Actual gas consumption data is used to calculate this figure.\n\n[3] The primary energy of renewable electricity is calculated based on the equivalent amount of fossil fuel required to generate that amount of electricity in a standard thermal power plant with an e/fficiency of 36.8%. This means that renewable energy delivered to grid (expressed as TJ) is multiplied with a factor 1/0.368 = 2.7.\n\n## Investment criteria\n\nEquinor's strategy is to continue to create long-term, high value growth by developing a broad portfolio and applying strict robustness criteria to investments. To maintain a valuable portfolio in di/fferent possible energy transition pathways, Equinor has a financial framework in place addressing climate-related risks and the robustness of investment proposals.\n\nWhen a project is being sanctioned, it is assessed on multiple measures:\n\n- \u00b7 Net present value (NPV): to bring value to the company and our shareholders.\n- \u00b7 Price sensitivities: to assess the impact of di/fferent prices on the investment.\n- \u00b7 Other considerations include: safety, security and sustainability, optionality, resource e/fficiency and alternative cost, strategic value, country risk, operational capacity and capability. We undertake environmental and social impact assessments for all new projects including consideration of potential human rights impacts.\n\nIn addition, for oil and gas projects, the following assessments are undertaken:\n\n- \u00b7 Break-even price: to remain robust in low-price scenarios we use a break-even target for all oil and gas projects.\n- \u00b7 CO\u2082 intensity: all oil and gas projects are measured on scope 1 CO\u2082 intensity (upstream).\n- \u00b7 Carbon pricing: a CO\u2082 cost acts as an additional element of robustness, including application of Equinor's internal carbon price when calculating financial metrics.\n\nFor renewable projects we also assess the internal rate of return (IRR), real, after tax, full cycle, excluding e/ffects from farm downs and project financing.\n\nEquinor recognises that planned investments that are not sanctioned can have negative economic consequences for connected suppliers, partners, and end users of energy. We therefore work closely with all stakeholders, including local governments to explore solutions that enable Equinor to proceed with investment, or alternatively to find new developers or owners.",

We assess the portfolio transition risk by testing the net present value after tax (NPV) and the revenue robustness by applying price assumptions for oil, natural gas and CO\u2082 tax in each of the WEO scenarios, relative to using Equinor's commodity price assumptions. Additionally, we assess potential impairments (detailed in note 3 Climate change and energy transition to the Consolidated financial statements) when applying the price assumptions in the relevant WEO scenarios.\n\nPhysical climate risk assessment - Equinor also disclose an assessment of the portfolio exposure to possible climate-related hazards, using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP's) scenarios provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nBy evaluating our portfolio against the scenarios outlined in the WEO report and assessing physical climate risk exposure, we can ensure that we have a resilient value creating portfolio that is able to remain profitable through challenging market conditions and climate scenarios.\n\n| IEAs WEO scenarios                                     | Stated policies   scenario (STEPS)                                                                                          | Announced pledges  scenario (APS)                                                                             | Net-zero emissions by 2050  scenario (NZE)                                                                                              |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Description                                            | A scenario based on the  latest implemented policy  settings, including energy,  climate, and related  industrial policies. | A scenario where all  national energy and  climate targets made  by governments are  met on time and in full. | A scenario where the world  moves on a potential path  towards limiting global   warming to 1.5 \u00b0C relative   to pre-industrial levels. |\n| Temperature rise to 2100   (from preindustrial levels) | 2.4 \u00b0C                                                                                                                      | 1.7 \u00b0C                                                                                                        | 1.4 \u00b0C                                                                                                                                  |\n| Change in demand for  Oil in 2050 (from 2022)          | +1%                                                                                                                         | -43%                                                                                                          | -75%                                                                                                                                    |\n| Change in demand for Natural  Gas in 2050 (from 2022)  | 0%                                                                                                                          | -42%                                                                                                          | -78%                                                                                                                                    |\n| Change in REN TWh production  in 2050 (from 2022)      | ~350%                                                                                                                       | ~550%                                                                                                         | ~700%                                                                                                                                   |\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nTransition stress test results - Compared to last year's annual report, the positive impact of the STEPS scenario declined from 41% to 11%, while the impact of the APS scenario changed from positive 17% to negative 5%, as illustrated by the figure below. The impact from the NZE scenario resulted in a 42% decrease in NPV this year, compared to a decrease of 22% in the previous year. Consistent with previous years, we assume a linear bridging between the prices in the current year and the first price point given by the IEA in 2030, which also this year significantly impact the change in results from year to year.\n\nThe figure below illustrates the changes in revenues from Equinor's portfolio in the WEO scenarios relative to using Equinor's commodity price assumptions for 2030 and 2035. The STEPS scenario provides a\n\n## Change in net present value after tax (NPV)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npositive e/ffect, with a 4% and 3% increase in 2030 and 2035 respectively. In the APS scenario, the revenue decreases by 3% and 5% in 2030 and 2035, while the revenue in the NZE decreases by 27% and 23% in 2030 and 2035 respectively.\n\nOur long-term strategy remains firm, and our portfolio and capex flexibility can reduce the negative impact seen in the low-price scenarios by mitigating actions such as re-optimising the non-sanctioned portfolio. Furthermore, the scenarios only stress oil, natural gas and CO\u2082 price, not reflecting the potential impact on our renewable and low carbon solution projects in an accelerated transition scenario, as indicated by the increasing market size of CCUS and a global growth in renewable energy production of ~700% by 2050 in the NZE scenario, as illustrated in the IEAs WEO scenarios table.\n\n## Change in revenue\n\n<!-- image -->",

Volume weighted average.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe oil and gas projects coming on stream within the next 10 years have a pay-back time at around 2.5\u00b2 years and a volume-weighted break-even at around 35 USD/bbl\u00b3, below the oil price in NZE in both 2030 and 2040. As such, our oil and gas portfolio is expected to remain robust even to a sharp decline in prices as seen in the NZE scenario. Equinor also maintains significant capex flexibility in our current portfolio, with only our sanctioned projects being committed, representing less than 50% of the yearly organic capex* from 2025. This will allow us to optimise and re-prioritise our nonsanctioned projects to ensure we continue to generate high value through cycles.\n\nAs previously mentioned, these scenarios do not fully capture the upside potential Equinor could capture in renewables and low carbon solutions. For renewables, we maintain our expectations of a real base project return of 4% to 8% (after tax, full cycle, excluding e/ffects from farm downs and project financing). From this level we can capture additional value by pulling di/fferent levers depending on the project and market, as exemplified by Dogger Bank and our onshore solar plants in Europe achieving equity returns of 12-16%. For our low carbon solution projects, we expect real base project returns of 4-8% in the early phase with government support while maturing the markets. As markets mature, we expect further value uplift potential.\n\nMethodology - NPV is calculated forward looking from 2024. We test the change in NPV and revenues of our portfolio by applying the price assumptions for oil, natural gas and CO\u2082 tax in each of these scenarios and compare the impact towards the value calculated at our commodity price assumptions. Equinor's commodity price assumptions are based on management's best\n\nestimate of the development of relevant current circumstances and the likely future development of such circumstances. This price-set is currently not equal to the price-set in accordance with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 as outlined in the WEO Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario. Consistent with previous years, we assume a linear bridging between 2023 prices and the first price point given by the IEA in 2030. We further assume a linear interpolation between IEA's prices from 2030 to 2050 and that the price in 2050 is kept constant in real terms thereafter. USD 2 per boe transportation cost for oil production is added to compare with Brent Blend. Finally, exploration activities are not included due to the uncertainties related to potential discoveries and development solutions. The results of this NPV and revenue transition test should not be directly compared with the result of the impairment test shown in note 3 Climate change and energy transition to the Consolidated financial statements, as they are not stress testing the same financial metric, although both are based on the same WEO scenarios and commodity price assumptions.\n\nCarbon pricing and carbon costs - For portfolio and decision analysis, our base assumptions include a carbon cost for all assets and projects. In countries where no such cost exists, we use a generic cost starting from 2025. We use a default minimum at 82 USD per tonne (real 2023), that increases to 115 USD per tonne by 2030 and stays flat thereafter. In countries with higher carbon costs, we use the countryspecific cost expectations. This carbon cost is included in investment decisions and is part of break-even calculations when testing for profitability robustness. The actual CO\u2082 costs for Equinor-operated assets were USD 1,276 million in 2023.",

The STEPS and APS scenarios from the WEO report predicts lower absolute carbon costs compared to Equinor's assumed CO\u2082 cost. The NZE scenario has a marginal higher carbon cost compared Equinor's internal assumptions, which demonstrates that Equinor's carbon pricing assumptions are in line with a potential scenario where the world moves towards limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C relative to pre-industrial levels.\n\n## Physical Climate Risk\n\nEquinor's portfolio comprises o/ffshore and onshore assets across a diverse set of regions around the world. While the company's core business today is centered on the NCS, the move towards a broader and more international energy company will lead to changes in the company's geographic footprint.\n\nIn accordance with the TCFD\u00b9 recommendations, Equinor is addressing climate-related physical risks for our assets, including both acute (extreme weather events) and chronic risks (longer-term shifts, such as sea level rise). To assess the exposure of our assets\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nto possible climate-related hazards we model the portfolio to di/fferent climate scenarios using data analytics software, provided by Jupiter Intelligence. In 2023 we assessed the exposure of 117 assets in which Equinor has an equity interest to several hazards, including wind, heat, fire, flood, hail, waves, sea level rise and precipitation. The data provide details on hazard exposure both today and the expected change in exposure between 2020 and 2050. We have also performed a third-party verification of the results for some selected assets to enhance our understanding of uncertainties and give input to further improvements.\n\nThe results for our onshore and o/ffshore assets for the SSP5-8.5 scenario can be seen in the figures below, which also show the relative book value of di/fferent clusters of assets by reporting segment. An increase in temperature and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events under SSP 5-8.5 is widely considered to be an unlikely scenario beyond current business-as-usual scenario, but it is included following the precautionary principle and in accordance with EU Commission guidance. Consistent with information published in the 2022 report, the model provides hazard scores equally weighting across wildfire, flooding, hail, heat, precipitation and wind. Sea level rise is also included in the modeling. While the assessment provides details on the exposure of assets to di/fferent hazards, it is not a direct indication of risk, as all Equinor installations are designed to tolerate a range of meteorological conditions as appropriate to their location.\n\nAs shown in the figure below, the results show that the majority of Equinor's onshore assets by book value\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nare assessed as having relatively limited exposure to climate-related change in physical environment. The onshore assets subject to the highest present-day exposure and with the greatest changes in exposure towards 2050 are the EPI and REN assets in South America.\n\nSeveral of the parameters studied are not relevant for our o/ffshore portfolio, and in 2023 we have added\n\n## Onshore portfolio exposure\u00b9 to physical climate hazards according to the SSP5-8.5\u00b2 scenario\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b9  Bubble size based on relative size of the book value of assets.\n- \u00b2  SSP5-8.5 reflects a fossil fuel-intensive world combined with high radiative forcing and represents a very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario.\n\nwave modeling to the assessments of the o/ffshore assets.

For most of the installations, the initial screening of exposure indicates that the increased exposure will be within the design margins of the installation. Those assets subject to the highest present-day exposure are o/ffshore installations in the US Gulf of Mexico and REN North America, while those\n\n## O/ffshore portfolio exposure\u00b9 to physical climate hazards according to the SSP5-8.5\u00b2 scenario\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b9  Bubble size based on relative size of the book value of assets.\n- \u00b2  SSP5-8.5 reflects a fossil fuel-intensive world combined with high radiative forcing and represents a very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario.\n\nwith the greatest changes in exposure towards 2050 are the renewable installations in North America and oil and gas assets in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nMore detailed risk assessments are required to assess the climate risk and to implement mitigating measures,",

It also empowers us with knowledge to implement any measures to ensure we are profitable for the future and able to create value for shareholders through capital allocation and distribution.\n\n## Relevant policies and standards\n\n- \u00b7 The Equinor Book\n- \u00b7 Code of Conduct\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n## Performance disclosure\n\n| HIGH VALUE                                                    | 2023 Ambition                            |        | Performance        | Performance   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------|---------------|\n| Indicators/metrics                                            | (target year)                            | Status | 2023               | 2022          |\n| Profitable portfolio                                          |                                          |        |                    |               |\n| Relative Total Shareholder Return   (Relative TSR) (quartile) | Above average in  ranking among peers\u00b9   | \uf06c      | 8 of 12            | 6 of 12       |\n| Relative ROACE* (peer group rank)                             | First quartile in   ranking among peers\u00b9 | \uf06c      | 1 of 12            | 1 of 12       |\n| Return on Average Capital Employed*  (ROACE) (%)              | >15% yearly   (2023-2030)\u00b9 ,  \u00b2          | \uf06c      | 24.9               | 55.1          |\n| Organic Capex* (billion USD)                                  | 2023 outlook   guiding 10-11\u00b9            | \uf06c      | 10.2               | 8.3\u00b3          |\n| Equity production liquids and gas   (mboe per day)            | 2023 outlook guiding  \u02dc3% above 2022\u00b9    | \uf06c      | Growth  2% (2,082) | 2,039         |\n\n## Highlighted: Performance indicator.\n\n- 1)  Outlook and ambitions presented at CMU 2023 or in Annual report 2022.\n- 2)  Based on 2023 CMU reference case (70 USD/bbl).\n- 3)  Adjusted to USD/NOK exchange rate assumption in the Outlook presented at CMU 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf06c Ambition met in 2023.\n- \uf06c Plan in place, on track to reach longer-term ambition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf06c Ambition not met in 2023.\n- \uf06c Plan in place, not on track to reach longer-term ambition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, capital expenditures will be spent on various extensions, modifications and improvements on currently producing fields and on exploration opportunities.\n\nInternationally, we estimate that a substantial proportion of 2024 capital expenditures will be spent on projects with recent final investment decisions such as Raia, Rosebank and Sparta. In addition, 2024 capital expenditures will be mainly spent in Bacalhau field and non-operated onshore activity.\n\nWithin renewable energy, capital expenditure in 2024 is expected to be spent mainly on o/ffshore wind projects. In addition, further investments are planned in our onshore projects.\n\nEquinor finances its capital expenditures both internally and externally. For more information, see debt and liquidity management in the section 2.1.\n\nEquinor has committed to certain investments in the future. A large part of the capital expenditure for 2024 is committed. The further into the future, the more flexibility we will have to revise expenditures. This flexibility is partially dependent on the expenditure joint\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nventure partners agree to commit to. For further information, see note 26 Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nEquinor may alter the amount, timing or segmental or project allocation of capital expenditures in anticipation of, or as a result of several factors outside our control.\n\n## Return on average capital employed (ROACE)*\n\nThe return on average capital employed (ROACE)* was 24.9% in 2023, compared to 55.1% in 2022.

Within our home, energy provides heating, cooling and lighting, and allows for access to digital services. As the energy transition progresses, we continue to balance our obligation to provide energy security with the need for decarbonisation and a/ffordability.\n\nWith the recent energy crisis and geopolitical instability, a key priority in 2023 was energy security, given that Equinor is one of Europe's largest energy companies. This year, we provided 2,082 mboe per day of oil and gas and 4,235 GWh of electric power. The aim of being a reliable energy partner stays firm.\n\nDelivering value to society beyond its products and services, is fundamental to any business. In the communities where we are present, we also create jobs, pay taxes to governments, and provide income opportunities to our approximately 8,000 suppliers and sub-suppliers. In addition, we support socioeconomic development and humanitarian relief through voluntary and mandatory social investments, strategic sponsorships and donations.\n\nMore information about our tax contributions and payments to governments can be found in the stand-alone Payments to governments report.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Indicators/Metrics\n\nEnergy production (TJ to market)\n\nPayments to governments (USD billion)\n\nShare of procurement spend locally (%)\n\n## Key impacts on nature and society\n\nThrough our balancing of a/ffordability, security and sustainability in our energy provision, and through making contributions to the societies where we operate, we can significantly influence socio-economic development.\n\n## Financial materiality\n\nChanges in political, economic, and social factors related to the energy trilemma could present new opportunities, a/ffect attractiveness of opportunities and value from current and future investments.\n\nRemaining commercially and technologically competitive is important to develop and operate an attractive portfolio of assets in current and new value chains. Deployment of innovative or new energy technologies could enhance or threaten value of Equinor's expected energy portfolio and impact our planned strategy execution in the transition to a broad energy company.\n\nChanges in investor and societal sentiment related to our portfolio and performance can a/ffect our access to capital markets, attractiveness for investors, and potentially restrict access to finance or increase financing costs.\n\n\"Energy provision and value creation for society\" pertains to the following GRI standards: GRI 202, GRI 203; GRI 204; GRI 207; GRI 413; GRI 415\n\nFor more information regarding our risk factors, please visit 5.2 Risk factors.",

        "page_content": "## Management approach\n\n## Energy provision\n\nTo produce and provide energy in a way that creates value to society is a balancing act that we face daily. As an energy company, we need to balance the energy trilemma of a/ffordability, security, and sustainability. The economic and geopolitical instability in 2023 emphasised the societal importance of energy security.\n\nTo increase security of supply we are shifting towards more long-term agreements that are predictable for all parties and facilitate energy planning. The 2023 gas sales agreements with Germany's stateowned energy company SEFE, for 111 terawatt hours until 2034, and a Letter of Intent for hydrogen supply towards 2060, serve as examples of how we manage long-term, reliable supply of energy and decarbonisation at scale.\n\n## Tax contribution\n\nWe believe that responsible and ethical behaviour is a prerequisite for sustainable business. Tax transparency is promoted through our Tax and transparency policy and our Code of Conduct, and supported through our membership in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), where Equinor has been an active supporter since its beginning in 2009. Equinor was among the first major O&G companies that voluntarily disclosed payments to governments in 2004.\n\nWe do not tolerate or support the facilitation of illegal tax evasion. Our tax planning is driven by the objective to match income with expenses to obtain\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\na tax deduction for all valid business costs and to avoid double taxation according to the principles of domestic laws and guidelines.\n\nEquinor ensures e/fficient compliance with tax rules and regulations by engaging openly with tax authorities around the globe concerning uncertainties or tax disputes which may arise.\n\nWe believe that transparency goes beyond the provision of legally required information to tax authorities, it extends to proactive consideration of other stakeholders. Therefore, we publish annually a Tax contribution report and a Payment to governments report, read more here Governance and transparency - Equinor.\n\n## Local procurement and employment\n\nEquinor strongly supports building local capacity, and we seek to prioritise goods and services from local suppliers wherever possible. Where goods and services are competitive in terms of price, quality and delivery, our contracting and procurement strategy gives first consideration to those produced and provided locally. First consideration for employment and training opportunities is also given to qualified local residents who otherwise meet all of the qualifications required. We actively engage in local supplier development, training, wider social investment partnerships and local outreach programmes to facilitate local employment and use of local suppliers.\n\n## Social investments\n\nIn alignment with our just transition approach, our social investments strategy focuses on education, skills-and capacity-building, nature restoration and\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nenhancement, and access to energy for vulnerable groups. These investments are identified and managed at a local level and will be measured by positive impact to people, as well as annual investment cost. All social investments are evaluated for strategic fit and comply with internal procedures, including anticorruption compliance requirements, as well as local regulations.\n\nLocal authorities and non-governmental organisations also help us understand the needs and expectations of our host communities. These are key to informing business models and project strategies that can deliver lasting value to the community and its support to our activities.\n\nOur new long-term partnerships with humanitarian aid organisations Red Cross and the Norwegian Refugee Council with fixed yearly donations allow for predictability and continued engagement as well as efficiency in delivering ad hoc local projects.\n\n## Relevant policies and standards\n\n- \u2022 The Equinor Book   Our Purpose\n- \u2022 The Equinor Book   Our Vision\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Enabling societal progress through tax contributions\n\nPaying the right tax where value is created is central to Equinor's commitment to contributing to progress for societies. In 2023, the Equinor group paid USD 28 billion in corporate income taxes and USD 3 billion in royalty payments and fees to local and national governments, including host entitlement. USD 27 billion was paid in Norway, where Equinor has the largest share of its operations and earnings. The reduction in corporate income tax payments relative to the prior year is due to the impact of lower commodity prices in 2023 compared to the extraordinary market conditions of 2022.\n\nThe full Payments to governments report for 2023 pursuant to the Norwegian Accounting Act \u00a73-3d and the Norwegian Security Trading Act \u00a75-5a can be found at our website: Governance and transparency - Equinor. We published our second tax contribution report in December 2023, which provides further insight into our approach to tax and explains why and where we pay the taxes we pay.\n\n## Procurement and employment that enable growth and opportunities\n\nThriving domestic supply chains are important for regional economic development and for us, as we deliver new projects and invest in long-term infrastructure that will be operational for decades. A significant contribution to society in terms of monetary value is our purchase of goods and services, totalling approx. USD 18.1 billion in 2023, of which 89% was spent locally. As a large company, we are also a significant source of employment in the communities where we operate. In 2023 we employed 2,350 number of people across 17 countries.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Energy provision\n\n## Energy production indicator\n\n(Equinor production, expressed as fossil fuel equivalents)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/fffi/ff\u2082\n\n/fffi/ff/ff\n\n[1] Energy delivered to grid from gas fired power plants based on third party gas.\n\n[2] The primary energy of fossil based electricity is equal to the energy content of the combusted fuel. Actual gas consumption data is used to calculate this figure.\n\n[3] The primary energy of renewable electricity is calculated based on the equivalent amount of fossil fuel required to generate that amount of electricity in a standard thermal power plant with an e/fficiency of 36.8%. This means that renewable energy delivered to grid (expressed as TJ) is multiplied with a factor 1/0.368 = 2.7.\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n## Supporting a just energy transition\n\nWe are committed to contributing to an energy transition that is just and inclusive, that respect human rights and brings about long-term social and economic benefits. To achieve this, we engage in dialogue and collaboration with all our key stakeholders - our workforce, supply chain, partners, industrial customers and local communities. Notable examples include:\n\n## Norway: The Northern Area Unit\n\nEquinor has established a unit called 'the Northern Area Unit' with a mandate to strengthen value creation, collaboration and competence building in this region. The unit works with suppliers to identify opportunities for local deliveries, and to enhance supplier development. Measures to strengthen local recruitment are also initiated, e.g. the \"North development program\", and an industry development program, \"Empowering northern societies\" is also established, addressing key challenges related to market, technology and society in the energy transition.\n\n## UK: Rosebank investments bring local opportunities\n\nIn the UK, Rosebank oil and gas field is expected to create ripple e/ffects in the supply chain and boost local job creation. According to\n\n- a socioeconomic study, if sanctioned, it is\n\nestimated to create GBP 8.5 billion of direct investment, of which GBP 6.6 billion is likely to be invested in UK-based businesses. During the peak of the construction phase the project is expected to support around 2,000 jobs, and it will continue to support around 525 UK-based jobs during the 25 years lifetime of the field. We acknowledge there is public debate about our Rosebank oil and gas field in the UK, and we respect the di/ffering views. Nevertheless, we believe there are sound reasons for developing Rosebank. This project is part of our contribution to energy security, creating jobs, and we plan to reduce CO\u2082 emissions from production through electrification measures.\n\n## US: O/ffshore Wind Ecosystem Fund\n\nThe Ecosystem Fund is a collaboration between Equinor and the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) to foster the o/ffshore wind industry in New York City. The Ecosystem Fund will contribute $5 million towards the following objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Scaling the talent pipeline in o/ffshore windrelated careers\n- \u00b7 Supporting low-income New Yorkers and New York City Housing Authority residents in the green energy transition\n- \u00b7 Growing the green energy innovation ecosystem in New York City",

        "page_content": "## Social investments\n\nIn 2023, we spent USD 3.4 million\u00b9 on social investments internationally\u00b9, the majority of which were contractual obligations. The mandatory investments are often longerterm initiatives targeted towards underprivileged groups with a focus on science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) education, vocational training and skills building to improve employability, as well as healthcare and economic empowerment for women. Our voluntary social investments are aligned with our just transition framework, helping drive resilience in our host communities. In 2023 material contributions included support for our community funds in the US and UK, as well as collaboration with the fishing industry in Brazil. An overview of Equinor's social investments in 2023 is presented in our Sustainability data hub.\n\n## Supporting humanitarian e/fforts in the longer-term\n\nSupporting humanitarian organisations is aligned with Equinor's sustainability strategy and our just transition plan. We prioritse longterm partnerships to increase predictability and e/ffectiveness for our partners. In 2023, we signed partnership agreements with Red Cross and the Norwegian Refugee Council, which commit us to a dedicated yearly amount per partnership. 50% is allocated to mutually agreed projects, and 50% is allocated freely by the partner organisation. This amounts to a total of NOK 40 million per year for both organisations. Equinor will also use the partnerships for additional local donations to projects, as relevant. The agreements run for three years, plus an optional extension for two more years.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nWhile the urgency of the climate challenge is clear, the world faces several related imperatives, including affordability of energy, security of supply, and ensuring a just and equitable energy transition. The political and market volatility of recent years has underlined the importance of energy security and the close relationship between energy prices and macroeconomic stability. With an inflation affecting both consumer ability to pay as well as prices of input goods through the supply chain, the need for reliable and affordable energy has become more apparent.\n\nOverall, we increased our provision of energy by 2% in 2023, positively contributing to energy security. However, as gas prices were significantly down compared to the extraordinary price levels seen in 2022, our revenues decreased, and our tax contributions and payments to governments reduced accordingly.\n\nDespite the drop in revenues, we continued our local spending and job creation at former levels, and we increased our voluntary investment spending. We deem our contributions to the communities we operate in a key element of sustainable and long-term value creation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It applies to our employees, board members and hired personnel who, each year, are required to confirm that they understand and will comply with the Code of Conduct. We expect our suppliers to act in a way that is consistent with our Code of Conduct, and we engage with them to help them understand our ethical requirements and how we do business. If our expectations are not met, we take appropriate action. In 2023, the Code of Conduct was reviewed and several sections were updated, and in particular, those related to harassment, bullying and discrimination.\n\n## Anti-corruption\n\nOur Code of Conduct explicitly prohibits engaging in bribery and corruption in any form. Equinor's anticorruption compliance programme summarises the standards, requirements and procedures implemented to comply with applicable laws and regulations and maintain our high ethical standards. The programme lays down the foundation for ensuring that bribery and corruption risks are identified, concerns are reported, and measures are taken to mitigate risks in all parts of the organisation. We have a global network of compliance o/fficers who support the business in identifying and handling business integrity risks and ensure that ethical and anti-corruption considerations are integrated into our activities no matter where they take place. Equinor provides risk-based regular training across the organisation to build awareness and understanding of the anti-corruption compliance programme.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Competition and antitrust compliance\n\nEquinor's Code of Conduct also addresses the requirement to comply with applicable competition and antitrust laws. Our competition and antitrust programme consists of governing documents and manuals, and training of employees in high-risk positions, as well as regular risk assessments and assurance activities.\n\n## Trade Controls compliance\n\nEquinor's Code of Conduct also addresses the requirement to comply with applicable sanctions and export control laws. Our trade controls programme consists of governing documents and guidance, and training of employees in high-risk positions, as well as regular risk assessments and assurance activities.\n\n## Key 2023 improvement initiatives\n\nFundamental and advanced business integrity competence requirements mapped to position and role in the company is consecutively being implemented in all business areas and functions. One main task in 2023 and going forward was to monitor the training statistics generated, and to deliver relevant trainings where needed. Our training e/fforts included general and targeted training and awareness sessions. Ethics and compliance was further strengthened as an integrated part of performance and reward assessments. A leadership onboarding programme was developed and is currently being piloted. The programme includes, among other items, elements on ethics, integrity, and creating and maintaining a speak-up culture through self-study, a gamified app solution and a three-day physical programme.\n\nIn 2023 Equinor further strengthened the risk-based bottom-up approach of its business integrity risk\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nprocess, by adding new requirements for corruption risk assessment at asset and organisational entity level.\n\n## Reporting and handling of concerns\n\nAccording to Equinor's Code of Conduct, all employees have a duty to report suspected violations of the Code or other unethical conduct. We require that our leaders work systematically and pro-actively to prevent, detect and respond to possible breaches of the Code and other ethical issues. Employees are encouraged to report/ discuss concerns with their line manager or the line manager's superior, or to use available internal channels established to provide support. Concerns can also be reported through our Ethics Helpline which allows for anonymous reporting and is open for employees, business partners and the general public. Equinor has a strict non-retaliation policy and does not tolerate any form of retaliation against any person who has raised an ethical or legal concern in good faith.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe legal business ethics and compliance function is headed by the chief ethics and compliance o/fficer (CECO), who reports to the executive vice president legal and compliance. The CECO is also able to report matters directly to the CEO, the BoD, the board audit committee (BAC) and the board's safety, sustainability and ethics committee (SSEC).\n\n## Collaboration and stakeholder engagement\n\nAt Equinor, we believe in the value of collective action to actively promote anti-corruption and revenue transparency. We have long standing relationships with the UN Global Compact, the World Economic Forum's Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) and Transparency International (TI). We are also a\n\nlong-standing supporter of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). In 2023 Equinor was assessed by EITI to meet all EITI company expectations.\n\n## Relevant policies and standards\n\n- \u00b7 The Equinor Book   Who We Are   Commitments\n- \u00b7 Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7 Ethics and compliance in Equinor\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Synthesis Report (March 2023) found that average global temperatures have already risen 1.1\u00b0C since pre-industrial levels; that every region of the world is facing 'widespread adverse impacts' of climate change; and that global warming is now 'more likely than not' to reach 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The IPCC's models found that limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C would depend on deep global emissions reductions this decade'. Importantly, the IPCC found that feasible, e/ffective, and lowcost options for mitigation and adaptation are available. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the speed of the roll-out of key clean energy technologies means that demand for coal, oil and natural gas will all peak this decade even without any new climate policies. Despite the progress, much more is needed to get the world on track to achieve the ambitions of the Paris agreement. The IEA projects that current policies will result in emissions leading to temperature increases of around 2.4\u00b0C, and that clean energy investment needs to increase from the record level of USD 1.8 trillion in 2023 to\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\naround USD 4.5 trillion a year by the early 2030s to be in line with the 1.5\u00b0C pathway.\n\nAs an industrial company focused on the production and delivery of oil, gas, electricity, low-carbon products and services, our business has both direct and indirect impacts on the climate. The indirect emissions (scope 3) associated with the use of the oil and gas products we sell are many times higher than those under our operational control. There are also emissions in our broader supply chain, with over 8000 direct suppliers delivering goods and services including transportation of our products and the capital goods embedded in the projects we develop. While the scale and urgency of the climate challenge are clear, the world faces several related imperatives, including a/ffordability of energy, security of supply, and ensuring a just and equitable energy transition. This context presents a complex external landscape for Equinor as we execute on our transition strategy where climate-related changes in policy, technology, markets and public sentiment presents risks and opportunities that could a/ffect Equinor's business plans and financial performance.\n\n## Indicators/Metrics\n\nUpstream CO\u2082 intensity, Scope 1 (kg CO\u2082/boe)\n\nAbsolute GHG emissions scope 1 and 2 (million tonnes CO\u2082e)\n\nNet carbon intensity (gCO\u2082e/MJ) (Includes GHG emissions from scope 1, 2 and 3 - Category 11, Use of sold products)\n\nAnnual gross CAPEX* to renewables and low carbon solutions (%)\n\nRenewable energy installed capacity (GW, equity)\n\n## Key impacts on nature and society\n\nEquinor has significant emissions from its operations (11.6 mt CO\u2082e scope 1+2 operated) and from use of sold products (250 million tonnes CO\u2082e, scope 3 - Category 11).\n\n## Financial materiality\n\nPolicy, legal, regulatory, market and technology developments, including stakeholder sentiment, related to the issue of climate change, could a/ffect our current and future business plans and financial performance.\n\nCompetition for assets, changing levels of policy support, di/fferent commercial/contractual models, as well as interest and inflation rates pose risks to returns within the renewables and low carbon industries.\n\n'Net-zero pathway' pertains to the following GRI standards: GRI 302; GRI 305\n\nFor more information regarding our risk factors, please visit 5.2 Risk factors.",

        "page_content": "## Management approach\n\n## Finding opportunities in the energy transition\n\nEquinor sees opportunities for value creation in the energy transition both through optimisation of its oil and gas business and through utilising its competitive capabilities across new areas of the energy system. In a decarbonising world with a broad energy mix, we expect that policymakers and stakeholders will set a premium on oil and gas produced in a responsible and increasingly carbon e/fficient way. We also see long term opportunities in developing a profitable low carbon and renewables portfolio which will help us meet our own net-zero ambitions and those of society at large.\n\nIn renewables, we have an ambition to become a leading global player in o/ffshore wind. We were an early mover in key o/ffshore wind markets - including floating - and are well placed to strengthen our competitive position and achieve the economies of scale necessary to improve returns. To build a competitive wind portfolio, we are applying our extensive experience in technology, innovation and project delivery. Another key opportunity set lies within low carbon solutions, where we focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen. This is a natural role for Equinor: to decarbonise the energy we supply and to help industrial end-users with transporting and storing captured carbon. Building on our strong position in industrial value chains in Europe, we are applying our technical and engineering competence to bring low-carbon products and services to the market. We are developing a broad funnel of projects to be at the\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nforefront of de-risking and maturing new technologies and business models. These include early positioning in CCS licences, innovative commercial agreements with industrial emitters for the transport and storage of emissions, and piloting of high-impact hydrogen projects.\n\n## Equinor's pathway to net zero\n\nEquinor's strategy for achieving net zero is summarised in our Energy transition plan (ETP), a plan that was informed by engagement with a wide range of stakeholders, including shareholders, governments, non-governmental organisations, academia, and civil society. The ETP is based on three main pillars: reduction in our operated emissions to 2030; increased allocation of capex to investments in renewables and low carbon solutions (gross capex*) to 2030; and reduction in the carbon intensity of energy we provide (including scope 3) according to specific milestones on the way to net zero in 2050. In addition to the main corporate decarbonisation and transition ambitions, the plan includes a series of short-term industrial project milestones that demonstrate our concrete commitment to delivering our transition strategy. A 2023 progress report Energy transition plan, summarising performance on key ambitions, can be found in chapter 1.\n\n## Risk management and governance\n\nAs outlined in Equinor's governing documents, the board is responsible for overseeing the company's\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nstrategy, internal controls and risk management. Climate-related upside and downside risks, and Equinor's strategic response to these are discussed frequently by the board.  Our management system includes our policies, requirements, and guidelines. Together with our corporate governance principles and performance framework, this forms the basis for how we are embedding climate and sustainability issues in our business activities. Management of climate-related risks is embedded in our enterprise risk management framework and applied across the company with the aim of creating value and avoiding incidents. We have standardised risk processes to identify, evaluate and manage upside and downside risk, and which consider risks with potential to a/ffect our business in the short, medium and long term.\n\nWe assess climate-related risks across two main dimensions: transition risk and physical climate risk. To assess and manage transition risks we use scenario and sensitivity analysis, including net present value (NPV) stress tests against all relevant scenarios published by the IEA. Details of our stress testing and scenario analysis are published in section Climate Scenario Testing (Transition Stress Test), Profitable portfolio. For physical climate risk, we map the exposure of our global asset portfolio against a range of climaterelated perils and scenarios, including heat, flood, fire, and wind, and assess potential asset vulnerability. The results of the 2023 exposure mapping can be seen in section Physical Climate Risk, Profitable portfolio.\n\nEquinor aligns its climate-related disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and we include explicit reference to the TCFD recommendations in section 5.6.\n\nSuccess also requires an internal governance and performance framework that is informed by our transition ambitions.\n\nClimate and energy transition-related goals and ambitions are included as part of the remuneration policies. Performance on the upstream CO\u2082 intensity of the oil and gas portfolio is integrated as a performance indicator for the corporate CEC and is linked to remuneration. The same performance indicator also influences remuneration as input to the decision on general bonus. The CEO, his direct reports and Equinor's wider leadership are assessed based on results within a broad range of topics, including safety, security and sustainability. The ability of executive leaders to be role models and drive the energy transition forward forms part of the holistic performance evaluation.\n\n## Relevant policies and standards\n\n- \u00b7 The Equinor Book   Our Vision\n- \u00b7 The Equinor Book   Who We Are   Commitments\n- \u00b7 Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7  Our Climate Policies",

We aim for at least 90% of this ambition to be realised by absolute emission reductions. Our total scope 1 and 2 operated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 2023 were 11.6 million tonnes CO\u2082, meaning that our operated emissions are 30% lower than in 2015. However, because of several operational developments, including resumption of the Hammerfest LNG facility in Norway and the Peregrino field in Brazil, the 2023 operated scope 1+2 emissions were 2% higher than in 2022. While operational factors contributed to a slight increase in 2023, we made progress on the portfolio of emission abatement measures that provide the main contribution to reaching our 2030 ambition. Examples of emissions abatement milestones in 2023 included the start-up of the Hywind Tampen o/ffshore wind supplying renewable power to the Gullfaks and Snorre fields and the electrification of the Gina Krog field with power from shore. In 2023, the Norwegian Government approved Sn\u00f8hvit Future project, for full electrification of the Hammerfest LNG facility, expected to result in annual reductions of 850,000 tonnes of CO\u2082.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Equinor's emissions prognosis shows that we are tracking slightly behind schedule on our ambition of a 50% net reduction by 2030, assuming that all current abatement projects in the project portfolio are approved by our partners and authorities. A portfolio of options for emissions abatement continues to be explored to enable us to reach the 2030 ambition.\n\nEquinor continued its work to reduce the upstream CO\u2082 intensity, which was 6.7 kg CO\u2082/boe in 2023, below\n\n## Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (operated, million tonnes CO\u2082e)\n\n(million tonnes, 100% operated basis)\n\nFigure: Operated scope 1 + scope 2 emissions 2023 vs 2022 with\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfi1fifi\n\n- fi12345167893063\u2082fl/ff\u00b9\u00b2fl\u22650fl\n- fi12345678903\u2082736fl/ff\u2082\u00b9\u2082/ff\u00b2\u2265\u2264\u00b3\u0119\u0144\u2083fl/ff\u2082\u011973GLYPH<9>9\u00b99GLYPH<9>367\u01443GLYPH<8>9/ff5\u0119\u0144\u0119GLYPH<9>\u01198\u00b2\n- fi12345677689730\u2082fl/ff1\u00b968935\u2082\u00b27/ff0\u20827\n\nfi1fi2\n\nkey levers/contributions.\n\n## Upstream CO\u2082 intensity\n\n(kg CO\u2082 per boe, 100% operated basis)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUpstream: All operations from exploration to production, excluding onshore gas processing and LNG facilities.",

This development is, on track towards the ambition of 6 kg CO\u2082/boe in 2030, and significantly lower than the industry average of 16 kg CO\u2082/boe (IOGP 2022). Our 2023 upstream flaring intensity was 0.8 tonnes/1000 tonnes of hydrocarbon produced compared with 0.7 in 2022. The main reason for the marginal increase in flaring levels in 2023 was the restart of production from the Njord A field and increased flaring at Gullfaks C due to turnaround and maintenance. Equinor's low flaring levels are due to continued e/fforts to improve operational e/fficiency and leveraging the well-established gas infrastructure in Norway. The average methane intensity of our\n\n## Equinor methane intensity vs industry average (OGCI)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOGCI Progress Report 2023. The results are lagging by one year.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\noperated assets in 2023 remained very low at 0.016% - around one tenth of the industry average (based on OGCI (Oil and Gas Climate Initiative) collective average) of 0.15%. Equity scope 1 CO\u2082 emissions in 2023 were 9.5 million tonnes, an increase from 9.1 in 2022. The main driver of the increase was the first fullyear operation of the Triton gas-fired power plant since Equinor's joint acquisition of the facility in 2022.\n\nWe were pleased to be named by the IEA as an 'example of best practice' for the average emissions intensity of our Norwegian upstream operations in its November 2023 report on the Oil & Gas Industry in Net Zero Transitions.\n\nForecast (Q4, 2023)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe IEA also provided a framework for assessing oil and gas company alignment with its Net Zero Emissions scenario. According to the framework, companies in the sector can only be fully aligned with Net Zero Emissions if they do not have investments in new oil and gas projects. For companies continuing to invest in new\n\nprojects, the framework assesses alignment across two dimensions: scope 1+2 emissions reductions and plans for investment into clean energy. The combination of Equinor's carbon e/fficient operations and its 2030 capex ambitions put it in the leading segment for each category.\n\nSource: Figure 3.20, An IEA framework for assessing alignment of company targets with the outcomes of the NZE Scenario.

        "page_content": "## Increased investments in renewables and low carbon solutions\n\nIn 2023, we saw continued progress on the leading indicator of capital allocation to transition-related activities, with 20% of our gross capex* allocated to renewables and low carbon solutions, a materially higher share than in 2022 (14%), and on track towards our ambition of 50% in 2030. Over 90% of this investment was allocated to renewables, with the remainder allocated to our Northern Lights Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) project. However, on net carbon intensity (NCI), the metric we use to track our corporate progress towards net zero in 2050, we saw a regression in 2023. Our ambition is to reduce the NCI of the energy we provide by 20% by 2030 and by 40% by 2035. This ambition includes scope 3 emissions from the use of our products. The NCI of the energy we provided in 2023 was 67 CO\u2082e/MJ, which is 1 percentage point higher than in 2022 and 1% reduction compared to the 2019 baseline year. The year-over-year rise was due to an increase in the ratio of oil to gas in our production portfolio as the energy security crisis in Europe stabilised and the extraordinary increase in demand for Equinor's gas seen in 2022 subsided. Key drivers for reducing net carbon intensity in the coming years will be rapid buildout of our renewables business and the deployment and scaling up of low carbon value chains, including carbon capture and storage (CCS). For renewables, we have an ambition to have an installed\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\ncapacity of 12-16GW by 2030, while for CCS we increased our ambitions in early 2024, targeting 30 million to 50 million tonnes per year (mtpa) by 2035 up from our previous ambition of 15-30mtpa.\n\nIn 2023, Equinor's installed renewable capacity was 0.9GW (equity share) and renewable energy production was 1938GWh, an increase on both metrics compared to 0.6GW and 1649GWh in 2022. The delivery of first power from our Dogger Bank A project in October 2023 marked a significant milestone in the development of what will be the world's largest o/ffshore wind farm. The project, which is expected to reach full commercial operation in 2026, is planned to have a total capacity of 3.6GW. Our acquisition of Rio Energy, a leading onshore renewables company in Brazil and the closing of the acquisition of Danish solar company BeGreen energy added around 8 GW of capacity to our project pipeline.\n\nLike other developers, Equinor faced an increasingly challenged business environment in the o/ffshore wind sector in 2023. Empire Wind, our flagship development on the US east coast, saw increased costs due to inflation and supply chain constraints. Nevertheless, we remain committed to the ambition of profitable growth in renewables. US federal approval of Empire Wind in November was a welcomed development and we continue to work to improve value creation for the project.\n\nIn addition to progress on renewables, we saw an increase in the volume of CO\u2082 stored in 2023 to 0.8 million tonnes, up from 0.5 million tonnes in 2022. Accumulated, Equinor has stored 27.1 million tonnes of CO\u2082 on the Norwegian Continental Shelf since 1996. We saw two major developments in our CCS portfolio in 2023: the acquisition of a 25% stake in Bayou Bend, a major CCS project in the US Gulf Coast with gross potential storage resources of more than one billion metric tonnes, adding 5 million tonnes per year (mtpa) of transport and storage to our portfolio; and the award by the UK North Sea Transition Authority to Equinor and its partners of additional CCS storage licenses, which will enable the Northern Endurance Partnership project to double its CO\u2082 storage capacity to around 10 mtpa from 2030.\n\nThese projects will be important contributors to our new ambition of 30-50 mtpa of transport and storage by 2035.\n\nAs outlined in our Energy transition plan, delivering on each pillar of our transition strategy will require the necessary frame conditions and the support of policy makers. Our ambitions to continue to expand our global renewables and CCS portfolios will be contingent on governments putting in place the necessary permitting and fiscal regimes and making acreage available for both offshore wind and carbon storage.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2023 we achieved significant progress with partners in the public and private sector on accelerating decarbonisation.\n\n## Supply chain decarbonisation\n\nIn our broader supply chain, we see opportunities to use our procurement and supplier relationships to drive decarbonisation in integrated and adjacent sectors, including shipping, steel, and cement. Our Energy transition plan includes a commitment to 'work with our suppliers and customers, host governments, and civil society to develop the business models, policies and frameworks to enable the world to achieve net zero by 2050'. In 2023 Equinor established groupwide expectations to all our suppliers that lay out expectations to have net-zero plans and emissions reductions ambitions, and to disclose their emissions. They also include an expectation for suppliers to work with their own suppliers on emissions disclosure and net-zero plans. Progress on the number of suppliers that meet these expectations will be followed up and published as part of our annual reporting and internal performance indicators were established by our procurement organisation to measure and incentivise compliance.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Increase Climate Resilience in Supply Chain through specific KPIs Monitoring of climate performance of most material suppliers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupplier disclosing information to CDP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSuppliers reporting scope 1 & 2 emissions\n\nSuppliers reporting scope 3 emissions estimates\n\nSuppliers with climate targets\n\nSuppliers engaging their suppliers\n\nSuppliers reporting verified scope 1 emissions\n\nSuppliers reporting verified scope 2 emissions\n\nSuppliers allocating to Equinor\n\nREPORTING SEGMENT PERFORMANCE\n\nemissions Source: CDP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE",

        "page_content": "In 2023, we also signed up to the CDP Supply Chain module to get more detailed insight into our suppliers' emissions data and climate policies. Equinor contacted the most material suppliers, in total representing around two thirds of spending on upstream goods and services: 60% responded, with over three quarters of respondents reporting scope 1+2 emissions and scope 3 emission estimates. The 2023 data will provide a baseline from which we will be able to measure progress on our supplier expectations in future years.\n\n## Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter\n\nAt COP28, Equinor signed the historic Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter, an industry-wide initiative joined by 50 national and international oil producing companies, equivalent to more than 40% of global oil and gas production. While Equinor's emissions reduction and transition plans already exceed the Charter's provisions, the initiative provides a much needed platform for ambition and transparency among companies and a framework for cooperation with national oil companies continued decarbonisation e/fforts.\n\n## Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund\n\nIn December 2023, Equinor became a founding corporate donor to the Global Flaring and Methane Reduction (GFMR) fund, a new World Bankadministered initiative to support flaring reduction and methane abatement in the oil and gas sector. The GFMR is a multi-donor trust fund focused on helping developing countries cut carbon dioxide and methane emissions generated by the oil and gas industry. According to the World Bank, the GFMR will provide more than $250 million and mobilise billions from the\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nprivate sector to support those countries with the least capacity and resources to address these emissions. The partnership will focus on providing grant funding, technical assistance, policy and regulatory reform advisory services, institutional strengthening, and mobilising financing to support action by governments and operators.\n\n## OGCI Satellite Monitoring Campaign\n\nTogether with fellow members of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, we made significant progress on a key initiative for industry leadership on methane emissions in 2023. OGCI's flagship programme on methane is the Satellite Monitoring Campaign, which collects highresolution data on large-magnitude methane plumes and uses confidential engagement with local operators to help them identify and address the sources of the emissions. The SMC published its first set of findings in 2023; continued with execution on the second phase of the project in Algeria, Kazakhstan, and Egypt; and began work on the third phase of the project, which more than doubles the number of countries and assets covered and has the potential for the elimination of millions of tonnes of CO\u2082e per year.\n\n## Policy engagement and advocacy\n\nEquinor promotes policies supporting the goals of the Paris Agreement and actions to accelerate the energy transition. We also actively work to ensure that the policy positions and advocacy of our membership organisations are supportive of and aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. To ensure transparency, we conducted and published our annual review of industry association and membership organisations in 2023 showing areas of potential\n\nmisalignment. The 2023 review included details of our withdrawal from industry association which was found to be misaligned with our climate policies. Our climate policy positions and our expectations of our membership associations are available on Equinor.com. We engage with a wide range of external independent benchmarking and assessment organisations, including\n\nClimate Action 100+, CDP, InfluenceMap and others, in an e/ffort to be a proactive stakeholder in the development of e/ffective frameworks for assessing corporate performance in the energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our 2023 performance on operated scope 1+2 emissions reductions and net carbon intensity (NCI) was in line with expectations. Our year-over-year performance underlines the e/ffects of market fluctuations, operational factors and project schedules on individual metrics, as well as the need to maintain a multiyear perspective to see the e/ffects of decarbonisation and transition investments.\n\n2023 saw a significant increase in the power generated from our renewable portfolio as well as substantial additions to our portfolio pipelines in renewables and CCS. As deployment of renewable and CCS accelerates in the coming years, we expect to see greater progress in NCI reductions, with the majority of progress towards the 20% reduction ambition in 2030 expected in the second half of this decade. As a leading indicator, capital allocation is the metric that showed the most progress in 2023 as we increased the share of gross capex* to renewables and low carbon solutions, from 14% in 2022 to 20% in 2023.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nWe remain committed on delivering on the ambitions in our Energy transition plan. Meeting the 2030 and 2035 NCI ambitions will put us well ahead of society's progress towards net zero in 2050. Equinor's ability to deliver on its transition ambitions and its net 2050 ambition will continue to be dependent on enabling policy and regulatory frameworks. It will also require continued engagement with suppliers and peers. In both of these areas, we saw positive progress in 2023. Our participation in the CDP Supply Chain module gave use a higher level of granularity into supplier emissions plans and performance while our new climate expectations to suppliers send an important signal that we will use our influence as a customer to drive decarbonisation through the value chain. We are proud to have engaged in several initiatives in 2023 to help the broader industry e/fforts towards decarbonisation, including through our participation in the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter, our contribution to the World Bank Global Flaring and Methane Reduction fund and our ongoing work with peers and partners through bilateral engagement and through industry associations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2023 we invested more than USD 650 million 9 in R&D including digitalisation e/fforts. The TDI business area is working closely together with the other BAs to solve the most important challenges to reach our ambitions. By combining partnerships, competence, data, technology and by fully utilising the opportunities within AI, we aim to secure longevity and competitiveness in our oil and gas portfolio as well as unlock new business opportunities in the energy transition.\n\nIn our Energy transition plan, we set out to allocate 40% of our R&D funding to low carbon and renewable technologies by 2025. Two years ahead of target, we achieved this ambition level in 2023.\n\nEquinor is deepening its external technology collaboration in several dimensions. The main ambition for the academia agreements is to develop capabilities that are needed to succeed in both current and new business. We are collaborating extensively with research facilities and suppliers in Norway and internationally to accelerate innovation. We are also exploring how technology ecosystems, where industrial players are collaborating with start-ups and research facilities, can contribute to solving the big challenges the energy transition brings.\n\nBiodiversity is a topic with special focus across the research portfolio. Equinor collaborates and co-innovates with international academic institutions and consultancies to ensure trustworthy and acknowledged results. A few examples of our work in this space include enhancing understanding of potential impacts of our activities\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\non seabirds and migratory birds and utilising new infrastructure such as drones, surveillance cameras etc. to document and disclose impacts on nature.\n\nIn the following sections, we summarise some of the key technologies that we are developing to deliver reliable energy, deliver on our ambitions in the Energy transition plan and finally reach net zero by 2050. A significant share of the technologies and competence that are developed for oil and gas can be reused for renewable, low carbon solutions and other new possible future business opportunities.\n\n## Oil and Gas\n\nTo unlock the total potential in our oil and gas portfolio we are combining data, new technology and competence. Over the last two years we have invested USD 200 million in new high-quality exploration seismic data with technologies like Ocean bottom and Topseis on the NCS, representing a step change in image quality. To significantly increase insight and processing speed we have developed AI based technologies using deep learning algorithms which recognise complex patterns in pictures, sound waves, and other data sets. By combining new technologies with our industry leading subsurface competence, we are identifying opportunities in mature areas that we were not able to see before. An example of this is the Troll area where 500 million new boe were proven with a significant upside potential. This is equivalent to a full year of NCS equity production.\n\nTo secure competitiveness across the portfolio, we are constantly seeking improvements through technology in safety, emission reduction, value generation and cost.\n\nSome examples of such improvements from 2023 include:\n\nBy using drones for inspection in confined spaces, we reduced human exposure to hazardous components. Also, robots are used for observation and cleaning operations on drilling deck to avoid humans in red zone.\n\nIn 2019 we opened our Integrated Operation Centre (IOC) in Bergen. IOC is monitoring a huge amount of data from our o/ffshore operations to optimise production and improve decisions through AI. The value\n\ncreated from increased production and reduced CO\u2082 emissions was more than USD 2 billion in 2023 (100%).\n\nUsing AI-based predictive maintenance to reduce unplanned downtime is one area where we have already seen large savings. One recent example is from the K\u00e5rst\u00f8 processing plant where a machine learning algorithm picked up early signals of a turbine failing. The savings from this alone are estimated to be USD 30 million. We are widely implementing predictive maintenance across our entire portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## O/ffshore wind\n\nIn 2023 we made several technological achievements within o/ffshore wind. Our focus areas in the o/ffshore wind research are improved early phase assessments, high quality metocean and wind modelling, improved hydrodynamics and marine concepts for o/ffshore wind farms. Environmental site characterisation for safe and cost-e/fficient design and operation of o/ffshore wind farms is key. We are utilising our world class competence on marine biology and weather/wake models for wind farm planning and layout.\n\nBuilding on our experience from the Integrated Operation Centre we are introducing new technology for operation and maintenance at the Dogger Bank windfarm. We have developed digital solutions, that in combination with sensor data and machine learning algorithms, give us a unique operating system that can expand the lifetime of our wind turbines. These solutions are currently not available in the industry. This has extended the expected lifetime of the project from 25 to 35 years, allowing us to increase revenues from the merchant period, reduce operational costs and increase e/fficiency. We intend to scale these solutions to the entire wind portfolio.\n\nWe are using our o/ffshore wind farms like Hywind Tampen, the world's largest floating wind farm, to increase knowledge of possible environmental impact and how these can be mitigated.\n\n## Hydrogen and Ammonia\n\nEquinor's research portfolio includes several projects addressing the safety, governance and potential environmental e/ffects of Hydrogen and Ammonia. Minimising and monitoring hydrogen leakages is vital\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nfor sustainable hydrogen deployment. Equinor has initiated projects aimed at detection and quantification of hydrogen emissions, as well as the development of sensors and measurement procedures for fugitive hydrogen emissions.\n\nAmmonia, a low carbon maritime fuel, has significant potential and we are participating in a pilot to demonstrate an ammonia-power combustion engine, combined with an ammonia-powered fuel cell. The pilot combines EU funding through the EU ShipFC project and ENOVA funding through the APOLLO project. The pilot is a platform supply vessel 'Viking Energy', owned and operated by Eidesvik O/ffshore ASA and contracted to Equinor. Ammonia bunkering solutions will also be tested.\n\nTo realise the hydrogen value chain, large scale hydrogen storage in salt caverns may be an important enabler. Equinor has conducted technology assessments and established a roadmap for hydrogen salt cavern qualification which includes participation in external pilot projects including the EU-funded Hypster project.\n\n## Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)\n\nWe have 27 years of experience from CCS on the NCS and our subsurface and drilling capabilities are crucial for de-risking and developing CO\u2082 storage sites. Our experience in developing complex large o/ffshore infrastructure, our pipeline operational capabilities and high-end technology capabilities like multiphase flow gives us a great starting point to develop next generation gas infrastructure - CO\u2082 and H\u2082.\n\nThe research projects address the entire CCS value chain to mature, cost-e/fficient technology solutions within CO\u2082 capture, transport, and subsurface storage. To\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nensure safety and sustainability it is key to understand CO\u2082 behaviour and appropriately monitor CO\u2082 in the subsurface.\n\nEquinor has 22% ownership in Test Center Mongstad (TCM), the world's largest test center for CO\u2082 capture. Since its inception in 2012, almost all key global carbon capture companies have tested and developed technologies here. In 2023 we signed an agreement to continue operations of TCM for 2 more years.\n\nIn 2023 we started implementing AI algorithms for automatic seismic fault interpretation, which are aimed at improving precision and speed of fault interpretation for both oil and gas and within CCS. For CCS this is highly important as accurate and e/fficient mapping of\n\npotential CO\u2082 leakage routes along faults are vital for identification of safe, long-term CO\u2082 sequestration sites.\n\n## Venture opportunities\n\nEquinor Ventures is Equinor's corporate venture capital arm investing in innovative scalable companies and developing relationships to accelerate the energy transition. We believe that the innovation, creativity and agility of startups in collaboration with industrial players like Equinor can drive change towards a lowcarbon future. More than 70% of our venture capital and more than 90% of new investments are allocated to renewables, low-carbon solutions and future opportunities.\n\nLast year we entered a strategic partnership with Captura to develop an industrial scale solution to remove CO\u2082 from the ocean. We will pilot Captura's Direct Ocean Capture (DOC) technology at the K\u00e5rst\u00f8 processing plants where we re-use the seawater used for cooling the processing plant. The captured CO\u2082 is planned for the commissioning of the Northern Lights facilities. This pilot is an important step towards commerciality for DOC.\n\nThe second example is our partnership with Lithium de France (ldF), a start-up aiming to extract lithium and heat from brines. Equinor and LdF have a strategic collaboration agreement which includes a wide range of topics related to lithium extractions from brines and where Equinor's core competence like subsurface is relevant. We are currently testing Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technologies at Equinor's research center in Trondheim. The DLE technologies could pave the way for new types of lithium resources with a lower environmental footprint than current extraction methods.",

        "page_content": "## Exploration & Production Norway\n\nAfter more than 50 years of operation, Equinor's equity production from the NCS remains high, at around 1,374 mboe per day generated from 46 fields operated by Equinor and 7 fields operated by partners. E&P Norway's net operating income exceeded USD 29 billion in 2023.\n\nEquinor has a strong belief in the longevity of the NCS and expects substantial value creation for decades to come. The production from NCS strengthens the energy security in Europe and is a key enabler in realising Equinor's strategy.\n\nExploration activity resulted in 12 commercial discoveries in 2023 all of which were made close to existing infrastructure, in line with the exploration strategy. Approximately 80% of the wells each year are focused on infrastructure led exploration, while the remaining 20% test new ideas or new plays. Exploration activity was carried out in 28 wells with 26 wells completed in 2023, including 7 sidetracks, compared to activity in 22 wells with 19 wells completed in 2022.\n\nE&P Norway has a project pipeline of over 20 sanctioned projects where the largest projects are:\n\n- \u00b7 Johan Castberg (Equinor 50%, operator), a subsea field development connected to the Johan Castberg FPSO currently under construction, with scheduled start-up in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n- \u00b7 Irpa (Equinor 51%, operator), a tie-in project to Asta Hansteen with planned start-up in 2026.\n- \u00b7 Halten East (Equinor 57.7%, operator), a tie-in project to \u00c5sgard with scheduled start-up in 2025.\n- \u00b7 Sn\u00f8hvit Future project (Equinor 36.79%, operator), which cuts emissions and extends the life of the Sn\u00f8hvit field. Scope covering onshore gas compression has scheduled start-up in 2028.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template\n\nAll rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Carbon reduction ambitions:\n\nE&P Norway's ambition is to reduce the CO\u2082 emissions from operated fields by 50% by 2030, 70% by 2040, and be close to net zero by 2050 (when compared to 2005 levels). E&P Norway aims to achieve these targets through energy e/fficiency (20%), consolidation (20%) and electrification of long-lived production hosts (60%).\n\nE&P Norway has adopted a plan backed by concrete actions and has sanctioned two thirds of the projects needed to reach the 2030 ambition while the remaining projects are being further matured.\n\nOngoing projects to electrify Sleipner, Troll B and Troll C (scheduled start-up in 2024), Oseberg (scheduled start-up in 2026), Njord (scheduled start-up in 2027), and Sn\u00f8hvit Melk\u00f8ya (scheduled start-up in 2030) are expected to contribute further to reducing the carbon footprint.\n\nElectrification on the Norwegian continental shelf will reduce emissions in Norway. O/ffshore, the energy e/fficiency of power production is only about 25-35%, whereas in Europe, e/fficiency is about 60% if used in a gas-fired power plant, and close to 100% when used for heating and industry. Replacing gas turbines, either completely, or partially, with electric power therefore provides increased energy e/fficiency and thus climate benefits.\n\nHighlights for carbon reduction in 2023 include:\n\n- \u00b7 Hywind Tampen, o/ffshore wind farm supplying power to Snorre and Gullfaks field was o/fficially opened in August 2023.\n- \u00b7 Gina Krog started receiving power from shore in September 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With a robust project portfolio in the execution phase and a valuable non-sanctioned portfolio, field development activity is expected to remain high on the NCS. In addition, a large remaining potential from improved recovery and exploration could be realised through new technologies. Overall, E&P Norway's ambition is to deliver 20-30 exploration wells and 50-70 improved recovery wells each year. This would result in at least 125 wells every year, including project wells.\n\nIn 2023, E&P Norway was awarded 26 new production licences, and 12 discoveries were made close to existing infrastructure.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Delivering on CO\u2082 ambitions\n\nThe CO\u2082 abatement portfolio is progressing towards the ambition of a 50% emissions reduction from operations in Norway by 2030, through electrification, consolidation, and improved energy e/fficiency on the existing installations. In 2023 approvals were received for Njord Electrification and the Sn\u00f8hvit Future Project. The Gina Krog platform was electrified and connected to the Utsira High power grid in September. In August the Hywind Tampen floating o/ffshore wind farm was o/fficially opened, and it is delivering 35% of Snorre and the Gullfaks fields total energy needs.\n\n## From an oil and gas province to a broad energy province\n\nNorway Energy Hub, Equinor's industrial plan to transform the NCS into a broad energy province led by E&P Norway, saw good progress. Equinor and RWE signed a collaboration agreement to develop low-carbon energy solutions with a focus on establishing an energy partnership between Germany and Norway.\n\nEquinor applied for new CO\u2082 storage acreage during the year, and matured Smeaheia CO\u2082 storage project further. The Norwegian government also announced two processes for awarding o/ffshore wind acreage on competitive terms. Equinor is seeking to participate in both. The first is announced to be held by the Government in March 2024. Further licence rounds from the authorities are expected in 2025. Equinor continues to support further development of CCS, o/ffshore wind, and hydrogen in Norway as part of this industrial plan.\n\n## Exploratory wells drilled 1)\n\n|                  | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   |\n|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                  | 2023                             | 2022                             | 2021                             |\n| North Sea        |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Equinor operated | 12                               | 6                                | 10                               |\n| Partner operated | 9                                | 3                                | 2                                |\n| Norwegian Sea    |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Equinor operated | 3                                | 4                                | 2                                |\n| Partner operated | 1                                | 4                                | 0                                |\n| Barents Sea      |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Equinor operated | 0                                | 2                                | 2                                |\n| Partner operated | 1                                | 0                                | 2                                |\n| Total (gross)    | 26                               | 19                               | 18                               |\n\n- 1) Wells completed during the year, including appraisals of earlier discoveries.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Other income was impacted by gain from sale of ownership shares, with USD 222 million in 2023 for the Statfjord area compared to USD 730 million for Martin Linge and Ekofisk in 2022. In addition, other income in 2022 included a significant positive e/ffect on embedded derivatives from higher short term gas prices.\n\nIncreased operation and maintenance costs, as well as environmental expenses led to increased operating, selling, general and administrative expenses from 2022 to 2023. The development in interest rates and increased cost estimates impacted the Gassled removal cost negatively, when comparing 2023 to 2022. In contrast, falling energy prices, led to decreased transportation and electricity cost partially o/ffsetting the increases. Exchange rate development in the NOK/USD during the year 2023 o/ffset the cost increases and their visibility in the reported numbers.\n\nREPORTING SEGMENT\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe NOK/USD exchange rate development in the year and the sale of ownership shares in Martin Linge and Ekofisk in 2022 reduced depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses in 2023. However, depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses were negatively impacted by a USD 588 million impairment of a North Sea asset in 2023 as opposed to net impairment reversals of USD 819 million in 2022 driving an overall increase year-on-year.\n\nIncreased exploration drilling activity levels (28 wells this year compared to 22 wells last year) and increased seismic and field development led to an increase in exploration expenses in 2023 compared to 2022. An increased capitalisation rate partially o/ffset the increase.\n\nDuring 2023, organic capex* and additions to PP&E, intangibles and equity accounted investments increased mainly due to increased activity in the sanctioned projects portfolio both for Equinor- and partner operated projects. Decreased investments on the Johan Sverdrup field following completion of phase 2 partially o/ffset this.",

Although there was a slight increase in the number of actual incidents compared to the previous year, the reduction in the number of incidents with serious potential, especially those associated with falling objects, o/ffset this increase. TRIF also improved compared to 2022. However, there are still too many personnel injuries. Throughout the year, reinforcement measures in the \"I am Safety Roadmap\" were carried out systematically. Measures related to increased attention on observations, reporting, and actions to prevent falling objects positively influenced the number of falling objects. Increased attention to quality in compliance and leadership conversation, and pre-job briefings on site also contributed positively to identifying and managing risks in the execution of work.\n\nThe reduction in the upstream CO\u2082 intensity is primarily attributable to Johan Sverdrup being fully electrified and producing at increased plateau. These gains\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nwere partially o/ffset by turnarounds on the Troll fields, declining production at Martin Linge and startup of production on Njord.\n\nCO\u2082 capture and storage (CCS) is important for E&P Norway's sustainability performance. Emissions of more than 700 Ktonnes CO\u2082 were avoided in 2023 due to CCS at the Sleipner and Sn\u00f8hvit fields. Through energy management, E&P Norway is making continuous e/fforts to improve energy e/fficiency of its operations. In 2023, more than 60 energy e/fficiency measures were implemented with the potential to reduce around 200 Ktonnes of CO\u2082.\n\nAs a response to Equinor's biodiversity position, sitespecific inventories (SSI) of important biodiversity features were established for all facilities on the NCS in 2023. The SSI also included identification of possible pressures from site activities and an assessment of how the pressures were managed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This accounted for around 17% of Equinor's total equity production of oil and gas in 2023, compared to 16% in 2022. E&P International reported a net operating income of USD 2.3 billion in 2023.\n\nEquinor believes that continued development within well-established areas of the international portfolio will realise high value potential for the future.\n\nExploration activity: In 2023, four onshore appraisal wells in Argentina were completed by the operator YPF in Bajo del Toro license in Vaca Muerta, including test production. Eight exploration licences were awarded in the year with four in the UK, three in Angola and one in Brazil.\n\n## A strong project pipeline in core countries:\n\n## Brazil\n\n- \u00b7 Bacalhau (Equinor 40%, operator) is being developed with subsea wells tied back to an FPSO, with first oil scheduled for 2025. A second phase of the Bacalhau field development is being considered to fully exploit the value potential.\n- \u00b7 Raia (Equinor 35%, operator) includes both oil and gas discoveries and will be developed with a new FPSO, with start-up expected in 2028. Raia represents one of the main gas projects in the country, playing a key role in the further development of the Brazilian gas market.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template\n\nAll rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## UK\n\n- \u00b7 The Rosebank field (Equinor 80%, operator) will be developed with subsea wells tied back to a redeployed FPSO, with start-up planned in 20262027.\n\n## Committing to low carbon ambitions\n\nIn 2023, E&P International continued to implement measures to deliver on its climate ambitions and worked closely with partners to drive CO\u2082 and methane reductions in both operated and nonoperated assets.\n\nPeregrino in Brazil started importing gas to power turbines at the Peregrino C platform 10 and switched from diesel to fuel gas at the FPSO. When completed, this is expected to avoid 100kt per year of CO\u2082 emissions. In addition, a vent gas recovery unit was commissioned. This is expected to eliminate E&P International's single biggest source of methane emissions.\n\nMariner in the UK is systematically implementing opportunities identified as part of the Emissions Reduction Action Plan (ERAP). Three of the prioritised projects include flare bypass tie-ins, use of biodiesel, and optimising crude pump controls, which are expected to deliver emissions reductions of up to approximately 125kt CO\u2082e over the field life.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Progress was made in core areas of the operated project portfolio by approving the final investments for the Rosebank project in the UK and the Raia project in Brazil. Additionally, E&P International took steps to focus its portfolio by signing an agreement to sell the business in Nigeria to Chappal Energies and by agreeing to sell all interests in assets in Azerbaijan to SOCAR.\n\nGoing forward, E&P International seeks to work systematically to improve the robustness of the portfolio. This is expected to improve the ability to deliver positive cash flow year-on-year. E&P International continues to, in collaboration with partners and key stakeholders, mature the unsanctioned projects such as Bay du Nord and Tanzania LNG with the aim to improve value and resilience to low prices. Exploration will primarily be focused on lower-risk opportunities in areas with existing activities and where existing infrastructure can be leveraged.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Decarbonising the portfolio and improving sustainability performance\n\nDecarbonising and improving the sustainability performance of the portfolio remains a top priority to ensure competitiveness through the energy transition. E&P International has increased decarbonisation e/fforts in existing assets, and new production is designed for lower emission intensity. Mariner's Emissions Reduction Action Plan was submitted to the authorities in 2023 and implementation is in progress. All new development projects have been designed for lower emissions to support delivery of Equinor's Energy transition plan. Rosebank is going to be designed for electrification from shore and the projects in Brazil will use combined-cycle gas turbines and closed flare system.\n\nE&P International is also focusing on (i) increasing voluntary social investments in both core and other countries, along the 'resilient host communities' dimension in the just transition framework and (ii) 'identifying key biodiversity features associated with projects through site-specific inventories to enable biodiversity preservation.\n\n## Exploratory wells drilled 1)\n\n|                         | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                         | 2023                             | 2022                             | 2021                             |\n| Americas (excluding US) |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Equinor operated        | 0                                | 3                                | 0                                |\n| Partner operated        | 4                                | 7                                | 2                                |\n| Africa                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Equinor operated        | 0                                | 0                                | 0                                |\n| Partner operated        | 0                                | 2                                | 0                                |\n| Other regions           |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Equinor operated        | 0                                | 0                                | 1                                |\n| Partner operated        | 0                                | 0                                | 0                                |\n| Total (gross)           | 4                                | 12                               | 3                                |\n\n- 1) Wells completed during the year, including appraisals of earlier discoveries.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Liquid volumes increased by 8%, while gas volumes decreased by 13%, compared to 2022. The main contributor to the growth in liquid production was the Peregrino field which had a full year of production in 2023 following resumption of production in the second half of 2022 and phase 2 start-up in October 2022. Additionally, the Buzzard field in the UK contributed positively to the growth following the Suncor Energy UK Limited acquisition in July 2023. The decrease in gas volumes is mainly due to the divestment of the Corrib field in Ireland.\n\nThe decreased e/ffect from production sharing agreements (PSA) in 2023 compared to 2022 was mainly caused by lower oil and gas prices, in combination with a decrease in production from several fields with PSAs.\n\n## Average equity production by asset in 2023\n\nmboe/day\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nREPORTING SEGMENT PERFORMANCE\n\n## Average equity production by country in 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeregrino is producing at plateau and is expected to continue maintaining this level of production in the coming years.\n\n51% of E&P International production in 2023 was from Africa .\n\nE&P International's newly acquired equity shares of Buzzard increased the average production in the UK by 15 mboe/d from mid-year 2023.",

The decrease in operating income and revenues was mainly due to the reduction in liquid commodity prices, as liquids constitute 90% of E&P International's entitlement production. The sharp decline in gas prices further contributed to the decrease in revenues.\n\nIncreased operation and maintenance expenses associated with turnarounds across various fields led to increased operating expenses from 2022 to 2023. Increased royalties and production fees linked to increased production at the Peregrino field also contributed to the overall rise in costs. This was partially offset by decreased royalties at Roncador due to lower prices in 2023.\n\nThe inclusion of Buzzard following the Suncor Energy UK Limited acquisition, increased production from Peregrino in Brazil and Bandurria Sur in Argentina, in addition to several new investments in producing fields resulted in an overall increase in depreciation from 2022 to 2023.\n\nNet impairment related to property, plant, and equipment increased from USD 286 million in 2022 to USD 310 million in 2023. In 2023, the impairment was mainly related to the planned exit from Azerbaijan. In 2022, the main contributors were impairments related to Equinor's exit from Russia, partially o/ffset by an impairment reversal of an asset in the Europe and Asia area, supported by a slight increase in reserves estimates.\n\nWell costs related to Karabagh in Azerbaijan, and drilling costs in Canada expensed in 2022 were the main drivers for the reduction in exploration expenses from 2022 to 2023. The capitalisation of previously expensed exploration wells in Brazil also positively impacted the 2023 numbers.\n\nThe main driver for increased organic capex* from 2022 to 2023 is the development project Raia in Brazil, following the final investment decision in May 2023. In addition, increased activity from Argentina and the final investment decision for the Rosebank project in the UK, added to the increase. The Suncor Energy UK Limited acquisition in 2023 further influenced the movement in the additions to PP&E, intangibles and equity accounted investments.",

Of the eight recorded serious incidents (SI), two of the incidents had major accident potential, as described in section 2.2. Safe and secure operations. Five of the SIs happened in Brazil, one in Argentina, one in the US and one in UK. These incidents were thoroughly investigated in order to learn and improve. Continuous work is ongoing to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nTRIF increased in 2023. Of the 27 recordable injuries, 20 happened in Brazil, four in UK, two in the US, and one in Argentina. This roughly corresponds to the distribution of manhours recorded by the di/fferent business clusters.\n\nIn 2023, E&P International continued to work diligently to improve its overall safety performance, in line with the I am Safety Roadmap. Key focus areas included Major Accident Prevention, proactive and visible safety leadership, collaboration with suppliers and partners, as well as the implementation of digital observation cards. While the results of 2023 do not reflect these, E&P International firmly believes that consistently applying safety practices, protocols, and reporting routines to learn from incidents will strengthen the safety performance over time. E&P International remains committed to the aspiration of zero harm, and this is reflected in the regular safety trainings, focus on human and organisational principles as well as assurance activities, and the belief that all accidents are preventable.\n\nE&P International has a strong focus on reducing GHG emissions. For Equinor-operated licences this means continually identifying, prioritising, and executing measures to reduce emissions. For partner-operated assets and joint-operated entities this means supporting partners, operators, and relevant stakeholders to improve detection, reporting and forecasting of GHG emissions; to identify the most e/ffective opportunities to reduce emissions; and supporting implementation of these. CO\u2082 intensity of Equinor-operated assets forms a performance indicator both at E&P International and business cluster level, and in 2023 it decreased for E&P International following the return of the Peregrino field to full production.\n\nEnvironmental performance is based around avoiding harm, with a performance indicator relating to accidental spills. In order to better understand opportunities for protecting and enhancing nature, in 2023 site-specific inventories for biodiversity were completed for Equinor-operated assets.",

The production accounted for 17% of Equinor's total equity production of oil and gas in 2023, compared to 16% in 2022. E&P USA reported a net operating income of USD 1,353 million for 2023.\n\nEquinor has continued shaping the US oil and gas portfolio, focusing activity in areas with high value potential while maintaining a low operational CO\u2082 footprint.\n\nExploration activity: Equinor is one of the most active exploration companies in the Gulf of Mexico, with more than 100 exploration leases in its portfolio including multiple prospects and leads. In 2023, E&P USA added leases to the portfolio of opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico. Equinor continues to evaluate these prospects and mature the opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2023, E&P USA participated in drilling activity for five exploration prospects in the area. One prospect was determined to be a discovery while the remaining four prospects were dry or noncommercial.\n\n## Strong project pipeline:\n\nVito platform (Equinor 36.89%, non-operated) was brought online in 2023 and reached plateau production during the year. Development will continue by drilling additional production wells.\n\nSparta (Equinor 49%, non-operated) development was sanctioned at the end of 2023, which will include eight production wells tied back to a semisubmersible floating production unit. The Sparta development will utilise 20k technology and have a designed capacity of 100,000 boe per day at peak and is expected to start production in 2028.\n\nAlong with the development of Sparta, E&P USA continues to look for opportunities to add value through exploration and expansion opportunities to existing infrastructure.\n\n## Committing to low carbon ambitions\n\nThe US assets, onshore and o/ffshore, have some of the lowest carbon intensities within the Equinor international portfolio and E&P USA remains committed to working with partners to maintain this.",

This increase was partially offset by improved reserves.\n\nImpairment reversals related to property, plant, and equipment amounted to USD 290 million in 2023 which were primarily driven by improved expected reserves due to additional well opportunities. In 2022, impairment reversals amounted to USD 1,060 million mainly driven by increased short-term prices.\n\nIncreased exploration expenses were driven by drilling activity for four exploration prospects in the Gulf of Mexico. The four prospects were dry or noncommercial and were expensed accordingly, resulting in a significant increase in exploration cost.\n\nInvestments in 2023 in the recently sanctioned Sparta project, St. Malo Water Injection, and Appalachian Basin Partner Operated assets drove the increase in Organic capex* and additions to PPE, intangibles and equity accounted investments from 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As owner of Danske Commodities (DC), a trading company for power and gas, MMP increased its presence in energy trading. DC is active in Europe and also operates in the US, Brazil, Singapore and Australia. The major export markets for natural gas produced from the NCS are the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. LNG from the Sn\u00f8hvit field, combined with third-party LNG cargoes, allows Equinor to reach global gas markets.\n\nMMP is active in both the physical and exchange markets, such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and\n\nTrayport, and optimises the value of the gas volumes through a mix of bilateral contracts and over the trading desk, via its production and transportation systems and downstream assets. Some of Equinor's long-term gas contracts have price review clauses which can be triggered by the parties 13 . MMP receives a marketing fee from E&P Norway for the Norwegian gas sold on behalf of the company.\n\n## Crude, products and liquids\n\nMMP is responsible for the sale of crude oil and NGL produced on the NCS. It also markets the equity volumes from Equinor's assets in the US, Brazil, Canada, Angola, Nigeria, Algeria, Azerbaijan, and the UK, as well as third-\n\nparty volumes. Value is maximised through marketing, physical and financial trading, and the optimisation of owned and leased capacity such as refineries, processing, terminals, storage, pipelines, railcars, and vessels.\n\nThese operations are headquartered in Norway, with o/ffices in the UK, Singapore, the US, and Canada.\n\n## Low-carbon solutions\n\nEquinor believes decarbonising hydrocarbons with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is key to reaching net zero, and aims to combine its long experience from CCS on the NCS, its reservoir expertise and experience from developing value chains with peers, suppliers and customers to develop large-scale, commercially viable decarbonisation solutions. By 2030, more than 50% of Equinor's gross capex* is intended to be dedicated to renewables and low carbon solutions. Equinor's solutions include:\n\nDeveloping carbon management services to o/ffer industries based on CO\u2082 transport and storage:\n\n- \u00b7 Northern Lights: Equinor is, together with Shell and TotalEnergies, developing infrastructure for CO\u2082 transport and storage on the NCS from various industries. Phase 1 has a capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of CO\u2082 annually and is planned to be operational in 2024. The Northern Lights infrastructure will enable the transport of CO\u2082 from industrial capture sites to a terminal in \u00d8ygarden for intermediate storage before transport by pipeline for permanent storage. Phase 1 is fully utilised with Oslo Celsio, Heidelberg Cement Brevik, Yara Sluiskil and \u00d8rsted's two biomass power stations Asn\u00e6s and Aved\u00f8re as the first customers.\n\n13) For ongoing price reviews, Equinor provides in its financial statements for probable liabilities based on Equinor's best judgement. For further information, see note 26 Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nFuture CCS projects under development include:\n\n- \u00b7 East Coast Cluster & Net Zero Teesside power: Equinor is a partner in the bp-operated CO\u2082 transport and storage project Northern Endurance Partnership (NEP) in the UK. NEP will serve CO\u2082 capture projects in the two industrial clusters Teesside and Humber and have an annual storage capacity of 4 million tonnes.\n- \u00b7 Smeaheia: Equinor was awarded the CO\u2082 storage licence for Smeaheia in the North Sea by the Norwegian Ministry of Energy (MPE) in 2022 on a 100% equity basis. The licence has an estimated CO\u2082 storage capacity of 20 million tonnes annually.\n- \u00b7 CO\u2082 Highway Europe is a large-scale CO\u2082 pipeline planned to connect CO\u2082 capture projects in NorthWest Europe to di/fferent storage sites on the NCS. The pipeline is planned to have a capacity of between 20-30 million tonnes annually.\n- \u00b7 Bayou Bend: Equinor has a 25% interest in Bayou Bend CCS LLC, which is positioned to be one of the largest US CCS projects located along the Gulf Coast in Southeast Texas. The project aims to have a CO\u2082 storage potential of 10-20 million tonnes annually.\n\nProviding hydrogen by reforming natural gas with CCS:\n\n- \u00b7 Hydrogen provides a solution to hard to abate emissions from industries. Equinor is involved in projects aimed at producing low-carbon hydrogen from natural gas with CCS, including the H2BE project in Belgium, the H2M Eemshaven project in the Netherlands, and a proposed 600 MW low-carbon hydrogen production plant at Saltend Chemicals Park in the UK.",

This di/fference is mainly due to decreased production from the NCS caused by turnarounds and natural decline of gas producing fields.\n\nThe average crude, condensate and NGL sales were 2.6 mmbbl per day in 2023, 17% higher than 2022 14 due to increased sales of equity and third-party volumes.\n\nHigh regularity at onshore gas processing plants, ensured gas deliveries and portfolio flexibility allowing MMP to continue to be a reliable provider of energy in Europe. MMP utilised its transport systems and shipping portfolio to deliver crude, LNG and products where they were needed the most, thereby increasing the overall value creation\n\nIn 2023, the average realised piped gas price in Europe was USD 13.86 per MMBtu, down from USD 32.84 per MMBtu in 2022. European gas prices reduced significantly during the year compared to 2022 due to decreased demand, increased LNG imports and increased storage levels.\n\nIn 2023, the average realised piped gas price in North America was USD 2.09 MMBtu, down from USD 5.89 MMBtu in 2022.

During 2023, the net operating income included impairments of USD 343 million, in contrast to USD 895 million of net impairment reversals in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted earnings* in 2023 decreased from the previous year. The result from Crude, Products and Liquids doubled by e/ffectively capturing financial and physical market opportunities and optimising the shipping portfolio. However, this was more than o/ffset by a decreased result from Gas and Power trading, as reduced gas market volatility and diminished geographical spreads reduced the 2023 result compared to the extraordinary performance in 2022.\n\nTotal revenues and other income decreased from 2023 to 2022 due to lower gas and oil sales prices in both Europe and North America and decreased gas volumes.\n\nThis was partially o/ffset by increased liquid sales.\n\nPurchases [net of inventory] decreased from 2022 to 2023 due to lower prices for both gas and liquids.\n\nThe increase in Operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses from 2022 to 2023 was mainly due to significant increased transportation costs for liquids and increased selling, general and administrative expenses mainly due to increased activity within Low Carbon Solutions.\n\nDepreciation, amortisation and net impairment increased from 2022 to 2023 driven by the impairment of refinery assets in 2023 and an impairment reversal in 2022.\n\nThe main driver for the decrease in organic capex* from 2022 to 2023 are lower investments in projects related to onshore plants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n| Marketing, Midstream and Processing                                        | Performance   | Performance   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Performance indicator                                                      | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Serious Incident Frequency (SIF) (number per million hours worked)         | 0.4           | 0.6           |\n| CO\u2082 emissions reduction (kt)                                               | 55            | 358           |\n| Monitoring indicator                                                       |               |               |\n| Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) (number per million hours worked) | 3.5           | 3.0           |\n\nMMP's systematic e/fforts within safety resulted in a reduction in the frequency of serious incidents in 2023. As part of the 'I am safety framework' main priorities for the Onshore Plants in 2023 included actions to prevent major accidents including trainings, actions to prevent falling objects, strengthening use of lifesaving rules and C&L, proactive reporting and learning, selfassessments, and internal verifications. Within shipping, MMP worked closely with the shipowners to improve reporting and learning from incidents. All shipping companies operating for MMP must be prequalified before contracts are entered into, and all vessels undergo regular thorough inspections. During the third quarter MMP experienced a man overboard fatality on a tanker in Malaysia.\n\nMMP achieved CO\u2082 emission reductions in 2023 of a total of 55 Ktonnes of CO\u2082 due to more e/fficient and stable operations in Hammerfest LNG and process\n\nimprovements at Mongstad and K\u00e5rst\u00f8. The decrease against last year is due to the large reduction achieved last year through the rebuild of the Mongstad Combined Heat and Power.\n\nAs a part of Equinor's biodiversity position, site-specific inventories of important biodiversity features were established for all onshore facilities. Possible pressures from activities and operations were assessed, using both internal and external data and analyses. The sitespecific inventory is an important contribution to future sustainability and biodiversity risk management, both at site level and a regional level.",

Dogger Bank A started generating first power in 2023 and is expected to o/fficially commence operation in 2024. Dogger Bank B and C are under construction and are expected to start generating power during the next three years. During the developmental stage, SSE Renewables operates these three projects, which Equinor will assume operatorship when the wind farms come on stream.\n\nO/ffshore wind projects on the US Northeast Coast are facing cost inflation and supply chain constraints. The rejection of petitions relating to o/fftake agreements resulted in the recognition of an impairment loss for the year. Equinor and bp decided to reset the Empire Wind 2 project and explore alternative business opportunities. On 25 January 2024, Equinor entered a swap transaction with bp, under which Equinor will take full ownership of the Empire Wind lease and projects and bp will take full ownership of the Beacon Wind lease and projects. Following the signing of agreement, Equinor submitted a bid for the Empire Wind 1 project in New York's fourth o/ffshore wind solicitation round and on 29 February 2024 was awarded the o/fftake contract.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nAs the demand for integrated solar, wind, and energy storage solutions continues to rise, Equinor is expanding its presence in onshore renewable energy in specific power markets across Europe, North America, and South America. Equinor is also integrating battery storage assets into its renewable portfolio, with a primary focus on the UK and the US, two prominent battery storage markets where the company holds substantial o/ffshore wind assets. These market entries involve the acquisition of local energy companies and Equinor aims to enhance value through collaboration with local teams, fostering transformation and leveraging synergies within the company.\n\nThe below table shows REN's onshore assets in operation including ownership and operator responsibilities.\n\n| Asset                | Asset type      | Country   | Generation   capacity  Equinor (MW)   | Storage  capacity   (MW/MWh)   | Ownership   | Operated     |\n|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Apodi                | Solar           | Brazil    | 71                                    |                                | 44%         | N/Scatec     |\n| Wilko                | Onshore wind    | Poland    | 26                                    |                                | 100%        | Y/Wento      |\n| St\u0119pie\u0144              | Solar           | Poland    | 58                                    |                                | 100%        | Y/Wento      |\n| Zag\u00f3rzyca            | Solar           | Poland    | 60                                    |                                | 100%        | Y/Wento      |\n| Serra da Babil\u00f4nia 1 | Onshore wind    | Brazil    | 223                                   |                                | 100%        | Y/Rio Energy |\n| Blandford Road       | Battery storage | UK        |                                       | 25/50                          | 100%        | Y/Noriker    |\n\nEquinor currently has three onshore renewable projects under construction in Europe, with an expected completion date within the next two years, at which point the projects are expected to begin generating power.\n\nIn addition, hydrogen based on renewable energy sources is expected be a key contributor to the energy transition, primarily by decarbonising the hard-to-abate sectors. Equinor has taken positions in green hydrogen projects in Northwest Europe and is exploring further opportunities. Green hydrogen has the potential to unlock additional value through storage and balancing energy systems where renewables penetration is high.",

REN is aiming to deliver above 65 TWh from renewables power generation by 2035, with real project returns in the 4-8% range and further potential equity value upsides from the selective use of project financing and farm-downs. Renewables growth initially relies on the following two strategic pillars, which will over time converge into flexible power and energy o/fferings in selected markets.\n\n## Becoming an o/ffshore wind major and floating wind leader\n\nREN aims to create value through industrial scale-up in offshore wind by building on its early entry and successful track-record in the industry and leveraging the leading position in floating offshore wind. Key milestones in 2023 include reaching full production capacity at Hywind Tampen, the world's largest floating wind farm, as well as delivering first power from Dogger Bank, the world's largest offshore wind farm.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Building onshore renewables and storage positions\n\nREN aims to build low-cost onshore renewables positions in attractive markets, backed by storage and trading. REN's onshore strategy is to enter markets through the acquisition of local companies with strong teams and capabilities. Key milestones in 2023 include the closing of the BeGreen transaction in Denmark, the acquisition of Rio Energy in Brazil (onshore wind and solar), and the expansion of Wento - onshore renewables platform in Poland into onshore wind.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Value creation will be the priority over reaching volume targets.\n\nProgress was demonstrated in 2023 on both project execution and on building the portfolio pipeline. Hywind Tampen, the world's largest floating wind farm, was o/fficially opened in August, supplying renewable power to the Snorre and Gullfaks fields in Norway. Another significant achievement was the world's largest o/ffshore wind farm, Dogger Bank A (SSE lead developer),\n\nreaching first power in the UK. In addition, REN successfully initiated production from solar projects in Brazil and Poland and diversified its renewable portfolio by making bolt-on acquisitions of onshore platforms in Denmark, Poland and Brazil. The acquisition of the onshore solar and wind platforms in these countries was a significant move towards expanding the portfolio and providing more options for sustainable energy generation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Financial performance\n\nEuropean o/ffshore wind assets in operation within the equity accounted investment portfolio decreased in revenue contribution by 26% within net income/(loss) from equity accounted investments in 2023. This decline was due to lower prices experienced in 2023, increased maintenance costs and increased expenditure associated with early phase projects.\n\nAdded revenue from the newly acquired onshore wind farm in Brazil and the start-up of production at solar plants in Poland contributed positively to total revenues in 2023. Combined with the decreased results from equity accounted investments in 2023, total revenues and other income decreased relative to 2022. Favourable e/ffects of divestments early in 2022 significantly impacted the decline.\n\nThe notable decrease in net operating income for 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the recognition of a USD 300 million impairment in the third quarter for o/ffshore wind projects in the US Northeast following the rejection of petitions related to o/fftake agreements. In addition, increased business development expenditures and increased operating activity levels contributed to an upward\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\ntrend in operating and administrative expenses in 2023. The increased costs associated with maturing projects, which predominantly originated from o/ffshore wind activities in the UK and Asia, contributed to the reduction in adjusted earnings* in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nFor 2023, USD 114 million of organic capex* was allocated for onshore renewables, while USD 729 million was for o/ffshore wind projects and investments related to projects in the US and the UK. In 2022, total organic capex* was USD 247 million, mainly related to investments in US and the Europe.\n\nThe acquisitions of BeGreen and Rio Energy in the year drove the increase in additions to PP&E, intangibles and equity accounted investments compared to 2022.\n\nThe gross capex* for the renewable business amounted to USD 2.6 billion, of which organic gross capital expenditures* amounted to USD 1.5 billion. Equinor's ambition is to have more than 50% of gross capex* allocated to renewable and low carbon solutions by 2030 and is on track to deliver on the ambitions.\n\n## Sustainability performance\n\n| Renewables                                                                 | Performance   | Performance   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Performance indicator                                                      | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Serious Incident Frequency (SIF) (number per million hours worked)         | 1.0           | 0.8           |\n| Monitoring indicator                                                       |               |               |\n| Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) (number per million hours worked) | 2.2           | 4.3           |\n| Renewables o/ffshore wind GHG intensity, scope 1 and 2 (g CO\u2082/kWh)         | 3.2           | 2.9           |\n\nThe number and frequency of personnel injuries for Renewables was reduced over the last year. However, REN experienced four potential serious incidents in 2023, resulting in a negative development in the serious incident frequency. Continuous improvements for routine operational activities have been established and are ongoing.\n\nThe GHG intensity for o/ffshore wind fields in operation recorded a slight increase over the last year, mainly because maritime vessel diesel consumption increased more than electricity production. Reducing maritime emissions is part of the activities planned for 2024 to support the net-zero ambition.\n\nTo address Equinor Renewables' aims within circularity and biodiversity, following ambitions have been set:\n\n- \u00b7 Ban landfill of blades from 2024 and perform 100% recirculation of decommissioned blades by 2030.\n- \u00b7 All new o/ffshore wind projects will establish net positive biodiversity impact plans.\n\nSite-specific inventories of key biodiversity features were established for four Equinor operated o/ffshore wind assets in operation, Sheringham Shoal, Dudgeon, Hywind Scotland and Hywind Tampen.",

This was mainly due to the good development in PDP and TDI but was o/ffset by a slight increase SIF and TRIF in the Corporate sta/ff and support function.\n\nThe safety results for TDI continued to improve with zero SIs in 2023. TDI had one recordable incident, reducing TRIF from 2022 to 2023. Focus areas included preventing falling objects and safety incidents on pressurised systems for test rigs and laboratories. TDI also contributes to improving safety through technology by improving safety in new value chains (H\u2082, NH\u2083, CO\u2082), establishing monitoring methods for corrosion under insulation, and using drones and robotics to improve health and safety.\n\nPDP repeated another year without serious well control incidents. The total number of serious incidents\n\nwas 11 in 2023, decreased from 19 in 2022. The improvements were related to the systematic and consequent follow up of the PDP safety charters between Equinor and contractors over many years. The SIF incidents included two serious personnel injuries. PDP is committed to further improvements in its safety results to avoid serious injuries and well control incidents.\n\nIn the Energy transition plan, Equinor set out to allocate 40% of the TDI R&D funding to low carbon and renewable technologies by 2025. Two years ahead of target, Equinor achieved this ambition in 2023. Two important 2023 milestones that are the outcome of research projects in TDI were:\n\n- \u00b7 FPSO with technology to lower emissions Bacalhau will be the first asset to have a FPSO in Brazil that uses combined cycle gas turbines, which is expected to significantly reduce carbon\n\nemissions. The technology combines a gas turbine with a steam turbine to take advantage of excess heat that would otherwise be lost. The introduction of combined cycle technology is expected to increase energy e/fficiency and reduce CO\u2082 emissions by about 3 million tons over the field lifetime (-25%).\n\n- \u00b7 Methane measurements using drones - In June 2023, Equinor successfully tested three dronebased technologies, and one LIDAR-based technology for methane measurements at Kollsnes to meet current and future methane measurement obligations and requirements. Data collection was deemed successful by vendors and results are being analysed.\n\nOne of PDP's main focus is developing projects that contribute to deliver on Equinor 'Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions' performance indicator of a 50% reduction by 2030, and tailor for portfolio optimisation by project emissions forecast. PDP Procurement and Supplier Relations is accelerating the energy transition by integrating net zero in supply chain management, through upstream Scope 3 emissions data collection and supplier collaboration for net zero. PDP drilling & well is mainly pursuing e/fficiency and reduced emissions in its drilling operations. PDP is supporting the inclusion of Equinor biodiversity position: Sitespecific inventories of important biodiversity features, enhancement opportunities for existing project sites and plans on how to have a positive contribution to biodiversity are a requisite for all projects.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1. Organisation\n\nThe Equinor Group (Equinor) consists of Equinor ASA and its subsidiaries. Equinor ASA is incorporated and domiciled in Norway and listed on the Oslo B\u00f8rs (Norway) and the New York Stock Exchange (USA). The address of its registered o/ffice is Forusbeen 50, N-4035 Stavanger, Norway.\n\nEquinor's objective is to develop, produce and market various forms of energy and derived products and services, as well as other businesses. The activities may also be carried out through participation in or cooperation with other companies. Equinor Energy AS, a 100% owned operating subsidiary of Equinor ASA and owner of all of Equinor's oil and gas activities and net assets on the Norwegian continental shelf, is co-obligor or guarantor for certain debt obligations of Equinor ASA.\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements of Equinor for the full year 2023 were approved for issuance by the board of directors on 12 March 2024 and is subject to approval by the annual general meeting on 14 May 2024.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Note 2. Accounting policies\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements of Equinor ASA and its subsidiaries (Equinor) have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU) and with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), IFRIC\u00ae Interpretations issued by IASB and the additional requirements of the Norwegian Accounting Act, e/ffective on 31 December 2023.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with some exceptions where fair value measurement is applied. These exceptions are specifically disclosed in the accounting policies sections in relevant notes. The material accounting policies described in these Consolidated financial statements have been applied consistently to all periods presented.\n\nCertain amounts in the comparable years have been restated or reclassified to conform to current year presentation. All amounts in the Consolidated financial statements are denominated in USD millions, unless otherwise specified. The subtotals and totals in some of the tables in the notes may not equal the sum of the amounts shown in the primary financial statements due to rounding.\n\nThe line items included in Total operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income are presented as a combination of function and nature in conformity with industry practice. Purchases [net of inventory variation] and Depreciation, amortisation and net impairments are presented on separate lines based on their nature, while Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses as well as Exploration expenses are presented on a functional basis. Significant expenses such as salaries, pensions, etc. are presented by their nature in the notes to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Equinor ASA and its subsidiaries as well as Equinor's interests in jointly controlled and equity accounted investments. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits and losses arising from Equinor's internal transactions, have been eliminated.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nForeign exchange di/fferences arising on translation of transactions, assets and liabilities to the functional currency of individual entities in Equinor are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income as foreign exchange gains or losses within Net financial items. However, foreign exchange di/fferences arising from the\n\ntranslation of estimate-based provisions are generally accounted for as part of the change in the underlying estimate.\n\nWhen preparing the Consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of entities with functional currencies other than the Group's presentation currency USD are translated into USD, and the foreign exchange di/fferences are recognised separately in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income within Other comprehensive income (OCI). The cumulative amount of such translation di/fferences relating to an entity is reclassified to the Consolidated statement of income and reflected as a part of the gain or loss on disposal of that entity.\n\nLoans from Equinor ASA to subsidiaries and equity accounted investments with other functional currencies than the parent company, and for which settlement is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered part of the parent company's net investment in the subsidiary. Foreign exchange di/fferences arising on such loans are recognised in OCI in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nIn the statement of cash flows, operating activities are presented using the indirect method, where Income/ (loss) before tax is adjusted for changes in inventories",

Increase/decrease in financial investments, derivative financial instruments, and other interest-bearing items are all presented net as part of Investing activities, either because the transactions are financial investments and turnover is quick, the amounts are large, and the maturities are short, or due to materiality.\n\n## Adoption of new IFRS Accounting Standards, amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards and IFRIC Interpretations\n\nNew IFRS Accounting Standards, amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards and IFRIC Interpretations e/ffective and adopted by Equinor from 1 January 2023 do not have significant impact on Equinor's Consolidated financial statements upon adoption. This includes among others IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and amendments to IAS 12 International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules (top-up tax).\n\nIFRS Accounting Standards, amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards, and IFRIC Interpretations issued, but not yet e/ffective, are either not expected to materially impact Equinor's Consolidated financial statements upon adoption or are not expected to be relevant. Equinor has not early adopted any IFRS Accounting Standard, amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards, or IFRIC Interpretations issued, but not yet e/ffective.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Accounting judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated financial statements requires management to make accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions.\n\nInformation about judgements made in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant e/ffects on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated financial statements is described in the following notes:\n\nNote 6 - Acquisitions and disposals\n\nNote 7 - Total revenues and other income\n\nNote 25 - Leases\n\nEstimates used in the preparation of these Consolidated financial statements are prepared based on customised models. The assumptions on which the estimates are based rely on historical experience, external sources of information and various other factors that management assesses to be reasonable under the current conditions and circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities when these are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may di/ffer from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis considering the current and expected future set of conditions.\n\nEquinor is exposed to several underlying economic factors a/ffecting the overall results, such as commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, market risk premiums and interest rates as well as financial instruments with fair values derived from changes in these factors. The e/ffects of the initiatives to limit climate changes and the potential impact of the energy transition are relevant to several of these economic assumptions. In addition, Equinor's results are influenced by the level of production, which in the short term may be influenced by, for instance, maintenance programmes. In the long-term, the results are impacted by the success of exploration, field developments and operating activities.\n\nThe most important matters in understanding the key sources of estimation uncertainty are described in each of the following notes:\n\nNote 3 - Climate change and energy transition\n\nNote 11 - Income taxes\n\nNote 12 - Property, plant and equipment\n\nNote 13 - Intangible assets\n\nNote 14 - Impairments\n\nNote 23 - Provisions and other liabilities\n\nNote 26 - Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\n## Note 3. Climate change and energy transition\n\n## Risks arising from climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\n\nPolicy, legal, regulatory, market and technology developments related to climate change, can a/ffect Equinor's business plans and financial performance. Shifts in stakeholder focus between energy security, a/ffordability and sustainability add uncertainty to delivery and outcomes associated with Equinor's strategy. In its long-term planning, Equinor analyses how the global energy markets may develop, such as future changes in demand for Equinor's products (oil, gas and power in key markets). Commodity price sensitivities are presented in a table below, including the World Energy Outlook 2023 (WEO) scenarios presented by International Energy Agency (IEA), and in note 14 Impairments.\n\nEquinor assesses climate risk from two perspectives: transition risk, which relates to the financial robustness of the company's business model and portfolio in various decarbonisation scenarios; and physical climate risk, which relates to the exposure and potential vulnerability of Equinor's assets to climate-related perils in di/fferent climate change scenarios. Equinor's net-zero strategy and climate related ambitions are responses to the challenges and opportunities presented by the energy transition. Below is a summary of relevant risks and risk adjusting actions:",

A large portion of the cost of CO\u2082 is related to the purchase of EU ETS quotas. The table below shows, on a 100% operated basis, an analysis of number of quotas utilised and the related monetary amounts recognised in financial statements by Equinor's operated licences and landbased facilities subject to the requirements under EU ETS. Allocated free quotas consist of actual free quotas received in ETS during the year. The closing balance for the number of quotas consists mainly of purchased quotas for current year and remaining quotas after the settlement of current and previous year(s), including free quotas. The closing balance in USD consists mainly of the value of the remaining quotas after the preliminary allocation of the current year quotas.\n\nInvestments in renewables and low carbon solutions Equinor's ambition is to build a focused, carbon e/fficient\n\noil and gas portfolio complemented with renewable and low-carbon solutions to create long-term value while supplying reliable energy with progressively lower emissions. 2023 saw a significant increase in the power generated from Equinor's renewable portfolio as well as substantial additions to the portfolio pipelines in renewables. However, due to inflation and supply chain constraints, Equinor recognised an impairment in the Renewables segment on the US North East Coast o/ffshore wind projects, see note 14 Impairments for more details.\n\nEquinor's investments in renewables are included as Additions to PP&E, intangibles and equity accounted investments in the REN-segment in note 5 Segments. See table below for details. Over the course of 2023, the acquisition of BeGreen, a commercial-scale o/ffshore wind lease in California, Rio Energy in Brazil and investments related to projects in the US and the UK contributed to the significant increase in the book value compared to the prior year. See note 6 Acquisitions and disposals for more details.\n\n| (in USD million)                                                                    | 2023   |   2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| O/ffshore, REN                                                                      | 880    |    146 |\n| Onshore, REN                                                                        | 1,127  |    152 |\n| Total Additions to PP&E, intangibles and equity accounted investments - REN         | 2,007  |    298 |\n| Low carbon solutions (within MMP)                                                   | 179    |     36 |\n| Total Additions to PP&E, intangibles and equity accounted investments - REN and LCS | 2,186  |    334 |",

        "page_content": "Equinor is making significant steps to industrialise CCS and is already involved in the Northern Lights project in Norway providing CO\u2082 transport and storage solutions (in partnership with Shell and TotalEnergies). Equinor is also pursuing CCS projects in other regions that have the necessary frame conditions for low carbon solutions. The acquisition of a 25% stake in Bayou Bend, positions Equinor to be one of the largest US carbon capture and storage projects located along the Gulf Coast in Southeast Texas. Acquisition investments and capital contributions in these projects amounted to USD 179 million in 2023 (USD 36 million in 2022).\n\nInvestments in electrification of oil and gas assets During 2023, Equinor invested around USD 200 million in electrification (around USD 250 million in 2022). Equinor's abatement projects primarily include full and partly electrification of o/ffshore assets in Norway at key fields and plants, including the Troll, Oseberg, Sleipner, Njord and the Hammerfest LNG plant, mainly by power from shore. Emissions abatement milestones in 2023 included the start-up of the Hywind Tampen o/ffshore wind supplying carbon-free power to the Gullfaks A field and the electrification of the Gina Krog field with power from shore.\n\n## Research and development activities (R&D)\n\nEquinor is involved in several R&D projects aimed at optimizing oil and gas activities, reducing emissions, and developing new business opportunities in renewables and low carbon solutions.

The resulting e/ffects and Equinor's exposure to them are sources of uncertainty. Estimating global energy demand and commodity prices towards 2050 is challenging due to various complex factors, including technology change, taxation and production limits, which may change over time. This could lead to significant changes in accounting estimates, such as useful life (depreciation period and timing of asset retirement obligations), value-in-use (impairment assessments), and deferred tax assets (see note 11 Income taxes for expected utilisation period of tax losses carried forward and recognised as deferred tax assets).\n\n## Commodity prices\n\nEquinor's commodity price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing are based on management's best estimate of future market trends. This price-set is currently not equal to the price-set in accordance with achieving net zero emissions by 2050 as outlined in the WEO Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario. Changes in how the world acts with regards to achieving the goals in the Paris agreement could have a negative impact on the valuation of Equinor's assets. Calculated possible impairments of upstream production assets and certain intangible assets using\n\nassumed prices for two scenarios estimated by the International Energy Agency (IEA) are provided in the sensitivity table below. These illustrative impairment sensitivity calculations are based on a simplified model with limitations as described in note 14 Impairments. A linear bridging was applied between current prices and the first price point in the price sets disclosed in both scenarios. USD 2 per bbl of transportation cost was added to the Brent-prices in the scenarios for comparability with management's current best estimate. The IEA scenarios primarily stress oil and gas prices, not reflecting the potential impact on Equinor's renewable and low carbon projects or trading and refinery margins. Furthermore, the MMP and REN segments represent only around 12% of Equinor's total book value of non-current segment assets and equity accounted investments, as disclosed in note 5 Segments.\n\n## Cost of CO 2\n\nThe EU ETS price has increased significantly from 25 EUR/tonne in 2020 to an average cost of EU ETS allowances of 86 EUR/tonne in 2023 (81 EUR/tonne in 2022). In its commodity price assumptions Equinor projects the price to remain high, in the region of 80 EUR/tonne for the next couple of years in real 2023 terms. In 2040 the price expected to increase to around 130 EUR/tonne (109 EUR/tonne projected in 2022), thereafter increasing to around 150 EUR/ tonne in 2050 (135 EUR/tonne project in 2022) in real 2023 terms. As such, Equinor expects greenhouse gas emission costs to increase from current levels and to have a wider geographical range than today, and\n\na global tax on CO\u2082 emissions will have a negative impact on the valuation of Equinor's oil and gas assets. Currently, Equinor pays CO\u2082 fees in Norway, the UK, Germany, Canada and Nigeria. Norway's Climate Action Plan for the period 2021-2030 (Meld. St 13 (2020-2021)) which assumes a gradually increased CO\u2082 tax (the total of EU ETS + Norwegian CO\u2082 tax) in Norway to 2,000 NOK/ tonne (real 2020) in 2030 is used for impairment calculations of Norwegian upstream assets.\n\nEquinor's responses to this risk include evaluation of carbon intensity on both project and portfolio level in investment and divestment decisions. Equinor currently uses an internal cost of carbon, set at 82 USD/tonne in 2025 and increasing to 115 USD/ tonne by 2030 and staying flat thereafter (in countries with higher carbon costs, country specific cost expectations are used). This cost-scenario is uncertain but serves as a placeholder for possible future CO\u2082 pricing systems, making sure the assets are financially robust.\n\nClimate-related considerations are included directly in the impairment calculations by estimating the CO\u2082 taxes in the cash flows, and indirectly through estimated commodity prices related to supply and demand. The CO\u2082 prices also have e/ffect on the estimated production profiles and economic cut-o/ff of the projects. To reflect that carbon will have a cost for all Equinor's assets, the current best estimate of CO\u2082 prices is considered to be EU ETS for countries outside EU where carbon is not already subject to taxation or where Equinor has not established specific estimates.",

Please see note 14 Impairments for further information on discount rate sensitivity.\n\n## Robustness of Equinor's portfolio, and risk of stranded assets\n\nThe transition to renewable energy, technological development, and the expected reduction in global demand for carbon-based energy, may impact the future profitability of certain upstream oil and gas assets. Equinor uses scenario analysis to outline di/fferent possible energy futures, some of which imply lower oil and natural gas prices and higher CO\u2082 tax. If this materialises, it can lead to a decrease in the cash flow from oil and gas, and potentially reduce the economic lifetime of some assets. Equinor seeks to mitigate this risk by improving the resilience of the existing upstream portfolio, maximising the e/fficiency of the infrastructure on the NCS and optimising the highquality international portfolio. The project portfolio is robust to low oil and gas prices and actions are in place to maintain cost discipline across the company. Equinor will continue to add high value barrels to the portfolio through exploration and increased recovery, with the expectation to maintain strong oil and gas cash flow from operations until 2035. Equinor aims to maintain significant capex flexibility in the current portfolio, with only sanctioned projects being committed representing less than 50% of the yearly organic capex from 2025. This is expected to allow Equinor to optimise and reprioritise non-sanctioned projects to ensure continued generation of high value through cycles. Equinor will continuously assess the current and future exposure of its portfolio and take preventative measures to manage physical climate risks.\n\nBased on the current production profiles, approximately 65% of Equinor's proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by the SEC, are expected to be produced in the period 2024-2030 and more than 99% in the period 2024-2050. This indicates a lower risk of early cessation of production and can provide flexibility in adapting to the changing market conditions or a shift in global energy demand.\n\nEquinor aims to continue to selectively explore for new resources with a focus on mature areas with existing infrastructure to minimise emissions and maximise value. During the transition, Equinor anticipates allocating a reducing share of its gross capex to oil and gas in the coming years and the volume of production is likely to decrease over time. Reaching Equinor's net 50% reduction ambition for operated scope 1 and 2 emissions will require a company-wide, coordinated e/ffort to execute and mature the abatement projects, improve energy e/fficiency, develop new technologies, and strengthen the resilience of the portfolio. Equinor aims to achieve a 20% reduction in net carbon intensity by 2030 and a 40% reduction by 2035, including scope 3 emissions. The combination of increased renewables and decarbonised energy, the scale up of low carbon solutions such as CCS and optimisation of the oil and gas portfolio provides confidence that Equinor can meet its medium-term ambitions. As such, Equinor's ambition to become a net-zero company by 2050 have currently not resulted in the identification of additional assets being triggered for impairment or earlier cessation.\n\nAny future exploration may be restricted by regulations, market, and strategic considerations. Provided that the economic assumptions would deteriorate to",

See note 13 Intangible assets for more information regarding Equinor's intangible assets.\n\nTiming of Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) As mentioned above, there are currently no assets triggered for earlier cessation as a result of Equinor's ambition to become a net-zero company by 2050. However, if the business cases of Equinor's producing oil and gas assets should change materially, this could a/ffect the timing of cessation of the assets. A shorter production period will increase the carrying value of the liability. To illustrate, performing removal five years earlier than currently scheduled would increase the liability by around USD 1.2 billion before tax (around USD 1 billion in 2022).

Financial risk and capital management\n\n## General information and financial risks\n\nEquinor's business activities naturally expose Equinor to financial risks such as market risk (including commodity price risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. Equinor's approach to risk management includes assessing and managing risk in activities using a holistic risk approach, by considering relevant correlations at portfolio level between the most important market risks and the natural hedges inherent in Equinor's portfolio. This approach allows Equinor to reduce the number of risk management transactions and avoid sub-optimisation.\n\nThe corporate risk committee, which is an advisory body in Enterprise Risk Management, is responsible for Equinor's Enterprise Risk Management and for proposing appropriate measures to adjust risk at the corporate level. This includes assessing Equinor's financial risk policies.\n\n## Market risk\n\nEquinor operates in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, and electricity markets and is exposed to market risks including fluctuations in hydrocarbon prices, foreign currency rates, interest rates, and electricity prices that can a/ffect the revenues and costs of operating, investing, and financing. These risks are managed primarily on a short-term basis with a focus on achieving the highest risk-adjusted returns for Equinor within the given mandate. Longterm exposures are managed at the corporate level, while short-term exposures are managed according to trading strategies and mandates. Mandates in the\n\ntrading organisations within crude oil, refined products, natural gas, and electricity are relatively restricted compared to the total market risk of Equinor.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nEquinor's most important long-term commodity risk (crude oil and natural gas) is related to future market prices as Equinor's risk policy is to be exposed to both upside and downside price movements. In the longer term, also power price risk is to a large extent expected to contribute to Equinor's commodity price risk portfolio. To manage short-term commodity risk, Equinor enters into commodity-based derivative contracts, including futures, options, over-the-counter (OTC) forward contracts, market swaps and contracts for di/fferences related to crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, power and emissions. Equinor's bilateral gas sales portfolio is exposed to various price indices with a combination of gas price markers.\n\nThe term of crude oil and refined oil products derivatives are usually less than one year, and they are traded mainly on the Inter- Continental Exchange (ICE), the CME group, the OTC Brent market, and crude and\n\nrefined products swap markets. The term of natural gas, power, and emission derivatives is usually three years or less, and they are mainly OTC physical forwards and options, NASDAQ OMX Oslo forwards, and futures traded on the European Energy Exchange (EEX), NYMEX and ICE.\n\nThe table below contains the commodity price risk sensitivities of Equinor's commodity-based derivative contracts. Equinor's assets and liabilities resulting from commodity-based derivative contracts consist of both exchange traded and non-exchange traded instruments, including embedded derivatives that have been bifurcated and recognised at fair value in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nPrice risk sensitivities at the end of 2023 and 2022 at 30% are assumed to represent a reasonably possible change based on the duration of the derivatives. Since none of the derivative financial instruments included in the table below are part of hedging relationships, any changes in the fair value would be recognised in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\n| Commodity price sensitivity                         | At 31 December   | At 31 December   | At 31 December   | At 31 December   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                     | 2023             | 2023             | 2022             | 2022             |\n| (in USD million)                                    | - 30%            | + 30%            | - 30%            | + 30%            |\n| Crude oil and refined products net gains/(losses)   | 442              | (442)            | 666              | (666)            |\n| Natural gas, electricity and CO\u2082 net gains/(losses) | 86               | (52)             | (3)              | 140              |",

Equinor manages its interest rates exposure on its bond portfolio based on risk and reward considerations from an enterprise risk management perspective. This means that the fixed/floating mix on interest rate exposure may vary from time to time. For more detailed information about Equinor's long-term debt portfolio see note 21 Finance debt.\n\nThe following interest rate risk sensitivity has been calculated by assuming a change of 1.3 percentage points as a reasonable possible change in interest rates at the end of 2023. In 2022, a change of 1.2 percentage points in interest rates was viewed as a reasonable possible change. A decrease in interest rates will have an estimated positive impact on net financial items in the Consolidated statement of income, while an increase in interest rates will have an estimated negative impact on net financial items in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\n| Interest risk sensitivity                         | At 31 December            | At 31 December            | At 31 December            | At 31 December            |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                   | 2023                      | 2023                      | 2022                      | 2022                      |\n| (in USD million)                                  | - 1.3  percentage  points | + 1.3  percentage  points | - 1.2  percentage  points | + 1.2  percentage  points |\n| Positive/(negative) impact on net financial items | 336                       | (333)                     | 369                       | (366)                     |",

By holding these assets, Equinor is exposed to equity price risk, defined as the risk of declining equity prices, which can result in a decline in the carrying value of certain Equinor's assets recognised in the balance sheet.

The purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that Equinor always has su/fficient funds available to cover its financial obligations.\n\nThe main cash outflows include the quarterly dividend payments and Norwegian petroleum tax payments made six times per year. Trading in collateralised commodities and financial contracts also exposes\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nEquinor to liquidity risk related to potential collateral calls from counterparties.\n\nIf the cash flow forecasts indicate that the liquid assets will fall below target levels, new long-term funding will be considered. Equinor raises debt in all major capital markets (USA, Europe and Asia) for long-term funding purposes. The policy is to have a maturity profile with repayments not exceeding 5% of capital employed in any year for the nearest five years. Equinor's noncurrent financial liabilities have a weighted average\n\nmaturity of approximately nine years. For more information about Equinor's non-current financial liabilities, see note 21 Finance debt.\n\nShort-term funding needs will normally be covered by the USD 5.0 billion US Commercial paper programme (CP) which is backed by a revolving credit facility of USD 6.0 billion, supported by 19 core banks, maturing in 2026. The facility supports secure access to funding,\n\nsupported by the best available short-term rating.

Credit risk arises from credit exposures with customer accounts receivables as well as from financial investments, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions. Equinor uses risk mitigation tools to reduce or control credit risk both on a counterparty and portfolio level. The main tools include bank and parental guarantees, prepayments, and cash collateral.\n\nPrior to entering into transactions with new counterparties, Equinor's credit policy requires all counterparties where Equinor has material credit exposure to be formally identified and assigned internal credit ratings. The internal credit ratings reflect Equinor's assessment of the counterparties' credit risk and are based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of recent financial statements and other relevant business information. All counterparties are re-assessed regularly.\n\nEquinor has pre-defined limits for the absolute credit risk level allowed at any given time on Equinor's portfolio as well as maximum credit exposures for individual counterparties. Equinor monitors the portfolio on a regular basis and individual, material exposures against limits on a daily basis. Equinor's total credit exposure is geographically diversified among a number of counterparties within the oil and energy sector, as well as larger oil and gas consumers and financial counterparties. The majority of Equinor's credit exposure is with investment- grade counterparties.\n\nThe following table contains the carrying amount of Equinor's financial receivables and derivative financial instruments split by Equinor's assessment of the counterparty's credit risk. Trade and other receivables include 1% overdue receivables of more than 30 days. A provision has been recognised for expected credit losses of trade and other receivables using the expected credit loss model. Only non-exchange traded instruments are included in derivative financial instruments.\n\n| (in USD million)                   | Non-current  financial  receivables   | Trade  and other  receivables   | Non-current  derivative  financial  instruments   | Current  derivative  financial  instruments   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2023                |                                       |                                 |                                                   |                                               |\n| Investment grade, rated A or above | 193                                   | 5,857                           | 305                                               | 565                                           |\n| Other investment grade             | 8                                     | 5,132                           | 7                                                 | 565                                           |\n| Non-investment grade or not rated  | 140                                   | 5,204                           | 247                                               | 248                                           |\n| Total financial assets             | 341                                   | 16,193                          | 559                                               | 1,378                                         |\n| At 31 December 2022                |                                       |                                 |                                                   |                                               |\n| Investment grade, rated A or above | 1,633                                 | 6,125                           | 390                                               | 1,715                                         |\n| Other investment grade             | 12                                    | 8,725                           | 41                                                | 1,393                                         |\n| Non-investment grade or not rated  | 14                                    | 6,761                           | 259                                               | 931                                           |\n| Total financial assets             | 1,659                                 | 21,611                          | 690                                               | 4,039                                         |\n\nFor more information about Trade and other receivables, see note 18 Trade and other receivables.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n|              |          |          | GROUP       | REPORTING SEGMENT   | FINANCIAL   | ADDITIONAL   |\n|--------------|----------|----------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| INTRODUCTION | CONTENTS | ABOUT US | PERFORMANCE | PERFORMANCE         | STATEMENTS  | INFORMATION  |",

Equinor's primary focus is on maintaining its credit rating in the A category on a stand alone basis (excluding uplifts for Norwegian Government ownership). Equinor's current long-term ratings are AA- with a stable outlook (including one notch uplift) and Aa2 with a stable outlook (including two notch uplift) from S&P and Moody's, respectively. In order to monitor financial robustness, a key ratio utilised by Equinor is the nonGAAP metric of 'Net interest-bearing debt adjusted (ND2) to Capital employed adjusted (CE2)'.\n\nND1 is defined as Equinor's interest-bearing financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and current financial investments, adjusted for collateral deposits and balances held by Equinor's captive insurance company (amounting to USD 2,030 million and USD 6,538 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively). CE1 is defined as Equinor's total equity (including noncontrolling interests) and ND1. ND2 is defined as ND1 adjusted for lease liabilities (amounting to USD 3,570 million and USD 3,668 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively). CE2 is defined as Equinor's total equity (including non-controlling interests) and ND2.\n\n|                                                                              | At 31 December   | At 31 December   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| (in USD million)                                                             | 2023             | 2022             |\n| Net interest-bearing debt adjusted, including lease liabilities (ND1)        | (5,040)          | (6,750)          |\n| Net interest-bearing debt adjusted (ND2)                                     | (8,610)          | (10,417)         |\n| Capital employed adjusted, including lease liabilities (CE1)                 | 43,460           | 47,239           |\n| Capital employed adjusted (CE2)                                              | 39,890           | 43,571           |\n| Net debt to capital employed adjusted, including lease liabilities (ND1/CE1) | (11.6%)          | (14.3%)          |\n| Net debt to capital employed adjusted (ND2/CE2)                              | (21.6%)          | (23.9%)          |\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Note 5. Segments\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEquinor's operations are managed through operating segments identified on the basis of those components of Equinor that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, Equinor's Corporate Executive O/fficer (CEO). The reportable segments Exploration & Production Norway (E&P Norway), Exploration & Production International (E&P International), Exploration & Production USA (E&P USA), Marketing, Midstream & Processing (MMP) and Renewables (REN) correspond to the operating segments. The operating segments Projects, Drilling & Procurement (PDP), Technology, Digital & Innovation (TDI) and Corporate sta/ff and functions are aggregated into the reportable segment Other based on materiality. The majority of the costs in PDP and TDI is allocated to the three Exploration & Production segments, MMP and REN.\n\nThe accounting policies of the reporting segments equal those described in these Consolidated financial statements, except for the line-item Additions to PP&E, intangibles and Equity accounted investments in which movements related to changes in asset retirement obligations are excluded as well as provisions for onerous contracts which reflect only obligations towards group external parties. The measurement basis of segment profit is net operating income/(loss). Deferred tax assets, pension assets, non-current financial assets, total current assets and total liabilities are not allocated to the segments. Transactions between the segments, mainly from the sale of crude oil, gas, and related products, are performed at defined internal prices which have been derived from market prices. The transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.\n\nThe Exploration & Production operating segments are responsible for the discovery and appraisal of new resources, commercial development and safe and e/fficient operation of the oil and gas portfolios within their respective geographical areas: E&P Norway on the Norwegian continental shelf, E&P USA in USA and E&P International worldwide outside of E&P Norway and E&P USA.\n\nPDP is responsible for global project development, well deliveries, and sourcing across Equinor.\n\nTDI encompasses research, technology development, specialist advisory services, digitalisation, IT, improvement, innovation, and ventures and future business.\n\nMMP is responsible for the marketing, trading, processing and transportation of crude oil and condensate, natural gas, NGL and refined products, and includes refinery, terminals, and processing plant operation. MMP is also managing power and emissions trading and the development of transportation",

The purchase price includes total consideration paid to acquire the entity's assets and liabilities, as well as contingent consideration at fair value. The acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed under Selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from events after the acquisition date are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income under Other income.\n\nEquinor recognises a gain or loss on disposal of a subsidiary when control is lost. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the time of loss of control. However, when partially divesting subsidiaries that do not constitute a business, and where the retained investment in the former subsidiary is an associate or a jointly controlled investment, Equinor recognises the gain or loss only on the divested part within Other income or Operating expenses, respectively. The interest retained in the former subsidiary is initially not remeasured, and subsequently accounted for using the equity method.\n\nOn the NCS, all disposals of assets are performed including the tax base (after-tax). Any gain includes the release of tax liabilities previously recognised related to the assets in question and is recognised in full in Other income in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Assets classified as held for sale\n\nNon-current assets are classified separately as held for sale in the Consolidated balance sheet when a sale is highly probable. This condition is met when an asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, Equinor's management is committed to the sale, and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. In Equinor, these requirements are normally met when management has approved a negotiated letter of intent with the counterparties (a 'DGC'). Liabilities directly associated with the assets classified as held for sale and expected to be included as part of the sales transaction, are also classified separately.\n\nAccounting judgement regarding acquisitions Determining whether an acquisition meets the definition of a business combination requires judgement to be applied on a case-by-case basis. Acquisitions are assessed to establish whether the transaction represents a business combination or an asset purchase, and the conclusion may materially a/ffect the financial statements both in the transaction period and subsequent periods. Similar assessments are performed upon the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation. Depending on",

        "page_content": "the specific facts, acquisitions of oil and gas exploration and evaluation licences for which a development decision has not yet been made have largely been concluded to represent asset purchases, while purchases of producing assets have largely been concluded to represent business acquisitions.\n\n## Accounting judgement regarding partial\n\n## divestments\n\nThe policy regarding partial divestments of subsidiaries is based on careful consideration of the requirements and scope of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. The assessment requires judgement to be applied on a case-by-case basis, considering the substance of the transactions. In evaluating the IFRS Accounting Standards' requirements, Equinor acknowledges pending considerations related to several relevant and similar issues which have been postponed by the IASB in anticipation of concurrent consideration at a later date. Where assets are transferred into separate legal entities concurrently with a portion of the entities' shares being sold to a third party, thereby resulting in Equinor's loss of control of those asset-owning subsidiaries, and where investments in joint ventures are established simultaneously, Equinor has concluded to recognise the gain only on the divested portion.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## 2023\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## Acquisition of Rio Energy\n\nOn 3 November 2023, Equinor closed a transaction with Denham Capital to acquire 100% of the shares in Horus Investimentos S.A., the parent company of Rio Energy Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A., a leading onshore renewables company in Brazil. The cash consideration amounted to USD 82 million in addition to USD 268 million in capital contribution to settle Rio Energy's external financing. The acquired portfolio includes a producing onshore wind farm in the north-eastern state of Bahia, a pre-construction solar photovoltaic (PV) portfolio and a pipeline of 1.2 GW of onshore wind and solar projects. This transaction resulted in an increase in Equinor's property, plant and equipment of USD 350 million. The transaction has been accounted for as a business combination within the REN segment. The purchase price and the purchase price allocation are preliminary.\n\n## Acquisition of Suncor Energy UK Limited\n\nOn 30 June 2023, Equinor closed a transaction with Suncor Energy UK Holdings Ltd to acquire 100% of the shares in Suncor Energy UK Limited for a total consideration of USD 847 million after customary adjustments for working capital. The transaction includes a non-operated interest in the producing Buzzard oil field (29.89%) and an additional interest in the operated Rosebank development (40%). The transaction has been accounted for within the E&P International segment as a business combination, resulting in an increase in Equinor's property, plant\n\nand equipment of USD 1,490 million and deferred tax liabilities of USD 672 million. The purchase price allocation remains preliminary.\n\n## Acquisition of BeGreen\n\nOn 26 January 2023, Equinor closed a transaction with the Bregentved Group and members of the executive board of BeGreen Solar Aps to acquire 100% of the shares in the Danish solar developer BeGreen Solar Aps. The cash consideration amounted to USD 252 million (EUR 235 million), in addition to a consideration contingent on the successful delivery of future solar projects above an agreed megawatt threshold. The transaction has been accounted for within the REN segment as a business combination, resulting in an increase of Equinor's intangible assets of USD 423 million.\n\n## Disposals\n\n## Equinor Energy Ireland Limited\n\nOn 31 March 2023, Equinor closed the transaction with Vermilion Energy Inc (Vermillion) to sell Equinor's nonoperated equity position in the Corrib gas project in Ireland, covering 100% of the shares in Equinor Energy Ireland Limited (EEIL). Prior to closing, Equinor received an extraordinary dividend of USD 371 million from EEIL. Total consideration amounted to USD 362 million, including cash settlement of contingent consideration. A loss of USD 258 million has been recognised within the E&P International segment and presented in the line item Operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Held for sale\n\n## Divestment of interest in Azerbaijan\n\nOn 22 December 2023, Equinor entered into an agreement with the State Oil Company of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) to sell its interest in its Azerbaijan assets. The assets comprise a 7.27% nonoperated interest in the Azeri Chirag Gunashli (ACG) oil fields in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea, 8.71% interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline and 50% in the Karabagh oil field. Closing is expected during 2024 subject to regulatory and contractual approvals. The assets have been classified as held for sale resulting in a USD 310 million impairment within the E&P International segment, presented in the line item Depreciation, amortisation and net impairments in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\n## 2022\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## Acquisition of Triton Power\n\nOn 1 September 2022, Equinor and SSE Thermal Generation Holdings Limited (SSE Thermal) closed a transaction to acquire the UK power company Triton Power Holdings Ltd (Triton Power) from Triton Power Partners LP owned by Energy Capital Partners (ECP). Equinor's share of the consideration was USD 141 million (GBP 120 million), after adjustments that mainly related to net debt and working capital. The key plant included in the purchase of Triton Power is the Saltend Power Station with an installed capacity of 1.2 GW. Equinor and SSE Thermal own 50% each of Triton Power, and Equinor is accounting for the investment under the equity method as a joint venture in the MMP segment.",

        "page_content": "## Acquisition of Statfjord\n\nOn 31 May 2022, Equinor closed a transaction to acquire all of Spirit Energy's ownership interests in production licences in the Statfjord area which covers the Norwegian and UK Continental Shelves ranging from 11.56% to 48.78%. All licences are operated by Equinor. The cash consideration received was USD 168 million. The assets and liabilities acquired have been reflected in accordance with the principles in IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The transaction is reflected in the E&P Norway and E&P International segments. In the segment E&P Norway, the acquisition resulted in an increase of USD 98 million in property, plant and equipment, an increase of USD 390 million in asset retirement obligation, a reduction of deferred tax liability of USD 298 million and an increase in taxes payable of USD 98 million. In the segment E&P International, the acquisition resulted in an increase of USD 98 million in property, plant and equipment, an increase of USD 241 million in asset retirement obligation and an increase of deferred tax asset of USD 86 million.\n\n## Disposals\n\n## Ekofisk and Martin Linge on the Norwegian Continental Shelf\n\nOn 30 September 2022, Equinor closed a transaction with Sval Energi AS to divest Equinor's entire ownership share in the Greater Ekofisk Area including its share in Norpipe Oil AS, and a 19% ownership share in Martin Linge. The cash consideration at closing amounted\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nto USD 293 million. Equinor retained a 51% ownership share in Martin Linge and continues as operator of the field. The disposal resulted in a decrease in property, plant and equipment of USD 1,493 million, a decrease in asset retirement obligation of USD 376 million, a decrease in deferred tax liability of USD 597 million and a decrease in taxes payable of USD 686 million. A posttax gain of USD 655 million is presented in the line item Other income in the Consolidated statement of income in the E&P Norway segment.\n\n## Exit Russia\n\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Equinor announced that it had decided to stop new investments in Russia and start the process of exiting Equinor's joint arrangements. Based on this decision, Equinor evaluated its assets in Russia and recognised net impairments of USD 1,083 million in the first quarter, of which USD 251 million was related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and USD 832 million was related to investments accounted for using the equity method. The impairments were net of contingent consideration from the time of acquiring the assets. The impairments were recognised in the line items Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses and Exploration expenses in the Consolidated statement of income based on the nature of the impaired assets and reflected in the E&P International segment. During the second quarter, Equinor transferred its participating interests in four Russian entities to Rosneft and was released from all future\n\ncommitments and obligations with no material impact on the financial statements. The ownership interests in Kharyaga were transferred to the operator.\n\nEquinor has stopped trading in Russian oil. This means that Equinor will not enter into any new trades or engage in new transport of oil and oil products from Russia. Equinor has assessed the accounting impact of certain commitments arising from such contracts entered into prior to the invasion and deem the impact to be immaterial.\n\n## 10% of Dogger Bank C\n\nOn 10 February 2022, Equinor closed the transaction with Eni to sell a 10% equity interest in the Dogger Bank C project in the UK for a total consideration of USD 91 million (GBP 68 million), resulting in a gain of USD 87 million (GBP 65 million). After closing, Equinor's ownership share is 40%. Equinor continues to equity account for the remaining investment as a joint venture. The gain is presented in the line item Other income in the Consolidated statement of income in the REN segment.",

        "page_content": "## Note 7. Total revenues and other income\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nEquinor presents Revenue from contracts with customers and Other revenue as a single caption, Revenues, in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue from the sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, power and other merchandise is recognised when a customer obtains control of those products, which for tangible products normally is when title passes at point of delivery, based on the contractual terms of the agreements. Each such sale normally represents a single performance obligation. In the case of natural gas as well as power, which is delivered on a continuous basis through pipelines and grid, sales are completed over time in line with the delivery of the actual physical quantities.\n\nSales and purchases of physical commodities are presented on a gross basis as Revenues from contracts with customers and Purchases [net of inventory variation] respectively in the Consolidated statement of income. When the contracts are deemed financial instruments or part of Equinor's trading activities, they are settled and presented on a net basis as Other revenue. Reference is made to note 28 Financial instruments and fair value measurement\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nfor a description of accounting policies regarding derivatives. Sales of Equinor's own produced oil and gas volumes are always reflected gross as Revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nRevenues from the production of oil and gas in which Equinor shares an interest with other companies are recognised on the basis of volumes lifted and sold to customers during the period (the sales method). Where Equinor has lifted and sold more than the ownership interest, an accrual is recognised for the cost of the overlift. Where Equinor has lifted and sold less than the ownership interest, costs are deferred for the underlift.\n\nCertain long-term LNG and natural gas sales contracts include clauses which entail price reviews at regular intervals at the discretion of either party. Where updated prices have not yet been agreed upon for volumes already delivered, it is necessary to estimate the amount of variable consideration Equinor expects to be entitled to for these volumes. In the frequently volatile markets, there is a degree of estimation uncertainty and reasoned judgement in establishing the expected variable consideration.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nItems representing a form of revenue, or which are related to revenue from contracts with customers, are\n\npresented as other revenue if they do not qualify as revenue from contracts with customers. These other revenue items include taxes paid in-kind under certain production sharing agreements (PSAs) and the net impact of commodity trading and commodity-based derivative instruments related to sales contracts or revenue-related risk management.\n\n## Transactions with the Norwegian State\n\nEquinor markets and sells the Norwegian State's share of oil and gas production from the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). The Norwegian State's participation in petroleum activities is organised through the Norwegian State's Direct Financial Interests (SDFI). All purchases and sales of the SDFI's oil and natural gas liquids production are classified as purchases [net of inventory variation] and revenues from contracts with customers, respectively.\n\nEquinor sells, in its own name, but for the SDFI's account and risk, the SDFI's production of natural gas including Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). These gas sales and related expenditures refunded by the SDFI are presented net in the Consolidated financial statements. Natural gas sales made in the name of Equinor's subsidiaries are also presented net of the SDFI's share in the Consolidated statement of income, but this activity is reflected gross in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Accounting judgement related to transactions with the Norwegian State\n\nWhether to account for the transactions gross or net involves the use of significant accounting judgement. In making the judgement, Equinor has considered whether it controls the State-originated crude oil volumes prior to onwards sales to third party customers. Equinor directs the use of the volumes, and although certain benefits from the sales subsequently flow to the SDFI, Equinor purchases the crude oil volumes from the SDFI and obtains substantially all the remaining benefits. On that basis, Equinor has concluded that it acts as principal in these sales.\n\nRegarding gas sales, Equinor concluded that ownership of the gas had not been transferred from the SDFI to Equinor. Although Equinor has been granted the ability to direct the use of the volumes, all the benefits from the sales of these volumes flow to the SDFI. On that basis, Equinor is not considered the principal in the sale of the SDFI's natural gas volumes.\n\nReference is made to note 27 Related parties for detailed financial information regarding transactions performed between Equinor and SDFI.",

Income taxes\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Income tax\n\nIncome tax in the Consolidated statement of income comprises current income tax and e/ffects of changes in deferred tax positions. Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated statement of income except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI).\n\nCurrent tax consists of the expected tax payable for the year and any adjustment to tax payable for previous years. Uncertain tax positions and potential tax exposures are analysed individually. The outcomes of tax disputes are mostly binary in nature, and in each case the most likely amount for probable liabilities to be paid (including penalties) or assets to be received (disputed tax positions for which payment has already been made) is recognised within Current tax or Deferred tax as appropriate.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences attributable to di/fferences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and on unused tax losses and credits carried forward, subject to the initial recognition exemption. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilised. For a deferred tax asset to be recognised based on future taxable income, convincing evidence is\n\nrequired, considering the existence of contracts, production of oil or gas in the near future based on volumes of expected reserves, observable prices in active markets, expected volatility of trading profits, expected foreign currency rate movements and similar facts and circumstances.\n\nWhen an asset retirement obligation or a lease contract is initially reflected in the accounts, a deferred tax liability and a corresponding deferred tax asset are recognised simultaneously and accounted for in line with other deferred tax items.\n\nEquinor has adopted amendments to IAS 12 International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules (top-up tax) with e/ffect from 1 January 2023. Equinor has applied the mandatory exception and does not recognise or disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.\n\nThe mandatory exception applies retrospectively. However, since no new legislation to implement the top-up tax was enacted or substantively enacted on 31 December 2022 in any jurisdiction in which Equinor operates, and no related deferred tax was recognised at that date, the retrospective application has no impact on the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty regarding income tax\n\nEquinor incurs significant amounts of income taxes payable to various jurisdictions and may recognise\n\nsignificant changes to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. There may be uncertainties related to interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations regarding amounts in Equinor's tax returns, which are filed in a number of tax regimes. For cases of uncertain tax treatments, it may take several years to complete the discussions with relevant tax authorities or to reach resolutions of the appropriate tax positions through litigation.\n\nThe carrying values of income tax related assets and liabilities are based on Equinor's interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant court decisions. The quality of these estimates, including the most likely outcomes of uncertain tax treatments, is dependent upon proper application of at times very complex sets of rules, the recognition of changes in applicable rules and, in the case of deferred tax assets, management's ability to project future earnings from activities that may apply loss carry forward positions against future income taxes. Climate-related matters and the transition to carbon-neutral energy-consumption globally have increased the uncertainty in determining key business assumptions used to assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets through su/fficient future taxable income before tax losses expire.",

The rules are introducing a global minimum tax of 15%. The proposal was sanctioned in January 2024 and the Norwegian Top Up Tax Act (No: 'Suppleringsskatteloven') has entered into e/ffect for the income year 2024. The Pillar Two rules will be applicable to the Equinor group, but Equinor's preliminary assessment is that we do not expect any significant economic impact from the rules.",

The rates are influenced by earnings composition between tax regimes with lower statutory tax rates and tax regimes with higher statutory tax rates.\n- 2)  The Norwegian petroleum income is taxable at a tax rate of 71.8% after deducting a calculated 22% corporate tax.\n- 3)  As from 2023 the uplift deduction for investments on NCS has been abolished except for asset investments that fall under the temporary rules enacted under the Covid-19 pandemic. For investments with PUD submitted to the authorities before 31 December 2022 the rules allow a direct deduction of the whole uplift in the year the capital expenditure is incurred. In 2022 the rate was 17.69% and this rate was reduced to 12.4% in 2023.\n- 4)  Equinor performs its assessment on DTA recognition based on sources of income such as the reversal pattern of taxable timing di/fferences and projections of taxable income and recognises the amount of deferred tax assets that is probable to be realised. In 2023 USD 137 million was derecognised due to an increase in valuation allowance mainly related to Angola and Canada, compared to a recognition of USD 4,401 million in 2022 mainly related to unused accumulated tax losses in the US.",

The remaining unrecognised deferred tax assets originate from several di/fferent tax jurisdictions.\n\n## Note 12. Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is reflected at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation, the initial estimate of an asset retirement obligation, exploration costs transferred from intangible assets and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. Contingent consideration included in the acquisition of an asset or group of similar assets is initially measured at its fair value, with later changes in fair value other than due to the passage of time reflected in the book value of the asset or group of assets, unless the asset is impaired. Property, plant and equipment include costs relating to expenditures incurred under the terms of production sharing agreements (PSAs) in certain countries, and which qualify for recognition as assets of Equinor. Stateowned entities in the respective countries, however, normally hold the legal title to such PSA-based property, plant and equipment.\n\nExpenditure on major maintenance refits or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs and overhaul costs. Inspection and overhaul costs, associated with regularly scheduled major maintenance programmes planned and carried out at recurring intervals exceeding one year, are capitalised and amortised over the period to\n\nthe next scheduled inspection and overhaul. All other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nCapitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures, development expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of production wells, and field-dedicated transport systems for oil and gas are capitalised as Producing oil and gas properties within Property, plant and equipment. Such capitalised costs, when designed for significantly larger volumes than the reserves from already developed and producing wells, are depreciated using the unit of production method (UoP) based on proved reserves expected to be recovered from the area during the concession or contract period. Depreciation of production wells uses the UoP method based on proved developed reserves, and capitalised acquisition costs of proved properties are depreciated using the UoP method based on total proved reserves. In the rare circumstances where the use of proved reserves fails to provide an appropriate basis reflecting the pattern in which the asset's future economic benefits are expected to be consumed, a more appropriate reserve estimate is used. Depreciation of other assets and transport systems used by several fields is calculated on the basis of their estimated useful lives, normally using the straight-line method. Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately. For exploration and",

Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is included in Other income or Operating expenses, respectively, in the period the item is derecognised.\n\nMonetary or non-monetary grants from governments, when related to property, plant and equipment and considered reasonably certain, are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet as a deduction to the carrying value of the asset and subsequently recognised in the Consolidated statement of income over the life of the depreciable asset as a reduced depreciation expense.\n\n## Research and development\n\nEquinor undertakes research and development both on a funded basis for licence holders and on an unfunded basis for projects at its own risk, developing innovative technologies to create opportunities and enhance the value of current and future assets. Expenses relate both to in-house resources and the use of suppliers. Equinor's own share of the licence holders' funding and the total costs of the unfunded projects are considered for capitalisation under the applicable IFRS Accounting Standard requirements. Subsequent to initial recognition, any capitalised development costs are accounted for in the same manner as\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nProperty, plant and equipment. Costs not qualifying for capitalisation are expensed as incurred, see note 9 Auditor's remuneration and Research and development expenditures for more details.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty regarding determining oil and gas reserves\n\nReserves quantities are, by definition, discovered, remaining, recoverable and economic. Recoverable oil and gas quantities are always uncertain. Estimating reserves is complex and based on a high degree of professional judgement involving geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production, historical recovery and processing yield factors and installed plant operating capacity. The reliability of these estimates depends on both the quality and availability of the technical and economic data and the e/fficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.\n\nEstimation uncertainty; Proved oil and gas reserves Proved oil and gas reserves may impact the carrying amounts of oil and gas producing assets, as changes in the proved reserves, will impact the unit of production rates used for depreciation and amortisation. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, estimates of proved reserves only reflect the period before the contracts providing the right to operate expire. For future development\n\nprojects, proved reserves estimates are included only where there is a significant commitment to project funding and execution and when relevant governmental and regulatory approvals have been secured or are reasonably certain to be secured.\n\nProved reserves are divided into proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves are to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or where the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major capital expenditure is required. Undrilled well locations can be classified as having proved undeveloped reserves if a development plan is in place indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless specific circumstances justify a longer time horizon. Specific circumstances are for instance fields which have large up-front investments in o/ffshore infrastructure, such as many fields on the NCS, where drilling of wells is scheduled to continue for much longer than five years. For unconventional reservoirs where continued drilling of new wells is a major part of the investments, such as the US onshore assets, the proved reserves are always limited to proved well locations scheduled to be drilled within five years.\n\nProved oil and gas reserves have been estimated by internal qualified professionals based on industry standards and are governed by the oil and gas rules and disclosure requirements in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations S-K and S-X, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)\n\nrequirements for supplemental oil and gas disclosures. The estimates have been based on a 12-month average product price and on existing economic conditions and operating methods as required, and recovery of the estimated quantities have a high degree of certainty (at least a 90% probability). An independent third party has evaluated Equinor's proved reserves estimates, and the results of this evaluation do not di/ffer materially from Equinor's estimates.\n\nEstimation uncertainty; Expected oil and gas reserves Changes in the expected oil and gas reserves may materially impact the amounts of asset retirement obligations, as a consequence of timing of the removal activities. It will also impact value-in-use calculations for oil and gas assets, possibly a/ffecting impairment testing and the recognition of deferred tax assets. Expected oil and gas reserves are the estimated remaining, commercially recoverable quantities, based on Equinor's judgement of future economic conditions, from projects in operation or decided for development. As per Equinor's internal guidelines, expected reserves are defined as the 'forward looking mean reserves' when based on a stochastic prediction approach. In some cases, a deterministic prediction method is used, in which case the expected reserves are the deterministic base case or best estimate. Expected reserves are therefore typically larger than proved reserves as defined by the SEC, which are high confidence estimates with at least a 90% probability of recovery when a probabilistic approach is used. Expected oil and gas reserves have been estimated by internal qualified professionals based on industry standards and classified in accordance with the Norwegian resource classification system issued by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.",

        "page_content": "## Note 13. Intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Intangible assets including goodwill\n\nIntangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Intangible assets include acquisition cost for oil and gas prospects, expenditures on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources, goodwill, and other intangible assets. Intangible assets relating to expenditures on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources are not amortised. When the decision to develop a particular area is made, related intangible exploration and evaluation assets are reclassified to Property, plant and equipment.\n\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each cash generating unit (CGU), or group of units, expected to benefit from the combination's synergies. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment. In acquisitions made on a post-tax basis according to the rules on the NCS, a provision for deferred tax is reflected in the accounts based on the di/fference between the acquisition cost and the tax depreciation basis transferred from the seller. The o/ffsetting entry to such deferred tax amounts is reflected as goodwill, which is allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs on whose tax depreciation basis the deferred tax has been computed.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nOther intangible assets with a finite useful life, are depreciated over their useful life using the straightline method.\n\n## Oil and gas exploration, evaluation and development expenditures\n\nEquinor uses the successful e/fforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration costs. Expenditures to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties, including signature bonuses, expenditures to drill and equip exploratory wells and evaluation expenditures are capitalised within Intangible assets as Exploration expenditures and Acquisition costs - oil and gas prospects. Geological and geophysical costs and other exploration and evaluation expenditures are expensed as incurred.\n\nExploration wells that discover potentially economic quantities of oil and natural gas remain capitalised as intangible assets during the evaluation phase of the discovery. This evaluation is normally finalised within one year after well completion. If, following the evaluation, the exploratory well has not found potentially commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, the previously capitalised costs are evaluated for derecognition or tested for impairment. Any derecognition or impairment is classified as Exploration expenses in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\nCapitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures related to o/ffshore wells that find proved reserves, are transferred to Property, plant and equipment at the time of sanctioning of the development project. The timing from evaluation of a discovery until a project is sanctioned could take several years depending on the location and maturity, including existing infrastructure, of the area of discovery, whether a host government agreement is in place, the complexity of the project and the financial robustness of the project. For onshore wells where no sanction is required, the transfer to Property, plant and equipment occurs at the time when a well is ready for production.\n\nFor exploration and evaluation asset acquisitions (farm-in arrangements) in which Equinor has decided to fund a portion of the selling partner's exploration and/or future development expenditures (carried interests), these expenditures are reflected in the Consolidated financial statements as and when the exploration and development work progresses.\n\nEquinor reflects exploration and evaluation asset disposals (farm-out arrangements) on a historical cost basis with no gain or loss recognition. Consideration from the sale of an undeveloped part of an asset reduces the carrying amount of the asset. If the consideration exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess amount is reflected in the Consolidated statement of income under\n\nOther income. Equal-valued exchanges (swaps) of exploration and evaluation assets with only immaterial cash considerations are accounted for at the carrying amounts of the assets given up with no gain or loss recognition.\n\nEstimation uncertainty regarding exploration activities Exploratory wells that have found reserves, but where classification of those reserves as proved depends on whether a major capital expenditure can be justified, will remain capitalised during the evaluation phase for the findings on the exploration wells. Thereafter it will be considered a trigger for impairment evaluation of the well if no development decision is planned for the near future, and there moreover are no concrete plans for future drilling in the licence. Judgements as to whether these expenditures should remain capitalised, be derecognised or impaired in the period may materially a/ffect the carrying values of these assets and consequently, the operating income for the period.",

Impairments\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, intangible assets including goodwill and equity accounted investments\n\nEquinor assesses individual assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped into cash generating units (CGUs). Normally, separate CGUs are individual oil and gas fields or plants, or equity accounted investments. Each unconventional asset play is considered a single CGU when no cash inflows from parts of the play can be reliably identified as being largely independent of the cash inflows from other parts of the play. In impairment evaluations, the carrying amounts of CGUs are determined on a basis consistent with that of the recoverable amount.\n\nUnproved oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the asset or CGU to which the unproved properties belong may exceed its recoverable amount, and at least once a year. Exploratory wells that have found reserves, but where classification of those reserves as proved depends on whether major capital expenditure can be justified or where the economic viability\n\nof that major capital expenditure depends on the successful completion of further exploration work, will remain capitalised during the evaluation phase for the exploratory finds. If, following evaluation, an exploratory well has not found proved reserves, the previously capitalised costs are tested for impairment. After the initial evaluation phase for a well, it will be considered a trigger for impairment testing of a well if no development decision is planned for the near future and there is no firm plan for future drilling in the licence.\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the CGU, or group of units, to which the goodwill relates. When impairment testing goodwill originally recognised as an o/ffsetting item to the computed deferred tax provision in a post-tax transaction on the NCS, the remaining amount of the deferred tax provision will factor into the impairment valuation.\n\nImpairment and reversals of impairment are presented in the Consolidated statement of income as Exploration expenses or Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment, on the basis of the nature of the impaired assets as either exploration assets (intangible exploration assets)",

Equinor may also apply the assets' fair value less cost of disposal as the recoverable amount when such a value is available, reasonably reliable, and based on a recent and comparable transactions.\n\nValue in use is determined using a discounted cash flow model. The estimated future cash flows are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and represent management's best estimates of the range of economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the assets, as set down in Equinor's most recently approved forecasts. Assumptions and economic conditions in establishing the forecasts are reviewed by management on a regular basis and updated at least annually. For assets and CGUs with an expected useful life or timeline for production of expected oil and natural gas reserves extending beyond five years, including planned onshore production from shale assets with a long development and production horizon, the forecasts reflect expected production volumes, and the related cash flows include project or asset specific estimates reflecting the relevant period. Such estimates are established based on Equinor's\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nprinciples and assumptions and are consistently applied.\n\nThe estimated future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the asset or CGU and discounted using a real post-tax discount rate which is based on Equinor's post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Country risk specific to a project is included as a monetary adjustment to the projects' cash flow. Equinor considers country risk primarily as an unsystematic risk. The cash flow is adjusted for risk that influences the expected cash flow of a project and which is not part of the project itself. The use of post-tax discount rates in determining value in use does not result in a materially di/fferent determination of the need for, or the amount of, impairment that would be required if pre-tax discount rates had been used.\n\n## Impairment reversals\n\nA previously recognised impairment is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment was recognised. Previously recognised impairments of goodwill are not reversed in future periods.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty regarding impairment\n\nEvaluating whether an asset is impaired or if an impairment should be reversed requires a high degree of judgement and may to a large extent depend upon\n\nthe selection of key assumptions about the future. In Equinor's line of business, judgement is involved in determining what constitutes a CGU. Development in production, infrastructure solutions, markets, product pricing, management actions and other factors may over time lead to changes in CGUs such as splitting one original CGU into several CGUs.\n\nThe key assumptions used will bear the risk of change based on the inherent volatile nature of macroeconomic factors such as future commodity prices and discount rates, and uncertainty in asset specific factors such as reserve estimates and operational decisions impacting the production profile or activity levels. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates will also a/ffect value in use, especially for assets on the NCS, where the functional currency is NOK. When estimating the recoverable amount, the expected cash flow approach is applied to reflect uncertainties in timing and amounts inherent in the assumptions used in the estimated future cash flows. For example, climate-related matters (see also Note 3 Climate change and energy transition) are expected to have a pervasive e/ffect on the energy industry, a/ffecting not only supply, demand and commodity prices, but also technology changes, increased emission-related levies, and other matters with mainly mid-term and long-term e/ffects. These e/ffects have been factored into the price assumptions used for estimating future cash flows using probability-weighted scenario analyses.\n\nThe estimated future cash flows, reflecting Equinor's, market participants' and other external sources' assumptions about the future and discounted to their present value, involve complexity. In order to establish relevant future cash flows, impairment testing requires long-term assumptions to be made concerning a number of economic factors such as future market prices, refinery margins, foreign currency exchange rates and future output, discount rates, impact of the timing of tax incentive regulations, and political and country risk among others. Long-term assumptions for major economic factors are made at a group level, and there is a high degree of reasoned judgement involved in establishing these assumptions, in determining other relevant factors such as forward price curves, in estimating production outputs, and in determining the ultimate terminal value of an asset.",

        "page_content": "## Exploration & Production Norway\n\nIn 2023, the net impairment mainly relates to reduced expected reserves on a producing asset on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. 2022, the net impairment reversal was mainly caused by increased price estimates and changed gas export strategy. In 2021, the net impairment reversal was mainly due to increased price estimates and an upward reserve revision.\n\n## Exploration & Production USA - onshore\n\nIn 2023, there were no impairments related to exploration and production assets USA - onshore. In 2022, the impairment reversal was caused by increased gas price assumptions, while in 2021 the net impairment was caused by revision of reserves and sale of an asset.\n\nExploration & Production USA - o/ffshore Gulf of Mexico In 2023, impairment reversals mainly relate to increased expected reserves on a producing asset. In 2022, the impairment reversal was caused by increased price assumptions and higher reserves estimates, while in 2021, the impairment was due to a negative reserve revision.\n\n## Exploration & Production International - Europe and Asia\n\nIn 2023, the impairment relates to the held for sale reclassification of Azerbaijan assets at the end of the year (see note 6 Acquisitions and disposals). In 2022, the net impairment was mainly caused by the decision to exit Russia. This was to a large extent o/ffset by a reversal on Mariner in the UK mainly due to optimisation of the production profile and higher prices, supported by a slight increase in reserves estimates. In 2021, the net impairment was mainly caused by downward reserve revisions partially o/ffset by higher prices.\n\n## Marketing, Midstream & Processing\n\nIn 2023, net impairment mainly relates to expectations of stabilizing refinery margins at a lower level than the margins consumed in recent periods. In 2022 the net impairment reversal was mainly related to increased refinery margin assumptions, while in 2021, the impairment losses were caused by increased CO\u2082 fees and - quotas on a refinery and a classification to held for sale.\n\nABOUT US\n\nGROUP\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n## Renewables USA - O/ffshore\n\nIn 2023, Equinor's o/ffshore wind projects on the US North East Coast are facing increased costs due to inflation and supply chain constraints. On 12 October 2023, the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) rejected price increase petitions related to o/fftake agreements from several o/ffshore and onshore wind farm developers, including Equinor's joint ventures. As a consequence, an impairment of USD 300 million has been recognised. The recoverable amount of Equinor's investments in the o/ffshore wind projects on the US North East Coast has been established applying a fair value approach. These investments are accounted for using the equity method.\n\n## Accounting assumptions\n\nThere are inherent uncertainties in the assumptions, however the commodity price assumptions as well as currency assumptions reflect management's best estimate of the price and currency development over the life of the Group's assets based on its view of relevant current circumstances and the likely future development of such circumstances, including energy demand development, energy and climate change\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\npolicies as well as the speed of the energy transition, population and economic growth, geopolitical risks, technology and cost development and other factors. Management's best estimate also takes into consideration a range of external forecasts.\n\nEquinor has performed a thorough and broad analysis of the expected development in drivers for the di/fferent commodity markets and exchange rates. Significant uncertainty exists regarding future commodity price development due to the transition to a lower carbon economy, future supply actions by OPEC+ and other factors. Such analysis resulted in changes in the longterm price assumptions with e/ffect from the second quarter of 2023. The main price assumptions applied in impairment and impairment reversal assessments are disclosed in the table below as price-points on price curves. Previous price-points applied from the third quarter of 2022 and up to and including the first quarter of 2023 are provided in brackets.\n\n## Year\n\n| Prices in real terms 1)        |   2025 | 2025   |   2030 | 2030   |   2040 | 2040   |   2050 | 2050   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brent Blend (USD/bbl)          |   79   | (78)   |   78   | (78)   |   73   | (73)   |   68   | (68)   |\n| European gas (USD/MMBtu) - TTF |   15.5 | 20.9   |    9.1 | (9.9)  |    9.5 | (9.4)  |    9.5 | (9.4)  |\n| Henry Hub (USD/MMBtu)          |    3.6 | (4.2)  |    4.3 | (3.9)  |    4.3 | (3.9)  |    4.3 | (3.9)  |\n| Electricity Germany (EUR/MWh)  |  106   | (122)  |   78   | (74)   |   71   | (60)   |   71   | (60)   |\n| EU ETS (EUR/tonne)             |   90   | (84)   |  105   | (84)   |  128   | (111)  |  150   | (137)  |\n\n1) Basis year 2023.

        "page_content": "Climate considerations are included in the impairment calculations directly by estimating the CO\u2082 taxes in the cash flows. Indirectly, the expected e/ffect of climate change is also included in the estimated commodity prices where supply and demand are considered. The prices also have e/ffect on the estimated production profiles and economic cut-o/ff of the projects. Furthermore, climate considerations are a part of the investment decisions following Equinor's strategy and commitments to the energy transition.\n\nNorway's Climate Action Plan for the period 20212030 (Meld. St 13 (2020-2021)) which assumes a gradually increased CO\u2082 tax (the total of EU ETS + Norwegian CO\u2082 tax) in Norway to 2,000 NOK/tonne in 2030 is used for impairment calculations of Norwegian upstream assets.\n\nTo reflect that carbon will have a cost for all our assets the current best estimate is considered to be EU ETS for countries outside EU where carbon is not already subject to taxation or where Equinor has not established specific estimates.\n\nThe long-term NOK currency exchange rates are expected to be unchanged compared to previous long-term assumptions. The NOK/USD rate from 2026 and onwards is kept at 8.50, the NOK/EUR at 10.00. The USD/GBP rate is kept at 1.35.\n\nThe base discount rate applied in value in use calculations is 5.0% real after tax. The discount rate\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nis derived from Equinor's weighted average cost of capital. For projects, mainly within the REN segment in periods with fixed low risk income, a lower discount rate will be considered. A derived pre-tax discount rate is in the range of 24% for E&P Norway, 6% for E&P USA and 7% for MMP depending on the asset's characteristics, such as specific tax treatments, cash flow profiles, and economic life. The pre-tax rates for 2022 were 42102%, 6-9% and 7% respectively, in addition to 8-9% for E&P International.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nSignificant downward adjustments in Equinor's commodity price assumptions would result in impairment losses on certain producing and development assets, including intangible assets subject to impairment assessment, while an opposite adjustment could lead to impairment-reversals. Assuming a reasonably possible 30% decline in commodity price forecasts over the assets' lifetime could result in an illustrative impairment recognition of approximately USD 10 billion before tax e/ffects. See note 3 Climate change and energy transition for possible e/ffect of using the prices in a 1.5\u00baC compatible Net Zero Emission by 2050 scenario and the Announced Pledges.\n\nSimilarly, for illustrative purposes, Equinor assessed the sensitivity of the discount rate used in the value in use calculations for upstream producing assets and certain related intangible assets. It was determined an increase in the discount rate from 5.0% to 6% real after\n\ntax, in isolation, the impairment amount recognised could have a potential impact of USD 2 billion before tax e/ffects.\n\nThe illustrative impairment sensitivities above are based on a simplified method, which assumes no changes to other input factors. However, Equinor notes a price reduction of 30% or those representing Net Zero Emission scenario and Announced Pledges Scenario would likely impact business plans and other factors used in estimating an asset's recoverable amount. The correlated changes reduce the stand-alone impact of the price sensitivities. Changes in such input factors would likely include a reduction in the cost level in the oil and gas industry and o/ffsetting foreign currency e/ffects, which has historically occurred following significant changes in commodity prices.",

        "page_content": "## Note 15. Joint arrangements and associates\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Joint operations and similar arrangements, joint ventures and associates\n\nA joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby Equinor and other parties undertake an activity subject to joint control, i.e. when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Such joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. In determining the appropriate classification, Equinor considers the nature of products and markets of the arrangements and whether the substance of the agreements is that the parties involved have rights to substantially all the arrangement's assets and obligations for the liabilities, or whether the parties involved have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Equinor accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in joint operations in accordance with the principles applicable to those particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\n\nThose of Equinor's exploration and production licence activities that are within the scope of IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements have been classified as joint operations. A considerable number of Equinor's unincorporated joint exploration and production activities are conducted through arrangements that\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nare not jointly controlled, either because unanimous consent is not required among all parties involved, or no single group of parties has joint control over the activity. Licence activities where control can be achieved through agreement between more than one combination of involved parties are considered to be outside the scope of IFRS 11, and these activities are accounted for on a pro-rata basis using Equinor's ownership share. Currently, Equinor uses IFRS 11 by analogy for all such unincorporated licence arrangements whether these are in scope of IFRS 11 or not. Reference is made to note 5 Segments for financial information related to Equinor's participation in joint operations within upstream activities.\n\nJoint ventures, in which Equinor has rights to the net assets currently include the majority of Equinor's investments in the Renewables (REN) operating and reporting segment. Equinor's participation in joint arrangements that are joint ventures and investments in companies in which Equinor has neither control nor joint control but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are classified and accounted for as equity accounted investments.\n\nUnder the equity method, the investment is carried on the Consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in Equinor's share of net\n\nassets of the entity, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of the investment. Equinor also reflects its share of the investment's other comprehensive income (OCI) arisen after the acquisition. The part of an equity accounted investment's dividend distribution exceeding the entity's carrying amount in the Consolidated balance sheet is reflected as income from equity accounted investments in the Consolidated statement of income. Equinor will subsequently only reflect the share of net profit in the investment that exceeds the dividend already reflected as income.\n\nThe Consolidated statement of income reflects Equinor's share of the results after tax of an equity accounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortisation and any impairment of the equity accounted entity's assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. In case of material di/fferences in accounting policies, adjustments are made in order to bring the accounts of the equity accounted investment in line with Equinor's accounting policies. Net income/loss from equity accounted investments is presented on a separate line as part of Total revenues and other income, as investments in and participation with significant influence in other companies engaged in energy-related business activities is considered to be part of Equinor's main operating activities.\n\nAcquisition of ownership shares in joint ventures and other equity accounted investments in which the activity constitutes a business, are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applicable to business combinations. Please refer to note 6 Acquisitions and disposals for more details on acquisitions.\n\n## Equinor as operator of joint operations and similar arrangements\n\nIndirect operating expenses such as personnel expenses are accumulated in cost pools. These costs are allocated on an hours' incurred basis to business areas and Equinor-operated joint operations under IFRS 11 and to similar arrangements (licences) outside the scope of IFRS 11. Costs allocated to the other partners' share of operated joint operations and similar arrangements are reimbursed and only Equinor's share of the statement of income and balance sheet items related to Equinor-operated joint operations and similar arrangements are reflected in the Consolidated statement of income and the Consolidated balance sheet.",

The 2023 programme was up to USD 6 billion, including shares to be redeemed from the Norwegian State.\n\nDuring 2023, four tranches of in total USD 6 billion were launched, including shares to be redeemed from the Norwegian State. The acquisition of the fourth tranche in the open market was finalised in January 2024. As of 31 December 2023, USD 410 million of the fourth tranche had been purchased in the open market, of which USD 388 million had been settled. Due to an\n\nirrevocable agreement with a third party, the remaining order of USD 162 million is accrued for and classified as Trade, other payables and provisions.\n\nIn order to maintain the Norwegian State's ownership share in Equinor, a proportionate share of the second, third and fourth tranche of the 2022 programme as well as the first tranche of the 2023 programme was redeemed and annulled after approval by the annual general meeting on 10 May 2023. The liability to the Norwegian State of USD 3.705 billion (NOK 39.071 billion) was settled in June 2023.\n\n## Employees share saving plan\n\n| Number of shares                 | 2023        | 2022        |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Share saving plan at 1 January   | 10,908,717  | 12,111,104  |\n| Purchase                         | 2,204,207   | 2,127,172   |\n| Allocated to employees           | (4,228,256) | (3,329,559) |\n| Share saving plan at 31 December | 8,884,668   | 10,908,717  |\n\nIn 2023 and 2022 treasury shares were purchased to employees participating in the share saving plan for USD 68 million and USD 72 million, respectively.

        "page_content": "## Note 22. Pensions\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEquinor has pension plans for employees that either provide a defined pension benefit upon retirement or a pension dependent on defined contributions and related returns. A portion of the contributions are provided for as notional contributions, for which the liability increases with a promised notional return, set equal to the actual return of assets invested through the ordinary defined contribution plan. For defined benefit plans, the benefit to be received by employees generally depends on many factors including length of service, retirement date and future salary levels.\n\nEquinor's proportionate share of multi-employer defined benefit plans is recognised as liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet as su/fficient information is considered available, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.\n\nThe cost of pension benefit plans is expensed over the period that the employees render services and become eligible to receive benefits. The calculation is performed by an external actuary. Equinor's net obligation from defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their services in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nThe recognition of a net surplus for the funded plan is based on the assumption that the net assets represent a future value for Equinor, either as a possible distribution to premium fund which can be used for future funding of new liabilities, or as disbursement of equity in the pension fund.\n\nContributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income as pension costs in the period in which the contribution amounts are earned by the employees.\n\nNotional contribution plans, reported in the parent company Equinor ASA, are recognised as Pension liabilities with the actual value of the notional contributions and promised return at reporting date. Notional contributions are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income as periodic pension cost, while changes in fair value of the employees' notional assets are reflected in the Consolidated statement of income under Net financial items.\n\nPeriodic pension cost is accumulated in cost pools and allocated to business areas and Equinor's operated joint operations (licences) on an hours' incurred basis and recognised in the Consolidated statement of income based on the function of the cost.\n\n## Pension plans in Equinor\n\nThe main pension plans for Equinor ASA and its most significant subsidiaries are defined contribution plans which includes certain unfunded elements (notional contribution plans). In addition, several employees and former employees of the Equinor Group is a member of certain defined benefit plans. The benefit plan in Equinor ASA was closed in 2015 for new employees and for employees with more than 15 years to regular retirement age. Equinor's defined benefit plans are generally based on a minimum of 30 years of service and 66% of the final salary level, including an assumed benefit from the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme. The Norwegian companies in the group are subject to, and complies with, the requirements of the Norwegian Mandatory Company Pensions Act.\n\nThe defined benefit plans in Norway are managed and financed through Equinor Pensjon (Equinor's pension fund - hereafter Equinor Pension). Equinor Pension is an independent pension fund that covers the employees in Equinor's Norwegian companies. The pension fund's assets are kept separate from the company's and group companies' assets. Equinor Pension is supervised by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway (\"Finanstilsynet\") and is licenced to operate as a pension fund.\n\nEquinor has more than one defined benefit plan, but the disclosure is made in total since the plans are not subject to materially di/fferent risks. Pension plans outside Norway are not material and as such not disclosed separately. In this note pension costs are presented on a gross basis before allocation to licence partners. In the Consolidated statement of income, the pension costs in Equinor ASA are presented net of costs allocated to licence partners.\n\nEquinor is also a member of a Norwegian national agreement-based early retirement plan ('AFP'), and the premium is calculated based on the employees' income but limited to 7.1 times the basic amount in the National Insurance scheme (7.1 G). The premium is payable for all employees until age 62. Pension from the AFP scheme will be paid from the AFP plan administrator to employees for their full lifetime.\n\n## Net pension cost\n\nTotal pension costs amount to USD 441 million in 2023, USD 458 million in 2022 and USD 488 million in 2021. In addition, interest cost and interest income related to defined benefit plans are included in the Consolidated statement of income within Net financial items.",

        "page_content": "## Note 23. Provisions and other liabilities\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Asset retirement obligations (ARO)\n\nProvisions for asset retirement obligations (ARO) are recognised when Equinor has an obligation (legal or constructive) to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of property, plant and equipment and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reliable estimate of that liability can be made. Normally an obligation arises for a new facility, such as an oil and natural gas production or transportation facility, upon construction or installation. An obligation may also arise during the period of operation of a facility through a change in legislation or through a decision to terminate operations or be based on commitments associated with Equinor's ongoing use of pipeline transport systems where removal obligations rest with the volume shippers.\n\nThe amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditures determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. The cost is estimated based on current regulations and technology, considering relevant risks and uncertainties. The discount rate used in the calculation of the ARO is a market-based risk-free rate based on the applicable currency and time horizon of the underlying cash flows. The provisions are classified under Provisions in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nWhen a provision for ARO is recognised, a corresponding amount is recognised as an increase of the related asset within property, plant and equipment and is subsequently depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment. When a decrease in the ARO related to a producing asset exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognised as a reduction of Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment in the Consolidated statement of income. When an asset has reached the end of its useful life, all subsequent changes to the ARO are recognised as they occur in Operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\nRemoval provisions associated with Equinor's role as shipper of volumes through third party transport systems are expensed as incurred.\n\nEstimation uncertainty regarding asset retirement obligations\n\nEstablishing the appropriate estimates for such obligations are based on historical knowledge combined with knowledge of ongoing technological developments, expectations about future regulatory and technological development and involve the application of judgement and an inherent risk of\n\nsignificant adjustments. The costs of decommissioning and removal activities require revisions due to changes in current regulations and technology while considering relevant risks and uncertainties. Most of the removal activities are many years into the future, and the removal technology and costs are constantly changing. The speed of the transition to renewable energy sources may also influence the production period, hence the timing of the removal activities. The estimates include assumptions of norms, rates and time required which can vary considerably depending on the assumed removal complexity. Moreover, changes in the discount rate and foreign currency exchange rates may impact the estimates significantly. As a result, the initial recognition of ARO and subsequent adjustments involve the application of significant judgement.",

Leases\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Leases\n\nA lease is defined as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. At the date at which the underlying asset is made available for Equinor, the present value of future lease payments (including extension options considered reasonably certain to be exercised) is recognised as a lease liability. The present value is calculated using Equinor's incremental borrowing rate. A corresponding right-of-use (RoU) asset is recognised, including lease payments and direct costs incurred at the commencement date. Lease payments are reflected as interest expense and a reduction of lease liabilities. The RoU assets are depreciated over the shorter of each contract's term and the assets' useful life.\n\nShort term leases (12 months or less) and leases of low value assets are expensed or (if appropriate) capitalised as incurred, depending on the activity in which the leased asset is used.\n\nMany of Equinor's lease contracts, such as rig and vessel leases, involve several additional services and components, including personnel cost, maintenance, drilling related activities, and other items. For a number of these contracts, the additional services represent a not inconsiderable portion of the total contract value. Non-lease components within lease contracts are accounted for separately for\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nall underlying classes of assets and reflected in the relevant expense category or (if appropriate) capitalised as incurred, depending on the activity involved.\n\nAccounting judgement regarding leases In the oil and gas industry, where activity frequently is carried out through joint arrangements or similar arrangements, the application of IFRS 16 Leases requires evaluations of whether the joint arrangement or its operator is the lessee in each lease agreement and consequently whether such contracts should be reflected gross (100%) in the operator's financial statements, or according to each joint operation partner's proportionate share of the lease.\n\nIn many cases where an operator is the sole signatory to a lease contract of an asset to be used in the activities of a specific joint operation, the operator does so implicitly or explicitly on behalf of the joint arrangement. In certain jurisdictions, and importantly for Equinor as this includes the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS), the concessions granted by the authorities establish both a right and an obligation for the operator to enter into necessary agreements in the name of the joint operations (licences).\n\nAs is the customary norm in upstream activities operated through joint arrangements, the operator will manage the lease, pay the lessor, and subsequently re-bill the partners for their share of\n\nthe lease costs. In each such instance, it is necessary to determine whether the operator is the sole lessee in the external lease arrangement, and if so, whether the billings to partners may represent sub-leases, or whether it is in fact the joint arrangement which is the lessee, with each participant accounting for its proportionate share of the lease. Where all partners in a licence are considered to share the primary responsibility for lease payments under a contract, Equinor's proportionate share of the related lease liability and RoU asset will be recognised net by Equinor. When Equinor is considered to have the primary responsibility for the full external lease payments, the lease liability is recognised gross (100%).",

Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\n## Contractual commitments\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEstimation uncertainty regarding levies Equinor's global business activities are subject to taxation on income and indirect taxes in various jurisdictions around the world. In these jurisdictions, governments can respond to global or local development, including climate related matters and public fiscal balances, by issuing new laws or other regulations stipulating changes in income tax, value added tax, tax on emissions, customs duties or other levies which may a/ffect profitability and even the viability of Equinor's business in that jurisdiction. Equinor mitigates this risk by using local legal representatives and staying up to date with the legislation in the jurisdictions where activities are carried out. Occasionally, legal disputes arise from di/fference in interpretations. Equinor's legal department, together with local legal representatives, estimate the outcome from such legal disputes based on first-hand knowledge. Such estimates may di/ffer from the actual results.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nEquinor had contractual commitments of USD 11,259 million as of 31 December 2023. The contractual commitments reflect Equinor's proportional share and mainly comprise construction and acquisition of property, plant and equipment as well as committed investments/funding or resources in equity accounted entities. It also includes Equinors' estimated expenditures related to commitments to drill a certain number of wells, commitments which sometimes can be a prerequisite to be awarded oil and gas exploration and production licences.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Equinor was committed to participate in 34 wells, with an average ownership interest of approximately 46%. Equinor's share of estimated expenditures to drill these wells amounts to USD 609 million. Additional wells that Equinor may become committed to participating in depending on future discoveries in certain licences are not included in these numbers.\n\n## Other long-term commitments\n\nEquinor has entered into various long-term agreements for pipeline transportation as well as terminal use, processing, storage and entry/exit capacity commitments and commitments related to specific\n\npurchase agreements. The agreements ensure the rights to the capacity or volumes in question, but also impose on Equinor the obligation to pay for the agreed-upon service or commodity, irrespective of actual use. The contracts' terms vary, with durations of up to 2060.\n\nTake-or-pay contracts for the purchase of commodity quantities are only included in the table below if their contractually agreed pricing is of a nature that will or may deviate from the obtainable market prices for the commodity at the time of delivery.\n\nObligations payable by Equinor to entities accounted for in the Equinor group using the equity method are included in the table below with Equinor's full proportionate share. For assets (such as pipelines) that are included in the Equinor accounts through joint operations or similar arrangements, and where consequently Equinor's share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses (capacity costs) are reflected on a line-by-line basis in the Consolidated financial statements, the amounts in the table include the net commitment payable by Equinor (i.e. Equinor's proportionate share of the commitment less Equinor's ownership share in the applicable entity).\n\nThe table below also includes USD 3,600 million as the non-lease components of lease agreements reflected in the accounts according to IFRS 16, as well as leases not yet commenced.

        "page_content": "## Guarantees\n\nEquinor has guaranteed for its proportionate share of some of our associates' long-term bank debt, payment obligations under contracts, and certain third-party obligations. The total amount guaranteed at yearend 2023 is USD 1,564 million. The book value of the guarantees is immaterial.\n\n## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\n## Claim from Petrofac regarding multiple variation order requests performed in Algeria (In Salah)\n\nPetrofac International (UAE) LLC ('PIUL') was awarded the EPC Contract to execute the ISSF Project (the In Salah Southern Fields Project in central Algeria). Following a suspension of activity in 2013, PIUL issued multiple Variation Order Requests ('VoRs') related to the costs incurred for stand-by and remobilization costs. Several VoRs have been paid, but the settlement of the remaining has been unsuccessful. PIUL initiated arbitration in August 2020 claiming an estimated amount of USD 533 million, of which Equinor holds a 31.85% share. Equinor's maximum exposure amounts to USD 163 million. Equinor has provided for its best estimate in the matter.\n\n## Withholding tax dispute regarding remittances from Brazil to Norway\n\nRemittances made from Brazil for services are normally subject to withholding income tax. In 2012, Equinor's subsidiaries in Brazil filed a lawsuit to avoid paying this tax on remittances made to Equinor ASA and Equinor Energy AS under the Double Tax Treaty Brazil has with Norway. The lawsuit relates to services without transfer of technology on fields where Equinor is a partner. Court proceedings through several levels in the legal\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nsystem have been ongoing, and a final verdict has not yet been reached. Withholding tax has not been paid since 2014. Equinor's share of maximum exposure in the case at year end 2023 is estimated at approximately USD 159 million. Although Equinor continues to be of the view that all applicable tax regulations have been applied in the case, recent developments in similar litigation in Brazil have led to an updated evaluation of the likelihood of loss, and Equinor has provided for the best estimate in the case as income tax expense.\n\n## Suit for an annulment of Petrobras' sale of the interest in BM-S-8 to Equinor\n\nIn March 2017, an individual connected to the Union of Oil Workers of Sergipe (Sindipetro) filed a class action suit against Petrobras, Equinor, and ANP - the Brazilian Regulatory Agency - to seek annulment of Petrobras' sale of the interest and operatorship in BM-S-8 to Equinor, which was closed in November 2016 after approval by the partners and authorities. In February 2022, sentence in the annulment case was issued at the first instance level, and Equinor won on all merits. The case was appealed by the plainti/ff and Equinor has filed counter arguments. At the end of 2023, the acquired interest remains on Equinor's balance sheet, where the assets related to phase 1 have been reclassified to property, plant and equipment and the assets related to phase 2 are presented as intangible assets, all of which are part of the Exploration & Production International (E&P International) segment.\n\n## Brazilian law creating uncertainty regarding certain tax incentives\n\nEquinor is currently part in two legal matters in the state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil related to a law requiring taxpayers that benefits from ICMS tax incentives (i.e.\n\nRepetro) to deposit 10% of the savings made from such benefits into a state fund. Equinor is of the opinion that specific incentives so far relevant for the Roncador and Peregrino fields are not in scope of the law, while the state of Rio de Janeiro requires deposits to be paid with the addition of fines and interest. While legal developments in 2023 have included clarification from the Supreme Court that the law is constitutional, subject to a final ruling, Equinor's litigation in the matter continues, mainly related to the law's impact specifically for Repetro and other state tax incentives. Equinor believes that our view in the matter will ultimately be upheld by the courts, and no amounts have consequently been provided for in the financial statements. At year-end 2023, the maximum exposure for Equinor in the matter has been estimated to be a total of USD 114 million.\n\n## KKD oil sands partnership\n\nCanadian tax authorities have issued a notice of reassessment for 2014 for Equinor's Canadian subsidiary which was party to Equinor's divestment of 40% of the KKD Oil Sands partnership at that time. The reassessment adjusts the allocation of the proceeds of disposition of certain Canadian resource properties from the partnership. Maximum exposure is estimated to be approximately USD 380 million. Following an administrative appeal process with Canadian tax authorities, Equinor commenced court proceedings in the matter in 2023. While the court process may take several years, the reassessment will impact Equinor's tax paying position while the proceedings are ongoing. Equinor is of the view that all applicable tax regulations have been applied in the case and that Equinor has a strong position. No amounts have consequently been provided for in the financial statements.\n\n## Other claims\n\nDuring the normal course of its business, Equinor is involved in legal proceedings, and several other unresolved claims are currently outstanding. The ultimate liability or asset, in respect of such litigation and claims cannot be determined at this time. Equinor has provided in its Consolidated financial statements for probable liabilities related to litigation and claims based on its best estimate. Equinor does not expect that its financial position, results of operations or cash flows will be materially a/ffected by the resolution of these legal proceedings. Equinor is actively pursuing the above disputes through the contractual and legal means available in each case, but the timing of the ultimate resolutions and related cash flows, if any, cannot at present be determined with su/fficient reliability.\n\nProvisions related to claims other than those related to income tax are reflected within note 23 Provisions and other liabilities. Uncertain income tax related liabilities are reflected as current tax payables or deferred tax liabilities as appropriate, while uncertain tax assets are reflected as current or deferred tax assets.",

Related parties\n\n## Transactions with the Norwegian State\n\nThe Norwegian State is the majority shareholder of Equinor and also holds major investments in other Norwegian companies. As of\n\n31 December 2023, the Norwegian State had an ownership interest in Equinor of 67.0% (excluding Folketrygdfondet, the Norwegian national insurance fund, of 3.6%). This ownership structure means that Equinor participates in transactions with many parties that are under a common ownership structure and therefore meet the definition of a related party.\n\nFor accounting policies and accounting judgement related to transactions with the Norwegian State, see note 7 Total revenues and other income. Total purchases of oil and natural gas liquids from the Norwegian State amounted to USD 10.1 billion, USD 12.6 billion and USD 9.6 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Payables to equity accounted associated companies and other related parties specified in note 24 Trade and other payables are mostly related to these purchases, and is included in the below table within Trade, other payables and provisions. In addition, Equinor sells in its own name, but for the Norwegian State's account and risk, the Norwegian State's gas production.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nTrade and other receivables include a receivable from the Norwegian State under the Marketing Instruction in relation to the state's (SDFI) participation in the gas sales activities of a foreign subsidiary of Equinor, estimated at USD 0.1 billion. At year-end 2022, the corresponding estimated amount of USD 1.5 billion was classified as a non-current item and included within Prepayments and financial receivables. The decrease is mainly related to reduced cost price for gas storage volume and realised gains in the period. A corresponding non-current liability of USD 0.1 billion has been recognised, representing SDFI's estimated interest in the gas sales activities in the foreign subsidiary, and is included within Provisions and other liabilities in the below table. The estimated total non-current liabilities to SDFI amount to USD 0.8 billion at 31 December 2023 (USD 2.1 billion at year end 2022).\n\nIn addition, the line-item Finance debt, which form part of the sub-total Total current liabilities, includes a liability of USD 0.9 billion to SDFI due to cash received for collateral deposits requirement (0 at year end 2022).\n\nTransactions with the Norwegian State related to Equinor's share buy-back programme are presented in note 20 Shareholders' equity, capital distribution and earnings per share.\n\n## Other transactions\n\nIn its ordinary business operations, Equinor enters into contracts such as pipeline transport, gas storage and processing of petroleum products, with companies in which Equinor has ownership interests.\n\nGassled and certain other infrastructure assets are operated by Gassco AS, which is an entity under common control by the Norwegian Ministry of Energy. Gassco's activities are performed on behalf of and for the risk and reward of pipeline and terminal owners, and capacity payments flow through Gassco to the respective owners. Equinor payments that flowed through Gassco in this respect amounted to USD 1.0 billion in 2023, USD 1.2 billion and USD 1.0 billion in 2022 and 2021 respectively. The stated amounts represent Equinor's capacity payment net of Equinor's own ownership interests in Gassco operated infrastructure. In addition, Equinor manages, in its own name, but for the Norwegian State's account and risk, the Norwegian State's share of the Gassco costs. These transactions are presented net.\n\nEquinor has had transactions with other associated companies and joint ventures in the course of its ordinary business, for which amounts have not been disclosed due to materiality. In addition, Equinor has\n\nhad transactions with joint operations and similar arrangements where Equinor is operator. Indirect operating expenses incurred as operator are charged to the joint operation or similar arrangement based on the 'no-gain/no-loss' principle.\n\nRelated party transactions with management are presented in note 8 Salaries and personnel expenses. Related party transactions due to Equinor's share buy-back programme are presented in note 20 Shareholders' equity, capital distribution and earnings per share. Outstanding balances to related parties split on SDFI and other related parties are presented in the below table. All related party transactions are carried out on market terms.",

Financial instruments and fair value measurement\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are initially recognised at fair value when Equinor becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the asset.\n\nShort-term highly liquid investments with original maturity exceeding 3 months are classified as current financial investments. Current financial investments are primarily accounted for at amortised cost.\n\nTrade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less a provision for doubtful receivables which represent expected losses computed on a probability-weighted basis.\n\nA part of Equinor's financial investments is managed together as an investment portfolio of Equinor's captive insurance company and is held in order to comply with specific regulations for capital retention. The investment portfolio is managed and evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with an investment strategy and is accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets are presented as current if they contractually will expire or otherwise are expected to be recovered within 12 months after the balance sheet date, or if they are held for the purpose of being traded. Financial assets and financial liabilities are shown separately in the Consolidated balance sheet, unless Equinor has both a legal right and a demonstrable intention to net settle certain balances payable to and receivable from the same counterparty.\n\nGains and losses arising on the sale, settlement or cancellation of financial assets are recognised within Net financial items.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value when Equinor becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the liability. The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities is either as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or financial liabilities measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method, depending on classification. The latter applies to Equinor's noncurrent bank loans and bonds.",

        "page_content": "Financial liabilities are presented as current if the liability is expected to be settled as part of Equinor's normal operating cycle, the liability is due to be settled within 12 months after the balance sheet date, Equinor does not have the right to defer settlement of the liability more than 12 months after the balance sheet date, or if the liabilities are held for the purpose of being traded.\n\nGains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised within Net financial items.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nEquinor uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value through profit and loss. The impact of commoditybased derivative financial instruments is recognised in the Consolidated statement of income as part of Revenues, as such derivative instruments are related to sales contracts or revenue-related risk management for all significant purposes. The impact of other derivative financial instruments is reflected under Net financial items.\n\nDerivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Derivative assets or liabilities expected to be settled, or with the legal right to be settled\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nmore than 12 months after the balance sheet date, are classified as non-current. Derivative financial instruments held for the purpose of being traded are however always classified as current.\n\nContracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument are accounted for as financial instruments. However, contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with Equinor's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements, also referred to as own-use, are not accounted for as financial instruments. Such sales and purchases of physical commodity volumes and power are reflected in the Consolidated statement of income as Revenue from contracts with customers and Purchases [net of inventory variation], respectively. This is applicable to a significant number of contracts for the purchase or sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as for some contracts for the purchase or sale of power.\n\nFor contracts to sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash, but which ultimately are physically settled despite not qualifying as own use prior to settlement, the changes in fair value are included in Gain/loss on commodity derivatives. When these derivatives are physically settled, the previously recognised unrealised gain/loss is included in Physically settled commodity derivatives. Both these elements are included as part of Revenues. The physical deliveries made through such contracts are included in Revenue from contracts with customers at contract price.\n\nDerivatives embedded in host contracts which are not financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 are recognised as separate derivatives and are reflected at fair value with subsequent changes through profit and loss, when their risks and economic characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts, and the host contracts are not carried at fair value. Where there is an active market for a commodity or other non-financial item referenced in a purchase or sale contract, a pricing formula will, for instance, be considered to be closely related to the host purchase or sales contract if the price formula is based on the active market in question. A price formula with indexation to other markets or products will however result in the recognition of a separate derivative. In Equinor, this mainly relates to certain natural gas sales contracts where the pricing formula references power.",

For financial investments, the di/fference between measurement as defined by IFRS 9 categories and measurement at fair value is immaterial. For trade and other receivables and payables, and cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amounts are considered a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Financial instruments quoted in active markets will typically include financial instruments with quoted market prices obtained from the relevant exchanges or clearing houses. The fair values of quoted financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative instruments are determined by reference to mid-market prices, at the close of business on the balance sheet date.\n\nWhere there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. These include using recent arm's-length market transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and pricing models and related internal assumptions. In the valuation techniques, Equinor also takes into consideration the counterparty and its own credit risk. This is either reflected in the discount rate used or through direct adjustments to the calculated cash flows. Consequently, where Equinor reflects elements of long-term physical delivery commodity contracts at fair value, such fair value estimates to the extent possible are based on quoted forward prices in the market and underlying indexes in the contracts, as well as assumptions of forward prices and margins where observable market prices are not available. Similarly, the fair values of interest and currency swaps are estimated based on relevant quotes from active markets, quotes of comparable instruments, and other appropriate valuation techniques.",

This will typically be when Equinor uses forward prices on crude oil, natural gas, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as inputs to the valuation models to determine the fair value of it derivative financial instruments.\n\nLevel 3, fair value based on unobservable inputs, includes financial instruments for which fair values are\n\ndetermined on the basis of input and assumptions that are not from observable market transactions. The fair values presented in this category are mainly based on internal assumptions. The internal assumptions are only used in the absence of quoted prices from an active market or other observable price inputs for the financial instruments subject to the valuation.\n\nThe fair value of certain earn-out agreements and embedded derivative contracts are determined by the use of valuation techniques with price inputs from\n\nobservable market transactions as well as internally generated price assumptions and volume profiles. The discount rate used in the valuation is a risk-free rate based on the applicable currency and time horizon of the underlying cash flows adjusted for a credit premium to reflect either Equinor's credit premium, if the value is a liability, or an estimated counterparty credit premium if the value is an asset. In addition, a risk premium for risk elements not adjusted for in the cash flow may be included when applicable. The fair values of these derivative financial instruments have been classified",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EQUINOR ASA\n\n## Note 1. Organisation and material accounting policies\n\nEquinor ASA ('the company') is the parent company of the Equinor Group (Equinor), consisting of Equinor ASA and its subsidiaries. Equinor ASA's main activities include shareholding in group companies, group management, corporate functions and group financing. Equinor ASA also carries out activities related to external sales of oil and gas products, purchased externally or from group companies, including related refinery and transportation activities. Reference is made to disclosure note 1 Organisation in Equinor's Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements of Equinor ASA have been prepared in accordance with simplified application of international accounting standards according to section 3-9 of the Norwegian Accounting Act and regulations regarding simplified application of international accounting standards issued by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance on 7 February 2022. The presentation currency of Equinor ASA is US dollar (USD), consistent with the presentation currency for the group financial statements and with the company's functional currency.\n\nEquinor ASA's financial statements should be read in connection with the Consolidated financial statements of Equinor, published together with these financial statements. With the exceptions described below, Equinor ASA applies the accounting policies of the group, as described in Equinor's Consolidated financial statements.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures\n\nShareholdings and interests in subsidiaries and associated companies (companies in which Equinor ASA does not have control, or joint control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, generally when the ownership share is between 20% and 50%), as well as Equinor ASA's participation in joint arrangements that are joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in Equinor ASA's share of net assets of the entity, less distribution received and less any impairment in value of the investment. Goodwill may arise as the surplus of the cost of investment over Equinor ASA's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate. Goodwill included in the balance sheets of subsidiaries and associated companies is tested for impairment as part of the related investment in the subsidiary or associated company. The Statement of income reflects Equinor ASA's share of the results after tax of an equityaccounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortisation and any impairment of the equityaccounted entity's assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition in situations where Equinor ASA has not been the owner since the establishment of the entity. Equinor also reflects its share of the investment's other comprehensive income (OCI) arisen after the acquisition. Net income/loss from equity accounted investments is presented as part of Total revenues and other income, as these investments in other companies\n\nengaged in energy-related business activities are considered part of Equinor ASA's main operating activities.\n\nWithin Equinor ASA's equity, a reserve for valuation variances has been established. All positive di/fferences between the equity accounted investments' carrying value and the acquisition cost are allocated to this reserve.\n\n## Expenses related to the Equinor group as operator of joint operations and similar arrangements (licences)\n\nIndirect operating expenses incurred by the company, such as personnel expenses, are accumulated in cost pools. Such expenses are allocated in part on hours incurred cost basis to Equinor Energy AS, to other group companies and to licences where Equinor Energy AS or other group companies are operators. Costs allocated in this manner reduce the expenses in the company's statement of income, with the exception of operating subleases and cost recharges related to lease liabilities being recognised gross, which are presented as revenues in Equinor ASA.\n\n## Asset transfers between the company and its subsidiaries\n\nTransfers of assets and liabilities between the company and the entities that it directly or indirectly controls are accounted for at the carrying amounts (continuity) of the assets and liabilities transferred, when the transfer is part of a reorganisation within the Equinor group.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nEmbedded derivatives within sales or purchase contracts between Equinor ASA and other companies within the Equinor group are not separated from the host contract.\n\n## Dividends payable and group contributions\n\nDividends are reflected as Dividends payable within current liabilities. Group contributions for the year to other entities within Equinor's Norwegian tax group are reflected in the balance sheet as current liabilities within Liabilities to group companies. Under simplified application of international accounting standards according to section 3-9 of the Norwegian Accounting Act the presentation of dividends payable and group contributions payable di/ffers from the presentation under IFRS Accounting Standards, as it also includes dividends and group contributions payable which at the date of the balance sheet is subject to a future annual general meeting approval before distribution.\n\n## Reserves for unrealised gains\n\nReserves for unrealised gains included within the company's equity consists of accumulated unrealised gains on non-exchange traded financial instruments and accumulated positive fair value changes from embedded derivatives.",

Financial risk management and measurement of financial instruments\n\n## General information relevant to financial risks\n\nEquinor ASA's activities expose the company to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The management of such risks does not substantially di/ffer from the Group's. See note 4 Financial risk and capital management in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of financial instruments by categories\n\nThe following tables present Equinor ASA's classes of financial instruments and their carrying amounts by the categories as they are defined in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. For financial investments, the di/fference\n\nbetween measurement as defined by IFRS 9 categories and measurement at fair value is immaterial. For trade and other receivables and payables and cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amounts are considered a reasonable approximation of fair value.\n\nSee note 21 Finance debt in the Consolidated financial statements for fair value information of non-current bonds and bank loans and note 28 Financial instruments and fair value measurement in the Consolidated financial statements where fair value measurement is explained in detail.\n\n| (in USD million)                                                   | Note   | Amortised  cost   | Fair value  through  profit or  loss   |

Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\n## Contractual commitments\n\nEquinor ASA has entered into various long-term agreements for pipeline transportation as well as terminal use, processing, storage and entry/exit capacity commitments and commitments related to specific purchase agreements. The agreements ensure the rights to the capacity or volumes in question, but also impose on Equinor the obligation to pay for the agreed-upon service or commodity, irrespective of actual use. The contracts' terms vary with durations of up to 2060.\n\nTake-or-pay contracts for the purchase of commodity quantities are only included in the table below if their contractually agreed pricing is of a nature that will or may deviate from the obtainable market prices for the commodity at the time of delivery.\n\nObligations payable by Equinor ASA to entities accounted for as associates and joint ventures are included gross in the table below. Obligations payable by Equinor ASA to entities accounted for as joint operations (for example pipelines) and where consequently Equinor's share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses (capacity costs) are reflected on a line-by-line basis in the Financial statements, are included net (i.e. gross commitment less Equinor ASA's ownership share).\n\nThe table below includes USD 931 million related to the non-lease components of lease agreements reflected in the accounts according to IFRS 16, as well as leases not yet commenced. See note 20 Leases for information regarding lease related commitments.\n\nNominal minimum other long-term commitments at 31 December 2023:\n\n| (in USD million)                  |       |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|\n| 2024                              | 1,084 |\n| 2025                              | 1,080 |\n| 2026                              | 811   |\n| 2027                              | 748   |\n| 2028                              | 689   |\n| Total other long-term commitments | 9,576 |\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Guarantees\n\nEquinor ASA has provided parent company guarantees and also counter-guaranteed certain bank guarantees to cover liabilities of subsidiaries in countries of operations. Equinor ASA has guaranteed for its proportionate portion of an associate's long-term bank debt, payment obligations under the contracts and some third-party obligations, amounting to USD 305 million. The fair value and book value of the guarantees are immaterial.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nEquinor ASA is the participant in certain entities (\"DAs\") in which the company has unlimited responsibility for its proportionate share of such entities' liabilities, if any, and participates in certain companies (\"ANSs\") in which the participants in addition have joint and several liabilities. For further details, see note 10 Investments in subsidiaries and other equity accounted investments.\n\n## Other claims\n\nDuring the normal course of its business, Equinor ASA is involved in legal proceedings, and several other unresolved claims are currently outstanding. The ultimate liability or asset in respect of such litigation and claims cannot be determined at this time. Equinor ASA has provided in its financial statements for probable liabilities related to litigation and claims based on the company's best judgment. Equinor ASA does not expect that its financial position, results of operations or cash flows will be materially a/ffected by the resolution of these legal proceedings.\n\nProvisions related to claims and disputes are reflected within note 18 Provisions and other liabilities.",

It has a direct ownership interest of 67%, which is managed by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries, and a 3.6% indirect interest through the National Insurance Fund (Folketrygdfondet), totalling 70.6%.\n\nEquinor has one class of shares, and each share confers one vote at the annual general meeting. The Norwegian State does not have any voting rights that di/ffer from the rights of other ordinary shareholders.\n\nPursuant to the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act, a majority of at least two-thirds of the votes cast at the general meeting is required to amend our articles of association. As long as the Norwegian State owns more than one-third of our shares, it is able to prevent any amendments to our articles of association. Since the Norwegian State, acting through the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries, has more than two-thirds of the shares in the company, it also has the sole power to amend our articles of association. In addition, as\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nmajority shareholder, the Norwegian State has the power to control any decision at a general meeting that requires a majority vote, including approval of dividend proposed by the BoD and election of the majority of the corporate assembly which, in turn, has the power to elect the BoD.\n\nThe Norwegian State endorses the principles set out in The Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance,and has stated that it expects companies in which the State has an ownership interest to adhere to the code. The principle of ensuring equal treatment of di/fferent groups of shareholders is a key element in the State's own guidelines. In companies in which the State is one of the shareholders, its intention is to exercise the same rights and obligations as any other shareholder and not act in a manner that has a detrimental e/ffect on the rights or financial interests of other shareholders. In addition to the principle of equal treatment of shareholders, emphasis is also placed on transparency in relation to the State's ownership and on general meetings being the correct forum for owner decisions and formal resolutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The purpose of these plans is to strengthen the business culture and encourage loyalty through employees becoming part-owners of the company. As of 31.12.2023, 84% of eligible employees worldwide participated in share incentive plans.\n\nThrough regular salary contributions, employees can invest up to 5% of their base salary in Equinor shares. In addition, the company provides a contribution of up to a maximum of NOK 1,500 per year (approximately USD 150) to the total share investment made by employees in Norway. After a holding period of two calendar years following the year of purchase 15 , one extra share is awarded for each share purchased. Under current Norwegian tax legislation, the share award is a taxable employee benefit, with a value equal to the value of the shares awarded and taxed at the time of the award.\n\nEquinor ASA runs a share-based long-term incentive (LTI) plan for approximately 100 employees (comprising executive committee members, senior vice presidents, and nominated vice presidents). A gross LTI grant is made at a fixed percentage of the employee's base salary. Equinor shares are allocated for the net-aftertax amount, to be held in for a period of 36 months. The gross LTI grant is a taxable employee benefit.\n\nOn behalf of the company, the BoD is authorised to acquire Equinor shares on the open market in order to\n\ncontinue the operation of the share-based incentive plans. This authorisation is valid until 30 June 2024, and it is Equinor's intention to renew it at the annual general meeting on 14 May 2024.\n\nVoting rights may not be exercised for shares in Equinor ASA which belong to the company itself or a subsidiary.\n\n## Share buy-backs\n\nFor the period 2013-2023, the BoD was authorised by the annual general meeting to repurchase Equinor shares on the open market for subsequent annulment. It is Equinor's intention to renew this authorisation at the annual general meeting in May 2024.\n\nThe annual general meeting on 10 May 2023 authorised the BoD to acquire shares in the open market. The authorisation is valid until either 30 June 2024 or the annual general meeting in 2024 (whichever is the earliest). A total of 64,861,696 shares were bought back as part of this 2023 share buy-back programme for USD 1.98 billion. Of the announced share buy-back programme of USD 6 billion for 2023, 67% will be settled with the Norwegian State in order to keep the State's ownership share unchanged. The State share of the first tranche of the 2023 programme was settled in June 2023, while the State share of the second, third and fourth tranches in 2023 will be settled in July 2024, subject to approval by the annual general meeting in May 2024.",

Generally, Equinor does not have control over the factors that a/ffect market developments and prices.\n\nUncertainty in global and regional energy supply and demand means that Equinor's long-term plans should take into consideration many outcomes for how global energy markets may develop. Examples of factors that can a/ffect supply and demand, and consequently the prices of oil, natural gas, electricity and other energy products include: global and regional economic conditions, political and regulatory developments, geopolitical tensions, the actions of OPEC+ and other large energy suppliers, the social and health situation in any country or region, technological advances, availability of energy resources or access to energy-related acreages, development of supply chains and consumer preferences, including those related to climate issues.\n\nOver recent years, there has been significant volatility in energy prices, triggered by the supply and demand impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and the post-pandemic recovery, the European security situation, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and its e/ffect on global energy flows. Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023 and the subsequent war between the parties, have escalated the potential for further tension in the Middle East and added to uncertainty and volatility in energy prices.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nEnergy prices and predominantly oil and natural gas prices are the primary drivers of Equinor's business results, financial condition and liquidity, and its ability to finance planned capital expenditures. A significant or prolonged period of low prices could lead to changes in production, impairment of assets or reassessment of the viability of projects under development and future business opportunities.\n\nIncreases in prices can lead to increased taxes, cost inflation or higher access costs for Equinor.\n\nFluctuating foreign exchange rates, especially between USD, EUR, GBP and NOK, can have a significant impact on Equinor's operational and financial results. A large percentage of Equinor's revenues and cash receipts are denominated in or driven by USD, sales of gas and refined products are mainly denominated in EUR and GBP, while a large portion of operating expenses, capital expenditures and income taxes payable accrue in NOK. The majority of Equinor's long-term debt has USD exposure. See also the description of market risk (including commodity price risk and currency risk) in note 4 Financial risk and capital management in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nSuch risks could have a material adverse e/ffect on Equinor's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nK\u00e5rst\u00f8\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reliability of resource estimates depends on the quality and quantity of Equinor's geological, technical and economic data together with extensive engineering judgements. Substantial upward or downward revisions in Equinor's resources outlook may be required should additional information become available after the initial estimates were prepared. A substantial downward revision could potentially lead to impairments.\n\nEquinor's future oil and gas resource base depends on the company's timely success in accessing, acquiring, and developing attractive opportunities. If unsuccessful, future production will decline and future revenue will be reduced. Equinor's access to resources is impacted by the choices of governments and, outside of Norway, national oil and gas companies. Changes in fiscal terms and fluctuations in oil and gas prices will have a direct impact on Equinor's resource base. Proved oil and gas reserves are estimated based on the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements and may di/ffer substantially from Equinor's view on expected reserves and contingent resources.\n\nEquinor's ability to build material renewable and low-carbon business portfolios depends on access to attractive opportunities where the right commercial terms are key. Future conditions, along with risks and uncertainties in power, hydrogen and carbon markets as well as internal factors, will influence our ability to achieve our ambitions relating to renewable energy resources and low-carbon business.\n\nSuch risks could have a material adverse e/ffect on Equinor's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Strategic and commercial risks\n\n## Climate change and transition to a lower carbon economy\n\nPolicy, legal, regulatory, market and technology developments, including stakeholder sentiment, related to the issue of climate change, can a/ffect our business plans and financial performance.\n\nShifts in stakeholder focus between energy security, a/ffordability and sustainability add uncertainty to delivery and outcomes associated with Equinor's strategy.\n\nStricter climate laws, regulations, and policies as well as adverse litigation outcomes could adversely impact Equinor's financial results and outlook, including the value of its assets. This might be directly (through regulatory changes towards energy systems free of unabated fossil fuels, changes in taxation, increased costs or access to opportunities) or indirectly (through changes in consumer behaviour or technology developments).\n\nEquinor expects greenhouse gas emission costs to increase from current levels and to have a wider geographical range than today. Equinor applies a default minimum carbon price in investment analysis starting at USD 82 per tonne in 2025, increasing towards USD 115 per tonne by 2030. In countries where the actual or predicted carbon price is higher than our default at any point in time, Equinor applies the actual or expected cost, such as in Norway where both a CO\u2082 tax and the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS) apply. A higher carbon price provides an incentive to reduce emissions and increase investment in new low-carbon solutions and technology.\n\nChanging demand for renewable energy and low-carbon technologies, and innovation and technology changes supporting their cost-competitive development, represent both threats and opportunities for Equinor.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nMarket development and our ability to reduce costs and capitalise on technology improvements are important but unpredictable risk factors. Multiple factors in the energy transition contribute to uncertainty in future energy price assumptions, and changes in investor and societal sentiment can a/ffect our access to capital markets, attractiveness for investors, and potentially restrict access to finance or increase financing costs.\n\nStrong competition for assets, changing levels of policy support, and di/fferent commercial/contractual models may lead to diminishing returns within the renewable and low-carbon industries and hinder Equinor ambitions. These investments may be exposed to interest rate risk and inflation risk.\n\nEquinor's net-zero strategy and climate-related ambitions are responses to challenges and opportunities in the energy transition. There is no assurance that these ambitions will be achieved or that all stakeholders will accept our approach or methods to set, measure or reach our ambitions. Successful strategy execution depends on development of new technologies, new value chains, societal shifts in consumer demand, as well as firm leadership from policy makers. Should societal demands, technological innovation and policy support from governments not shift in parallel with Equinor's pursuit of significant greenhouse gas emission reductions and energy transition investments, our business plans and financial performance may be adversely a/ffected and Equinor may be unable to fulfil its net-zero strategy and/or meet its climate-related ambitions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## International politics and geopolitical change\n\nPolitical, economic, and social developments or instability in regions where Equinor has interests and may seek future opportunities could adversely a/ffect Equinor's business causing financial loss.\n\nPolitical instability, civil strife, strikes, insurrections, acts of terrorism, acts of war, sanctions and trade disputes, public health situations (including pandemics such as Covid-19), adverse and hostile actions against Equinor's sta/ff, its facilities, its transportation systems and its digital infrastructure (cyberattacks) may disrupt or curtail Equinor's operations and business opportunities. These may in turn lead to a decline in production and otherwise adversely a/ffect Equinor's business, operations, results and financial condition. Similarly, Equinor's response to such situations could lead to claims from partners and relevant stakeholders, litigation, and litigationrelated costs.\n\nEquinor exited all projects in Russia in 2022. The European security situation will continue to impact our business environment volatility, uncertainty, and complexity for the foreseeable future, including through impacts related to oil and gas supply and demand, policy response, supply chains and security. The situation in the Middle East remains volatile with potential energy market implications.",

Cyber disruption may arise from factors such as unauthorised access, usage or attacks, computer viruses, errors or wrongdoing by employees or others who have gained access to Equinor's or any connected networks and systems, as well as threats to our assets from insiders who exploit, or intend to exploit, their legitimate access to Equinor's facilities or networks for unauthorised purposes. Risks related to cyber disruption may also be impacted by increasing artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nDigital and cyber-disruption, whether in respect of Equinor's systems and networks or those of third parties on which Equinor relies, could result in delayed activities, loss of production, loss of sensitive or personal information, misuse of information or systems, as well as safety and environmental losses as a result of damage to our physical assets caused by such disruption, and the company could face associated regulatory actions, legal liability, reputational damage and loss of revenue. Equinor could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to avoid, limit or remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems, which in turn could a/ffect our financial performance.\n\nSee also section 2.2 Safe and secure operations - Performance disclosure - Security incidents.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Project delivery and operations\n\nUncertainties in development projects and production operations in the Equinor portfolio could prevent Equinor from realising profits and cause substantial losses.\n\nOil and gas, renewable, low-carbon and other projects or assets may be curtailed, delayed, cancelled or suspended for many reasons. Situations such as equipment shortages or failures, natural hazards, unexpected drilling conditions or reservoir characteristics, irregularities in geological formations, challenging soil conditions, accidents, mechanical and technical di/fficulties, power cost and availability, protestor actions, health issues (including pandemics such as Covid-19), new technology implementation and quality issues might have significant impact. The risk is higher in new and challenging areas such as deep waters or other harsh environments, and in new value chains. Cost inflation in capital and operational expenditures can negatively a/ffect project deliveries, results from operations and longer-term financial outcomes.\n\nEquinor's portfolio of development projects includes a high number of major development-projects as well as 'first-o/ff' projects (i.e. involving new development concepts, operating regions, execution models, partners/contractors, value chains and markets) that increase portfolio complexity and potentially execution risk.\n\nEquinor's ability to commercially exploit energy resources and carbon products depends, among other factors, on the availability of adequate capacity of transportation and/or transmission infrastructure to markets at a commercially viable price. Equinor may be unsuccessful in its e/fforts to secure commercially viable transportation, transmission, and markets for all its potential production in a cost-e/fficient manner or at all, which in turn could a/ffect our operational and financial performance.",

If operators, partners, or contractors fail to fulfil their responsibilities, Equinor can be exposed to financial, operational, safety, security, and compliance risks as well as reputational risks and risks related to ethics, integrity and sustainability.\n\nEquinor is also exposed to enforcement actions by regulators or claimants in the event of an incident in an operation where it does not exercise operational control. Operators, partners. and contractors may be unable or unwilling to compensate Equinor for costs incurred on their behalf or on behalf of the relevant arrangement.\n\nSuch risks could impact Equinor's operational and financial performance, the implementation of its strategy, our reputation and the value of our securities.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Competition and technological innovation\n\nIf competitors move faster or in other directions related to the development and deployment of new technologies and products, Equinor's financial performance and ability to deliver on our strategy may be adversely a/ffected.\n\nEquinor could be adversely a/ffected if we do not remain commercially and technologically competitive to e/fficiently develop and operate an attractive portfolio of assets, to obtain access to new opportunities, and to keep pace with deployment of new technologies and products that can impact our transition to a broad energy company.\n\nEquinor's financial performance may be negatively impacted by competition from players with stronger financial resources or with increased agility and flexibility, and from an increasing number of companies applying new business models.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ownership and actions by the Norwegian State\n\nThe interests of Equinor's majority shareholder, the Norwegian State, may not always be aligned with the interests of Equinor's other shareholders. A change in the Norwegian State's ownership policy or in the manner in which the Norwegian State exercises its ownership can impact Equinor's ability to execute its strategy and deliver on its ambitions or impact Equinor's financial performance.\n\nThe Norwegian State, as our majority shareholder with 67% ownership as of 31 December 2023, has the power to influence the outcome of any vote of shareholders, including amendments to Equinor's articles of association (which require the support of two-thirds of the votes cast at the general meeting) and the election of all non-employee members of the corporate assembly (which requires a majority of the votes cast). Factors influencing the voting of the Norwegian State could be di/fferent from the interests of the other shareholders.\n\nThe Norwegian State has resolved that its shares in Equinor and the State's Direct Financial Interests in NCS licenses must be managed in accordance with a coordinated ownership strategy for the Norwegian State's oil and gas interests. Under this strategy, the Norwegian State has required Equinor to market the Norwegian State's oil and gas together with Equinor's own oil and gas as a single economic unit and to take account of the Norwegian State's interests in all decisions that may a/ffect the marketing of these resources. If the Norwegian State's coordinated ownership strategy is not adequately implemented, then Equinor's mandate to sell the Norwegian State's oil and gas together with its own oil and gas is likely to be prejudiced which could have an adverse e/ffect on Equinor's position in the markets in which it operates 16 .\n\nAny change to the manner in which the Norwegian State exercises its ownership of Equinor could influence Equinor's ability to execute its strategy and deliver on its ambitions and could therefore have an adverse e/ffect on our financial performance.",

Such changes could constrain our plans, cause operational delays, increase costs of regulatory compliance, increase litigation risk, impact the sale of our products, require us to divest or curtail operations, limit access to new opportunities, and a/ffect provisions for pension, tax, and legal liabilities.\n\nMoreover, if a country in which Equinor operates changes its laws, regulations, policies, or practices relating to energy or the oil and gas industry, including in response to environmental, social or governance concerns, Equinor's national and/or international exploration, development and production activities, and the results of its operations, could be a/ffected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of the countries in which Equinor operates could have a material adverse e/ffect on liquidity and the results of operations.\n\nEquinor's exploration and production activities undertaken together with national oil companies are subject to a significant degree of state control. In recent years, governments and national oil companies have in some regions exercised greater authority and imposed more stringent conditions on energy companies. Intervention by\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\ngovernments could take a variety of forms, such as nationalisation, expropriation, cancellation, non-renewal, restriction or renegotiation of our interests, assets, and related rights. Equinor could be subject to the imposition of new contractual obligations, price and exchange controls, tax or royalty increases, payment delays, and currency and capital transfer restrictions.\n\nEquinor's US operations use hydraulic fracturing, which is subject to a range of federal, state, and local laws. Various US states and local governments have implemented, or are considering, changes to regulations or increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing that could adversely a/ffect Equinor's US onshore business and the demand for its fracturing services.\n\nThe ongoing maturation of the regulatory framework and permitting requirements for low-carbon value chains in various countries can also impact financial outcomes from Equinor's investment in related technologies, opportunities, and projects.\n\nEquinor incurs, and expects to continue to incur, substantial capital, operating, maintenance and remediation costs relating to compliance with increasingly complex laws, regulations and obligations related to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, as well as in response to concerns relating to climate change. Such occurrences could have a materially adverse e/ffect on Equinor's operations and opportunities, liquidity, and financial performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial risks, liquidity and capital management\n\nEquinor's business is exposed to liquidity, interest rate, equity and credit risks that could adversely a/ffect the results of Equinor's operations, our financial position and ability to operate, as described in note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Trading and commercial supply activities\n\nEquinor's trading and commercial supply activities in the commodity markets can lead to financial losses.\n\nEquinor uses financial instruments such as futures, options, over-thecounter (OTC) forward contracts, market swaps and contracts for di/fferences related to crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas and electricity to manage price di/fferences and volatility. Trading activities involve elements of forecasting, and Equinor bears the risk of market movements, the risk of losses if prices develop contrary to expectations, and the risk of default by counterparties.\n\nThere is a risk that an individual or group of traders acting for or on behalf of Equinor could act outside of their respective mandates which could therefore result in financial loss, fines, or loss of licence to operate, including permissions to trade. Should such risks materialise, they may adversely a/ffect the Group's financial results and performance.",

A crisis or disruption might occur as a result of a security or cybersecurity incident or if a risk described under Security, safety and environmental risks materialises.\n\nEquinor maintains insurance coverage that includes physical damage to its properties, third-party liability, workers' compensation and employers' liability, general liability, sudden pollution, and other cover. Equinor's insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery and is subject to caps, exclusions, and limitations. There is no assurance that such cover will adequately protect Equinor against liability from all potential consequences and damages as illustrated by the financial loss for the group related to the fire at Hammerfest LNG in 2020.\n\nThe Equinor group retains parts of its insurable risks in a wholly owned captive insurance company, so insurance recovery outside of the Equinor group may be limited.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Continuation, resurgence or emergence of a pandemic, could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this report and materially impact Equinor's operations and financial condition.\n\nThese risk factors could result in disruptions of our operations and could, among other things, lead to blowouts, structural collapses, loss of containment of hydrocarbons or other hazardous materials, fires, explosions and water contamination that cause harm to people, loss of life or environmental damage. All modes of transportation of hydrocarbons are susceptible to a loss of containment of hydrocarbons and other hazardous materials and represent a significant risk to people and the environment. Equinor could also be subject to civil and/or criminal liability and the possibility of incurring substantial costs, including for remediation if any such health, safety or environmental risk materialises.\n\nIt is not possible to guarantee that the management system or other policies and procedures will be able to identify or mitigate all aspects of health, safety and environmental risks or that all activities will be carried out in accordance with these systems.\n\n## Security breaches\n\nEquinor's personnel, assets, infrastructure, and operations may be subject to hostile or malicious acts that disrupt our operations, cause loss of data, harm to people or the environment, and a/ffect Equinor's financial performance.\n\nSecurity threats may arise from terrorism, crime, acts of sabotage, armed conflict, civil unrest, maritime crime, insiders and social engineering or illegal or unsafe activism. A changing geopolitical, political, technological and social context makes these factors increasingly unpredictable.\n\nManagement of security risks, and the application of national security laws or policies, can incur significant costs, restrict our ability to do business in a particular jurisdiction and limit operations, including our supply chains and the supply of our products. Failure to avoid security breaches can disrupt Equinor operations, cause loss, misuse or manipulation of data, harm to our people, assets, or the environment, result in fines or liabilities and impact our reputation and future business, all of which may a/ffect Equinor's financial performance.

Reviews performed by financial supervisory authorities could result in changes to previously published financial statements and future accounting practices. In addition, failure of external reporting to report data accurately and in compliance with applicable standards could result in regulatory action, legal liability, and damage to Equinor's reputation.\n\nAudits of financial statements could identify material weaknesses or deficiencies in Equinor's internal control over financial reporting and cause loss of investor confidence that can potentially impact the share price.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business integrity and ethical misconduct\n\nNon-compliance with anti-corruption and bribery laws, anti-money laundering laws, competition and antitrust laws, sanctions and trade restrictions or other applicable laws, or failure to meet Equinor's ethical requirements, could expose Equinor to legal liability, lead to a loss of business, loss of access to capital and damage our reputation and social licence to operate.\n\nEquinor is subject to anti-corruption and bribery laws and anti-money laundering laws in multiple jurisdictions, including the Norwegian Penal code, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. A violation of such applicable laws could expose Equinor to investigations from multiple authorities and may lead to criminal and/or civil liability with substantial fines. Incidents of noncompliance with applicable anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations and the Equinor Code of Conduct could be damaging to Equinor's reputation, competitive position, and shareholder value.

Sanctions and trade restrictions are complex, unpredictable and are often implemented at short notice. While Equinor remains committed to comply with sanctions and trade restrictions and takes steps to ensure, to the extent possible, compliance therewith, there can be no assurance that an Equinor entity, o/fficer, director, employee, or agent is not in violation of such sanctions and trade restrictions. Any such violation, even if minor in monetary terms, could result in substantial civil and/or criminal penalties and could materially adversely a/ffect Equinor's business and results of operations or financial condition.\n\nEquinor is subject to competition and antitrust laws in multiple jurisdictions, including the Norwegian Competition Act, the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union and the Unites States' Sherman Act, Clayton Act, HSR Act and Federal Trade Commission Act.

A large proportion of Equinor's environmentally sustainable activities are conducted through equity accounted investments and therefore are not evaluated in the mandatory key performance indicator (KPI) disclosure. To provide more holistic information of the environmentally sustainability activities of Equinor, a voluntary disclosure including the capex KPI for eligible and aligned equity accounted investments has been included below. These activities are conducted through both operated and non-operated joint ventures mainly outside the EU jurisdiction.\n\nBased on the stage of development of the projects, operational activity is limited.

Net income/(loss) from equity accounted investments and other income (i.e. gain on divestment of assets) are excluded from the definition of the mandatory KPI, and not part of the turnover denominator. For Equinor the KPI denominator related to turnover will be highly impacted by changes in commodity prices.\n\nThe denominators are calculated based on reported IFRS Accounting Standards numbers in the Consolidated financial statements. For Equinor this has the e/ffect that the proceeds from the sale of the Norwegian State's (SDFI) oil production on the NCS, that Equinor markets and sells on their behalf (see\n\nnote 27 Related Parties to the Consolidated financial statements), that is reported on gross basis and recognised as revenue in the income statement, will have a negative impact on the reported KPI related to taxonomy-eligible and aligned turnover. Total purchases of oil and natural gas liquids from the Norwegian state amounted to USD 10 billion in 2023 and USD 13 billion in 2022.\n\n## Appendix 2: Reconciliation to Share of gross capex to REN and LCS\n\nThe di/fference between the mandatory 9% capex KPI as defined within the EU Taxonomy and the 20% REN / LCS Gross capex* is mainly related to eligible activity in equity accounted investments which is included within the voluntary EU taxonomy KPI. In addition, additions to right-of-use asset (leasing) are excluded and additions to goodwill are included in the REN / LCS Gross capex* which di/ffers in treatment to the EU taxonomy KPI.\n\n| (in USD million)                                                | Note   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Additions to PP&E, intangibles and equity accounted investments | 5      | 14,500 | 9,994  |\n| Less:                                                           |        |        |        |\n| Additions to Equity accounted investments                       | 15     | (926)  | (337)  |\n| Goodwill additions through business acquisition                 | 13     | (348)  | -      |\n| Goodwill additions                                              | 13     | (9)    | (36)   |\n| Capex denominator as defined by the EU Taxonomy                 |        | 13,217 | 9,621  |\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Capex\n\nTotal capital expenditures consist of additions to property, plant and equipment including right of use assets line item as specified in note 12 Property, plant and equipment and additions to intangible assets as specified in note 13 Intangible assets to the Consolidated financial statements. Additions excludes additions and subsequent changes in estimated asset retirement obligations based on policy interpretation of the delegated act. Capitalised exploration and acquisition costs of oil and gas prospects related to exploration are recognised as intangible assets, and by interpretation of the Taxonomy regulation, considered to be included the KPI denominator, as this is a part of Equinor's ongoing activity (see assessment below). Goodwill acquired through business combinations is excluded from the capital expenditure KPI.\n\n## Opex\n\nTotal operating expenditures under the Taxonomy cover direct non-capitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term lease, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment that are necessary to ensure the continued and e/ffective functioning of such assets.\n\nOther direct expenditures relating to the dayto-day servicing of assets of property includes direct maintenance-related expenses. Operating expenditures consist of a subset of the operating expenditures in the income statement and does not include any selling, general and administrative expenditures, depreciation, amortisation, impairment, and exploration expenses.\n\nThe definition of the capex KPI includes intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38. Acquired goodwill and capitalised costs according to the successful e/fforts method under IFRS 6 is out of the scope of IAS 38. The rationale for excluding IFRS 6 from the capex KPI is not clearly stated in the Taxonomy regulation. Equinor regards exploration activities as part of the ongoing core activities and has included capitalised exploration costs in the capex denominator. The exploration costs are not covered by the EU Taxonomy opex definition and not included in the opex KPI. Capitalised exploration expenditures do not have significant e/ffect on the reported capex KPIs for the year-end 2023.",

The report should be read in conjunction with the GRI index available at equinor.com, to get an overview of the full extent of the report. We view this report to be our Communication on Progress to the UN Global Compact (advanced reporting level). We also use reporting guidance from Ipieca, the global oil and gas industry association for advancing environmental and social performance across the energy transition, and recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. This year's report has also been informed by the European Sustainability Reporting Standard as a first step towards compliance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Assurance\n\nWe recognise that the quality of our reported sustainability data can be a/ffected by inherent limitations in accuracy in raw data, calculation and estimation procedures including assumptions for such purposes, and in manual transfer of data. We strive to achieve data quality in line with expectations set out in GRI 1 Foundation 2021 and continue our work to improve internal reporting and control processes in line with the COSO framework for internal control. These processes are laid out in our internal performance framework. Examples of our internal assurance mechanisms are independent internal audits and verifications, quarterly reviews of the data at business area and corporate level, and an annual process where all reported sustainability data are reviewed by named individuals and their relevant leaders confirm, in documented form, that quality assurance has been performed. This report has been externally assured by EY, with reasonable level of assurance for selected climate, environment and safety indicators, and a limited level of assurance for the rest of the report, excluding forward looking information and field-specific reporting. The independent assurance statement, as listed in appendix, concludes that the report is presented in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We strive to be consistent and transparent about variations in boundaries and provide a complete report in line with industry practice.\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental data is, unless otherwise stated, reported on a 100% basis for our operated assets, facilities and vessels, including subsidiaries and operations where we are the technical service provider, for contracted drilling rigs and flotels ('operational control basis'), and for service operations vessels (SOV) and crew transfer vessels (CTV) during operations in REN.\n- \u00b7 Scope 1 CO\u2082 emissions and upstream CO\u2082 intensity are reported both on an operational control basis and on equity basis (financial ownership interest).\n- \u00b7 Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are reported on the basis of equity (products sold). Maritime emissions are reported from maritime vessels under Equinor contract, including project and supply vessels, drilling rigs, and tankers transporting both Equinor and third-party volumes.\n- \u00b7 Scope 3 emissions related to business travel is for Equinor employees only.\n\n## Restatements\n\nHistoric numbers are sometimes adjusted due to for example changes in reporting principles, changes of calculation factors used by authorities, or re-classification of incidents after investigations. We restate historic numbers and explain the\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Health and safety incident data is reported for our operated assets, facilities and vessels, including subsidiaries and operations where we are the technical service provider. These include contracted drilling rigs, flotels, vessels, projects and modifications, and transportation of personnel and products, using a risk-based approach.\n- \u00b7 Economic and energy production data are reported on an equity basis, unless otherwise stated.\n- \u00b7 Workforce data covers employees in our direct employment. Temporary employees are not included.\n- \u00b7 Human rights data is collected from operated and nonoperated assets including from our supply chain.\n\nOperations acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the period in which we owned them, unless otherwise stated. Entities that we do not control, but have significant influence over, are included in the form of disclosures of management approach. The report does not include data from equity interest fields/projects, such as joint ventures, where we are not operator. Exceptions are for climate data or where specified.\n\nchanges if the adjustment represents a change of minimum 5% for indicators with reasonable level of assurance, and 10% for indicators with limited level of assurance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements.\n\n## Impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements\n\n## Basis for the key audit matter\n\nAs described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the e/ffects of the initiatives to limit climate change and the potential impact of the energy transition are relevant to some of the economic assumptions in the Company's estimation of future cash flows. Climate considerations are included directly in the impairment assessments by estimating the carbon costs in the cash flows, and indirectly as the expected e/ffects of the climate change are included in the estimated commodity prices. As also described in Note 3, commodity price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing are based on management's best estimate, which di/ffers from the price-set required to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement as described in the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook's Announced Pledges Scenario, or the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario.\n\nThe impact of the energy transition and potential restrictions by regulators, market and strategic considerations may also have an e/ffect on the estimated production profiles and the economic lifetime of the Company's assets and projects. In addition, if the Company's business cases for the oil and gas producing assets in the future should change materially due to governmental initiatives to limit climate change, it could a/ffect the timing of cessation of the assets and the asset retirement obligations (ARO).\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements is complex and involves a high degree of judgement. Significant assumptions used in such estimate are commodity prices and carbon costs.\n\nWe consider the impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements to be a key audit matter given the significance of this matter and the complexity and uncertainty in the estimates and assumptions used by management.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the Company's process for evaluating the impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements. This included testing controls over management's review of the significant assumptions commodity prices and carbon costs.\n\nWith the involvement of climate change and sustainability specialists, we evaluated management's assessment of the impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements. Our audit procedures among other comprised the following:\n\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's methodology to factor climate-related matters into their determination of future commodity price assumptions and compared those with external benchmarks\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's methodology to determine future carbon costs and compared those with the current legislation in place in the relevant jurisdictions and the jurisdictions' announced pledges regarding escalation of carbon costs\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's sensitivity analyses over its future commodity prices and carbon cost assumptions by taking into consideration, among other sources, the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario and Announced Pledges Scenario estimated by the International Energy Agency (IEA)\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's sensitivity analyses over the e/ffect of performing removal five years earlier than currently scheduled due to potential governmental initiatives to limit climate change\n- \u00b7 We have also evaluated management's disclosures related to the consequences of initiatives to limit climate change, including the e/ffects of the Company's climate change strategy on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the energy transition's e/ffects on estimation uncertainty, discussed in more detail in Notes 3, 14 and 23",

Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the related disclosures. As described in Note 14, determining the recoverable amount of an asset involves an estimate of future cash flows, which is dependent upon management's best estimate of the economic conditions that will exist over the asset's useful life. The asset's operational performance and external factors have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows and therefore, the recoverable amount of the asset.\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the recoverable amount of production plants and oil and gas assets is complex and involves a high degree of judgement. Significant assumptions used in forecasting future cash flows are future commodity prices, currency exchange rates, expected reserves, capital expenditures, and the discount rate.\n\nThese significant assumptions are forward-looking and can be a/ffected by future economic and market conditions, including matters related to climate change and energy transition. For more detail, please refer to the key audit matter related to the Impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements.\n\nAdditionally, the treatment of tax in the estimation of the recoverable amount is challenging, as the Company is subject to di/fferent tax structures that are inherently complex, particularly in Norway.\n\nWe consider the determination of the recoverable amounts of production plants and oil and gas assets including assets under development to be a key audit matter given the significance of the accounts on the balance sheet and the complexity and uncertainty of the estimates and assumptions used by management in the cash flow models.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating e/ffectiveness of controls over the Company's process for evaluating the recoverability of production plants and oil and gas assets including assets under development. This included testing controls over management's review of assumptions and inputs to the assessments of impairment and impairment reversals.\n\nOur audit procedures performed over the significant assumptions and inputs included, among others, evaluation of the methods and models used in the calculation of the recoverable amount. We also evaluated the relevant tax e/ffects based on the local legislation of the relevant jurisdictions, particularly in Norway, and tested the clerical accuracy of the models through independently recalculating the value in use. We involved valuation specialists to assist us with these procedures. In addition, we compared projected capital expenditures to approved operator budgets or management forecasts. For those assets previously impaired, we compared actual results to the forecasts used in historical impairment analyses. We also compared expected reserve volumes with internal production forecasts and external evaluations of expected reserves and we compared the historical production with management's previous production forecasts, with the involvement of our reserves specialists.\n\nTo test price assumptions, we evaluated management's methodology to determine future commodity prices and compared such assumptions to external benchmarks, among other procedures. We involved valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the Company's assessment of currency exchange rates and the discount rate, by assessing the Company's methodologies and key assumptions used to calculate the rates and by comparing those rates with external information.\n\nWe also evaluated management's methodology to factor climate-related matters into their determination of future commodity prices and carbon cost assumptions.

Refer to Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the related disclosures. As described in Note 23, the appropriate estimates for such obligations are based on historical knowledge combined with knowledge of ongoing technological developments, expectations about future regulatory and technological development and involve the application of judgement and an inherent risk of significant adjustments. The estimated costs of decommissioning and removal activities require revisions due to changes in current regulations and technology while considering relevant risks and uncertainties.\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the decommissioning and removal of o/ffshore installations at the end of the production period is complex and involves a high degree of judgement. Determining the provision for such obligations involves application of considerable judgement related to the assumptions used in the estimate, the inherent complexity and uncertainty in estimating future costs, and the limited historical experience against which to benchmark estimates of future costs. Significant assumptions used in the estimate are the discount rates and the expected future costs, which include the underlying assumptions norms and rates, and time required to decommission and can vary considerably depending on the expected removal complexity.\n\nThese significant assumptions are forward-looking and can be a/ffected by future economic and market conditions, including matters related to climate change and energy transition. For more detail, please refer to the key audit matter related to the Impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements.\n\nWe consider the estimation of the asset retirement obligations to be a key audit matter given the significance of the accounts on the balance sheet and the complexity and uncertainty of the assumptions used in the estimate.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating e/ffectiveness of controls over the Company's process to calculate the present value of the estimated future decommissioning and removal expenditures determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. This included testing controls over management's review of assumptions described above, used in the calculation of the ARO.\n\nTo test management's estimation of the provision for decommissioning and removal activities, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the completeness of the provision by comparing significant additions to property, plant and equipment to management's assessment of new ARO obligations recognized in the period.\n\nTo assess the expected future costs, among other procedures, we compared day rates for rigs, marine operations and heavy lift vessels to external market data or existing contracts. For time required to decommission, we compared the assumptions against historical data. We compared discount rates to external market data. With the support of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the methodology and models used by management to estimate the ARO and performed a sensitivity analysis on the significant assumptions. In addition, we recalculated the formulas in the models.\n\nWe also evaluated management's methodology to factor climate-related matters into their determination of the timing of cessation of the assets and the asset retirement obligations.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Company's and the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain su/fficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the board of directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the board of directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

The Criteria can be accessed at globalreporting.org and in Equinor's GRI-index and are available to the public. Such Criteria were specifically designed for companies and other organizations that want to report their sustainability impacts in a consistent and credible way. As a result, the information may not be suitable for another purpose.\n\n## Equinor ASA's responsibilities\n\nThe Board of Directors and management are responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for presenting the Subject Matters in accordance with the Criteria, in all material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the Subject Matters, such that they are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## EY's responsibilities - limited assurance engagement\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the presentation of the Subject Matter for limited assurance based on the evidence we have obtained.\n\nWe conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ('ISAE 3000 (Revised)'). This standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Subject Matter for limited assurance is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nWe believe that the evidence obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusions.\n\n## EY's responsibilities - reasonable assurance engagement\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the presentation of the Subject Matter for reasonable assurance based on the evidence we have obtained.\n\nWe conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ('i 3000 (Revised)'). This standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Subject Matter for reasonable assurance is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the evidence obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion.\n\n## Our Independence and quality control\n\nWe are independent of the Company and the Group in accordance with the requirements of the relevant laws and regulations in Norway and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nEY also applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services engagements, which requires that we design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Description of procedures performed\n\nThis engagement is designed to express a) limited assurance on the Subject Matter for limited assurance and b) reasonable assurance on the Subject Matter for reasonable assurance.\n\nGHGs are quantified when preparing the Subject Matters. The quantification process used in preparing the reporting is subject to scientific uncertainty, which arises because of incomplete scientific knowledge about the measurement of GHGs, including CO\u2082 and CH 4 . Additionally, GHG emissions are subject to estimation and measurement uncertainty resulting from the calculation process used to quantify emissions within the bounds of existing scientific knowledge. Our verification of these disclosures relates to the criteria for estimation set by local authorities.",

Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained if a reasonable assurance engagement had been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nAlthough we considered the e/ffectiveness of management's internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.\n\nA limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing the Subject Matter for limited assurance and related information and applying analytical and other appropriate procedures.\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Interviews with key personnel to understand the reporting process for collecting information, collating and reporting the Subject Matter during the reporting period\n- \u00b7 Tested on a sample basis the calculation Criteria against the methodologies outlined in the Criteria\n- \u00b7 Analyses of Subject Matter data\n- \u00b7 Comparison, on a sample basis, of Subject Matter data against supporting documentation\n- \u00b7 Comparison of the presentation of the Subject Matter with the presentation requirements outlined in the Criteria.

The following financial measures may be considered non-GAAP financial measures:\n\n- a) Net debt to capital employed ratio, Net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted, including lease liabilities and Net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted\n- b) Return on average capital employed (ROACE)\n- c) Organic capital expenditures\n- d) Gross capital expenditures (Gross capex)\n- e) Cash flow from operations after taxes paid (CFFO after taxes paid)\n- f) Net cash flow (previously named Free cash flow)\n- g) Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## a) Net debt to capital employed ratio\n\nIn Equinor's view, net debt ratios provide a more informative picture of Equinor's financial strength than gross interest-bearing financial debt.\n\nThree di/fferent net debt to capital ratios are provided below: 1) net debt to capital employed, 2) net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted, including lease liabilities, and 3) net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted.\n\nThese calculations are all based on Equinor's gross interest-bearing financial liabilities as recorded in the Consolidated balance sheet and exclude cash, cash equivalents and current financial investments.\n\nThe following adjustments are made in calculating the net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted, including lease liabilities and the net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted: collateral deposits (classified as Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated balance sheet), and financial investments held in Equinor Insurance AS (classified as Current financial investments\n\nin the Consolidated balance sheet) are treated as non-cash and excluded from the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. Collateral deposits are excluded since they relate to certain requirements of exchanges where Equinor's securities are trading and therefore are presented as restricted cash and cash equivalents. Financial investments in Equinor Insurance are excluded as these investments are not readily available for the group to meet short term commitments. These adjustments result in a higher net debt figure and in Equinor's view provides a more prudent measure of the net debt to capital employed ratio than would be the case without such exclusions.\n\nAdditionally, lease liabilities are further excluded in calculating the net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted.\n\nThe accompanying table details the calculations for these non-GAAP measures and reconciles them with the most directly comparable IFRS Accounting Standards financial measure or measures.",

The calculation of Adjusted earnings was changed in 2023, as detailed below.\n\nAdjusted earnings after tax equals the sum of net operating income/(loss) less income tax in reporting segments and includes adjustments to operating income to take the applicable marginal tax into consideration. Adjusted earnings after tax excludes\n\nnet financial items and the associated tax e/ffects on net financial items. It is based on adjusted earnings less the tax e/ffects on all elements included in adjusted earnings (or calculated tax on operating income and on each of the adjusting items using an estimated marginal tax rate). In addition, tax e/ffects related to tax exposure items not related to the individual reporting period are excluded from adjusted earnings after tax. Management believes adjusted earnings after tax provides an indication of Equinor's underlying operational performance and facilitates comparisons of operational trends between periods as it reflects the tax charge associated with operational performance excluding the impact of financing. Certain net USD denominated financial positions are held by group companies that have a USD functional currency that is di/fferent from the currency in which the taxable income is measured. As currency exchange rates change between periods, the basis for measuring net financial",

        "page_content": "items for IFRS Accounting Standards will change disproportionally with taxable income which includes exchange gains and losses from translating the net USD denominated financial positions into the currency of the applicable tax return. Therefore, the e/ffective tax rate may be significantly higher or lower than the statutory tax rate for any given period. Adjusted taxes included in adjusted earnings after tax should not be considered indicative of the amount of current or total tax expense (or taxes payable) for the period.\n\nAdjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax are supplementary measures and should not be viewed in isolation or as substitutes for net operating income/ (loss) and net income/(loss), which are the most directly comparable IFRS Accounting Standards measures. There are material limitations associated with the use of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax compared with the IFRS Accounting Standards measures as these non-GAAP measures do not include all the items of revenues/gains or expenses/losses of Equinor that are needed to evaluate its profitability on an overall basis. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax are only intended to be indicative of the underlying developments in trends of our ongoing operations for the production, manufacturing and marketing of our products and exclude pre- and post-tax impacts of net financial items. Equinor reflects such underlying developments in our operations by eliminating the e/ffects of certain items that may not be directly associated with the period's operations or financing. However, for that reason, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax are not complete measures of profitability and should therefore not be used in isolation.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n|              |          |          | GROUP       | REPORTING SEGMENT   | FINANCIAL   | ADDITIONAL   |\n|--------------|----------|----------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| INTRODUCTION | CONTENTS | ABOUT US | PERFORMANCE | PERFORMANCE         | STATEMENTS  | INFORMATION  |\n\n## Amended principles for Adjusted earnings with e/ffect from 2023:\n\nEquinor has made the following changes to the items adjusted for within Adjusted earnings:\n\n- \u00b7 With e/ffect from 2023, movements in the fair value of commodity derivatives used to manage price risk exposure of future sale and purchase contracts are excluded from adjusted earnings and deferred until the time of the physical delivery. This change minimises the e/ffects of timing di/fferences and presents a measure more indicative of underlying economic performance.\n- \u00b7 With e/ffect from 2023, the principle used to adjust the valuation of commercial storages is based on the forward price at the expected realisation date. Prior to this amendment, the valuation adjustment was based on short-term forward prices which, for some storages, did not correspond to the forward price at the expected realisation date. This change brings the valuation principle in line with how the corresponding derivative contract used to manage price exposure is valued.\n\nThese changes have been applied retrospectively to the comparative figures. The majority of the impact is due to the revised treatment of commodity derivatives. These changes only a/ffect the MMP reporting segment and currently do not have an impact on other segments. Equinor deems that these changes lead to a better representation of performance in each period by appropriately reflecting the economic impact of its risk management activities.\n\nFor further information on Adjusted earnings, see note 28 Financial instruments and fair value measurement to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n| Impact of change                           | Full year of 2022   | Full year of 2022   | Full year of 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| MMP segment                                | As reported         | Impact              | Restated            |\n| Changes in fair value of derivatives       | (149)               | 1,801               | 1,651               |\n| Periodisation of inventory hedging e/ffect | (349)               | 181                 | (168)               |\n| Adjusted total revenues and other income   | 147,599             | 1,981               | 149,580             |\n| Adjusted earnings/(loss)                   | 2,253               | 1,981               | 4,234               |\n| Adjusted earnings/(loss) after tax         | 2,727               | (10)                | 2,717               |\n\n| Impact of change                           | Full year of 2022   | Full year of 2022   | Full year of 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Equinor group                              | As reported         | Impact              | Restated            |\n| Changes in fair value of derivatives       | (207)               | 1,801               | 1,593               |\n| Periodisation of inventory hedging e/ffect | (349)               | 181                 | (168)               |\n| Adjusted total revenues and other income   | 149,910             | 1,981               | 151,891             |\n| Adjusted earnings/(loss)                   | 74,940              | 1,981               | 76,921              |\n| Adjusted earnings/(loss) after tax         | 22,691              | (10)                | 22,680              |\n| E/ffective tax rates on adjusted earnings  | 69.7%               | 0.8%                | 70.5%               |\n\nNo other line items or segments were affected by the change.",

        "page_content": "Adjusted earnings adjust for the following items:\n\n- \u00b7 Changes in fair value of derivatives: In the ordinary course of business, Equinor enters into commodity derivative contracts to manage the price risk exposure relating to future sale and purchase contracts. These commodity derivatives are measured at fair value at each reporting date, with the movements in fair value recognised in the income statement. By contrast, the sale and purchase contracts are not recognised until the transaction occurs resulting in timing di/fferences. Therefore, with e/ffect from 2023, the unrealised movements in the fair value of these commodity derivative contracts are excluded from adjusted earnings and deferred until the time of the physical delivery to minimise the e/ffect of these timing di/fferences. Further, embedded derivatives within certain gas contracts and contingent consideration related to historical divestments are carried at fair value. Any accounting impacts resulting from such changes in fair value are also excluded from adjusted earnings, as these fluctuations are not indicative of the underlying performance of the business.\n- \u00b7 Periodisation of inventory hedging e/ffect: Equinor enters into derivative contracts to manage price risk exposure relating to its commercial storage. These derivative contracts are carried at fair value\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nwhile the inventories are accounted for at the lower of cost or market price. An adjustment is made to align the valuation principles of inventories with related derivative contracts. With e/ffect from 2023, the adjusted valuation of inventories is based on the forward price at the expected realisation date. This is so that the valuation principles between commercial storages and derivative contracts are better aligned.\n\n- \u00b7 Over/underlift: Over/underlift is accounted for using the sales method and therefore revenues are reflected in the period the product is sold rather than in the period it is produced. The over/underlift position depends on a number of factors related to our lifting programme and the way it corresponds to our entitlement share of production. The e/ffect on income for the period is therefore adjusted to show estimated revenues and associated costs based upon the production for the period to reflect operational performance.\n- \u00b7 The operational storage is not hedged and is not part of the trading portfolio. Cost of goods sold is measured based on the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method, and includes realised gains or losses that arise due to changes in market prices. These gains or losses will fluctuate from one period to another and are not considered part of the underlying operations for the period.\n\n- \u00b7 Impairment and reversal of impairment are excluded from adjusted earnings since they a/ffect the economics of an asset for the lifetime of that asset, not only the period in which it is impaired or the impairment is reversed. Impairment and reversal of impairment can impact both the exploration expenses and the depreciation, amortisation and net impairments line items.\n- \u00b7 Gain or loss from sales of assets is eliminated from the measure since the gain or loss does not give an indication of future performance or periodic performance; such a gain or loss is related to the cumulative value creation from the time the asset is acquired until it is sold.\n- \u00b7 Eliminations (internal unrealised profit on inventories): Volumes derived from equity oil inventory vary depending on several factors and inventory strategies, i.e. level of crude oil in inventory, equity oil used in the refining process and level of in-transit cargoes. Internal profit related to volumes sold between entities within the group and still in inventory at period end is eliminated according to IFRS Accounting Standards (write down to production cost). The proportion of realised versus unrealised gain fluctuates from one period to another due to inventory strategies and consequently impacts net operating income/(loss). Write down to production cost is not assessed to be\n- a part of the underlying operational performance, and elimination of internal profit related to equity volumes is excluded in adjusted earnings.\n- \u00b7 Other items of income and expense are adjusted when the impacts on income in the period are not reflective of Equinor's underlying operational performance in the reporting period. Such items may be unusual or infrequent transactions, but they may also include transactions that are significant which would not necessarily qualify as either unusual or infrequent. However, other items adjusted do not constitute normal, recurring income and operating expenses for the company. Other items are carefully assessed and can include transactions such as provisions related to reorganisation, early retirement, etc.\n- \u00b7 Change in accounting policy are adjusted when the impacts on income in the period are unusual or infrequent, and not reflective of Equinor's underlying operational performance in the reporting period.",

We use IEA/NVE/e-grid (location-based) and AIB (market-based) as sources of scope 2 emissions factors, expressed as kg CO\u2082/kWh. The locationbased calculation method reflects the emission intensity of grids, taking electricity trade adjustments into account. The market-based calculation method reflects emissions from electricity that companies have purposefully chosen (or their lack of choice). It derives emission factors from contracts between two parties for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation, or for unbundled attribute claims. (Source: Greenhouse gas protocol). When no such contracts are in place, residual mix emission factors are used.\n- \u00b7 Scope 3 GHG emissions - All GHG emissions that occur as a consequence of the operations of the organisation but are not directly controlled or owned by the company, such as use of sold products (equity basis). Emissions from use of sold products is calculated from IPCC emission factors, combined with IEA statistics on regional energy consumption.\n- \u00b7 Serious incident frequency (SIF) - The number of serious incidents (including near misses) per million hours worked. An incident is an event or chain of events that has caused or could have caused injury, illness and/or damage to/loss of property, the environment or a third party.

They reflect current views about future events, are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and are, by their nature, subject to significant risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to di/ffer materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including levels of industry product supply, demand and pricing, in particular in light of significant oil price volatility; unfavourable macroeconomic conditions and inflationary pressures; exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations; levels and calculations of reserves and material di/fferences from reserves estimates; regulatory stability and access to resources, including attractive low carbon opportunities; the e/ffects of climate change and changes in stakeholder sentiment and regulatory requirements regarding climate change; changes in market demand and supply for renewables; inability to meet strategic objectives; the development and use of new technology; social and/or political instability, including as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East; failure to prevent or manage digital and cyber disruptions to our information and operational technology systems and those of third parties on which we rely; operational problems, including cost inflation in capital\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n|              |          |          | GROUP       | REPORTING SEGMENT   | FINANCIAL   | ADDITIONAL   |\n|--------------|----------|----------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| INTRODUCTION | CONTENTS | ABOUT US | PERFORMANCE | PERFORMANCE         | STATEMENTS  | INFORMATION  |\n\nand operational expenditures; unsuccessful drilling; availability of adequate infrastructure at commercially viable prices; the actions of field partners and other third-parties; reputational damage; the actions of competitors; the actions of the Norwegian state as majority shareholder and exercise of ownership by the Norwegian state; changes or uncertainty in or noncompliance with laws and governmental regulations; adverse changes in tax regimes; the political and economic policies of Norway and other oil-producing countries; regulations on hydraulic fracturing and low-carbon value chains; liquidity, interest rate, equity and credit risks; risk of losses relating to trading and commercial supply activities; an inability to attract and retain personnel; ine/ffectiveness of crisis management systems; inadequate insurance coverage; health, safety and environmental risks; physical security risks to personnel, assets, infrastructure and operations from hostile or malicious acts; failure to meet our ethical and social standards; non-compliance with international trade sanctions; and other factors discussed elsewhere in this integrated annual report.\n\nThe achievement of Equinor's climate ambitions depends, in part, on broader societal shifts in consumer demands and technological advancements, each of which are beyond Equinor's control. Should society's demands and technological innovation not shift in parallel with Equinor's pursuit of its energy transition\n\nplan, Equinor's ability to meet its climate ambitions will be impaired. The calculation of Equinor's net carbon intensity presented in this report includes an estimate of emissions from the use of sold products (GHG protocol category 11) as a means to more accurately evaluate the emission lifecycle of what we produce to respond to the energy transition and potential business opportunities arising from shifting consumer demands. Including these emissions in the calculations should in no way be construed as an acceptance by Equinor of responsibility for the emissions caused by such use.\n\nThe reference to any scenario in this report, including any potential net-zero scenarios, does not imply Equinor views any particular scenario as likely to occur. Thirdparty scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not Equinor, and their use by Equinor is not an endorsement by Equinor of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of Equinor's separate planning process. Any use of the modeling of a thirdparty organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by Equinor of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\nWe use certain terms in this document, such as 'resource' and 'resources' that the SEC's rules prohibit us from including in our filings with the SEC. U.S.\n\ninvestors are urged to closely consider the disclosures in our annual report on Form 20-F, SEC File No. 1-15200, which is available on our website or by calling 1-800-SEC-0330 or logging on to www.sec.gov.\n\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that our future results, level of activity, performance or achievements will meet these expectations. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and, except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any of these statements after the date of this integrated annual report, either to make them conform to actual results or changes in our expectations.",
