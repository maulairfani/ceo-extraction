The terms \"theCompany,\" \"Regency Centers,\" \"Regency,\"\"we,\" \"our,\" and\"us\" asused in this Reportmean the Parent Company and the\n\nOperating Partnership,collectively.\n\nTheParentCompany is areal estate investment trust (\"REIT\") and thegeneral partnerof the OperatingPartnership. As the sole generalpartner of theOperating Partnership, the ParentCompany has exclusive controlofthe Operating Partnership's day-to-day management. The OperatingPartnership's capitalincludesgeneral andlimited commonpartnership units (\"CommonUnits\"). Asof December 31, 2023, the Parent Company owned approximately 99.4% of the CommonUnits in theOperating Partnership. The remaining CommonUnits,which are all limited CommonUnits, are ownedby third party investors. In addition to the Common Units,the Operating Partnership has alsoissued twoseriesofpreferred units: the6.250%SeriesACumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the 'SeriesAPreferred Units') and the 5.875% Series BCumulative Redeemable PreferredUnits (the 'SeriesBPreferred Units'). The Parent Company currently owns all ofthe Series APreferredUnits and Series B PreferredUnits. The Series A Preferred Units and Series B PreferredUnits are sometimes referred to collectively asthe 'Preferred Units.\"\n\nThe Company believes combining theannualreports on Form 10-K of theParentCompany and the OperatingPartnership into this singlereportprovides the followingbenefits:\n\n- \u00b7 Enhances investors' understanding of the ParentCompany andthe OperatingPartnership by enabling investors to view the business as awhole in the same manner as management views and operates thebusiness;\n- \u00b7 Eliminatesduplicative disclosure and provides amorestreamlined andreadablepresentation; and\n- \u00b7 Creates time and cost efficiencies throughthe preparationofone combined report insteadoftwo separate reports.\n\nManagement operates the ParentCompany andthe OperatingPartnership as onebusiness. Themanagementofthe Parent Company consists of thesame individuals as themanagementofthe OperatingPartnership. These individuals are officersof the Parent Company, andofficers and employees of the OperatingPartnership.\n\nTheCompany believesitisimportant to understandthe keydifferences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in the contextofhow the Parent Company andthe OperatingPartnership operate as aconsolidated company. TheParentCompany is a REIT,whose only material asset is its ownership of Commonand PreferredUnits of theOperating Partnership. As a result, theParent Companydoesnot conductbusinessitself, other than acting asthe sole generalpartner of theOperatingPartnership, issuing public equity fromtimeto timeand guaranteeing certain debt of theOperating Partnership. Exceptfor $200million ofunsecured private placement debt, theParent Company does nothold any indebtedness, but guarantees allof the unsecureddebtof the Operating Partnership.

When considering an investment in our securities, carefully read and consider these risks, together with allother information inour otherfilings and submissionstothe SEC, whichprovide much more information and detail. Ifany of the eventsdescribed in thefollowing risk factors actually occur, ourbusiness, financialconditionand/oroperating results, as well as the market priceofour securities, couldbe\n\nmaterially adversely affected.\n\nRisk FactorsRelated to theCurrent Economic and GeopoliticalEnvironments\n\n## Interest rates in thecurrenteconomic environment mayadversely impact our cost to borrow, realestatevaluation,and stock\n\nprice.\n\nOn multiple occasions during2022 and2023, theBoard of Governorsof the FederalReserve System (\"the U.S. Federal Reserve\") raised its benchmarkfederal funds rate, whichhas led tonumerousincreases in interest rates in the credit markets, with further increases possible. Higher interest ratesmay negatively impact consumer spending,our tenants' businesses, and/or future demand for space in our shopping centers.\n\nAdditionally, higher interestrates adverselyimpact our costofborrowing. Our exposure to higher interest ratesinthe shortterm includesour variable-rate borrowings,which consistofborrowings underour unsecuredsenior lineof creditand variable rate based securednotes payable. Increases in interestrates could increaseour financing costs over time,either throughnear-term borrowingson ourfloating-rate line of creditorrefinancing of ourexistingborrowings thatmay incurhigherinterestexpensesrelated to the issuance of newdebt. Prolongedperiods of higher interestrates maynegativelyimpact thevaluation of ourreal estate assetportfolio and could result in adeclineofour stock price andmarket capitalization, which may adversely impact ourability andwillingnesstoraise equity capitalon favorable termsthrough salesofour commonshares, includingthrough ourAtthe Market (\"ATM\")program.\n\nAlthoughthe extent ofany prolongedperiods of higher interest ratesremains unknown atthis time, negative impacts toour cost of capital may also adversely affect ourfuturebusinessplans andgrowth, at leastin the near term.\n\n## Current economic challenges, including the potential for recession, may adversely impactour tenantsand ourbusiness.\n\nThe success ofour tenants inoperating their businesses and their corresponding ability to payusrent continue to be significantly impacted by many current economic challenges,which impact theircostofdoing business, including, but not limited to, inflation, labor shortages, supply chainconstraints,decreasing consumer confidence and discretionary spending,and increasingenergyprices andinterestrates. Additionally,macroeconomic andgeopolitical riskscreatechallenges that mayexacerbate current market conditions in theUnitedStates, including the potential for a recession.\n\nThese economic challenges could adversely impact ourvolume of leasingactivity, whichcould include tenant move outs and/or higher levels of uncollectible lease income, as well as negatively affect thebusinessand financialresults of ourtenants. The aggregate impacts of thesecurrent economic challenges may also negatively affect theoverall market for retail space, resultingin decreased demand for space in our centers. This, in turn, couldresult in pricing pressure on rent that we are able to chargetonew or renewing tenants, such that future rent spreads could be adversely impacted. Further,wemay experience higher costs for tenant buildouts,ascosts of materialsand labormay increaseand supply andavailability of both maybecomemorelimited.\n\n## Unfavorable developments affecting the banking andfinancial services industry could adversely affect ourbusiness, liquidity andfinancial condition,and overall results of operations.\n\nActual events,concerns or speculationaboutdisruptionorinstability in the banking andfinancial services industry,such asliquidity constraintsorlack of available credit, thefailure of individual institutions,orthe inability of individual institutions or thebanking and financial service industry generally to meet their contractualobligations,could significantly impairour accessto capital,delay access to deposits or otherfinancial assets, or cause actuallossof funds subjecttocashmanagementarrangements.Similarly, theseevents, concerns or speculationcould result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants,or systemic limitations on accessto credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult forus and our tenants to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, our critical vendors and business partners also couldbe adversely affected by these risks as described above,which in turn couldresultin their committing a breachordefault under theircontractual agreementswith us,their insolvency or bankruptcy,orother adverseeffects. Anydecline inavailable funding, lack of credit in thecommercial real estate market,oraccess to cashand liquidity resources, or non-\n\ncomplianceofbanking and financialservices counterpartieswith theircontractual commitments to us,our tenantsorour critical vendors andbusinesspartnerscould, among other risks, have materialadverse impactsonour ability to meet ouroperating expenses andother financialneeds, could resultinbreaches of our financial and/or contractualobligations, and couldhavematerialadverse impactsonour business,financial conditionand resultsofoperations.\n\n9",

Retailers are considering these customer buyinghabits and othertrendswhen making decisionsregarding their brick andmortarstores and how they will compete and innovatein a rapidlychangingretail environment. Many retailersin our shopping centers provide services or sell goodswhich have historically been less likely to be purchasedonline; however,the continuing change in customer buying habits, including increase in e-commerce sales in all retail categoriesmay cause retailers to adjust thesize ornumberoftheir retail locations in thefutureor close stores. For example, our grocer tenantsare incorporatinge-commerce concepts throughhomedelivery and curbside pick-up, which could reduce foot trafficat our centers. These alternative delivery methods aremorelikely toimpactfoottraffic atour centersin certain higher-incomemarkets where consumers arewillingto pay premiumsfor such services.

As aresult, our ability to sell one or more of ourproperties, includingpropertiesheldin joint ventures, inresponseto changes in economic,industry, financial market,orother conditions maybe limited.

Further, population migrationmay occur inresponseto these or otherfactors and negatively impact ourcenters.For example, climate andother environmentalchanges mayresultin moreunpredictable or decreased demand forretailspace at certain of ourproperties, reduced rent or, in extreme cases,our inability to operate certain propertiesat all. Climate change may alsohave indirect effectson ourbusinessby increasing the cost of insuranceormakinginsurance unavailable. While thefederal government hasnot yetenacted comprehensivelegislation to address climate change thatwould directly impact us, certain states in whichweown andoperate shopping centers, including California and NewYork, have done so. Compliancewith these andfuturenew laws or regulations related to climate changemay requireustomake additional investmentsinorfor ourexistingproperties, resulting inincreased capital expendituresand operatingcosts,implement neworadditionalprocessesand controls to facilitate compliance, and/or pay additional energy, insurance, taxes and related fees and costs. At thistime, there can be no assurance thatwecan anticipate all potential material impactsof climate change,or that climate change will nothaveamaterial adverseeffect on thevalue of ourpropertiesand our financial performance in thefuture.\n\n## Geographic concentrationof our properties makesour businessmorevulnerabletonatural disasters, severe weather conditionsand climatechange.\n\nA significantnumberofour propertiesare located inareas that aresusceptible to earthquakes, tropical storms,hurricanes, tornadoes,\n\nwildfires, sea-level rise, andother naturaldisasters. AtDecember31, 2023,18.7% of the GLA of our portfolio islocated in thestate of California, including a number of properties in the SanFrancisco Bayand LosAngeles areas. Additionally,20.1% and7.1%ofthe GLAofour portfolio is located in thestatesof Florida andTexas, respectively. Insurance costs forproperties in these areashave increased significantly, andrecentintense weatherconditions maycause property insurance premiums to increasesignificantly in the future.

Although we participate in a number of theseratings systems, we do not participateinall such systems, andmay notscore as well in all of the available ratings systems asother REITs and real estate operators. Further, the criteriaused in these ratings systemsmay conflict with each other and change frequently, and we cannot guaranty thatwewill be able to scorewellin the future. Wesupplementour participation inratings systemsbydisclosingon our website information about ourESG activities, butsomeinvestors maydesire additionaldisclosures that we do notprovide. In addition, theSEC is currently considering adoptingnew regulations that would imposeadditionalESG disclosure andother compliancerequirementsonus. Californiahas adopted a number of climate disclosure laws whichwill increaseour compliancecosts andrequire us to make additional climate disclosures. Other states are considering legislation similar to California'snew laws. Failure to participate in certain of the third-party ratings systems, failure to scorewell in those ratingssystems or failure to provide certain ESGdisclosures couldadversely impact us when investors compare us againstsimilar companies in our industry, and could cause certain investors to beunwilling to invest in our stock, which could adversely impact ourstock priceand ourability to raise capital. In addition, failure to comply with newgovernmentclimate and other ESG disclosure obligations could subject us to significantfines andpenalties.\n\n## An uninsured loss or a lossthat exceedsthe insurance coverage on ourproperties may subject us to lossof capital and revenue on thoseproperties.\n\nWe carry liability, fire, flood, terrorism,business interruption, andenvironmental insurancefor ourproperties. Some typesof losses, such as losses from namedwindstorms, earthquakes, terrorism, or wars mayhavemorelimited coverage, or in some cases, can be excluded frominsurance coverage. In addition, it is possible that theavailability of insurancecoveragein certain areas may decrease in thefuture, andthe cost to procuresuchinsurance mayincreasedue to factorsbeyond ourcontrol. Asaresult, wemay reduce the insuranceweprocure or we may elect or be compelled to self-insureorotherwise assume some of this risk. Shouldaloss occurat any of our properties that is in excess of the propertyor casualty insurance limits of our policies, wemay lose part or allofour invested capitaland revenuesfromsuchproperty, which may have amaterial adverse impact on ouroperatingresults,financial condition, and ourability to make distributionstostock andunitholders.\n\nTerroristactivities orviolenceoccurring at ourproperties alsomay directly affect thevalue of ourproperties through damage, destructionorloss.

Theseactivities are subject to the same risks as our investmentsinour wholly-owned properties. However, these investments, and otherfuture similar investments may involverisks that wouldnot be presentwere a thirdparty not involved, including the possibility that partners or otherownersmight become bankrupt,sufferadeterioration intheir creditworthiness,orfailto fund theirshare of required capitalcontributions. Partnersorother owners mayhaveeconomic orother business interests orgoals that are inconsistent with ourown business interests orgoals, and maybe in a positionto takeactions contrary to our policiesor objectives.\n\nThese investments, andother future similar investments, also have thepotential risk of creating impassesondecisions, such as asale or financing, because neitherwenor our partner orother owner has full control over the partnershipor joint venture. Disputes betweenus and partners or otherownersmight result in apremature terminationof the applicable partnershiporjoint venture, or potentially litigationorarbitration, that may increaseour investment andrelated risk as well as ourcosts andexpensesassociatedwith the investment, anddistract management from sufficiently focusing their time and effortsonothers areas of ourbusiness.

Certain of our partnershipoperating agreements provide eithermemberthe ability to elect buy/sell clauses. The electionofthese dissolution provisions couldrequire us to invest additionalcapitalto acquire thepartners' interest or to sell ourshare of theproperty thereby losing theoperating incomeand cash flow.\n\n## Risk FactorsRelated to Funding Strategies andCapital Structure\n\n## Ourability tosell propertiesand fund acquisitionsand developments maybe adversely impacted by higher market capitalizationrates and lower NOIatour properties which may dilute earnings.\n\nAs part of ourfunding strategy, we sell properties that no longer meet ourstrategic objectives or investment standardsand/orthose with a limited futuregrowthprofile. These salesproceeds are used to fund debt repayment, acquisitionofother properties, andnew developments and redevelopments. An increase inmarketcapitalizationrates (which mayormay not be driven by an increase in interest rates) or adecline inNOI may cause a reduction in the valueofcenters identified for sale, which would have an adverse impact on theamount of cashgenerated. Additionally,the sale of propertiesresultinginsignificanttax gainsmay require higher distributions to ourstockholdersorpayment of additional income taxes in order to maintain our REIT status.\n\n## We depend on external sources of capital, which may not beavailablein the future on favorable terms oratall.\n\nTo qualify as a REIT,the Parent Companymust, amongother things,distribute to its stockholders eachyear at least90% of itsREIT taxable income(excluding any netcapitalgains). Becauseofthese distribution requirements,wemay not beable tofundall future capitalneeds with income fromoperations. In such instances,wewould rely on third-party sources of capital, whichmay or maynot be availableon favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sourcesof capital depends on anumberof things, including the market's perception ofour growth potential and our current andpotential future earnings.

In addition, we do notexpect to generate sufficientoperatingcashflowto makeballoon principalpayments onour debt when due. If we areunable torefinance our debt on acceptable terms, we maybeforced(i) to disposeofproperties, whichmight result in losses, or (ii) to obtain financing at unfavorable terms, either of whichmay reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stockand unit holders.

In addition, uncertainty in the legal regulatory regime relating toAImay require significant resources to modify andmaintain businesspractices to comply with applicable law, thenatureofwhich cannotbedetermined at this time. Several jurisdictions have alreadyproposed or enacted laws governingAI. For example,onOctober 30,2023, the Biden administration issued an ExecutiveOrder to,among otherthings, establish extensivenew standards for AI safety andsecurity.Other jurisdictions maydecide to adopt similarormore restrictive legislation thatmay render the useofsuchtechnologies challenging.

Ifthe Parent Companycontinues toqualify as a REIT, itgenerally will notbesubject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. Many REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. The determination thatthe Parent Company is a REIT requires an analysis of variousfactualmatters andcircumstances, someofwhich maynot be totally within ourcontrol andsomeofwhich involve questions of interpretation. For example, to qualify asaREIT, atleast95% of ourgross income must come from specific passive sources, likerent, that are itemized in theREIT tax laws. There can be no assurancethatthe Internal RevenueService (\"IRS\")ora courtwould agreewith thepositions we have takenin interpreting the REIT requirements. TheParentCompany is also required to distribute to the stockholdersat least 90% of its REIT taxableincome, excludingnet capital gains. TheParentCompany will be subject to U.S. federalincometax on undistributed taxable incomeand netcapitalgains andto a 4% nondeductible excise taxon any amount by whichdistributions theParentCompany pays with respect to any calendaryear are lessthan the sumof85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capitalgainnet income and100%ofour undistributed income from prioryears. Thefactthatwehold many of ourassets through real estate partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates theapplicationofthe REIT requirements. Furthermore, Congress andthe IRS might make changesto the taxlawsand regulations,and thecourtsmight issuenew rulings,that make it more difficult forthe Parent Companytoremainqualified asaREIT.\n\nAlso,unlessthe IRSgranted relief under certain statutoryprovisions, the Parent CompanywouldremaindisqualifiedasaREIT for four yearsfollowing theyear it first failed toqualify. If the Parent CompanyfailedtoqualifyasaREIT (currently and/or with respect to any tax years for whichthe statute of limitations hasnot expired), the Parent Companywouldhavetopay significant income taxes, reducing cashavailabletopay dividends, whichwould likely haveasignificant adverse effect on the value of oursecurities. In addition, we wouldnolongerberequired topay anydividends to stockholders in ordertomaintainour REIT status. Although we believe that theParentCompany qualifiesasaREIT,wecannotbe assured thatthe Parent Companywillcontinue toqualifyorremain qualified asaREIT fortax purposes.\n\nEven if the ParentCompany qualifies as a REIT forfederal income taxpurposes, theParentCompany is requiredtopay certain federal, state, andlocal taxesonits income andproperty. Forexample,ifwehavenet income from \"prohibited transactions,\" that income will be subjectto a 100%tax. Ingeneral,prohibitedtransactions include sales orother dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in theordinarycourseofbusiness. Thedetermination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction dependson the factsand circumstances related tothatsale. While we have undertaken asignificant number of assetsales in recent years, we do notbelieve that thosesales should be considered prohibited transactions, butthere can be no assurancethatthe IRS wouldnot contendotherwise.\n\nNew legislation, as well as new regulations,administrativeinterpretations,or court decisions maybe introduced, enacted,or\n\npromulgatedfrom time to time, that maychange the tax laws or interpretationsof the tax lawsregarding qualification asaREIT,or thefederal income tax consequences of that qualification, in amannerthat isadverse to ourstockholders. Dividends paid byREITs generally do notqualifyfor reduced taxrates.\n\n## Subject to limited exceptions,dividends paid by REITs(other thandistributions designated as capital gain dividends, qualified\n\ndividendsorreturns of capital) arenot eligible forreduced ratesfor qualifieddividends paid by \"C\"corporations andare taxable at ordinary income taxrates.

Weseek tomitigatethese potentialimpactsthroughmaintaining ahighquality portfolio, diversifying our tenantmix,replacing less successful tenants withstrongeroperators, anchoring our centers with market leading grocerystoresthatdrive customer traffic, andinvesting insuburbantrade areas with compellingdemographic populations benefiting from high levels of disposal income. The potentialfor a recession and the severity anddurationofany economicdownturncould negatively impact ourexisting tenants and their ability to continue to meet theirleaseobligations.\n\nAlthoughbaserentisderived from long-termlease contracts, tenants thatfile for bankruptcy generallyhave the legalright to reject anyor all of their leases andclose related stores. Anyunsecured claimwehold against abankrupttenantfor unpaid rent mightbe paid only to the extent that funds areavailableand only in thesamepercentage as is paid to allother holdersofunsecured claims. As aresult, it is likely thatwewouldrecover substantially lessthan the full valueofany unsecured claims we hold. Additionally,wemay incur significant expense to adjudicate our claim and significant downtime to re-lease the vacated space. In the event that atenant with asignificantnumberof leases in ourshopping centers files for bankruptcy andrejects its leases, we could experience asignificant reduction inour revenues. Tenants who are currentlyinbankruptcy andcontinue to occupy space in ourshopping centersrepresent an aggregateof0.5%ofour Pro-rata annual base rent whichisprimarily related toRite Aidwho filed inOctober 2023.\n\n45",

A significant portion of our cashfromoperations isdistributed to our common shareholders in theformofdividends in ordertomaintainour status as aREIT.\n\nExceptfor $200 million of private placement debt,our Parent Companyhas no capitalcommitmentsother than its guarantees of the commitmentsofour OperatingPartnership. All remainingdebtisheldbyour OperatingPartnership,its subsidiaries,orbyour real estate partnerships. The Operating Partnership is a co-issuer andaguarantorofthe $200 millionofoutstanding debt of ourParent Company. The ParentCompany will from time to time access the capitalmarkets forthe purposeofissuing newequity,and will simultaneously contribute allofthe offering proceeds to theOperating Partnershipin exchange foradditionalpartnership units.\n\nWe continually assessour available liquidity and our expected cashrequirements, includingmonitoring ourtenantrentcollections. We have access to and draw on multiple financing sources to fund our operations andour long-term capital needs, including the requirements of our inprocess and planneddevelopments, redevelopments, other capital expenditures, and therepayment of debt. We expect to meet theseneedsbyusing acombination of thefollowing:cashflowfromoperations afterfunding ourcommon stock and preferredstock dividends, borrowings from our Line, proceeds from the sale ofreal estate, mortgageloan and unsecuredbank financing, distributions receivedfromour real estate partnerships,and when thecapitalmarkets arefavorable,proceedsfrom the sale of equity securities or the issuance of newunsecureddebt. We continually evaluate alternativefinancing options,and we believewe canobtain new financing on reasonable terms, although likely at higher interest rates than that of ourdebt currently outstanding, due to thecurrent interest rate environment.\n\nOn January8,2024,Regency priced apublic offering of $400 millionofseniorunsecurednotes due2034(the'2024Notes') under\n\nourexistingshelf registrationfiledwith the SEC. TheNotes mature on January15, 2034,and were issued at 99.617%ofpar value with acoupon of 5.25%. We have $250millionofunsecureddebtmaturinginJune2024, whichweintend topay off by utilizing the proceeds availablefromthe 2024 Notes. In addition, we have $148.3 million of securedmortgage maturities during the next 12 months, including mortgageswithinour real estate partnerships, which we intend to refinanceorpay-off as they mature. Based upon ouravailable cashbalance,sources of capital, ourcurrent credit ratings,and thenumberofhighquality,unencumberedpropertieswe own, we believe our availablecapital resources aresufficient tomeet our expected capitalneeds for the next year, although,in the longer term, we can provide no assurances.\n\n51",

During the years endedDecember 31, 2023 and2022, we generated cashflowfrom operations of $719.6 million and $655.8 million, respectively, andpaid$458.8 million individends to ourcommon and preferred stock andunitholders,and $430.1millionin dividendstoour common stock and unit holders, respectively.\n\nWe currentlyhavedevelopmentand redevelopmentprojects invarious stages of construction, alongwith a pipeline of potential projects for future developmentorredevelopment. Afterfunding our common and preferredstock dividend payments in January 2024,we estimate that we will require capitalduringthe next 12 months of approximately$677.8 millionrelated to leasing commissions, tenant improvements,in-process developments and redevelopments, capital contributions to ourreal estate partnerships, and repayingmaturingdebt. These capital requirements are being impacted by inflationresulting in increased costs ofconstruction materials, labor, and services from third party contractorsand suppliers. Further,continuedchallenges frompermittingdelaysand laborshortages mayextendthe timeto completion ofthese projects. In response,wehave implemented mitigationstrategiessuch as entering into fixedcostconstructioncontracts, pre-orderingmaterials, and otherplanningefforts.\n\nIf we startnew developments or redevelopments, committoproperty acquisitions, repay debt prior tomaturity, declare future dividends, or repurchase shares of ourcommon stock,our cash requirementswill increase. If we refinance maturingdebt, our cash requirements will decrease.\n\nWe endeavor to maintain ahigh percentageof unencumbered assets.Asof December31, 2023, 87.1% of ourwholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered. Our low level of encumberedassets allows us to more readily accessthe secured and unsecured debt marketsand to maintainborrowing capacity on theLine. Ourtrailing12monthfixed charge coverage ratio,including our Prorata shareofour partnerships, was 4.7x and4.6xfor theperiods endedDecember31, 2023 and2022, respectively, andour Pro-rata net debt and Preferred Stock-to-operating EBITDA re adjusted ratio on atrailing12month basiswas 5.4x and5.0x,respectively, forthe same periods. In light of themergerwith UBP onAugust18, 2023, the adjusted debt metric calculations include legacy Regency results for the trailing12 months andthe annualized contributionfromUBP post merger. Our Line and unsecureddebtrequire that we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are described innote9to the\n\nConsolidated FinancialStatements. Thedebtassumed in conjunction with theUBP acquisition contain covenants thatare consistent with our existingdebtcovenants. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31,2023,and expect to remain in compliance.\n\n52",

Theseaccounting estimates, judgments and assumptions arebased upon, but not limited tohistorical experience, current trends,expected future results,current market conditions,and interpretationofindustry accounting standards. While thefollowing is not intended tobe a comprehensive list of our accountingestimates, the estimates discussed below arebelievedto becritical because of theirsignificance tothe Consolidated FinancialStatements and thepossibility that future events maydifferfrom those judgments, or that theuse of differentassumptions could resultin materially different estimates.Wereviewthese estimatesonaperiodic basistoensurereasonableness; however, the amounts we mayultimately realize coulddifferfrom such estimates.\n\nValuationofRealEstateInvestments Acquired from Urstadt Biddle Properties, Inc.\n\n## We generally account foran acquisitionofasinglereal estate property or portfolio of real estate properties as an assetacquisition.

We determinecapitalization rates by market basedonrecent transactions andother market data and adjust, if necessary,based on thepropertycharacteristics.The fair valueof landis generally basedonrelevantmarketdata, such as acomparisonof the subject site to similar parcels thathaverecently been sold or are currently beingofferedonthe market for sale. The useofdifferent assumptions, judgments and estimates tovalue the acquiredproperties and allocate the most significant portionof the purchase priceamong theland, buildings and improvementsand identified intangibleassetsand liabilitiescould affect\n\nthe depreciation and amortization expensewe recognize over the estimated remaining useful life.\n\nImpairment of Real Estate Investments In accordance with GAAP,we evaluateour real estate for impairmentwhenever there are eventsor changes in circumstances, includingpropertyoperating performance,general market conditions or changesin expected holdperiods,that indicate that the carryingvalue of ourrealestateproperties(including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable. If such events or changesoccur, we compare the current carrying valueof the asset to the estimated undiscounted cashflows that are directly associated with the use andultimate dispositionofthe asset. Ourestimated cashflows arebased on severalkey assumptions, including rental rates, expected leasing activity, costsoftenantimprovements, leasing commissions, expected hold period, comparable salesinformation, andassumptions regarding the residualvalue upondisposition, includingthe exit capitalization rate. Thesekey assumptions aresubjectiveinnatureand theresulting impairment, if any, coulddifferfrom the actualgain or lossrecognized upon ultimate sale in an arm'slength transaction. If the carryingvalue of theassetexceeds the estimatedundiscounted cashflows, an impairmentlossisrecognized equal to the excessofcarryingvalue over the estimated fair value.\n\nThe estimated fair valueof real estate assets is subjective and is estimatedthrough comparable salesinformationand othermarketdata if available, as well as theuse of an income approach such as thedirect capitalization methodor the discounted cash flow approach. Thediscountedcashflowmethodusessimilarassumptions to the undiscounted cashflow method above, aswellas a discount rate. Such cashflowprojections andrates aresubject to management judgment and changes in thoseassumptions could impact the estimationoffairvalue. In estimating the fair valueofundeveloped land,wegenerally usemarketdataand comparable sales information.

Webelieve that the relativelyfew tenantswho currently operatedry cleaning plants or gasstations do so in accordance with current laws andregulations. Generally,weendeavor to require tenantstoremovedry cleaningplantsfromour shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendlysystems, in accordancewith the termsofour leases. We carry an environmentalinsurance policyfor certain third-party liabilities and, in certain circumstances,remediation costs on shopping centers forcurrently unknown contamination. We have also secured environmental insurancepolicies, whereappropriate, onarelatively smallnumberofspecificproperties withknown contamination, in order tomitigate our environmentalrisk. We monitor the shopping centers containing environmentalissues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites. We also have legalobligations to remediatecertain sitesand we arein the processof doing so.\n\nAs of December31, 2023,we had accrued liabilities of$19.4 million for our Pro-rata share of environmental remediation, including ourInvestments inreal estatepartnerships. We believe that the ultimate remediationofcurrently known environmental matters will not have amaterial effect on ourfinancial position, cashflows,orresults of operations. Wecan give no assurancethatexisting environmentalstudies on ourshopping centers have revealed allpotential environmentalcontamination; that our estimate of liabilities will not change as more informationbecomes available; that anypreviousowner,occupant or tenant didnot createany material environmentalcondition notknown to us;thatthe current environmentalconditionofthe shopping centers will notbe affected by tenantsand occupants, by theconditionofnearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changesin applicable environmental laws andregulations or theirinterpretationwill notresultinadditionalenvironmentalliability to us.\n\n57",

SOFRrates chargedonour Line change monthly, and the applicable margin on the Linewas dependentupon maintaining specificcreditratings. Ifour credit ratings were downgraded,the applicable margin on theLinewould increase, resulting inhigherinterest costs. AsofDecember31, 2023 the interestrate plusapplicable marginbased on our credit rating ranged fromAdjusted SOFRplus0.690%toAdjusted SOFRplus1.540%. EffectiveJanuary 18,2024, upon theSixth Amendment tothe Line,the applicable margin on the Line is dependent upon maintainingcertain compliance ratiosand credit ratingsstipulated in thecreditagreement, andthe interest rate plus applicable margin basedonour credit ratingranges\n- from Adjusted SOFR plus 0.640% to Adjusted SOFR plus 1.390%. \u00b7 We are alsoexposed to changes in interestrates when we refinanceour existing long-termfixed rate debt. The objective of our interestrate riskmanagementprogram is to limit the impact of interest rate changesonearnings and cashflows. To achieve these objectives,weborrowprimarily at fixed interestrates andmay enterintoderivativefinancial instrumentssuch as interest rate swaps, caps, or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We donot enter intoderivativeorinterest rate transactions for speculative purposes. Our interest rate swaps arestructured solely for thepurpose of interest rate protection.\n\nWe continuously monitorthe capitalmarkets and evaluateour ability to issuenew debt,torepay maturing debt,orto fundour commitments. We continue to believe, in light of our creditratings,the availablecapacity under ourunsecured creditfacility, and the numberof highquality, unencumberedproperties that weown which could collateralize borrowings, we will be able to successfully issuenew securedorunsecureddebttofundmaturingdebtobligations. Itisuncertain thedegreetowhich capitalmarketvolatility andrising interest rates will adverselyimpact the interest rates on anynew debt that we may issue.\n\nOur interestrate riskis monitoredusing avariety of techniques. The tablebelow presents theprincipal cash flows, weighted average interest ratesofremaining debt,and thefairvalue of totaldebt asofDecember 31,2023. Forvariablerate mortgages andunsecured credit facilities for whichwehaveinterestrate swaps in place to fix the interest rate, theyare included in the Fixed rate debt section belowat their all-in fixed rate. The table is presented byyear of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows andsensitivity to interest rate changes. Although theaverage interest rate forvariable rate debtis included in the table, those rates represent rates that existed as ofDecember31, 2023, and are subject to change on a monthly basis. In addition, we continually assess themarketriskfor floating ratedebtand believethata1% increase in interest rates woulddecreasefuture earnings and cashflows by approximately $1,557,500 peryearbased on $155.8 million of floatingratemortgagedebtand floating rate line of credit balances outstanding at December 31, 2023. If we increaseour lineof credit balance in thefuture, additionaldecreases to future earnings and cashflows couldoccur.\n\nFurther, thetable below incorporates only those exposures that exist asofDecember 31, 2023, anddoesnot consider exposures or positions that could arise afterthatdateorobligations repaid before maturity. Since firm commitmentsare notpresented, the tablehas limited predictivevalue. Asaresult, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposuresthatarise during theperiod, ourhedging strategies at that time,and actual interest rates.\n\nThe table belowpresents the principalcashflowpaymentsassociated with ouroutstanding debt by year,weightedaverage interest rates ondebt outstanding at each year-end, and fair value of total debt asof December31, 2023.\n\n(dollars in thousands)\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n2026\n\n2027\n\n2028\n\nThereafter\n\nTotal\n\nFair Value\n\n| Fixedratedebt (1)                                                                                           | $ 395,978   | 309,882   | 359,273   | 756,170   | 343,580   | 1,864,200   | 4,029,083   | 3,759,418   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Averageinterest ratefor allfixed rate                                                                       | 3.86%       | 3.88%     | 3.88%     | 3.87%     | 3.94%     | 3.86%       |             |             |\n| debt (2) Variable rate SOFR debt (1)                                                                        | $ -         | 155,750   | - -       | - -       | - -       | -           | 155,750     | 155,734     |\n| Averageinterest ratefor allvariable                                                                         | 5.89%       | 5.89%     | -%        | -%        | -%        | -%          |             |             |\n| rate debt (2) (1) Reflectsamount of debt maturities during each of theyears presentedasof December31, 2023. |             |           |           |           |           |             |             |             |\n\n58",

The Parent Companyprimarily engages in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, development, andredevelopmentofshopping centers through the OperatingPartnership, and has no other assets otherthan through its investmentinthe OperatingPartnership,and its only liabilities are $200 million of unsecured privateplacement notes, which are co-issued and guaranteedby the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company guarantees allof the unsecureddebtof the Operating Partnership.\n\nAs of December 31,2023, the ParentCompany, the OperatingPartnership, and their controlledsubsidiaries on a consolidated basis(the \"Company\" or \"Regency\") owned381 propertiesand held partialinterests in an additional101 propertiesthrough unconsolidated Investments inreal estate partnerships (alsoreferredto as\"jointventures\" or \"investmentpartnerships\").\n\n## AcquisitionofUrstadt Biddle PropertiesInc.\n\nOn May17, 2023, theParentCompany entered into anAgreement and Plan of Merger (the 'merger agreement') by and amongthe Parent Company, Hercules Merger Sub, LLC, awholly ownedsubsidiaryof the Parent Company('MergerSub'), UBP, UB MarylandI,Inc., awholly ownedsubsidiaryofUrstadt Biddle ('UB SubI'),and UB Maryland II, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiaryofUBSub I ('UBSub II'), pursuant to which, (a)UBSub II merged with andintoUrstadt Biddle (the 'first merger'), with UrstadtBiddle surviving thefirst merger as awholly owned subsidiaryofUBSub I, and (b) following thefirst merger,UBSub Imergedwith and intoMergerSub (the 'second merger' and together with the first merger, the 'mergers'), with Merger Subbeing thesurviving entity in thesecond merger.

Thepoliciesimplemented by theU.S.government to address these issues,including raising interest rates,could result in adverse impactson the U.S. economy, includingaslowingofgrowth and potentially a recession, thereby impacting consumerspending, tenants' businesses, and/or decreasing futuredemand for space in shopping centers. The potential impact of current macroeconomic andgeopolitical challengeson the Company's financialcondition, results of operations, andcashflows is subject to change and continues todependonthe extent and\n\nNotestoConsolidated FinancialStatements\n\ndurationof these risksand uncertainties.\n\nConsolidation\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include theaccounts ofthe Parent Company, theOperating Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries,and consolidated partnerships in whichthe Companyhas acontrollingfinancial interest. Investments in real estate partnerships not controlled by the Company are accounted forunderthe equity method of accounting. All significant inter-companybalances and transactions are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company consolidates propertiesthatare wholly-owned andpropertieswhere it owns less than 100% buthas control over the activities most important to theoverall successof the partnership. Control isdeterminedusing an evaluationbased on accountingstandards related tothe consolidationofVariableInterestEntities(\"VIEs\")and voting interestentities. For jointventuresthatare determined to be aVIE,the Companyconsolidates theentity whereitisdeemed to be theprimary beneficiary. Determinationofthe primarybeneficiary is basedonwhether an entity has(1) the power to direct the activities of theVIE that most significantly impact theentity's economic performance, and(2) theobligation to absorb lossesofthe entity that could potentially be significant tothe VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that couldpotentially be significant to theVIE.\n\n## Ownershipofthe Parent Company\n\nTheParentCompany has a single class of common stockand two seriesofpreferred stockoutstanding.\n\n## Ownershipofthe OperatingPartnership\n\nTheOperating Partnership's capital includesCommonUnits and PreferredUnits. AsofDecember31, 2023, theParent Companyowned approximately 99.4%or184,581,070 of the185,688,524 of theoutstanding Common Units,with the remaining limited partner's CommonUnits held by third parties (\"Exchangeable operatingpartnership units\" or \"EOP units\"). TheParentCompany currentlyowns all of the PreferredUnits.\n\nEach EOPunitis exchangeable for cashorone shareof commonstock of the ParentCompany, atthe discretion of the Parent Company, andthe unit holdercannotrequire redemption in cashorcommon stock (i.e., registered shares of theParent). The Parent Companyhas evaluated the conditions as specified underAccountingStandards Codification(\"ASC\") Topic480, Distinguishing LiabilitiesfromEquity , asitrelates to EOPunits outstanding and concluded that the Parent Companyhas the rightto satisfy the redemptionrequirementsofthe units bydeliveringshares ofunregisteredcommonstock. Accordingly, the Parent Company classifies EOPunits as permanent equity in theaccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and ConsolidatedStatements of Equity and Comprehensive Income. The Parent Company servesasgeneral partnerof the Operating Partnership.The EOPunit holders have limitedrightsover the Operating Partnership such that they do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the OperatingPartnership's economicperformance. As such, theOperatingPartnership is considered a VIE, and theParentCompany,which consolidates it, is theprimary beneficiary. TheParentCompany's only investment is the OperatingPartnership.Net income anddistributions of theOperating Partnership are allocable to the general and limited common PartnershipUnits in accordancewith theirownership percentages.\n\nReal Estate Partnerships\n\nAs of December31, 2023,Regency held partialownership interestsin119 propertiesthrough partnerships,ofwhich 18 are\n\nconsolidated. Regency's partners include institutional investors andreal estate developers and/or operators (the \"Partners\"or \"Limited Partners\"). Thesepartnershipshave been established to ownand operatereal estate property. Regency hasa variable interest in theseentitiesthrough its equity ownership, with Regencybeing theprimary beneficiaryin certain of these real estate partnerships. Assuch, Regency consolidates thepartnerships into its financialstatements for which itis the primarybeneficiary and reports the limited partners' interests as noncontrolling interests. For thosepartnershipswhich Regency isnot theprimary beneficiary and does notcontrol, but has significantinfluence, Regency recognizesits investment in them in accordancewith theequity method of accounting.\n\n83",

Noncontrollinginterests also include amounts related topartnership units issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the Company in connectionwith certain property acquisitions.These partnership units have adefined redemption amount and the unit holdersgenerally have theright to redeem theirunits at any timeafter a certain period from issuance.

NotestoConsolidated FinancialStatements\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nNoncontrolling Interestsofthe Parent Company The Consolidated FinancialStatementsof the Parent Companyinclude thefollowing ownership interests held by owners other than the common shareholders of theParentCompany: (i) the EOPunits and(ii) the minority-owned interestheld by thirdparties in consolidated partnerships (\"Limited partners' interests in consolidatedpartnerships\"). The ParentCompany hasincludedall of thesenoncontrolling interests in permanentequity,separatefromthe Parent Company'sshareholders' equity,inthe accompanying Consolidated BalanceSheetsand Consolidated Statements of Equity. The portionofnet income or comprehensive income attributable to these noncontrolling interestsisincluded innet income andcomprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Incomeofthe Parent Company.\n\nTheParentCompany also evaluated its fiduciaryduties toitself, its shareholders, and, as the managing generalpartner of the Operating Partnership, tothe Operating Partnership, and concludedits fiduciaryduties are not in conflict with eachother or the underlyingagreements. Therefore, theParent Company classifies such units and interests as permanent equity in the accompanyingConsolidated Balance Sheetsand Consolidated Statements of Equity.\n\n## Noncontrolling Interestsofthe OperatingPartnership\n\nTheOperatingPartnership hasdetermined that limited partners' interestsin consolidated partnerships arenoncontrolling interests. Subject to certain conditions andpursuantto the termsofthe partnership agreements, theCompany generally has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase theother members' interest or sell its own interestin these consolidated partnerships. The OperatingPartnership hasincludedthese noncontrollinginterests in permanentcapital, separate from partners'capital, in theaccompanying Consolidated BalanceSheetsand Consolidated Statements of Capital. Theportion of netincome(loss) or comprehensiveincome(loss)attributable to thesenoncontrollinginterests is included in Net income and Comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements Comprehensive Incomeof the OperatingPartnership.\n\n## (b) Revenues and Tenant Receivable\n\n## Leasing Income and Tenant Receivables\n\nThe Company leases space to tenantsunder agreements with varyingterms that generallyprovide forfixed payments of base rent, with stated increases over the term of the lease. Someof the leaseagreementscontain provisions that providefor additional rents basedon tenants'sales volume (\"percentage rent\"),which arerecognized when thetenants achieve the specified targets asdefined in their leaseagreements. Additionally,mostlease agreements containprovisions for reimbursement of thetenants' share of actualreal estate taxes and insurance and commonarea maintenance (\"CAM\") costs (collectively \"RecoverableCosts\") incurred.\n\nLease terms generally range from three to seven years for tenantspaces under10,000 square feet (\"Shop Space\") and in excessof fiveyears for spaces greater than 10,000 square feet (\"Anchor Space\"). Many leases also provide tenants the option to extend theirlease beyond the initial termofthe lease. If atenantdoesnot exercise its optionorotherwise negotiate to renew, the lease expires and the lease contains anobligationfor thetenanttorelinquishits space, allowing it to be re-leased to anew tenant. Thisgenerally involvessome level of cost to preparethe spacefor re-leasing, which iscapitalized and depreciated over the shorterperiodof the lifeof the subsequent leaseor the useful lifeofthe improvement.\n\nThe Company accountsfor its leases under ASC Topic842,\n\nLeases\n\n(\"Topic 842\"), as follows:\n\nClassification\n\nUnder Topic842,new leases or modifications thereto must be evaluated against specific classification criteria, which,\n\nbasedonthe customary terms of theCompany'sleases, are classified as operating leases. However, certain longer-term leases (both lessee and lessor leases)may be classified as direct financingorsales type leases,which mayresultin sellingprofit and an accelerated pattern of earnings recognition. At December 31, 2023, the Company classified one lease as a salestype lease, with allothersclassified as operating leases.\n\n85",

CAM is considered anon-lease component of the lease contract under Topic 842. However, asthe timing andpattern of providing theCAM service to the tenant is the same as the timingand patternof the tenant's useof the underlying leaseasset, the Company elected, as part of an availablepractical expedient, to combine CAM with the remaining leasecomponents, alongwith tenant's reimbursement of real estate taxes and insurance, andrecognize them together as Lease income inthe accompanying Consolidated StatementsofOperations.\n\nForsales type leases,the Companyrecordsany sellingprofitor lossarising fromthe lease at inception within Gain on sale of real estate, net of tax in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations, as well as any initial direct costsrecordedas an expense if, at commencement, thefairvalue of theunderlying assetdiffers from its carrying amount, otherwise, they aredeferredand included in the net investment in the lease.

At the commencementdate, theCompany derecognizes the carrying amountof the underlying asset. When measuringthe net investment in along-termground lease,the undiscounted residualvalue of thelandwill be limited to its fair value at commencementwhich will likely equate to its cost.\n\n## Collectibility\n\nAt leasecommencement, theCompany generally expectsthatcollectibility of substantially allpaymentsdue under the lease is probable due to the Company'scredit checkson tenants andother creditworthiness analysisundertakenbefore entering into anew lease; therefore, income from mostoperating leasesisinitially recognized on a straight-linebasis. Foroperatingleasesinwhich collectibility of Leaseincomeisnot considered probable,Leaseincomeisrecognized on a cashbasis andall previously recognized straight-line rentreceivables arereversed in the period in which the Lease income is determined nottobeprobableofcollection.

TheCompany estimatesthe collectibility of the accounts receivablerelated to base rents, straight-linerents,recoveries from tenants, andother revenue takinginto consideration the Company'shistoricalwrite-off experience, tenantcredit-worthiness, currenteconomictrends, and remaining lease terms.

Control ofthe property,including controllingfinancial interest,isgenerally considered to transfer upon closing through transfer of thelegal title andpossession\n\nof theproperty. While generally rare, any retained noncontrolling interest is measured at fair value at that time.\n\nManagement Services and Other PropertyIncome\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"Topic606\") , when or as controlofthe promised services are transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expectstobe entitled to in exchangefor thoseservices. The following is adescriptionofthe Company'srevenue from contracts withcustomers within thescope of Topic 606.\n\n## Property andAssetManagement Services\n\nThe Company is engagedunder agreements with its joint venturepartnerships, which are generallyperpetual in nature andcancellable through unanimouspartner approval, absent an eventofdefault. Underthese agreements, the Company is to provide assetand property managementand leasing services for the jointventures' shopping centers. The fees are market-based,generally calculated as a percentage of either revenues earned or the estimated valuesof the properties managed or the proceeds received, and arerecognized over themonthlyorquarterly periods as services arerendered. Property management andasset management services representaseries of distinct daily services. Accordingly, the Company satisfies its performance obligationasservice is rendered each day and thevariability associated with that compensationisresolved each day. Amounts duefrom the partnerships forsuch services arepaidduring the month following themonthly or quarterlyservice periods.\n\nSeveralof the Company'spartnership agreements providefor incentivepayments, generally referred to as \"promotes\" or \"earnouts,\" to Regencyfor appreciation inpropertyvalues in Regency's capacity as managing member. The termsof thesepromotes arebased on appreciation inreal estate valueoverdesignated timeintervals or upon designated events. The Company evaluates its expected promote payoutateachreporting period, whichgenerally doesnot result in revenue recognition until the measurementperiodhas completed, when theamount can be reasonablydetermined and theamount is notprobableof significantreversal.\n\n## LeasingServices\n\nLeasing service fees arebased on apercentageof the total rent due under the lease. The leasing service is considered performed upon successful execution of anacceptable tenant lease for thejoint ventures' shopping centers, atwhich time revenue isrecognized. Payment of the first half of the fee is generally due upon lease execution and thesecond half is generallydue upon tenant openingorthe commencementof rentpayments.\n\n## TransactionServices\n\nThe Company also receives transaction fees, as contractually agreed upon with each joint venture, which include acquisitionfees, disposition fees, and financingservice fees. Control of these services is generally transferred at the time the related transaction closes, which isthe point in time when theCompany recognizes therelated feerevenue. Any unpaid amounts related to transaction-based fees are included in Tenant and other receivables within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nOtherPropertyIncome\n\nOtherpropertyincome includes parking fees andother incidental income from theproperties and is generally recognized\n\nat thepoint in time thatthe performance obligation is met.\n\n87",

TheCompany periodically assesses the useful lives of its depreciable real estate assets, including those intendedtoberedeveloped inthe near term,and accounts for anyrevisions prospectively. Expendituresfor maintenance, repairsand demolition costs arecharged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, whichimprove or extend the lifeof the asset, arecapitalized.\n\nAs part of theleasingprocess,the Companymay provide lessees with allowances for the constructionof leasehold improvements. These leasehold improvements are capitalized andrecorded astenantimprovementsand depreciated over the shorterof the useful lifeof the improvementsor the remaining lease term. If the allowance represents apayment for a purposeother than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event the Company is notconsidered the ownerof the improvements, theallowanceisconsideredtobe a leaseincentive and is recognized overthe lease termas a reductionof Lease income. Factors considered duringthis evaluationinclude,among otherthings, whoholds legaltitle to the improvementsaswellasother controlling rightsprovidedby the leaseagreement andprovisionsfor substantiationofsuch costs(e.g. unilateral control of the tenantspace during thebuild-out process). Determination of theappropriate accounting forthe paymentofatenant allowanceismadeon a lease-by-leasebasis,considering thefacts and circumstances of the individualtenantlease.\n\nDepreciationiscomputedusing thestraight-line method over estimated useful lives of approximately15yearsfor land\n\nimprovements, 40 yearsfor buildings and improvements, andthe shorterofthe useful lifeor the remaining lease term.\n\n88",

Basedonthese estimates,the Company allocates thepurchaseprice of theacquiredpropertiesbased on theirrelativefair value to the applicable assets and liabilities. Acquisitions of operatingpropertiesare generally considered assetacquisitions and therefore transaction costs are capitalized. Fairvalue is determined basedon an exit price approach,which contemplates the price that would bereceived tosell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderlytransactionbetween market participants at themeasurement date.\n\nThe Company's methodology includes estimating an \"as-ifvacant\" fair valueof the physical property,which includes land, building, andimprovements. In addition, theCompany determines theestimated fair valueofidentifiable intangible assets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases,and (ii) above and below-market value ofinplace leases.\n\nThevalue of in-place leases is estimatedbased on thevalue associated with the costs avoided inoriginating leases compared\n\ndifferencebetween (i) the contractual amounts to bepaidpursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of market lease rates for comparable in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remainingnon-cancelable term of the lease, includingbelow-market renewal options,if applicable.

Upon thedeterminationto classify aproperty asheldfor sale, the Company ceases depreciation and amortizationon the real estate property held for sale, as well as theamortization ofany related intangible assets. Suchproperties are recorded at thelesserof the carryingvalue or estimated fairvalue less estimated coststo sell.\n\n## ValuationofRealEstateInvestments andImpairments\n\nThe Company continually evaluates whether there are any eventsor changes in circumstances, that could indicate the carryingvaluesofthe real estate properties(including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable. When indicatorsofpotential impairment suggestthat the carryingvalue of real estate assets may not be recoverable, theCompany assessesthe recoverability of theassetgroup by estimatingwhether theCompany will recoverthe carryingvalue of the asset groupthrough its undiscountedfuture cashflows, including eventual disposition. Basedonthis analysis,ifthe Companydoesnot believe that it will be able to recoverthe carryingvalue of theassetgroup,an impairment charge will be recorded to theextentthatthe carryingvalue exceeds the estimated fairvalue of theasset group.\n\nEstimated cash flows are basedonseveral key assumptions,including rental rates, expected leasing activity,costs of tenant improvements,leasingcommissions, expected holdperiod, andassumptions regarding the residual value upondisposition, including theexitcapitalizationrate. Thesekey assumptions are subjective innatureand coulddiffermaterially from actual results. Changesin eventsorchanges in circumstances mayalterthe hold period of an asset orassetgroup which may result in an impairment loss andsuch loss couldbematerialto the Company'sfinancial conditionoroperating performance. If a property previously classified as held andused is changedto heldfor sale, the Companyestimates fair value, less expected coststosell, which could cause theCompany to determinethatthe property is impaired.\n\nThe estimatedfairvalue of real estate assets is subjectiveand is estimated through comparablesales informationand other market data if available, or throughuse of an income approach such as the direct capitalization methodorthe discounted cash flow approach. The discounted cashflow approachuses similar assumptions to theundiscounted cashflow approachabove, as well as adiscountrate. Such cashflowprojections andrates are subject to management judgment andchanges inthose assumptions could impact theestimate offairvalue. In estimating the fair valueofundeveloped land, the Company generally uses market data and comparable sales information.\n\n## (d) Cash, Cash Equivalents, andRestricted Cash\n\nAny instruments whichhaveanoriginalmaturityof90days or lesswhenpurchased areconsidered cash equivalents.

Thequantitative approach consists of estimating the fair valueof each reporting unit using discounted projectedfuturecash flowsand comparing those estimated fairvalueswith the carryingvalues, which include the allocated goodwill. If the estimated fairvalue is less than thecarryingvalue,the Companywould then recognize agoodwill impairmentchargefor the amount by which the carryingamountexceeds the reporting unit'sfairvalue,not to exceed thetotal amount of goodwill allocated to that reportingunit.\n\nInvestments\n\nThe Company determines theappropriate classificationofits investmentsindebtand equity securitiesatthe time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date.

Debtsecuritiesthatare bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and arereported atfairvalue,with unrealized gainsand lossesrecognized through earningsin Investment income in theConsolidated Statements of Operations. Debtsecuritiesnot classified as held to maturity or as trading, are classified as available-for-sale, and are carried atfairvalue,with the unrealized gainsand losses, netoftax, includedinthe determinationofcomprehensive income andreported inthe Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n\nEquity securitieswith readily determinable fair values aremeasured at fair valuewith changesin the fair valuerecognized through netincomeand presentedwithin Investment income in theConsolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarilyby managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the useofderivative instruments. Specifically, the Company entersinto derivative instruments to manage exposures that arisefrombusinessactivities that result in the receipt or future payment of knownand uncertain cash amounts,the amount of which are determined by interest rates. The Company's derivative instrumentsare used to manage fluctuations in theamount, timing, anddurationofthe Company'sknownorexpected cash payments principally relatedto the Company'sborrowings.\n\nAllderivative instruments,whether designated in hedgingrelationships or not,are recorded on the accompanying ConsolidatedBalance Sheetsat their fair value. Theaccountingfor changesin the fair valueofderivatives dependsonthe intendeduse of thederivative, whether the Companyhas elected to designate a derivativein a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, andwhether thehedging relationshiphas satisfied the criteria necessary to applyhedge accounting. Derivatives designated andqualifying as a hedge of the exposure tovariability in expected future cashflows,orother types of forecasted transactions, are considered cashflowhedges. Hedge accountinggenerally provides for the matching of the timingofgainorlossrecognition on thehedging instrument with theearnings effect of the hedgedforecasted transactions in a cashflowhedge. The Companymay enter intoderivative contracts that are intended to economically hedgecertain risks, even though hedgeaccountingdoesnot applyor the Companyelectsnot to applyhedge accounting.\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate its interest rate risk on arelated financial instrument or forecasted\n\ntransaction, and the Companydesignatesthese interest rate swaps as cash flowhedges. Interest rate swapsdesignated as cash flow hedgesgenerally involvethe receipt of variable-rate amountsfrom a counterparty inexchange for the Companymaking fixed-rate payments over thelife ofthe agreements without exchange of the underlyingnotionalamount. The Company may also utilize cashflowhedgesto lockU.S.Treasuryrates in anticipation of future fixed-rate debt issuances.

Accordingly, theCompany owns only a long-term leaseholdorsimilar interestin these properties. Thebuilding and improvements constructedon the leased land are capitalized as Real estate assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.\n\n92\n\n## REGENCYCENTERSCORPORATIONAND REGENCYCENTERS,L.P.\n\nDecember 31, 2023 The Company formally documents all relationships betweenhedging instruments and hedged items, aswellas its risk management objectives andstrategies for undertaking varioushedge transactions.

All methods of assessing fair valueresultinageneralapproximation of value, andsuchvalue maynever actually be realized.\n\n## (f) Deferred Leasing Costs\n\nDeferred leasing costsconsist of costsassociated with leasing the Company's shopping centers, and arepresented net of accumulated amortization. Such costs are amortized over the period through lease expiration. If thelease is terminated early, theremaining leasingcosts arewritten off.\n\nUnder ASC Topic 842, the Company, as a lessor, mayonlydefer as initialdirect coststhe incrementalcosts of atenant's operating lease that wouldnot have been incurred if the lease hadnot been obtained. These costs generally consist of third partybrokerpayments. Non-contingent internal leasing and legalcosts associated with leasingactivitiesare expensed within Generaland administrative expenses.\n\n## (g) IncomeTaxes\n\nTheParentCompany believesitqualifies, andintends to continue to qualify, as a REITunder theCode. As a REIT, the ParentCompany will generally notbe subject to federalincometax,provided that distributions to its shareholders are at least equalto REITtaxable income. All wholly-owned corporate subsidiariesofthe Operating Partnership have elected to be a TRS or qualify as a REIT. The TRS's are subject tofederal and state income taxesand file separate taxreturns. As a pass through entity,the OperatingPartnership generally does not paytaxes,but its taxable incomeorlossisreportedbyits partners,ofwhich theParentCompany,asgeneral partnerand approximately 99.4%owner,isallocated its Pro-rata shareof tax attributes.\n\nThe Company accountsfor income taxes related to its TRS'sunder the asset and liability approach,which requires the recognitionofthe amount of taxespayable or refundable forthe current year and deferred tax assets andliabilitiesfor the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in thefinancial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between thefinancial statementand taxbasis of assets and liabilities usingenacted taxrates in effect forthe year in whichthe differences are expected to reverse. The Companyrecords netdeferred tax assets to theextentitbelievesitismorelikely thannot that theseassets will be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded to reducedeferred tax assets when it is believed that it is more likely than not that all or some portionof the deferred tax assetwill notberealized. The Company considers all availablepositiveand negativeevidence, including forecasts of future taxable income,the reversal of other existingtemporary differences, available netoperating loss carryforwards, tax planning strategies andrecentand projected results of operations in ordertomakethatdetermination.\n\nIn addition, tax positions are initially recognized in thefinancial statements when it is more likelythannot thepositionwill be sustainedupon examinationby the taxauthorities. Such taxpositions shallinitially andsubsequentlybe measured as the largest amount oftax benefit that has agreater than 50%likelihoodofbeing realized upon ultimate settlementwith the tax authority assumingfullknowledgeofthe position and relevant facts. TheCompany believesthatithas appropriatesupport for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its taxreturns and thatits accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years(2020and forwardfor federaland state) basedon an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax lawsapplied to the factsofeach matter.",

This methodology includesestimating an 'as-ifvacant' fairvalue of thephysical property,which includes land,building, and improvementsand also determines the estimated fair value of identifiableintangibleassets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above andbelow-market value of in-place leases. The fair market valueof the acquired operatingproperties isbased on avaluation prepared by Regencywith assistance of a third party valuation specialist. The third-party specialist utilized stabilized NOI andmarket specific capitalizationrates as theprimary valuation inputs indetermining thefairvalue of therealestateassets. The fair valueof land isgenerally basedon relevant market data,such asacomparison of thesubject site to similarparcels that have recently been sold or arecurrently being offeredon the market forsale. Management reviews the inputs used by thethird-party specialistaswellasthe allocationof the purchaseprice to ensure reasonableness and that theprocedures areperformed in accordancewithmanagement'spolicy. Management andthe third-partyvaluation specialistprepared their fair value estimates for eachof the operatingproperties acquired. Theallocationofthe purchase price described above requires asignificant amount of judgment andrepresents management's best estimateof the fair valueas of the acquisition date.\n\n96\n\n## REGENCYCENTERSCORPORATIONAND REGENCYCENTERS,L.P.\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nNotestoConsolidated FinancialStatements",

Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Company mayuse derivative financialinstruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, options,floors, andother interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge allor a portionofthe interest rate risk associated with its borrowings. Theprincipal objectiveof such arrangements is to minimize therisks and/or costs associated with theCompany's operatingand financial structureaswellastohedge specificanticipated transactions. The Companydoesnot intend to utilizederivatives for speculative transactions or purposesother than mitigationof interest raterisk. Theuse of derivative financial instruments carries certainrisks, including therisk thatthe counterparties to these contractualarrangements are not able to performunder theagreements. Tomitigatethisrisk, theCompany only enters into derivativefinancial instrumentswith counterpartieswith quality credit ratings.

These fairvalue measurements maximize theuse of observable inputs which are classified within Level2of thefairvalue hierarchy. However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assetor liability at the measurementdate, thefairvalue measurementreflects the Company's own judgmentsabout theassumptions that market participants woulduse in pricing the assetorliability.\n\nThe Company develops its judgmentsbased on thebestinformation available atthe measurementdate, including expected\n\ncashflows,appropriate risk-adjusteddiscountrates,and availableobservableand unobservable inputs. Service providers involved in fairvalue measurements areevaluated for competency and qualifications on an ongoingbasis. As considerable judgment is oftennecessary to estimate thefair value of these financial instruments, thefair valuespresented above arenot necessarily indicativeofamounts that will be realized upon dispositionofthe financialinstruments.\n\n109",

Changesin the value of securities are recorded within Net investment (income) loss in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations,and include unrealized gainsof$4.2 million for theyear endedDecember31, 2023,unrealized lossesof$8.0million for theyear endedDecember31, 2022 and unrealized gains of$1.7 millionfor theyear endedDecember31, 2021.\n\n## Available-for-Sale DebtSecurities\n\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities consist of investments incertificates of depositand corporatebonds, andare recorded at fair valueusing either recenttrade prices forthe identical debt instrument or comparable instrumentsby issuersofsimilar industry sector, issuer rating, and size, to estimate fair value, which are considered Level 2 inputs of thefairvalue hierarchy. Unrealized gainsorlossesonthese debt securities are recognized throughOther comprehensiveincome.\n\n## Interest Rate Derivatives\n\nThefairvalue of the Company's interest rate derivatives is determined usingwidely acceptedvaluation techniques including discounted cashflow analysison the expected cashflows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of thederivatives,including theperiodtomaturity,and uses observable market-based inputs,including interest rate curves and impliedvolatilities. TheCompany incorporates credit valuation adjustmentsto appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and therespective counterparty'snonperformance risk in thefairvalue measurements.\n\nAlthoughthe Companyhas determined that themajority of theinputsused tovalue its derivatives fall within Level2of the fair valuehierarchy,the credit valuationadjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihoodofdefault by theCompany and its counterparties. TheCompany has assessedthe significance of theimpact of thecreditvaluation adjustmentson the overallvaluation of itsderivativepositions andhas determined that thecreditvaluationadjustmentsare notsignificant to theoverall valuationofits interest rate swaps. As aresult, the Companydetermined that its interest rate swapsvaluation in its entirety isclassified in Level 2 of the fair valuehierarchy.\n\nThefollowing tables present the placement in the fair valuehierarchy of assets andliabilities that are measured at fair value on arecurring basis:\n\nFair ValueMeasurements as of December 31, 2023\n\n|                                   | Quoted Prices Significant   | Quoted Prices Significant                        | Quoted Prices Significant         | Quoted Prices Significant                 |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| (in thousands) Assets:            | Balance                     | in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) | Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) | Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) |\n| Securities                        | 37,039                      | 37,039                                           | -                                 | -                                         |\n| Available-for-sale debtsecurities | $ 14,953                    | -                                                | 14,953                            | -                                         |\n| Interest rate derivatives         | 14,213                      | -                                                | 14,213                            | -                                         |\n| Total                             | $ 66,205                    | 37,039                                           | 29,166                            | -                                         |\n| Liabilities:                      |                             |                                                  |                                   |                                           |\n| Interest rate derivatives         | $ (1,335)                   | -                                                | (1,335)                           | -                                         |\n\n110",

All awards arevalued atfairvalue, earndividends throughout the vestingperiod, andhavenovotingrights. Fair value ismeasured using thegrant date market pricefor alltime-basedorperformance-based awards.

Assumptions includehistoricvolatility overthe previous threeyearperiod, risk-free interestrates, and Regency's historic dailyreturn as comparedto the market index. Since the awardpayoutincludesdividend equivalents and the total shareholder return includes the valueofdividends,nodividendyield assumption is required forthe valuation.

These forward-looking statements are identified bythe use ofwords such as 'may,' 'will,' 'could,' 'should,' 'would,' 'expect,' 'estimate,' 'believe,' 'intend,' 'forecast, 'project,' 'plan,' 'anticipate,' 'guidance,' and othersimilarlanguage. However, the absence of these orsimilarwords or expressionsdoesnot mean a statement is not forwardlooking. While we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forwardlooking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance these expectations will be attained, and it is possible actual results may differmaterially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety ofrisks and uncertainties.\n\nOuroperations are subject to a numberofrisks and uncertaintiesincluding, but not limited to, those risk factorsdescribed in ourSEC filings.\n\nWhen considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and considerthese risks, together with all other information in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reportson Form 10-Qand ourother filings and submissionsto the SEC. If any ofthe events described in the risk factorsactually occur, ourbusiness, financial condition oroperating results, aswell asthe market price ofour securities, could be materially adversely affected. Forward-looking statements are only asofthe date they are made, and Regency undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements, whetherasaresult of newinformation, future events or developments or otherwise, except asrequired by law.\n\n140",
