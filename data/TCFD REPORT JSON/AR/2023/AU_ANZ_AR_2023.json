        "page_content": "## OUR OPERATING\n\n## ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Our operating environment\n\nThe environment in which we operate is characterised by a range of conflicting forces.\n\nEconomic activity and inflationary pressure have broadly moderated, resulting in an evolving peak in the most aggressive interest rate tightening cycle in more than a decade. This has reduced the risk of a deep recession, but a range of economic outcomes are still possible.\n\nChina has tracked a different path, with weak activity and a flirtation with deflation promoting policy easing. Economic activity in China continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate than has been the case in recent decades. The world's second largest economy remains an important source of\n\ndemand and business activity, even as its slowdown is contributing to businesses and investors examining other opportunities.\n\nUnemployment remains low and immigration has returned to Australia and New Zealand at record rates. These are supporting house price levels and demand for mortgages, even as consumer spending has moderated. Workforce shortages are not as acute, but input costs remain a challenge for many businesses.\n\nOn average, household balance sheets are strong and corporates hold high levels of liquidity. In some part this reflects the regulatory efforts of the past 15 years. This has reduced the level of delinquencies in the current interest rate tightening cycle, but also contributed to sustaining demand.\n\nPublic sector demand is strong across a range of sectors including infrastructure, defence, and housing. Housing affordability, in particular, has been subject to more vigorous policy action. Many governments are also active in addressing perceived supply chain vulnerabilities and prioritising domestic resilience.\n\nThe climate transition has gathered momentum. Over the past year Australia has introduced the safeguard mechanism, New Zealand has agreed methane should be taxed differently from carbon dioxide, the USA introduced the In/flation Reduction Act and in Europe the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism began administrative operation. This is altering patterns of economic activity, investment, and trade, and creating opportunities and challenges for banks.\n\n## Economic outlook\n\nThe year ahead is likely to be one of economic consolidation across ANZ's geographies. In Australia and New Zealand we expect somewhat slower growth and only modest movements in interest rates around the peak in the cycle. Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the full impact of interest rate increases is felt. Demand is also likely to be supported by strong household balance sheets, resilient housing markets, government activity, solid business investment intentions in Australia and strong migration in New Zealand. Modest increases in unemployment and underemployment, while disruptive for the individuals involved, should be sufficient to encourage inflation back towards target without undue delinquency stress. Both ANZ and the Reserve Bank of Australia expect to see inflation back at the top of the band by the end of 2025.\n\nIn China, weak demand has been the main challenge. Policy has responded, activity has begun to stabilise and inflation, though there are still deflationary pressures normalise. China's stabilisation will support the region as it copes with the effects of its own tightening cycle and weaker global demand.\n\n| Challenges                                             | Our response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| In/flationary pressures and  higher interest rates     | \u00b7 Assessing borrowers' resilience to rising interest rates \u00b7 Offering appropriate products and services to customers \u00b7 Dealing appropriately with customers experiencing financial hardship or in need of extra care \u00b7 Adjusting our staff salaries appropriately                                                                                                                     |\n| Public and regulatory  scrutiny                        | \u00b7 Building trust by 'doing what we say'  \u00b7 Working cooperatively with regulators, government and non-governmental organisations (NGOs)  \u00b7 Continuing to evolve our ESG policies and processes and seek to implement them effectively and  transparently disclose our progress                                                                                                         |\n| Competitive banking   industry                         | \u00b7 Deploying new and improved digital services, products and processes to help meet customer needs for  efficient and accessible banking \u00b7 Investing in underlying technology and systems to establish more flexible and responsive platforms  (including ANZ Plus and Institutional Payments and Cash Management Platforms)                                                           |\n| Cyber-security threats                                 | \u00b7 Ongoing investment in cyber-security, fraud and scams detection capabilities and raising customer  awareness as to the relevant risks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Geopolitical tension                                   | \u00b7 Contingency plans for our medium-to-higher risk jurisdictions with trigger events identified  and monitored                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Climate change and nature  including biodiversity loss | \u00b7 Providing sustainable banking and finance products and services, such as green and sustainability- linked loans and bonds, that drive the transition to a low carbon economy  \u00b7 Continuing to evolve our strategy, policies, processes, products and services to seek to manage the risks  and opportunities associated with climate change and nature, including biodiversity loss |",

        "page_content": "## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n2023 has seen an elevation of geopolitical tensions and continuing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. These continue to pose challenges to operating conditions. We recognise that our customers are similarly affected by these, as well as by additional challenges such as adverse weather events. Our risk management framework and practices have continued to evolve to meet such challenges.\n\n## External environment\n\nThe heightened geopolitical landscape with the ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, accompanied by the economic challenges relating to higher interest rates, inflation and real cost of living pressures continue to be the main drivers to create uncertainty for many of our customers. While households and businesses have been largely resilient to date, the Board and management continually monitor these developing conditions to set appropriate risk criteria for a range of potential scenarios. We have focused on the following to help support our customers and their financial resilience:\n\n- \u00b7 Global banking instability - Global financial stability risks increased during the year following the failure of some regional banks in the US and the regulator facilitated takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS. In the face of these events the broader global banking system has remained resilient. ANZ has navigated this challenging period from a position of strength as a profitable, well provisioned, strongly capitalised and highly liquid bank and is well placed to support our customers.\n- \u00b7 Home Loans and Consumer Lending -We continue to engage with our customers to help them better manage their home loans and personal finances. 70 per cent of our customers have paid additional funds to reduce their principal debt with almost half of those more than two years ahead on their repayments. Our portfolio customer credit scores have improved and we have consistently\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwritten new businesses at a higher average customer credit score. We have also proactively communicated with our customers to provide reassurance that, where required, we have options available to continue to support them. This includes additional support provided to customers facing natural disasters (for instance, the 2023 cyclones and floods in New Zealand).\n\n- \u00b7 Data Analytics - Data and analytics continue to play an important role in early identification of customers heading towards financial difficulty. Our analytics have focused on customer transaction data and the identification of customers that may need additional support. We are using data analytics to look at savings, credit, and offset accounts to better understand customers' financial behaviour and potential future outcomes. The analysis considers interest rate changes, increases in living expenses and cashflow. We continue to analyse our downturn indicators to understand, quantify, and address impacts to portfolio delinquency through tailored treatments to reduce customer financial difficulties/ delinquencies.\n\n## \u00b7 Financial health and Wellbeing -\n\n- Financial health and wellbeing is the guiding principle for our ANZ Plus App which provides tools and insights to help customers to have better visibility and control over their money. In addition, our targeted communication is designed to encourage at-risk customers to take steps to avoid falling behind on loan repayments and to contact ANZ as early as possible if they are experiencing financial difficulty. We have also identified common reasons customers provide for experiencing financial hardship, such as reduced income, medical illness, separation or over-commitment to assist with repayment management. We have also delivered proactive customer support including communications and webinars to help customers as they head into challenging economic times.",

        "page_content": "## Risk culture\n\nRisk culture is an important component of our organisational culture and underpins the shared values, behaviours and practices that influence how risk is considered in decision making.\n\nSignificant progress has been made in strengthening risk culture, with the Group achieving our target state. The Board and executive leadership teams have emphasised the importance of risk culture, providing strong leadership and oversight. This has resulted in outcomes that have further embedded our target risk behaviours and uplifted risk management in a number of key focus areas - particularly the group wide non-financial risk framework. The risk culture framework, with our Risk Principles at the core, outlines the approach to measure, assess, embed and govern risk culture. The approach assesses risk management behaviours and practice through consideration of an annual risk culture survey as well as frequent monitoring of business and risk metrics that provide insights about our risk culture. Risk culture maturity is assessed at the divisional and functional 1 level to assist the Board to form a view of our overall risk culture. Our Board Risk Committee receives half-yearly updates on plans and actions being taken to further improve our risk culture.\n\nMaintaining a sound risk culture is supported by alignment between our Risk Principles and organisational behaviours, training, and tools and resources to raise awareness of and embed the behaviours and practices that support our target risk culture.\n\nRisk culture is included as a performance objective for all Group Executives, and risk is a key element of the Group Performance Framework and Divisional/ individual performance scorecards for our people's performance and remuneration. Behaviours supporting the target risk culture are reinforced through the Enterprise Accountability Group (EAG) (see section 8 of the Remuneration Report with the Annual Report). We acknowledge individuals who role model outstanding risk behaviours through their efforts to identify, manage\n\nand mitigate the organisation's risks and contribute to our strong risk culture.\n\n## Financial crime\n\nWe continue to maintain an effective financial crime risk management program that anticipates and navigates criminal threats supported by the right people with the right tools. The Financial Crime portfolio continues to be responsible for ensuring that ANZ meets its regulatory obligations through its Anti-Money Laundering/ Counter Terrorism Finance and Sanction Programs, and for delivering enhanced detection, investigative and/or intelligence capability focusing on identifying, mitigating, and managing financial crime risk and protecting the community. We also maintain our partnership with the Australian Transaction Report and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC)-led Fintel Alliance to strengthen the finance industry's capability to tackle serious crimes and to better support police investigations.\n\nRefer to our ESG Supplement available at anz.com/annualreport for further information.\n\n## Scams\n\nWe are continually reviewing and adjusting our capabilities to keep customers safe as new scams emerge and cyber criminals change how they operate. In the last twelve months, our staff and our systems have stopped more than $100 million going to criminals and from April to September this year. We have has seen a 59% reduction in customer losses and a 38% increase in detected and prevented amounts. Investment in new technologies is critical as we continue to work to protect our customers and the community from fraud and scams. Our newest measures include:\n\n- \u00b7 The deployment of more than 170 new sophisticated algorithms that have helped to prevent $20m of customer scam losses across multiple payment channels.\n- \u00b7 A significant investment in a new capability using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning technology designed to detect accounts being used to receive funds from scam victims.\n- \u00b7 Preventing payments being made to particular high risk cryptocurrency platforms and introducing new holds and delays to some payment types and destinations.\n- \u00b7 Working with the major telcos to activate the Do Not Originate (DNO) service and to put in place measures that stop scammers from adopting the 'ANZ' label in text messages.\n\n## Non-/financial risk\n\nWe have made progress against our non-financial risk transformation agenda. Our improved Non-financial Risk Framework is uplifting both the effectiveness and efficiency of how we manage our nonfinancial risks ensuring we can operate our business well, support the right risk culture, save time and make things simpler. It is achieving this by being a holistic, standardised, integrated and automated framework with greater data-informed insights, enhanced operating model and capability uplift. This enables us to better anticipate and navigate a changing environment as we seek to protect our customers, shareholders and the community from harm.\n\n## Other risks\n\nWe manage and monitor risks in accordance with our Risk Management Framework (RMF). In addition to our key material risks - see below - three risks that we are paying particular attention to are:\n\nClimate-related risk : the Group's most material climate-related risks arise from lending to business and retail customers, which contributes to credit risk. These include the effect of extreme weather events on a customer's business or property including impacts to the cost and availability of insurance and insurance exclusions, changes to the regulatory and policy environment in which the customer operates, disruption from new technology and changes in demand towards low carbon products and services. Climaterelated risks may also indirectly affect a customer through impacts to its supply chains and customer base.",

        "page_content": "Our key material risk category of credit risk considers the risks associated with lending to customers that may be impacted by climate change, including physical and transition risks. Climate-related risks may also affect the ability of customers to repay debt, result in an increased probability of default, result in 'stranded assets', and impact the amount that the Group is able to recover due to the value or liquidity of collateral held as security being impaired. The Group may also face legal proceedings and suffer reputational damage if it acts inconsistently with public commitments in relation to climate change.\n\nWe continue to improve our management of climate-related risks and recently elevated climate-related risk as a key material risk within our RMF - refer below.\n\nWe are transitioning our lending with the goals of the Paris Agreement and supporting customers to reduce emissions and enhance their resilience to a changing climate. In this respect, we factor climate change risk into lending decisions for large business customers 1 , assessing their capacity to respond to climate change and the evolving regulatory landscape. We expect our existing large business customers in higher-emitting sectors such as energy, building products and transport to integrate climate change risk into their company strategies.\n\nFor details on the how we are improving our management of climate-related risks, how we govern climate-related risks and opportunities, performance against our climate targets and our new sectoral decarbonisation pathways set in accordance with our commitment to the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, refer to our 2023 Climate-related Financial Disclosures available at anz.com/annualreport . Our Climate Change Commitment is available at anz.com/esgreport.\n\nCybersecurity risk: As a bank, we handle a considerable amount of personal and confidential information about our customers across multiple geographies in which we operate. We continue to take the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsecurity of our bank, our customers and our customers' information very seriously. Our security strategy has helped build a mature security risk posture and operational cyber security capability commensurate with the size and extent of threats to us.\n\nCyber security threats continue to evolve, becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume and our approach draws on multiple layers of security testing and intelligence, seeking to ensure sustainable security practices to protect information and assets. We have layers of defence within the Group complemented by robust governance. We use industry benchmarking as well as a series of exercises to map and simulate potential threats. This helps us identify and better understand emerging threats, and adapt processes, technology and education to address the increase in customer fraud and scams. We maintain strong relationships and strategic partnerships with government, industry, community groups and law enforcement agencies locally and internationally to promote cyber security resilience across jurisdictions.\n\nWe are fostering a security-centric culture by providing staff education to help us to respond to the rapidly changing threat environment, as well as our customer education service to engage with and support our customers. We focus on raising customer awareness to cyber-threat risk. Our Cyber security centre also publishes a range of latest security alerts and protection approaches to assist our customers to avoid scams.\n\nBiodiversity risk: Biodiversity loss including as a result of species extinction or decline, ecosystem degradation and nature loss ('Biodiversity Loss') is an emerging risk which the Group is seeking to understand further. Biodiversity risks are closely linked to climate-related risks. Risks are likely to arise primarily from lending to customers that have material dependencies and/or whose actions may have negative impacts on nature, including biodiveristy. These risks can also arise from legal, and regulatory or policy, changes including potential\n\nreforms to halt and reverse forest loss, species extinction and land degradation. These changes may impact the Group directly, or indirectly through our customers.\n\nBiodiversity risk is recognised in our Climate Change Commitment and across our 'sensitive sector' lending policies. In line with our Social and Environmental Risk Policy, we expect our large business customers 1 to use, or mitigate towards internationally accepted industry practices to manage social, environmental and economic impacts, including potential impacts on nature. This year have continued to engage with 100 of our large emitting business customers to support them to implement and strengthen their lower carbon transition plans and enhance their efforts to protect biodiversity. We have also utilised the Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities Risks and Exposure (ENCORE) tool 2 to take initial steps to identify priority sectors and assess potential sector level biodiversity impacts and dependencies.\n\nFor details on our customer engagement, the ENCORE tool, including how we are upskilling our staff and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) pilot studies we have participated in this year, refer to our 2023 Climate-related Financial Disclosures available at anz.com/ annualreport. This year we have also sought to draw on the TNFD's recommendations to help inform our disclosures in this document.",

The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group's risk management policies. The Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities. The key pillars of our Group RMF include:\n\n- \u00b7 The Risk Management Strategy (RMS), which describes the approach for managing risk arising from the Group's purpose and strategy. The RMS includes: how the Risk function is structured to support the Group's purpose and strategy, and the execution of the Group Chief Risk Officer's prescribed responsibilities as an Accountable Person for ANZBGL under the Banking Executive Accountability Regime; the values, attitudes and behaviours required of employees in delivering on strategic priorities; a description of each material risk; and an overview of how the RMF addresses each material risk, with reference to the relevant policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how the Group identifies, measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and then either controls or mitigates the material risks and the oversight mechanism and/or committees in place.\n- \u00b7 The Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board's expectations regarding - for each material risk - the maximum level of risk the Group is willing to accept in pursuing its strategic objectives and its operating plans considering its shareholders', depositors' and customers' interests.\n- \u00b7 Risk Culture is an intrinsic part of the Group's RMF and underpins the values, attitudes and behaviours of our staff which drive the risk decisions we make.\n\nThe Group operates a Three Lines-ofDefence Model. Each line of defence has clearly defined roles, responsibilities and escalation paths to support effective risk management at ANZ. The three lines of defence model embeds a culture where risk is everyone's responsibility.\n\nThe business occupies the first line of defence responsibility for implementation and ongoing maintenance of the RMF including day-to-day ownership of risks and controls.\n\nThe Risk function (including Divisional/ functional and Group) form the second line of defence, providing independent oversight of the Group's risk profile and RMF, including effective challenge to activities and decisions that materially affect the Group's risk profile and assistance in developing and maintaining the RMF.\n\nInternal Audit is the third line of defence, providing independent evaluation and objective assurance on the appropriateness, effectiveness and adequacy of the Group's RMF.\n\nThe governance and oversight of risk management, whilst embedded in day-to-day activities, is also the focus of committees and regular forums across the Group (see diagram next page). The committees and forums discuss and monitor known and emerging risks, review management plans and monitor progress to address known issues.",

While climate change risk primarily manifests as financial risks, especially credit risk, it may also result in additional market, operational or other risks.\n\nOur understanding of climate-related risks continues to evolve and mature. On 9 November 2023 our Board Risk Committee approved that 'climate risk' will be elevated as a key material risk. This means going forward that we are further strengthening our enterprise-wide approach to managing climate risk. We are working to embed this change and expect to disclose our progress in our 2024 reporting. The table below discusses how climate-related risk has been managed and monitored during our 2023 financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further information about the principal risks and uncertainties that the Group faces, see our 'Principal Risks and Uncertainties' disclosure available at anz.com/shareholder/centre.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| RISK TYPE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | MANAGING THE RISK       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| The risk of loss arising from the Group failing   to maintain the level of capital required by  prudential regulators and other key stakeholders  (shareholders, debt investors, depositors, rating  agencies, etc.) to support the Group's | consolidated operations and risk appetite.

It is an industry-wide measure which enables comparison with our peer group. We calculate cash profit by adjusting statutory profit for non-core items. In general, it represents the financial performance of our core business activities. We use cash profit internally to set targets and incentivise our Senior Executives and leaders through our remuneration plans. Refer to page 21 for adjustments between statutory and cash profit. The adjustments made in arriving at cash profit are included in statutory profit which is subject to audit within the context of the external auditor's audit of the 2023 Financial Report. Cash profit is not subject to audit by the external auditor. Our external auditor has informed the Audit Committee that adjustments between statutory and cash profit have been determined on a consistent basis across each of the periods presented.\n\n## DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nThere are no discontinued operations in the current period. Profit/(Loss) from discontinued operations in the comparative periods relates to immaterial residual operational costs from divested wealth businesses and partial recovery of certain costs based on Transition Service Agreements, which ceased in April 2022.\n\n## ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW GROUP ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\n\nOn 3 January 2023, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZBGL) established by a scheme of arrangement, a non-operating holding company, ANZ Group Holdings Limited (ANZGHL), as the new listed parent holding company of the ANZ Group and implemented a restructure to separate ANZ's banking and certain non-banking businesses into the ANZ Bank Group and ANZ Non-Bank Group (Restructure). The ANZ Bank Group comprises the majority of the businesses and subsidiaries that were held in ANZBGL prior to the Restructure. The ANZ Non-Bank Group comprises banking-adjacent businesses developed or acquired by the ANZ Group to focus on bringing new technology and banking-adjacent services to the ANZ Group's customers, and a separate service company.\n\n## ANZGHL Financial Information\n\nAs a result of the Restructure, the ultimate holding company of ANZBGL is ANZGHL. A copy of the 2023 ANZGHL Annual Report can be accessed via the ANZ Shareholder Centre on website https://www.anz.com/shareholder/centre/reporting/.",

the Company from continuing operations increased $957 million (15%) compared with the 2022 financial year.\n\nNet interest income increased $1,701 million (11%) driven by a $65.5 billion (7%) increase in average interest earning assets and a 7 bps increase in net interest margin. The increase in average interest earning assets was driven by lending growth across all divisions, higher liquid assets and the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase of 7 bps was driven by favourable deposit margins, higher earnings on capital and replicating deposits, and favourable lending mix. This was partially offset by home loan pricing competition, unfavourable deposit mix, and Markets activities impacted by higher funding costs, primarily on commodity assets, where the related revenues are recognised as Other operating income.\n\nOther operating income increased $652 million (18%) primarily driven by an increase of $1,063 million in Markets other operating income from increased customer activity and more favourable trading conditions. This was partially offset by a $232 million decrease from business divestments/closures, $98 million of lower realised gains on economic hedges against foreign currency denominated revenue streams offsetting net favourable foreign currency translations elsewhere in the Group, and a $43 million decrease from the loss on disposal of data centres in Australia.\n\nOperating expenses increased $508 million (5%) driven by inflationary impacts, incremental costs associated with strategic initiatives, higher Suncorp Bank acquisition related costs, costs previously attributed to discontinued operations, and the initial levy under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme of Last Resort Levy Act 2023 (CSLR Levy). This was partially offset by productivity initiatives and investment reprioritisation.\n\nCredit impairment increased $477 million driven by increases in both collectively assessed and individually assessed credit impairment.\n\n22           ANZ 2023 ANNUAL REPORT",

Net interest margin increased driven by favourable deposit margins from a rising interest rate environment and higher earnings on capital and replicating portfolio. This was partially offset by unfavourable deposit mix with a shift towards lower margin term deposits, higher net funding costs and asset margin contraction from competitive pressure. Other operating income decreased driven by the gain on sale relating to the ANZ Worldline partnership in the prior year and lower impact of divested business results. This was partially offset by the loss on sale of the financial planning and advice business in the prior year, and higher cards revenue reflecting an increase in commercial spending. Operating expenses increased driven by inflationary pressure, incremental costs associated with strategic initiatives and higher restructuring expense, partially offset by lower costs post business divestment and productivity initiatives. Credit impairment charge increased driven by higher collectively assessed credit impairment, and higher individually assessed credit impairment charge.\n\n## Institutional\n\nLending momentum was sustained, with higher Markets balances partially offset by lower Transaction Banking volumes. Net interest margin ex-Markets increased driven by favourable deposit margins from a rising interest rate environment and higher earnings on capital and replicating portfolio. Other operating income increased primarily driven by higher Markets revenues from increased customer activity and more favourable trading conditions. Operating expenses increased driven by inflationary impacts and incremental costs associated with strategic initiatives, partially offset by productivity initiatives. Credit impairment release increased driven by release of collectively assessed credit impairment, and release of individually assessed credit impairment due to write-back of a single name exposure.\n\n## New Zealand\n\nLending volumes increased driven by home loan growth, partially offset by contraction in business lending. Net interest margin increased driven by favourable deposit margins from a rising interest rate environment. This was partially offset by asset margin contraction from competitive pressure and unfavourable deposit mix with a shift towards lower margin term deposits. Other operating income decreased driven by gain on sale of government securities in 2022 and lower cards revenue due to regulatory changes introduced in November 2022. Operating expenses increased driven by inflationary pressure and customer remediation provision release in the prior year. Credit impairment charge increased driven by increase in collectively assessed credit impairment and increase in individually assessed credit impairment due to lower write-backs and recoveries.\n\n## Pacific\n\nCash profit increased driven by higher net interest margin, loss on the planned closure of ANZ American Territories in 2022, and higher credit impairment release due to higher write-backs.\n\n## Group Centre\n\n2023 included the recycling of foreign currency translation reserves (FCTR gain) from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on dissolution of a number of legal entities, a loss on sale of data centres in Australia, transaction related costs, and the initial CSLR Levy. 2022 included the recycling of FCTR loss from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on dissolution of a number of legal entities, and a net charge on lease modification impacts of a significant lease arrangement.\n\nANZ 2023 ANNUAL REPORT           29\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOUR PERFORMANCE\n\n(continued)",

ANZ implemented these new requirements from 1 January 2023. The application of APRA Capital Reform reduced RWA by $34.5 billion, equivalent to a 100 bps CET1 ratio benefit.

It increased 105 bps driven by cash earnings, and APRA Capital Reform impacts. This was partially offset by the impact of dividends paid during the year, underlying RWA movement, capital deductions and surplus capital transferred to ANZGHL as part of the Restructure.\n\nAt 30 September 2023, the Group's APRA leverage ratio was 5.4% which is above the 3.5% proposed minimum for internal ratings-based approach ADI (IRB ADI), which includes ANZ.\n\n## Dividends\n\nANZBGL paid the following dividends during the year:\n\n- \u00b7 $2,213 million final dividend to ANZ shareholders on 15 December 2022;\n- \u00b7 $1,000 million special dividend to its intermediate holding company, ANZ BH Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of ANZGHL, as part of the Restructure on 3 January 2023; and\n- \u00b7 $2,387 million interim dividend to ANZ BH Pty Ltd on 3 July 2023.\n\nOn 10 November 2023, the Directors proposed a final dividend of $2,825 million be paid on 22 December 2023, to ANZ BH Pty Ltd.\n\nFurther details on dividends provided for or paid during the year ended 30 September 2023 are set out in Note 6 Dividends in the Financial Report.\n\n32           ANZ 2023 ANNUAL REPORT",

Our performance highlights are contained in the Chairman and CEO's messages within the Annual Report.\n\nThe Group achieved a total shareholder return (TSR) of 20% over the past financial year with contribution from both share price appreciation and dividends paid. ANZ's three-year TSR was 76%.\n\nThe team has produced good year-on-year outcomes while investing in a number of longer-term strategic initiatives that will position us well for the future. This includes\n\nongoing investment in our Retail Platform ANZ Plus which at the end of 2023 had 465K customers and $9.4bn in deposits, growth in our industry leading high returning Institutional Payments Cash Management and Platform Services businesses and in our Commercial business which delivered close to 20% of ANZ's Group Profit.\n\nThe Group maintained a high degree of risk discipline during this volatile period with the foundational work completed over prior years positioning us well to manage financial and non-financial risk in a considered and thoughtful way. There was a material uplift in the work to embed a non-financial risk framework, and other risk related programs remain on track despite their complexity.\n\nOur employee engagement score has remained the highest in the Australian banking sector and improved even further to now sit equal to the world's best companies in any industry. We have made substantial progress in hiring and promoting women into leadership roles, and significantly, three of our four Divisions are now led by women.\n\n## 2023 variable remuneration outcomes\n\nAs a Board, we believe we have appropriately recognised the results achieved by the executive team who have delivered a strong result for the bank and shareholders, in a challenging environment.\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Shayne Elliott, performed well this year and in the Board's view deserves an assessment of well above target for his personal objectives. He also has ultimate accountability for the broader Group's performance which was assessed as above target.\n\nThe Board determined the appropriate 2023 Short Term Variable Remuneration (STVR) outcome was 96% of his maximum opportunity (120% of target opportunity). This is the first above target STVR award for the CEO since commencing in the role in 2016.\n\n2023 Long Term Variable Remuneration (LTVR) was the first LTVR award under our new executive remuneration structure. A recap of the remuneration structure (to ensure compliance with APRA CPS 511 Remuneration), is summarised in section 3.2. The CEO's proposed 2024 LTVR of $3.375m will be subject to a shareholder vote at the upcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM).\n\nFor Disclosed Executives, the Board approved 2023 STVR outcomes which range from 80% to 100% of maximum opportunity (average 89%). This reflects their individual and Divisional performance and the above target assessment for Group performance. 2023 LTVR (50% performance rights and 50% restricted rights) was awarded at full opportunity at the start",

There were no further increases except for the Group Executive, Technology & Group Services who received a market adjustment reflecting the expansion of responsibilities effective 1 November 2022.\n\n## Changes to the way we remunerate executives\n\nFor future LTVR awards of performance rights (i.e., these changes apply from financial year 2024 and do not apply to awards currently on foot), the Board has approved that:\n\n- \u00b7 for the relative TSR hurdle: DBS Bank Limited to be removed from the Select Financial Services (SFS) comparator group to better balance the weighting of international peers in our comparator group;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIlana Atlas, AO Chair - Human Resources Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 for the absolute Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) TSR hurdle: CAGR targets to be based on the time weighted cost of capital over the four-year performance period (rather than the cost of capital at the start of the period), to better reflect cyclical factors impacting shareholders for improved shareholder alignment.\n\nSee section 7.2.5 for detail.\n\n## Non-Executive Director (NED) fees\n\nWhile there were no changes to NED fees for 2023, some uplifts for 2024 have been approved. For 2024, there is no uplift to the Board Chair fee, a 2% uplift to the NED member fee (noting that this is the first increase since 2016), and uplifts to fees for Committee chairs and members (see section 9.1).\n\nThis was a year of good performance, where we achieved good results in the year, while also making significant progress towards creating long-term value. Thank you to all our employees for their commitment and contribution this year.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I invite you to consider our Remuneration Report which will be presented to shareholders at the 2023 AGM.\n\n## CONTENTS\n\n| 1.

This report has been prepared, and audited, as required by the Corporations Act 2001 .

The outcome also aligns strongly with the shareholder experience (see section 4.2.2).\n\nOverall, the Board view that an 'above target' assessment accurately reflects overall performance in 2023, noting that STVR outcomes for the CEO and Disclosed Executives also take into consideration performance against individual objectives.\n\n## OVERALL ASSESSMENT\n\n## Assessment: Above target\n\nThe above target assessment appropriately reflects our performance with all business lines each contributing strongly together to achieve above target financial results and strong performance against our strategic objectives - positioning ANZ well for the future.\n\n1. The Group's results include a number of items collectively referred to as large/notable items. Given the nature and significance they are considered separately given the target was established without consideration of large notables. 2. Economic profit is a risk adjusted profit measure used to evaluate business unit performance and is not subject to audit by the external auditor. Economic profit is calculated via a series of adjustments to cash profit with the economic credit cost adjustment replacing the accounting credit loss charge; the inclusion of the benefit of imputation credits (measured at 70% of Australian tax) and an adjustment to reflect the cost of capital. The economic profit increase in 2023 was driven by higher cash profit, favourable economic credit cost adjustment and higher imputation credits, partially offset by higher cost of capital. 3.

The Group uses cash profit 1 as a measure of performance for the Group's ongoing business activities, as this provides a basis to assess Group and Divisional performance against earlier periods and against peer institutions. The adjustments made in arriving at cash profit are included in statutory profit which is subject to audit. Although cash profit is not audited, the external auditor has informed the Audit Committee that the cash profit adjustments have been determined on a consistent basis across each period presented.\n\nStatutory profit is flat compared to the prior financial year, while cash profit from continuing operations has increased almost 14%.

The Board decides the CEO's variable remuneration outcomes separately to help mitigate potential conflicts of interest. See section 10.1.3.\n\nAt the end of each financial year the Board exercise their judgement to determine a fair and reasonable ANZIP pool. An assessment of financial performance guides the pool range but it is not a formulaic outcome. The Board considers a range of factors including:\n\n- \u00b7 The ANZ Group Performance Framework assessment (see section 4.1).\n- \u00b7 The quality of earnings and operating environment.\n- \u00b7 The shareholder experience during 2023 such as shareholder returns and dividend comparison with prior periods.\n- \u00b7 Our Reward Principles such as attract, motivate and keep great people (see section 7).\n\nAnnual performance objectives are set at the Group and also at the Divisional/ individual level at the start of each year. They are designed to be stretching yet achievable. The HR Committee and the Board make variable remuneration outcome decisions for the CEO and Disclosed Executives following lengthy and detailed discussions and assessment, supported by comprehensive analysis of performance from a number of sources.\n\nWhere expectations are met, STVR is likely to be awarded around 80% of maximum opportunity. Where performance is below expectations, STVR will be less (potentially down to zero), and where above expectations, STVR will be more (potentially up to maximum opportunity).\n\nLTVR will be awarded at the beginning of the year, based on full opportunity unless the LTVR RR pre grant assessment results in any reduction (and is also subject to shareholder approval for the CEO).\n\nRemuneration outcomes have been presented in the following three ways:\n\n## i. RECEIVED remuneration\n\n(see section 5.1)\n\n## ii. AWARDED remuneration\n\n(see sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4)\n\n## iii. STATUTORY remuneration\n\n(see section 11.1)\n\n## 5.1 2023 Received remuneration\n\nThis table shows the remuneration the CEO and Disclosed Executives actually received in relation to the 2023 financial year as cash paid, or in the case of prior equity awards, the value which vested in 2023.\n\nFR adjustments were received by Disclosed Executives in accordance with the executive remuneration structure changes made in 2022, as disclosed in the 2022 Remuneration Report. There were no other adjustments to FR for Disclosed Executives in 2023, apart from the Group Executive, Technology & Group Services whose FR was increased on 1 November 2022 from $1.15m to $1.25m to reflect the expansion of responsibilities and to improve alignment with the market.\n\n## 2023 Received remuneration - CEO and Disclosed Executives:\n\nReceived value includes the value of prior equity awards which vested in that year\n\nOther deferred\n\n|                                      | Fixed   remuneration $               | Cash variable  remuneration $        | Total cash $                         | Deferred variable  remuneration which  vested during the year 1 $   | remuneration   which vested  during the year1 $   | Actual  remuneration  received 2 $   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| CEO AND CURRENT DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES | CEO AND CURRENT DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES | CEO AND CURRENT DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES | CEO AND CURRENT DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES |                                                                     |                                                   |                                      |\n| S Elliott                            | 2,500,000                            | 1,160,000                            | 3,660,000                            | 919,413                                                             | -

After several years focused on simplification of ANZ (disposal of businesses and internal re-structures), ANZ has moved to driving sustainable growth in each of the core businesses. Pleasingly, ANZ's record financial performance in 2023 was contributed to by each of the four core business divisions. The CEO's deliverables highlight that the key strategic building blocks are in place to support long-term performance.\n\nThe CEO has focused on executing and delivering sustainable growth in our core businesses. Key results include:\n\n- \u00b7 ANZ Plus being the fastest growing new bank platform in Australia, including exceeding targets related to the number of active customers, funds under management and Net Promoter Scores\n- \u00b7 Executing the Commercial strategy, with the new Division performing strongly - in large part due to the CEO's stewardship of this business (pre appointment of GE, Australia Commercial)\n- \u00b7 Exceeding our ambitions to grow sustainability as a source of revenue through a range of sustainability banking activities such as, labelled sustainable finance (e.g., green and sustainability linked loans, bonds and guarantees), and banking activities to fund and facilitate the transition to a net zero economy (e.g., green buildings, renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure)\n- \u00b7 Recovery of home lending momentum, with growth exceeding 1x system target\n- \u00b7 Improving share on Institutional payment platforms, with overall payments growing by ~8%\n- \u00b7 Building digital ecosystems in support of the broader strategy (e.g., investments in View Media Group, DOT Loves Data and Pollination, and appointment of a new CEO in Cashrewards)\n\nThere has been continued strong risk discipline championed by the CEO, with emphasis on the right behaviours to identify, discuss, and act on risks the bank confronts and takes. Strengthening operational excellence and resilience has been a key focus of the CEO. Examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 Clear progress in the build of a Group wide non-financial risk framework (with strong business leadership)\n- \u00b7 Executed a very ambitious change agenda (e.g., technology uplift programs, ANZ Plus, NOHC implementation, Suncorp acquisition, Platform Services, major regulatory programs)\n- \u00b7 Demonstration of strong cyber resilience, and positive achievements in the area of financial crime\n- \u00b7 Delivery of BS111 (the first of any New Zealand bank) and the launch of Ng\u0101 Tapuwae2 in NZ to unlock future growth in New Zealand\n\nA key strength of the CEO is his strong advocacy and role modelling of ANZ's values and behaviours - create opportunities, deliver what matters, succeed together - as evidenced by all business lines contributing strongly to achieve a great performance outcome. The CEO's leadership translates into continuing high employee engagement (87%) - which is equal to the Global Best In Class across all industries. Similarly, ANZ's 'Speak Up' index at 84% reflects continued efforts to encourage a culture\n\nwhere people feel they can challenge each other respectfully.\n\nThe CEO continues to demonstrate his ability to communicate effectively and authentically with stakeholder groups - shareholders, employees, customers, regulators, government and the community (including non-profit and environmental groups). He is regarded as a thought and industry leader both internally and externally, and engages regularly with employees and the community at large, via multiple communication and media channels, parliamentary hearings, and through proactive relationship management.\n\nThe CEO has played a key role in leading the Suncorp acquisition initiative, and has been a strong advocate of the benefits and opportunities for ANZ, our customers in Queensland, and the broader community. While the ACCC rejected ANZ's application, the CEO has ensured ANZ is well prepared for the integration of Suncorp Bank into ANZ in the event its application for Australian Competition tribunal review is successful.\n\nThe strong performance in 2023 reflects the effective support provided by the CEO to ExCo, along with key moves and appointments made to his team over the last 1 to 2 years. Executive succession and development continue to be a focus for the CEO and the Board, with the CEO making solid progress in enabling potential internal CEO successors in the future.\n\nOverall there were many positive achievements in 2023 (positioning ANZ well to deliver against our strategic priorities), and in the Board's view the CEO deserves an overall assessment outcome of well above target.",

In 2023, STVR is at or above target for all Disclosed Executives (reflecting that they have all jointly delivered material value from strategic and operational decisions in 2023); however only 2 of 38 Disclosed Executives in recent reporting periods (2018 to 2022) received at or above target variable remuneration. See section 5.4 for 2023 variable remuneration awarded details.\n- \u00b7 The average STVR outcome for current Disclosed Executives is 89% of maximum opportunity. This reflects both the overall assessment of ANZ Group performance as above target (see section 4.1), which is weighted 25% or 50%, and also individual performance (see section 6.2) which is weighted 75% or 50% depending on role. Outcomes range from 80% to 100% of maximum opportunity. The remuneration outcomes in 2023 reflect that this is a high performing team, with all business and enablement functions each contributing significantly to a strong performance outcome for ANZ.\n- \u00b7 2023 STVR awarded outcomes for both C Morgan and A Strong are based on their time as a Disclosed Executive during 2023 (i.e., ~7 months and ~11 months respectively).\n- \u00b7 R Howell's 2023 STVR awarded outcome reflects the period acting as the GE T&C (i.e., ~4 months).\n\n## Awarded STVR in the relevant /financial year - Disclosed Executives\n\n|                              |

As non-cash components are subject to future vesting outcomes, the awarded value may be higher or lower than the future realised value.\n\nAwarded remuneration appears significantly higher in 2023, largely because no LTVR was awarded for 2022 (as we transitioned to the new remuneration structure and moved to awarding LTVR at the start (rather than end) of the financial year). Note, STVR is awarded at the end of the year.\n\nReceived remuneration reflects the actual remuneration received in the year (i.e., cash paid and the value of previously awarded STVR deferred shares and LTVR performance rights which vested in the year).\n\nThe amount received is lower in 2023 (compared to 2022), primarily due to there being no LTVR due to vest in 2023 due to changing from a three to four-year performance period in Nov/Dec 2019.\n\nStatutory remuneration reflects remuneration in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards which includes FR and the amortised accounting value of variable remuneration, not the actual awarded or received value in respect of the relevant financial year (i.e., includes the value of STVR and LTVR expensed in the year). This is different to remuneration received in 2023 (which includes prior year awards which vested).\n\n|      | Fixed   remuneration  $   | STVR  $   | LT VR   $   | Total   remuneration  $   | Total   remuneration  $   | Total   remuneration  $   |\n|------|---------------------------|-----------|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| 2023 | 2,500,000                 | 2,400,000 | 3,375,000   | 8,275,000                 | 4,579,413                 | 6,186,508                 |\n| 2022 | 2,500,000                 | 1,860,000 | n/a         | 4,360,000                 | 6,000,069                 | 5,489,133                 |\n\n## Historical STVR and LTVR\n\nThis table shows the STVR as a % of maximum opportunity and LTVR vesting outcomes for the CEO over the last five years.

Prior to 2022, the maximum STVR opportunity for the CEO was 150% of target, however under the new structure (effective from 2022) this was reduced to 125% of target, therefore the 2022 and 2023 STVR % of maximum opportunity of 74% and 96% respectively is not comparable with prior years.

Both the ANZ Group Performance Framework and individual strategic objectives are agreed by the Board at the start of the financial year and are stretching.\n\n## WEIGHTING OF FINANCIAL METRICS\n\n## STVR\n\nThe CEO's STVR is not formulaic outcomes are moderated by the Risk element of the ANZ Group Performance Framework and the Board's judgement on the appropriate STVR considering all aspects of performance.\n\n## LTVR\n\nTSR (both relative and absolute) continue to determine the outcome of LTVR PR (50% LTVR weighting). However, LTVR also includes a 50% weighted RR award that is primarily focused on risk-based measures (as part of the pre grant and pre vest assessments - see section 7.2.4). This ensures LTVR has a material weight to non-financial measures as required under the APRA Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration .\n\nAt the end of the financial year, ANZ's performance is assessed against the ANZ Group Performance Framework, and the CEO's performance is also assessed against this, along with his individual strategic objectives, the ANZ values (behaviours), delivery of the BEAR obligations and ANZ's risk and compliance standards. In conducting the CEO's performance assessment, the HR Committee seeks input from the Chairman, CRO (on risk management), CFO (on financial performance), GE T&C (on talent and culture matters) and Group General Manager Internal Audit (GGM IA) (on internal audit matters). Material risk, audit and conduct\n\nevents that have either occurred or come to light in the year are also considered, together with input from both the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board.\n\n## 6.2 Disclosed Executive performance\n\nAt the start of each year, stretching performance objectives are set in the form of Divisional Performance Frameworks for each of our Disclosed Executives, in alignment with the ANZ Group Performance Framework approved by the Board.\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the performance of each Disclosed Executive 1 is assessed against the ANZ Group Performance Framework (25% to 50% weighting), their Divisional Performance Framework, ANZ's values (behaviours), delivery of BEAR obligations and ANZ's risk and compliance standards.\n\nThe ANZ Group Performance Framework weighting for Disclosed Executives reinforces the importance of collective accountability and contribution to Group outcomes. The respective 2023 weighting varies based on role focus:\n\n- \u00b7 50% Group performance weighting: CFO, GE Strategy & Transformation, GE T&C, and GE Technology & Group Services\n- \u00b7 25% Group performance weighting: CRO, GE Australia Retail, GE Australia Commercial, GE & CEO New Zealand, and GE Institutional\n\nSimilar to the ANZ Group Performance Framework, the Divisional Performance Frameworks include the key elements of Financial Discipline and Operational Resilience, Customer, and People and Culture, with Risk acting as a modifier. 2 The weighting of each element varies to reflect the responsibilities of each individual's role. The Financial Discipline and Operational Resilience element weightings range from 20% to 40%.\n\nThe HR Committee seeks input from the CEO, and independent reports from Risk,\n\nFinance, Talent and Culture, and Internal Audit, and also reviews material risk, audit and conduct events, and seeks input from both the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board.\n\nThe HR Committee reviews and recommends to the Board for approval the overall performance outcomes for each Disclosed Executive.\n\n## STVR and LTVR\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the CEO and HR Committee determine STVR recommendations for each Disclosed Executive, which are ultimately approved by the Board. 3 STVR varies year-on-year in line with performance - it is not guaranteed and may be adjusted up or down ranging from zero to a maximum opportunity.\n\nAs highlighted in section 4, performance against objectives impacts STVR outcomes (e.g., where expectations are met, STVR is likely to be awarded around target which equates to 80% of maximum opportunity). The degree of variance in individual STVR outcomes reflect the weighting of the Group component (i.e., roles with 50% Group weighting will generally have less differentiation), and relative performance of the different areas/individuals, ensuring appropriate alignment between performance and reward. The outcomes demonstrate the at risk nature of STVR, and that outcomes vary across the Disclosed Executives and also from year to year. The average 2023 STVR for Disclosed Executives is 89% of maximum opportunity (ranging from 80% to 100%).\n\nLTVR under the new remuneration structure was awarded for the first time in 2023, with a pre grant assessment (focused on risk measures) resulting in a full RR award. A pre vest assessment will determine the number of RR that ultimately vest, and performance against TSR hurdles will determine the level of vesting of PR. LTVR (RR and PR) is designed to strengthen the alignment of executive interests with shareholders, and PR provide a strong link between the reward for executive performance and TSR returns over the next four-year period.",

It also needs to consider the experience and expectations of a range of stakeholders (including shareholders, customers, employees, community and regulators).\n- \u00b7 Attract, motivate and keep great people: In determining remuneration outcomes, the Board acknowledges the importance of balancing performance with being market competitive to ensure retention of key talent - particularly in a competitive talent landscape.\n- \u00b7 Focus on how things are achieved as much as what is achieved: The Board ensures that appropriate consideration and weight is given to performance against objectives (which includes a risk\n\nmodifier), a risk assessment (capturing financial and non-financial risks), and how that performance was achieved (i.e., in accordance with our values and purpose).\n\n- \u00b7 Fair and simple to understand: Variable remuneration should be fair and consistent through the cycle and have regard to external influences outside of management's control.\n\nVariable remuneration outcomes are based on a range of measures (as illustrated overleaf), with material weight provided to non-financial measures in accordance with Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration . Our variable remuneration approach has a strong focus on driving long-term sustainable outcomes for shareholders. For example, STVR outcomes include a number of objectives that are considered key drivers of shareholder value, and the significant weighting to the LTVR component (around 60% of VR) as well as 50% of STVR delivered as ANZ shares, aligns a large proportion of executive remuneration to the shareholder experience (in respect of the share price and dividend).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Maximum variable remuneration opportunity is 200% of FR for the CRO. The remuneration mix is 33.3% FR/33.3% STVR/33.3% LTVR.\n\n## Acting GE T&C\n\nDue to the acting nature of R Howell's appointment his remuneration arrangements differ to other Disclosed Executives. For the time spent in this acting role, his FR was set at $700k per annum from 1 June 2023 and increased to $703k from 1 July 2023 (due to the impact of the Superannuation Guarantee rate change). His VR maximum opportunity was set at\n\n150% of FR (his remuneration mix is therefore 40% FR/60% VR). His VR will be delivered as 60% cash and 40% as shares deferred over years 4 to 5 to ensure compliance with CPS 511 deferral requirements.\n\n## 7.2 Variable remuneration delivery\n\nVariable remuneration for the CEO and the Disclosed Executives (excluding the CRO and Acting GE T&C) is delivered as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 STVR as 50% cash and 50% shares deferred equally over years 2 and 3; and\n- \u00b7 LTVR as RR and PR deferred over:\n- - year 4 (33%), year 5 (33%) and year 6 (34%) for the CEO; and\n- - year 4 (50%) and year 5 (50%) for Disclosed Executives.\n\nBoth RR and PR are tested against the relevant performance condition at the end of the four-year performance period and are then subject to additional holding period(s) until the completion of the respective deferral periods.\n\nAt target performance, 63% of variable remuneration for the CEO and Disclosed Executives, and 56% of variable remuneration for the CRO is deferred for at least four years (from the date the Board approved the variable remuneration in October (and the date shareholders approve the CEO's LTVR)), noting that this complies with the BEAR minimum deferral requirement of 60% for the CEO and 40% for Disclosed Executives. If the CEO receives above target STVR (as is the case in 2023), the amount above target will be delivered as 40% cash and 60% deferred shares (20% year 4, 20% year 5, 20% year 6) to ensure compliance with the minimum deferral requirements with respect to BEAR and APRA's Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration.\n\nBefore any scheduled release of deferred remuneration, the Board considers whether malus should be applied to previously deferred remuneration (or further deferral of vesting), or clawback to variable remuneration previously granted, for the CEO and Disclosed Executives.

We grant deferred shares in respect of performance for the financial year ending 30 September in late November each year.\n\nFor deferred variable remuneration for the CEO and Disclosed Executives, we calculate the number of deferred shares to be granted based on the VWAP of the shares traded on the ASX in the five trading days leading up to and including 1 October (i.e., in line with the beginning of the financial year). Allocations prior to the 2022 financial year were based on the VWAP in the five trading days leading up to and including the date of grant.

The Board reviews and approves the absolute TSR targets each year for the PR award. When reviewing the targets, the Board references ANZ's assessed Cost of Capital (CoC). The CoC is determined using methodologies including the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The CoC is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect current market conditions. Due to the prospective nature of the 2023 PR and given the increased volatility in the 10-year bond rate, the Board determined it was appropriate to use the 2H average CoC as the CAGR TSR target for the 2023 PR.\n\n| If the absolute CAGR of our TSR                   | then the percentage of 2023 PR that vest                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| is less than 9.125%                               | is nil                                                                           |\n| is 9.125%                                         | is 50%                                                                           |\n| reaches at least 9.125%, but is less than 13.688% | is progressively increased on a pro-rata, straight-line,  basis from 50% to 100% |\n| reaches or exceeds 13.688%                        | is 100%                                                                          |\n\nFor future LTVR awards of PR (i.e., from financial year 2024), the CAGR TSR hurdle will be based on the time weighted CoC over the four-year performance period of the PR. Therefore, the CAGR TSR target will be adjusted on a time weighted basis unless the Board applies discretion not to adjust. The CoC will be reviewed by the Board on a quarterly basis based on the output from the CAPM methodology (which takes into consideration the risk-free bond rate, the market risk premium and the beta - i.e., the volatility of ANZ's historical share price relative to the market). Any CoC changes approved by the Board throughout the performance period are prospective only (i.e., reflect current market factors) and will form part of the dynamic absolute TSR target calculation. Moving to a dynamic target that reflects the changes in CoC over the performance period (rather than a static target at the beginning of the performance period), is more responsive to changes in both interest rates and risks, and is considered more appropriate and fairer from both an investor and executive perspective, and supports better shareholder alignment.\n\nWhen calculating performance against TSR, we:\n\n- \u00b7 reduce the impact of share price volatility - by using an averaging calculation over a 90-trading day period for start and end values;\n- \u00b7 ensure an independent measurement - by engaging the services of an external organisation, to calculate ANZ's performance against both the absolute and relative TSR hurdles; and\n- \u00b7 test the performance against the relevant hurdle once only at the end of the four-year performance period the rights lapse if the performance hurdle is not met - there is no retesting.\n\n## 7.3 Downward adjustment - Board discretion\n\nThe Board can exercise its discretion to apply a number of downward adjustment options as part of consequence management (in accordance with applicable law and any terms and conditions provided). The Board may choose to exercise the following options or a combination of these at any time, but will always consider their use if any of the circumstances specified by Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration occur. The downward adjustment options specified in #1 to #3 below are applicable to all employees, while clawback (#4) in 2023 is currently limited to select employees (primarily the CEO, Disclosed Executives and some senior employees in jurisdictions where clawback regulations apply):\n\n- 1. In year adjustment , the most common type of downward adjustment, which reduces the amount of variable remuneration an employee may have otherwise been awarded for that year.\n- 2. Further deferral/freezing delays the decision to pay/allocate variable remuneration, or further defers the vesting of deferred remuneration or freezes vested/unexercised shares and rights. This would typically only be considered where an investigation is pending/underway.\n- 3. Malus is an adjustment to reduce the value of all or part of deferred remuneration before it has vested. Malus is used in cases of more serious performance or behaviour issues. Any and all variable remuneration we award or grant to an employee is subject to ANZ's on-going and absolute discretion to apply malus and adjust variable remuneration downward (including to zero) at any time before the relevant variable remuneration vests.\n- 4. Clawback is the recovery of variable remuneration that has already vested or been paid (up to two years from vesting/payment or a longer period as determined by Board discretion, policy or applicable law). This would typically only be considered if the other types of downward adjustment/other consequences are considered inadequate given the severity of the situation.\n\nBefore any scheduled vesting of deferred remuneration, the Board (for the CEO, Disclosed Executives and other specified roles) and/or the Enterprise Accountability Group (EAG) (for other employees) considers whether any further deferral, malus, or clawback should be applied. See section 8 for details.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It operates under the delegated authority of the HR Committee and is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 supporting the Board in monitoring the implementation and ongoing effectiveness of ANZ's A&CF;\n- \u00b7 reviewing the most material risk, conduct and audit events for accountability and the application of consequences, where appropriate;\n- \u00b7 providing guidance to the Divisions and considering initiatives across the Divisions to strengthen risk behaviours;\n- \u00b7 acknowledging material positive risk events and recognising risk role models, whose achievements are profiled across the organisation; and\n- \u00b7 approving the release or application of downward adjustment for deferred variable remuneration (noting that for the CEO and Disclosed Executives this is approved by the Board).\n\n## 8.2 Material positive risk events\n\nThe EAG review material positive risk decisions and events - times when our proactive approach to identifying and mitigating risk have had a material positive outcome. Reviewing these examples provides an opportunity to acknowledge the importance of these events and share learnings across the enterprise.\n\n## 8.3 Risk role models\n\nIn 2023, 81 individuals were recognised by the EAG for role modelling outstanding risk behaviours through their efforts to identify, manage and mitigate the organisation's risks and contribute to our strong risk culture. Recognition provided included a personalised e-mail from the CEO, local recognition events, and having their achievement profiled on our intranet and in internal newsletters.\n\n## 8.4 Compliance with Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration\n\nANZ's A&CF is an integral part of our enterprise approach to meeting the requirements of APRA Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration.\n\nWe introduced clawback provisions for the CEO and our Disclosed Executives effective 2022, in addition to existing downward adjustment tools such as in year adjustment, further deferral and malus.\n\nIn 2023, we have continued to raise employee awareness with respect to accountability and consequences through explicit references to the A&CF (including remuneration consequences) in employee training and communications and performance and remuneration policy documents.\n\nIn addition, as part of our annual performance and remuneration process, we have provided our People Leaders with guidance regarding appropriate (and in some cases, mandatory) remuneration consequences for conduct and performance issues, including insights from the previous year's consequences applied. These activities are part of our continued focus on consistency in application of remuneration consequence across ANZ globally.\n\n## 8.5 Consideration of consequences for material risk, audit and conduct events\n\nThe EAG has processes in place to ensure that we mitigate the risk of conflicts of interest in reviewing events and determining accountability and consequences. For example, when undertaking accountability reviews, a recommendation regarding the review leader and scope must be sent to the CRO (or in the case of an event involving Group Risk to the CEO), for review and approval to ensure the individual is capable of undertaking an impartial and unbiased review.\n\nConsiderations regarding accountability and consequences for our most senior executives are considered and determined by the HR Committee and Board.\n\nReports on the most material risk, audit and conduct issues were presented to the HR, Risk and Audit Committees at a concurrent meeting. This information was considered by the Board when considering the performance of the Group and the 2023 ANZIP variable remuneration pool for all employees and determining the performance and remuneration outcomes of the CEO and Disclosed Executives.\n\nThe HR Committee and Board consider accountability and consequences for the CEO and Disclosed Executives, including the application of malus and clawback (see section 7.3). No malus or clawback was applied to the remuneration of the CEO and Disclosed Executives during 2023.\n\nWhen determining consequences, consideration is given to the level of accountability, and the severity of the issue, including customer impacts. Consequences may include, for example, one or more of the following: counselling, formal warnings, impacts to in year performance and remuneration outcomes or application of malus to previously deferred remuneration and ultimately termination of employment or clawback for the most serious issues.",

We are also focused on ensuring that we learn from the cause of the event, mitigate the risk of future recurrences and continuously seek to strengthen our risk culture. We review the effectiveness of the A&CF every year and implement enhancements to further strengthen the A&CF based on regulatory and internal stakeholder input.\n\n## 8.7 Speak up culture\n\nWe continue to raise employee awareness of, and promote the various ways employees can speak up and raise issues and ideas for improvement including through initiatives such as:\n\n- \u00b7 a global awareness campaign to mark World Whistleblower Day in June, which included a conversation guide designed to support People Leaders with team discussions on the importance of speaking up and promotion of whistleblowing;\n- \u00b7 digital communications designed to build confidence and trust in the Whistleblower Program and process; and\n- \u00b7 through monitoring responses in our employee engagement surveys.\n\nKey risk and speak-up scores, including 'The People Leaders in the area I work demonstrate personal accountability for risk and sound risk behaviours' (91%), 'I can raise issues and concerns without fear of reprisals' (81%) and 'When I speak up, my ideas, opinions and concerns are heard' (84%) remained strong and consistent with 2022 and 2021 results. 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 8.8 Application of consequences\n\nIn 2023, there were 1,330 employee relations cases involving alleged breaches of our Code, with 501 resulting in a formal consequence or the employee leaving ANZ, down from 518 in 2022. Breaches ranged from compliance/procedural breaches (23%), through to general unacceptable behaviour (31.7%), email/systems misuse (9.2%), attendance issues (20.8%), fraud/ theft (5.4%), conflict of interest (5.6%) and breaches of our Equal Opportunity, Bullying and Harassment Policy (3.6%). Outcomes following investigations of breaches this year included 100 terminations, 314 warnings and 87 employees leaving ANZ.\n\nIn relation to the application of consequences to our senior leadership population (senior executives, executives and senior managers), 30 current and former employees (21 in 2022) had a consequence applied as a result of the application of our Code of Conduct Policy and/or findings of accountability for a relevant event. Consequences included warnings, impacts on performance and remuneration outcomes and dismissal.\n\nAll employees and contractors across the enterprise are required to complete mandatory learning modules. Permanent employees who fail to complete their mandatory learning requirements within 30 days of the due date are (in the absence of genuinely exceptional circumstances) ineligible for any FR increase or variable remuneration award as part of our annual Performance and Remuneration Review. In 2023, the mandatory learning course compliance rate across the enterprise was 99.6%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board Chairman fee remains unchanged. Following review, the HR Committee also approved the alignment of the fee structure across all Committees increasing each Committee chair fee to $68,000, and each Committee member fee to $34,000. This fee review considered increased complexity in the regulatory environment, uplifts for ANZ's broader employee population, and the external market.\n\nThe fee structure is applicable to NEDs of ANZGHL and ANZBGL. Fees prior to the implementation of the Non-Operating Holding Company (NOHC) structure related to membership of the ANZBGL Board, and post implementation are viewed as a single fee covering both Boards (i.e., membership of ANZGHL and ANZBGL Boards/Committees). Currently the fee structure applies irrespective of whether NEDs serve on one or more Boards.\n\nNEDs receive a fee for being a Director of the Board, and additional fees for either chairing, or being a member of a Board Committee. The Chairman of the Board does not receive additional fees for serving on a Board Committee.\n\nIn setting Board and Committee fees, the following are considered: general industry practice, ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations, the responsibilities and risks attached to the NED role, the time commitment expected of NEDs on Group and Company matters, and fees paid to NEDs of comparable companies.\n\nANZ compares NED fees to a comparator group of Australian listed companies with a similar market capitalisation, with particular focus on the major financial services institutions. This is considered an appropriate group, given similarity in size and complexity, nature of work and time commitment by NEDs.\n\n## To maintain NED independence and impartiality:\n\n- \u00b7 NED fees are not linked to the performance of the Group; and\n- \u00b7 NEDs are not eligible to participate in any of the Group's variable remuneration arrangements.\n\nThe current aggregate fee pool for NEDs of $4m was approved by shareholders at the 2012 AGM. The annual total of NEDs' fees, including superannuation contributions, is within this agreed limit.\n\nThis table shows the NED fee policy structure for 2023.\n\n| 2023 NED fee policy structure                      | 2023      | 2023       |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|\n|                                                    | Chair fee | Member fee |\n| Board1,2                                           | $850,000  | $240,000   |\n| Audit Committee                                    | $65,000   | $32,500    |\n| Risk Committee                                     | $65,000   | $32,500    |\n| HR Committee                                       | $65,000   | $32,500    |\n| Digital Business & Technology Committee            | $55,000   | $27,500    |\n| Ethics, Environment, Social & Governance Committee | $55,000   | $27,500    |\n\n- 1. Including superannuation. 2. The Chairman of the Board does not receive additional fees for serving on a Board Committee. The Chairman of the Board and NEDs do not receive a fee for serving on the Nomination and Board Operations Committee.\n\n## NED shareholding guidelines\n\nWe expect our NEDs to hold ANZ shares. NEDs are required:\n\n- \u00b7 to accumulate shares - over a five-year period from their appointment to the value of:\n- - 100% of the NED member fee for Directors;\n- - 100% of the Chairman fee for the Chairman; and\n- \u00b7 to maintain this shareholding while they are a Director of ANZ.\n\nBased on the ANZ share price as at 30 September 2023, all NEDs meet or, if less than five years' tenure, are on track to meet the holding guideline.",

The HR Committee supports the Board on remuneration and other HR matters. It reviews the remuneration policies and practices of the Group, and monitors market practice and regulatory and compliance requirements in Australia and overseas.\n\nDuring the year the HR Committee met on five occasions and reviewed and approved, or made recommendations to the Board on matters including:\n\n- \u00b7 remuneration for the CEO and other key executives (broader than those disclosed in the Remuneration Report) in accordance with the ANZ Group Performance and Remuneration Policy and ANZBGL Performance and Remuneration Policy, and fees for the NEDs;\n- \u00b7 matters related to the implementation of APRA's Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration , and updates on the BEAR, and Treasury's Financial Accountability Regime (FAR);\n- \u00b7 the ANZ Group Performance Framework (annual objectives setting and assessment) and annual variable remuneration spend;\n- \u00b7 performance and reward outcomes for key senior executives, including the consideration of material events that have either occurred or came to light in the year;\n- \u00b7 the release, further deferral or application of malus of deferred remuneration or clawback;\n- \u00b7 key senior executive appointments and terminations;\n- \u00b7 the review of the ANZ Group Performance and Remuneration Policy and ANZBGL Performance and Remuneration Policy, and the Accountability & Consequence Framework (A&CF);\n- \u00b7 building capabilities required to deliver on our strategy;\n- \u00b7 succession plans for key senior executives; and\n- \u00b7 culture, diversity and inclusion, employee engagement, and how we work in a post COVID environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore details about the role of the HR Committee, including its Charter, can be found on our website.

The chairs of the Risk and Audit Committees and the full Board (ANZGHL and ANZBGL) are in attendance for specific HR Committee meetings. A concurrent meeting of the HR, Risk and Audit Committees was held to review:\n\n- \u00b7 material risk, conduct and audit events that either occurred or came to light in 2023;\n- \u00b7 2023 performance and variable remuneration recommendations at both the Group, CEO and Disclosed Executive level.\n\nTo further reflect the importance of the link between remuneration and risk:\n\n- \u00b7 the Board had two NEDs (in addition to the Chairman) in 2023 who served on both the HR Committee and the Risk Committee;\n- \u00b7 the HR Committee has free and unfettered access to risk and financial control personnel (the CRO and CFO attend HR Committee meetings for specific agenda items);\n- \u00b7 the CRO (together with GE T&C and GGM IA) provides an independent report to the HR Committee on the most material risk, conduct and audit events (as relevant) to help inform considerations of performance and remuneration, and accountability and consequences at the Group, Divisional and individual level;\n- \u00b7 the CRO also provides an independent report to assist the Board in their assessment of performance and remuneration outcomes for the CEO and Disclosed Executives;\n- \u00b7 the chairs of the Risk and Audit Committees are asked to provide input to ensure appropriate consideration of all relevant risk and internal audit issues;\n- \u00b7 the ANZ Group Performance Framework and Divisional Performance Frameworks include Risk as a key element acting as a modifier, and it forms an integral part of each framework's assessment and directly impacts the overall outcomes; and\n- \u00b7 the LTVR RR pre grant and pre vest assessments undertaken by the Board are primarily based on non-financial risk outcomes.\n\n## 10.1.3 CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nTo help mitigate potential conflicts of interest:\n\n- \u00b7 management are not in attendance when their own performance or remuneration is being discussed by the HR Committee or Board;\n- \u00b7 the CEO's STVR is funded and determined separately from the ANZIP variable remuneration pool;\n- \u00b7 the CRO's remuneration arrangements differ to other Disclosed Executives to preserve the independence of the role;\n- \u00b7 the EAG also has processes in place to help mitigate conflicts of interest as outlined in section 8; and\n- \u00b7 the HR Committee seeks input from a number of sources to inform their consideration of performance and remuneration outcomes for the CEO and Disclosed Executives including:\n- - independent reports from Risk, Finance, Talent and Culture, and Internal Audit;\n- - material risk, conduct and audit event data provided by the CRO;\n- - input from both the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board.\n\n## 10.1.4 EXTERNAL ADVISORS PROVIDED INFORMATION BUT NOT RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe HR Committee can engage independent external advisors as needed.",

Accordingly, executives and their associated persons must not enter into any schemes that specifically protect the unvested value of equity allocated. If they do so, then they would forfeit the relevant equity.\n\n## 10.2.2 CEO AND DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES' SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES\n\nWe expect the CEO and each Disclosed Executive to, over a five-year period:\n\n- \u00b7 accumulate ANZ shares to the value of 200% of their FR; and\n- \u00b7 maintain this shareholding level while they are an executive of ANZ.\n\nExecutives are permitted to sell ANZ securities to meet taxation obligations on employee equity even if below the 200% guideline.

As required by AASB 2 Share-based payments, the amortisation value includes a proportion of the fair value (taking into account market-related vesting conditions) of all equity that had not yet fully vested as at the commencement of the financial year. The fair value is determined at grant date and is allocated on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period. The amount included as remuneration neither relates to, nor indicates, the benefit (if any) that the executive may ultimately realise if the equity becomes exercisable. No terms of share-based payments have been altered or modified during the financial year. There were no cash settled share-based payments or any other form of share-based payment compensation during the financial year for the CEO or Disclosed Executives. 8. Other equity allocations (A Watson) relate to shares received in relation to the historical Employee Share Offer which provided a grant of ANZ shares in each financial year to eligible employees subject to Board approval. 9. Remuneration based on time as a Disclosed Executive in either 2022 (F Faruqui) or 2023 (R Howell, C Morgan, A Strong). 10.

Share-based payments include the expensing treatment on resignation for unvested deferred remuneration (including reversals for forfeiture on resignation). Termination benefits reflect payment for accrued annual leave in accordance with her contract, payable on resignation.",

The information below forms part of this Directors' Report:\n\n- \u00b7 Principal activities on page 7;\n- \u00b7 Operating and financial review on pages 20 to 32;\n- \u00b7 Dividends on page 32;\n- \u00b7 Information on the Directors on pages 8 to 10;\n- \u00b7 Remuneration report on pages 34 to 71.\n\n## Establishment of a New Group Organisational Structure\n\nOn 3 January 2023, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZBGL) established by a scheme of arrangement, a non-operating holding company, ANZ Group Holdings Limited (ANZGHL), as the new listed parent holding company of the ANZ Group and implemented a restructure to separate ANZ's banking and certain non-banking businesses into the ANZ Bank Group and ANZ Non-Bank Group (Restructure). The ANZ Bank Group comprises the majority of the businesses and subsidiaries that were held in ANZBGL prior to the Restructure. The ANZ Non-Bank Group comprises banking-adjacent businesses developed or acquired by the ANZ Group to focus on bringing new technology and banking-adjacent services to the ANZ Group's customers, and a separate service company.\n\nThe key steps undertaken in the Restructure were:\n\n- \u00b7 new legal entities ANZGHL, ANZ BH Pty Ltd, ANZ NBH Pty Ltd and ANZ Group Services Pty Ltd were created;\n- \u00b7 each ANZBGL shareholder received one ANZGHL ordinary share for each ANZBGL ordinary share that they held prior to the implementation of the Restructure;\n- \u00b7 ANZBGL transferred its beneficial interests in banking-adjacent businesses to ANZ NBH Pty Ltd;\n- \u00b7 ANZBGL transferred its interest in several properties to ANZ Group Services Pty Ltd;\n- \u00b7 ANZBGL transferred all shares in ANZ BH Pty Ltd, ANZ NBH Pty Ltd and ANZ Group Services Pty Ltd to ANZGHL; and\n- \u00b7 ANZGHL transferred all shares in ANZBGL to ANZ BH Pty Ltd.\n\nAs a result of the Restructure, the consolidated results of ANZBGL and its subsidiaries for the 2023 financial year consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 the results of the former ANZ Group for the period 1 October 2022 to 2 January 2023;\n- \u00b7 the results of the ANZBGL Group for the period 3 January to 30 September 2023.\n\n## ANZGHL Financial Information\n\nAs a result of the Restructure, ANZBGL is a subsidiary of ANZGHL. A copy of the 2023 ANZGHL Annual Report can be accessed via the ANZ Shareholder Centre at anz.com/ shareholder/centre/reporting.\n\n## Signi/ficant changes in state of a/ffairs\n\nThere have been no other significant changes in the Group's state of affairs other than Establishment of a New Group Organisational Structure as described above.\n\n## Events since the end of the /financial year\n\nThere have been no significant events from 30 September 2023 to the date of signing this report.\n\n## Participation in political party activities\n\nWe aim to assist the democratic process in Australia by attending and participating in paid events hosted by the major federal political parties. For the year ended 30 September 2023, we contributed $97,159 to participate in political activities hosted by the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia. These activities included speeches, political functions and conferences, and policy dialogue forums. We disclose these contributions to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), noting the AEC's reporting year is a different period to the Group's financial year.\n\n## Modern slavery statement\n\nThe Group is subject to Australia's Modern Slavery Act Australian Commonwealth Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) and United Kingdom's Modern Slavery Act 2015.\n\nOur Modern Slavery Statement sets out actions taken to identify, assess and manage modern slavery risks in our operations and supply chain during the financial year ended 30 September 2023.\n\nOur 2023 Modern Slavery Statement will be available at anz.com/esgreport prior to our Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Environmental regulation\n\nWe recognise the expectations of our stakeholders - customers, shareholders, staff and the community - to operate in a way that mitigates our environmental impact.\n\nIn Australia, we meet the requirements of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth) , which imposes reporting obligations where energy production, usage or greenhouse gas emissions trigger specified thresholds.\n\nWe do not believe that our operations are subject to any other particular and significant environmental regulation under a law of the Commonwealth of Australia or of an Australian State or Territory. We may become subject to environmental regulation as a result of our lending activities in the ordinary course of business and have developed policies, which are reviewed on a regular basis, to help identify and manage such environmental matters.\n\nFurther details of our environmental performance, including progress against our targets and management of material issues aligned with our commitment to fair and responsible banking and priority areas of financial wellbeing, environmental sustainability and housing, are available in the ESG Supplement, at anz.com/ annualreport.",

The ANZ Group appointed Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co (predecessor to KPMG) in 1969.\n\nThe Board Audit Committee conducts a formal annual performance assessment of the external auditor, including whether to commence an external tender for the audit. After considering relevant factors including tenure, audit quality, local and international capability and experience, and independence, the Board Audit Committee resolved to reappoint KPMG for the 30 September 2024 financial year audit.\n\nKPMG regularly rotates the Group Lead Audit Engagement Partner and the Engagement Quality Control Review Partner with the most recent rotation being for the financial years ended 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2020, respectively.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nOur Stakeholder Engagement Model for Relationship with the External Auditor (the Policy), which incorporates requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and industry best practice, prevents the external auditor from providing services that are perceived to be in conflict with the role of the external auditor or breach independence requirements. This includes consulting advice and sub-contracting of operational activities normally undertaken by management, and engagements where the external auditor may ultimately be required to express an opinion on its own work. Specifically, the Policy:\n\n- \u00b7 limits the scope of non-audit services that may be provided;\n- \u00b7 requires that audit, audit-related and permitted non-audit services be considered in light of independence requirements and for any potential conflicts of interest before they are approved by the Audit Committee, or approved by the Chair of the Audit Committee (or delegate) and notified to the Audit Committee; and\n- \u00b7 requires pre-approval before the external auditor can commence any engagement for the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details about the Policy can be found in ANZGHL's Corporate Governance Statement.\n\nThe external auditor has confirmed to the Audit Committee that it has:\n\n- \u00b7 implemented procedures to ensure it complies with independence rules in applicable jurisdictions; and\n- \u00b7 complied with applicable policies and regulations in those jurisdictions regarding the provision of non-audit services, and the Policy.\n\nThe Audit Committee has reviewed the non-audit services provided by the external auditor during the 2023 financial year, and has confirmed that the provision of these services is consistent with the Policy, compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 and did not compromise the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.\n\nThis has been formally advised by the Audit Committee to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe categories of non-audit services supplied to the Group during the year ended 30 September 2023 by the external auditor, KPMG, or by another person or firm on KPMG's behalf, and the amounts paid or payable (including GST) by the Group are as follows:\n\n## Amount paid/ payable $'000's\n\n| Non-audit services                                   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Methodology,  procedural and  administrative reviews |    105 |      8 |\n| Total                                                |    105 |      8 |\n\nFurther details on the compensation paid to KPMG are provided in Note 33 Auditor Fees to the financial statements including details of audit-related services provided during the year of $5.82 million (2022: $7.50 million).\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor during the year ended 30 September 2023 is compatible with the general standard of independence for external auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 and did not compromise the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.\n\n## Directors' and o/fficers' indemnity\n\nANZBGL's Constitution (Rule 9.1) permits ANZBGL to:\n\n- \u00b7 Indemnify any officer or employee of ANZBGL or any of its related bodies corporate, or its auditor, against liabilities (so far as may be permitted under applicable law) incurred as such an officer, employee or auditor to a person (other than ANZBGL or a related body corporate), including liabilities incurred as a result of appointment or nomination by ANZBGL or a related body corporate as a trustee or as an officer or employee of another corporation; and\n- \u00b7 Make payments in respect of legal costs incurred by an officer or employee or auditor in defending an action for a liability incurred as such an officer, employee or auditor, or in resisting or responding to actions taken by a government agency, a duly constituted Royal Commission or other official inquiry, a liquidator, administrator, trustee in bankruptcy or other authorised official.\n\nOur policy is that our employees should be protected from any liability they incur as a result of acting in the course of their employment, subject to appropriate conditions.\n\nUnder the policy, we will indemnify employees and former employees against any liability they incur to any third party as a result of acting in good faith in the course of their employment and this extends to liability incurred as a result of their appointment/nomination by or at the request of the ANZ Group as an officer or employee of another corporation or body or as a trustee.",

ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## ORGANISATIONAL RESTRUCTURE\n\nOn 3 January 2023, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZBGL) established by a scheme of arrangement, a non-operating holding company, ANZ Group Holdings Limited (ANZGHL), as the new listed parent holding company of the ANZ Group and implemented a restructure to separate ANZ's banking and certain non-banking businesses into the ANZ Bank Group and ANZ Non-Bank Group (the Restructure). The ANZ Bank Group comprises the majority of the businesses and subsidiaries that were held in ANZBGL prior to the Restructure. The ANZ Non-Bank Group comprises banking-adjacent businesses developed or acquired by the ANZ Group to focus on bringing new technology and banking-adjacent services to the ANZ Group's customers, and a separate service company.\n\nOn Restructure, each ANZ shareholder received one ANZGHL ordinary share for each ANZ ordinary share that they held prior to the implementation of the Restructure. The Restructure is accounted for as a reverse acquisition in the ANZGHL consolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2023, with ANZBGL identified as the acquirer in accordance with AASB 3 Business Combinations.\n\nAs a result of the Restructure, the ANZBGL consolidated results for the 2023 financial year end consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 the results of the former ANZ Group for the period 1 October 2022 to 2 January 2023;\n- \u00b7 the result of ANZBGL and its subsidiaries (Group) for the period 3 January to 30 September 2023.\n\nRefer to Accounting Policies Applicable to the Restructure section below for further details.\n\n## GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nThese are the financial statements for ANZBGL (the Company) and its controlled entities (together, the Group or Consolidated Entity) for the year ended 30 September 2023. The Company is a public company incorporated and domiciled in Australia with debt listed on securities exchanges. The Company is a subsidiary of ANZGHL and is regulated by APRA as an ADI. The address of the Company's registered office and its principal place of business is ANZ Centre, 833 Collins Street, Docklands, Victoria, Australia 3008. The Group provides banking and financial services to individuals and business customers and operates in and across 29 markets.\n\nOn 10 November 2023, the Directors resolved to authorise the issue of these financial statements. Information in the financial statements is included only to the extent we consider it material and relevant to the understanding of the financial statements. A disclosure is considered material and relevant if, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount is significant in size (quantitative factor);\n- \u00b7 the information is significant by nature (qualitative factor);\n- \u00b7 the user cannot understand the Group's results without the specific disclosure (qualitative factor);\n- \u00b7 the information is critical to a user's understanding of the impact of significant changes in the Group's business during the period - for example, business acquisitions or disposals (qualitative factor);\n- \u00b7 the information relates to an aspect of the Group's operations that is important to its future performance (qualitative factor); and\n- \u00b7 the information is required under legislative requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) or by the Group's principal regulators, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).\n\nThis section of the financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 outlines the basis upon which the Group's financial statements have been prepared; and\n- \u00b7 discusses any new accounting standards or regulations that directly impact the financial statements.\n\n## BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThis financial report is a general purpose (Tier 1) financial report prepared by a 'for profit' entity, in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AASs) and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), the Corporations Act 2001, and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nWe present the financial statements of the Group in Australian dollars, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency. We have rounded values to the nearest million dollars ($m), unless otherwise stated, as allowed under the ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors Report) Instrument 2016/191. We measure the financial statements of each entity in the Group using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates (the functional currency).\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## BASIS OF MEASUREMENT AND PRESENTATION\n\nWe have prepared the financial information in accordance with the historical cost basis - except the following assets and liabilities which we have stated at their fair value:\n\n- \u00b7 derivative financial instruments and in the case of fair value hedging, a fair value adjustment made to the underlying hedged item;\n- \u00b7 financial instruments held for trading;\n- \u00b7 financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL);\n- \u00b7 financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); and\n- \u00b7 assets and liabilities classified as held for sale (except those required to be at carrying value).\n\nIn accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits we have measured defined benefit obligations using the Projected Unit Credit Method.\n\nThere were no discontinued operations in the current period. For the purpose of comparative information, discontinued operations in the prior period are separately presented from the results of the continuing operations as a single line item 'Profit/(Loss) after tax from discontinued operations' in the Income Statement.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries. An entity, including a structured entity, is considered a subsidiary of the Group when we determine that the Company has control over the entity. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. We assess power by examining existing rights that give the Company the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity. We have eliminated, on consolidation, the effect of all transactions between entities in the Group.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\n## TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the relevant spot rate. Any foreign currency translation gains or losses that arise are included in profit or loss in the period they arise.\n\nWe measure translation differences on non-monetary items classified as FVTPL and report them as part of the fair value gain or loss on these items. For non-monetary items classified as investment securities measured at FVOCI, translation differences are included in other comprehensive income.\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS THAT HAVE A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY THAT IS NOT AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS\n\nThe financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars for consolidation into the Group financial statements using the following method:\n\n| Foreign currency item   | Exchange rate used                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Assets and liabilities  | The reporting date rate                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Equity                  | The initial investment date rate                                                                                                                                           |\n| Income and expenses     | The average rate for the period - but for a significant transaction if we believe the average rate is not  reasonable, then we use the rate at the date of the transaction |\n\nExchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign operations are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. When we dispose of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences are transferred to profit or loss.\n\n## FIDUCIARY ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Group provides fiduciary services to third parties including custody, nominee and trustee services. This involves the Group holding assets on behalf of third parties and making decisions regarding the purchase and sale of financial instruments. If ANZ is not the beneficial owner or does not control the assets, then we do not recognise these transactions in these financial statements, except when required by accounting standards or another legislative requirement.\n\n83",

        "page_content": "84\n\n## 1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLICABLE TO THE RESTRUCTURE\n\nThe implementation of the non-operating holding company involved the transfer of assets and entities between companies within the wider ANZGHL Group. This had implications for the ANZBGL consolidated financial statements due to the transfers extending outside of the Group. From an accounting perspective, since the transfers were between wholly owned entities, these are considered common control transactions. As there is no specific accounting standard for such transfers, the Group is required to make an accounting policy choice.\n\nThe Group's accounting policy for the transfer of the assets and entities between companies under common control is to apply book value accounting. Under this approach, any differences between book value and the transfer price are recorded in equity. The accounting policy choice did not have a material impact on profit and loss or equity when the assets were transferred as part of the Restructure. Refer to Note 31 Related Party Disclosures for details of the transfer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements and applied estimates and assumptions about past and future events. Further information on the key judgements and estimates that we consider material to the financial statements are contained within each relevant note to the financial statements.\n\nThe global economy is facing challenges associated with high inflation and interest rates, labour market constraints, and continuing geopolitical tensions which contribute to an elevated level of estimation uncertainty involved in the preparation of these financial statements.\n\nThe Group has made various accounting estimates in this Financial Report based on forecasts of economic conditions which reflect expectations and assumptions at 30 September 2023 about future events considered reasonable in the circumstances. Thus there is a considerable degree of judgement involved in preparing these estimates. Actual economic conditions are likely to be different from those forecast since anticipated events frequently do not occur as expected, and the effect of these differences may significantly impact accounting estimates included in these financial statements. The significant accounting estimates impacted by these forecasts and associated uncertainties are predominantly related to expected credit losses and recoverable amounts of non-financial assets.\n\nThe impact of these uncertainties on each of these accounting estimates is discussed in the relevant notes in this Financial Report. Readers should consider these disclosures in light of the inherent uncertainties described above.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM\n\nInterbank offered rates (IBORs) reform is the global transition away from IBORs and their replacement by risk-free rates (RFRs). IBOR reforms have had a wide-ranging impact for the Group and our customers given the fundamental differences between IBORs and RFRs. Accordingly, the Group established an enterprise-wide Benchmark Transition Program to manage the operational, market, legal, conduct and financial reporting risks associated with IBOR transition.\n\nAs at 30 September 2023 the Group's Program is largely complete, and included the implementation of the required processes, technology and product capabilities that ensured the transitions were successfully undertaken. In line with regulatory announcements made in early 2021, IBOR rates including Pound Sterling (GBP), Euro (EUR), Swiss Franc (CHF) and Japanese Yen (JPY), and the 1-week and 2-month US Dollar (USD) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate settings ceased on 31 December 2021 and were replaced by alternative RFRs. The Group's exposure to IBOR reform was primarily concentrated in other USD LIBOR settings which ceased on 30 June 2023. No material changes were made to the Group's risk management strategy because of IBOR reform and the use of IBOR rates in new products was phased out in accordance with industry and supervisory guidance. The transition activities had an immaterial impact to the Group's profit and loss.\n\nTo support any legacy contracts referencing these benchmarks across the industry, the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month USD settings will continue to be published using an alternative 'synthetic' methodology. The Group continues to manage a small number of loan and derivative contracts whose transition is being managed with customers, and a small number of debt issuances with investors. These remaining contracts will either mature or transition ahead of the synthetic USD LIBOR cessation date of 30 September 2024. The Group has an immaterial exposure to other announced benchmark cessation events expected to occur between 2024 and 2026.\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED IN THE PERIOD\n\nAccounting policies have been consistently applied, unless otherwise noted.\n\n## AASB 2023-2 AMENDMENTS TO AUSTRALIAN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - INTERNATIONAL TAX REFORM - PILLAR TWO MODEL RULES\n\nIn May 2023, the Federal Government announced it will implement key aspects of Pillar Two of the OECD/G20 Two-Pillar Solution to address the tax challenges arising from digitalisation of the economy. This measure is not yet law. Other jurisdictions in which ANZ operates are also considering implementation of the regime. The ANZ Group is expected to be within the scope of associated legislation. In anticipation of legislation being enacted, the AASB issued AASB 2023-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules in June 2023. The Group has applied the mandatory exemption included in para. 4A of this standard and will apply the whole amending standard from 1 October 2023. This amending standard stipulates a mandatory temporary exemption from recognising deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. The Group is monitoring progress of associated legislation and has not yet determined the expected impact on its financial statements.\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED\n\nA number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been published but are not mandatory for the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2023 and have not been applied by the Group in preparing these financial statements. Further details of these are set out below.\n\n## GENERAL HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) introduced new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management activities undertaken when hedging both financial and non-financial risks. AASB 9 provided the Group with an accounting policy choice to continue to apply the AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (AASB 139) hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board's ongoing project on Dynamic Risk Management (macro hedge accounting) is completed. The Group continues to apply the hedge accounting requirements of AASB 139.\n\n85\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED (continued)\n\n## AASB 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS (AASB 17)\n\nThe final version of AASB 17 was issued in July 2017 and is not effective for the Group until 1 October 2023. It will replace AASB 4 Insurance Contracts, AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts. AASB 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts.\n\nThe measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements under AASB 17 are significantly different from current accounting standards. Although the overall profit recognised in respect of insurance contracts will not change, it is expected that the timing of profit recognition will change.\n\nAASB 17 will not have a material impact on the Group.\n\n## DEFERRED TAX RELATED TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM A SINGLE TRANSACTION\n\nAASB 2021-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction amends AASB 112 Income Taxes. It clarifies that entities are required to recognise deferred tax on transactions for which there is both an asset and a liability and that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences which may apply to leases and decommissioning or restoration obligations. This amendment is effective for the Group from 1 October 2023 and will not have a material impact on the Group.\n\n## LEASE LIABILITY IN A SALE AND LEASEBACK\n\nAASB 2022-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback amends AASB 16 Leases and specifies the accounting for variable lease payments by seller-lessees in sale and leaseback transactions. The amendment is effective from 1 October 2024 and will not have a material impact on the Group.\n\n86",

We use the effective interest rate method to calculate the amortised cost of assets held at amortised cost and to recognise interest income on financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the stream of estimated future cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. For assets subject to prepayment, we determine their expected life on the basis of historical behaviour of the particular asset portfolio taking into account contractual obligations and prepayment experience.\n\nWe recognise fees and costs, which form an integral part of the financial instrument (for example loan origination fees and costs), using the effective interest rate method. These are presented as part of interest income or expense depending on whether the underlying financial instrument is a financial asset or financial liability.\n\n## Major Bank Levy\n\nThe Major Bank Levy Act 2017 (levy or major bank levy) applies a rate of 0.06% to certain liabilities of ANZBGL. The levy represents a finance cost and it is presented as interest expense in the Income Statement.\n\n87",

NON-INTEREST INCOME (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## OTHER OPERATING INCOME\n\n## Fee and Commission Revenue\n\nWe recognise fee and commission revenue arising from contracts with customers (a) over time when the performance obligation is satisfied across more than one reporting period, or (b) at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied immediately or is satisfied within one reporting period.\n\n- \u00b7 lending fees exclude fees treated as part of the effective yield calculation of interest income. Lending fees include certain guarantee and commitment fees where the loan or guarantee is not likely to be drawn upon, and other fees charged for providing customers a distinct good or service that are recognised separately from the underlying lending product.\n- \u00b7 non-lending fees include fees associated with deposit and credit card accounts, interchange fees and fees charged for specific customer transactions such as international transaction fees. Where the Group provides multiple goods or services to a customer under the same contract, the Group allocates the transaction price of the contract to distinct performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied.\n- \u00b7 commissions represent fees from third parties where we act as an agent by arranging a third party (such as an insurance provider) to provide goods and services to a customer. In such cases, we are not primarily responsible for providing the underlying good or service to the customer. If the Group collects funds on behalf of a third party when acting as an agent, we only recognise the net commission retained as revenue. When the commission is variable based on factors outside our control (such as a trail commission), revenue is only recognised if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the variable amount will not be required in future periods.\n- \u00b7 funds management income represents fees earned from customers for providing asset management services. Revenue is recognised over the period in which the asset management services are delivered. Performance fees associated with funds management activities are only recognised when it becomes highly probable the performance hurdle will be achieved.\n\n## Net Foreign Exchange Earnings and Other Financial Instruments Income\n\nWe recognise the following as net foreign exchange earnings and other financial instruments income:\n\n- \u00b7 exchange rate differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and translation differences on monetary items translated at rates different to those at which they were initially recognised or included in a previous financial report;\n- \u00b7 fair value movements (excluding realised and accrued interest) on derivatives not designated as accounting hedges that we use to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk on funding instruments;\n- \u00b7 the ineffective portions of fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges;\n- \u00b7 immediately upon sale or repayment of a hedged item, the unamortised fair value adjustments to items designated as fair value hedges and amounts accumulated in equity related to designated cash flow hedges;\n- \u00b7 fair value movements on financial assets and financial liabilities designated at FVTPL or held for trading;\n- \u00b7 amounts released from the FVOCI reserve when a debt instrument classified as FVOCI is sold; and\n- \u00b7 the gain or loss on derecognition of financial assets or liabilities measured at amortised cost.\n\n## Gain or Loss on Disposal of Non-Financial Assets\n\nThe gain or loss on the disposal of assets is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the proceeds of disposal net of costs. This is recognised in Other income in the year in which control of the asset transfers to the buyer.\n\nWhen a non-financial asset or group of assets is classified as held for sale, it is measured at the lower of its carrying amount immediately prior to reclassification and fair value less costs to sell, with any remeasurement recognised in Other operating income to align with the classification of gain or loss on sale that would have applied if the sale had completed during the year.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n89",

OPERATING EXPENSES (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## OPERATING EXPENSES\n\nOperating expenses are recognised as services are provided to the Group, over the period in which an asset is consumed, or once a liability is created.\n\n## SALARIES AND RELATED COSTS - ANNUAL LEAVE, LONG SERVICE LEAVE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nWages and salaries, annual leave and other employee entitlements expected to be paid or settled within twelve months of employees rendering service are measured at their nominal amounts using remuneration rates that the Group expects to pay when the liabilities are settled.\n\nWe accrue employee entitlements relating to long service leave using an actuarial calculation. It includes assumptions regarding staff departures, leave utilisation and future salary increases. The result is then discounted using market yields at the reporting date. The market yields are determined from a blended rate of high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity that closely match the estimated future cash outflows.\n\nIf we expect to pay short term cash bonuses, then a liability is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount (as a result of past service provided by the employee) and the obligation can be reliably measured.\n\nPersonnel expenses also include share-based payments which may be cash or equity settled. We calculate the fair value of equity settled remuneration at grant date, which is then amortised over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in share capital or the share option reserve as applicable. When we estimate the fair value, we take into account market vesting conditions, such as share price performance conditions. We take non-market vesting conditions, such as service conditions, into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the expense.\n\nAfter the grant of an equity-based award, the amount we recognise as an expense is reversed when non-market vesting conditions are not met, for example an employee fails to satisfy the minimum service period specified in the award due to resignation, termination or notice of dismissal for serious misconduct. However, we do not reverse the expense if the award does not vest due to the failure to meet a market-based performance condition.\n\nFurther information on share-based payment schemes operated by the Group during the current and prior year is included in Note 30 Employee Share and Option Plans.",

        "page_content": "## 5. INCOME TAX (continued)\n\n## TAX CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Company and all its wholly owned Australian resident entities are part of a tax-consolidated group under Australian taxation law. Following the Restructure on 3 January 2023, ANZGHL is the head entity in the tax-consolidated group. We recognise each of the following in the separate financial statements of members of the tax consolidated group on a 'group allocation' basis: tax expense/income, and deferred tax liabilities/assets that arise from temporary differences for members of the tax-consolidated group.\n\nUnder a tax funding arrangement between the entities in the tax-consolidated group, amounts are recognised as payable to or receivable by each member of the tax-consolidated group in relation to the tax contribution amounts payable or receivable between members of the tax-consolidated group and the head entity ANZGHL.\n\nMembers of the tax-consolidated group have also entered into a tax sharing agreement that provides for the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities were the head entity to default on its income tax payment obligations.\n\n## UNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets related to unused realised tax losses (on revenue account) total $1 million (2022: $1 million) for the Group and nil (2022: nil) for the Company.\n\nUnrecognised deferred tax liabilities related to additional potential foreign tax costs (assuming all retained earnings in offshore branches and subsidiaries are repatriated) total $286 million (2022: $250 million) for the Group and $30 million (2022: $18 million) for the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## INCOME TAX EXPENSE\n\nIncome tax expense comprises both current and deferred taxes and is based on the accounting profit adjusted for differences in the accounting and tax treatments of income and expenses (that is, taxable income). We recognise tax expense in profit or loss except when the tax relates to items recognised directly in equity and other comprehensive income, in which case we recognise the tax directly in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.\n\n## CURRENT TAX EXPENSE\n\nCurrent tax is the tax we expect to pay on taxable income for the year, based on tax rates (and tax laws) which are enacted at the reporting date. We recognise current tax as a liability (or asset) to the extent that it is unpaid (or refundable).\n\n## DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nWe account for deferred tax using the balance sheet method. Deferred tax arises because the accounting income is not always the same as the taxable income. This creates temporary differences, which usually reverse over time. Until they reverse, we recognise a deferred tax asset, or liability, on the balance sheet. We measure deferred taxes at the tax rates that we expect will apply to the period(s) when the asset is realised, or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.\n\nWe offset current and deferred tax assets and liabilities only to the extent that:\n\n- \u00b7 they relate to income taxes imposed by the same taxation authority;\n- \u00b7 there is a legal right and intention to settle on a net basis; and\n- \u00b7 it is allowed under the tax law of the relevant jurisdiction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nJudgement is required in determining provisions held in respect of uncertain tax positions. The Group estimates its tax liabilities based on its understanding of the relevant law in each of the countries in which it operates and seeks independent advice where appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n95",

SEGMENT REPORTING\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF SEGMENTS\n\nThe Group's six operating segments are presented on a basis that is consistent with the information provided internally to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker. This reflects the way the Group's businesses are managed, rather than the legal structure of the Group.\n\nWe measure the performance of operating segments on a cash profit basis. To calculate cash profit, we exclude items from profit after tax attributable to shareholders. For 2023 and 2022, the adjustments relate to impacts of economic hedges and revenue and expense hedges which represent timing differences that will reverse through earnings in the future. Transactions between divisions across segments within ANZ are conducted on an arm'slength basis and disclosed as part of the income and expenses of these segments.\n\nThe presentation of divisional results has been impacted by the following structural changes during the period. Prior period comparatives have been restated:\n\n- \u00b7 Non-banking businesses - transfer of non-banking businesses held in the Australia Commercial and Institutional divisions to the Group Centre division which were then disposed as part of the Restructure.\n- \u00b7 Corporate customer re-segmentation - certain business and property finance customers were transferred from the New Zealand division to the Institutional division.\n- \u00b7 Cost reallocations - certain costs were reallocated across the Australia Retail, Australia Commercial, Institutional and Group Centre divisions.\n\nThe reportable segments are divisions engaged in providing either different products or services or similar products and services in different geographical areas. They are as follows:\n\n## Australia Retail\n\nThe Australia Retail division provides a full range of banking services to Australian consumers.

Financial assets are classified into these measurement classifications on the basis of two criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 the business model within which the financial asset is managed; and\n- \u00b7 the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (specifically whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest).\n\nThe resultant financial asset classifications are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortised cost: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows;\n- \u00b7 FVOCI: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows or to sell the assets; and\n- \u00b7 FVTPL: Any other financial assets not falling into the categories above are measured at FVTPL.\n\n## Fair value option for financial assets\n\nA financial asset may be irrevocably designated on initial recognition:\n\n- \u00b7 at FVTPL when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise; or\n- \u00b7 at FVOCI for investments in equity securities, where that instrument is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination.\n\n## 8. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and other balances, as outlined below, that are convertible into cash with an insignificant risk of changes in value and with remaining maturities of three months or less, including reverse repurchase agreements.\n\n|                                                                         | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                                         | 2023  $m       | 2022  $m       | 2023  $m      | 2022  $m      |\n| Coins, notes and cash at bank                                           | 1,070          | 1,147          | 667           | 787           |\n| Securities purchased under agreements to resell in less than 3 months 1 | 31,711         | 15,996         | 31,120        | 14,372        |\n| Balances with central banks                                             | 105,689        | 127,790        | 94,389        | 118,928       |\n| Settlement balances owed to ANZ within 3 months                         | 29,684         | 23,199         | 28,232        | 21,396        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                               | 168,154        | 168,132        | 154,408       | 155,483       |\n\n101",

Different arrangements for posting of collateral exist with these exchanges:\n\n- \u00b7 some transactions are subject to clearing arrangements which result in separate recognition of collateral assets and liabilities, with the carrying values of the associated derivative assets and liabilities held at their fair value.\n- \u00b7 other transactions, are legally settled by the payment or receipt of collateral which reduces the carrying values of the related derivative instruments by the amount paid or received.\n\n## DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - HELD FOR TRADING\n\nThe majority of the Group's derivative financial instruments are held for trading.

By way of exception, bills of exchange (a form of security/transferable instrument) which are used to facilitate the Group's customer lending activities are classified as Loans and advances (rather than Investment securities) to better reflect the substance of the arrangement.\n\nEquity investments not held for trading purposes may be designated at FVOCI on an instrument by instrument basis. If this election is made, gains or losses are not reclassified from Other comprehensive income to profit or loss on disposal of the investment. However, gains or losses may be reclassified within equity.\n\nAssets disclosed as Investment securities are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for Financial Assets outlined at the commencement of the Group's financial asset disclosures on page 101. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with 'Investment securities - debt securities at amortised cost' and 'Investment securities - debt securities at FVOCI' are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 13 Allowance for Expected Credit Losses. For 'Investment securities - debt securities at FVOCI', the allowance for Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is recognised in the FVOCI reserve in equity with a corresponding charge to profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nJudgement is required when we select valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of assets not valued using quoted market prices, particularly the selection of valuation inputs that are not readily observable. Refer to Note 18 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for further details.\n\n116",

Amortised over the expected life of the loan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nLoans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and are facilities the Group provides directly to customers or through third party channels.\n\nLoans and advances are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the loan or advance, which are primarily brokerage and other origination costs which we amortise over the estimated life of the loan. Subsequently, we then measure loans and advances at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, or at fair value when they are specifically designated on initial recognition as FVTPL, are classified as held for sale or when held for trading. Refer to Note 18 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for further details.\n\nWe classify contracts to lease assets and hire purchase agreements as finance leases if they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the customer or an unrelated third party. We include these facilities in 'Other' in the table above.\n\nThe Group enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets that are recognised on its Balance Sheet. When the Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets remain on the Group's Balance Sheet, however if substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred, the Group derecognises the asset. If the risks and rewards are partially retained and control over the asset is lost, the Group derecognises the asset. If control over the asset is not lost, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.\n\nWe separately recognise the rights and obligations retained, or created, in the transfer of assets as appropriate.\n\nAssets disclosed as Net loans and advances are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for financial assets outlined on page 101. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with loans and advances at amortised cost are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 13 Allowance for Expected Credit Losses.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n117",

ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS MODEL\n\nThe measurement of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased, probability weighted prediction which evaluates a range of scenarios and takes into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nExpected credit losses are either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on credit deterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach:\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) since origination, an allowance for ECL is recognised reflecting the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months from the reporting date. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, expected credit losses are estimated based on default events that are possible over the remaining time to maturity.\n- \u00b7 Stage 2: Where there has been a SICR since origination, an allowance for ECL is recognised reflecting expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. If credit risk were to improve in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant, the exposure returns to a Stage 1 classification with ECL measured accordingly.\n- \u00b7 Stage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised.\n\nExpected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2, and on either a collective or individual basis when transferred to Stage 3.\n\n## MEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS\n\nECL is calculated as the product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level, discounted to incorporate the time value of money:\n\n- \u00b7 Probability of default (PD) - the estimate of the likelihood that a borrower will default over a given period;\n- \u00b7 Exposure at default (EAD) - the expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest; and\n- \u00b7 Loss given default (LGD) - the expected loss in the event of the borrower defaulting, expressed as a percentage of the facility's EAD, taking into account direct and indirect recovery costs.\n\nThese credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic variables.\n\n## EXPECTED LIFE\n\nWhen estimating ECL for exposures in Stage 2 and 3, the Group considers the expected lifetime over which it is exposed to credit risk.\n\nFor non-retail portfolios, the Group uses the maximum contractual period as the expected lifetime for non-revolving credit facilities. For non-retail revolving credit facilities, such as corporate lines of credit, the expected life reflects the Group's contractual right to withdraw a facility as part of a contractually agreed annual review, after taking into account the applicable notice period.\n\nFor retail portfolios, the expected lifetime is determined using a behavioural term, taking into account expected prepayment behaviour and events that give rise to substantial modifications.\n\n## DEFINITION OF DEFAULT, CREDIT IMPAIRED AND WRITE-OFFS\n\nThe definition of default used in measuring ECL is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all portfolios. This definition is also in line with the regulatory definition of default. Default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Group, or the exposure is 90 days past due.\n\nFinancial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they default.\n\nWhen there is no realistic probability of recovery, loans are written off against the related impairment allowance on completion of the Group's internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoveries have been collected. In subsequent periods, any recoveries of amounts previously written-off are recorded as a release to the credit impairment charge in the income statement.\n\n122",

ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT (continued)\n\n## MODIFIED FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nIf the contractual terms of a financial asset are modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one for either credit or commercial reasons, an assessment is made to determine if the changes to the terms of the existing financial asset are considered substantial. This assessment considers both changes in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as changes in the overall instrument risk profile; for example, changes in the principal (credit limit), term, or type of underlying collateral. Where a modification is considered non-substantial, the existing financial asset is not derecognised and its date of origination continues to be used to determine SICR. Where a modification is considered substantial, the existing financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at its fair value on the modification date, which also becomes the date of origination used to determine SICR for this new asset.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CREDIT RISK (SICR)\n\nStage 2 assets are those that have experienced a SICR since origination. In determining what constitutes a SICR, the Group considers both qualitative and quantitative information:\n\n- i. Internal credit rating grade\n\nFor the majority of portfolios, the primary indicator of a SICR is a significant deterioration in the internal credit rating grade of a facility since origination and is measured by application of thresholds.\n\nFor non-retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing the Customer Credit Rating (CCR) applicable to a facility at reporting date to the CCR at origination of that facility. A CCR is assigned to each borrower which reflects the PD of the borrower and incorporates both borrower and non-borrower specific information, including forward-looking information. CCRs are subject to review at least annually or more frequently when an event occurs which could affect the credit risk of the customer.\n\nFor retail portfolios, a SICR is determined, depending on the type of facility, by either comparing the scenario weighted lifetime PD at the reporting date to that at origination, or by reference to customer behavioural score thresholds. The scenario weighted lifetime probability of default may increase significantly if:\n\n- \u00b7 there has been a deterioration in the economic outlook, or an increase in economic uncertainty; or\n- \u00b7 there has been a deterioration in the customer's overall credit position, or ability to manage their credit obligations.\n- ii. Backstop criteria\n\nThe Group uses 30 days past due arrears as a backstop criterion for both non-retail and retail portfolios. For retail portfolios only, facilities are required to demonstrate three to six months of good payment behaviour prior to being allocated back to Stage 1.\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\n\nForward-looking information is incorporated into both our assessment of whether a financial asset has experienced a SICR since origination and in our estimate of ECL. In applying forward-looking information for estimating ECL, the Group considers four probability-weighted forecast economic scenarios as follows:\n\n- i. Base case scenario\n\nThe base case scenario is ANZ's view of future macroeconomic conditions. It reflects management's assumptions used for strategic planning and budgeting, and also informs the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which is the process the Group applies in strategic and capital planning over a 3-year time horizon;\n\n- ii. Upside and iii. Downside scenarios\n\nThe upside and downside scenarios are fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions (that is, they are not based on the economic conditions prevailing at balance date) and are based on a combination of more optimistic (in the case of the upside) and pessimistic (in the case of the downside) economic events and uncertainty over long term horizons; and\n\n- iv. Severe downside scenario\n\nTo better reflect the current economic conditions and geopolitical environment, the Group altered the severe downside scenario in 2022 from a scenario fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions to one which aligns with the scenario used for Groupwide stress testing.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n123",

ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT (continued)\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION (continued)\n\nThe four scenarios are described in terms of macroeconomic variables used in the PD, LGD and EAD models (collectively the ECL models) depending on the lending portfolio and country of the borrower. Examples of the macroeconomic variables include unemployment rates, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates, residential property price indices, commercial property price indices and consumer price indices.\n\nProbability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case economic scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required. The Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) is responsible for reviewing and approving the base case economic scenario and the Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) approves the probability weights applied to each scenario.\n\nWhere applicable, temporary adjustments may be made to account for situations where known or expected risks have not been adequately addressed in the modelling process. CMRC is responsible for approving such adjustments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nCollectively assessed allowance for expected credit losses\n\nIn estimating collectively assessed ECL, the Group makes judgements and assumptions in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 the selection of an estimation technique or modelling methodology; and\n- \u00b7 the selection of inputs for those models, and the interdependencies between those inputs.\n\nThe following table summarises the key judgements and assumptions in relation to the model inputs and the interdependencies between those inputs, and highlights significant changes during the current period.\n\nThe judgements and associated assumptions have been made within the context of the uncertainty as to how various factors might impact the global economy and reflect historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Group's ECL estimates are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n| Judgement/Assumption                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Considerations for the year ended 30 September 2023                        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Determining when a  Significant Increase in  Credit Risk has occurred  or reversed | In the measurement of ECL, judgement is  involved in determining whether there has been                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The determination of SICR has been applied consistent  with prior periods. |\n|                                                                                    | a SICR since initial recognition of a loan, which  would result in it moving from Stage 1 to Stage  2.

During 2023, the Group commenced the management of repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements on a fair value basis within the trading book in its Markets business. This resulted in the associated repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements being recognised and measured at FVTPL.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nFor deposits and other borrowings that:\n\n- \u00b7 are not designated at FVTPL on initial recognition, we measure them at amortised cost and recognise their interest expense using the effective interest rate method; and\n- \u00b7 are managed on a fair value basis, reduce or eliminate an accounting mismatch or contain an embedded derivative, we designate them as measured at FVTPL.\n\nRefer to Note 18 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for further details.\n\nFor deposits and other borrowings designated at fair value we recognise the amount of fair value gain or loss attributable to changes in the Group's own credit risk in Other comprehensive income in retained earnings. Any remaining amount of fair value gain or loss we recognise directly in profit or loss. Once we have recognised an amount in other comprehensive income, we do not later reclassify it to profit or loss.\n\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements represent a liability to repurchase the financial assets that remain on our balance sheet since the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the Group. Over the life of the repurchase agreement, we recognise the difference between the sale price and the repurchase price and charge it to interest expense in profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n129",

The carrying amount is then subsequently adjusted to reflect the interest on the lease liability, lease payments that have been made and any lease reassessments or modifications.\n- \u00b7 Trail commission liabilities are measured based on the present value of expected future trail commission payments taking into consideration average behavioural loan life and outstanding balances of broker originated loans.",

DEBT ISSUANCES\n\nThe Group, primarily via ANZBGL or other banking subsidiaries, uses a variety of funding programmes to issue senior debt (including covered bonds and securitisations) and subordinated debt. The difference between senior debt and subordinated debt is that holders of senior debt of a Group issuer take priority over holders of subordinated debt owed by that issuer. In the winding up of a Group issuer, the subordinated debt will be repaid by the relevant issuer only after the repayment of claims of its depositors, other creditors and the senior debt holders of that issuer.\n\n|                                              | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                              | 2023  $m       | 2022  $m       | 2023  $m      | 2022  $m      |\n| Senior debt                                  | 63,233         | 52,324         | 50,671        | 40,325        |\n| Covered bonds                                | 18,223         | 12,967         | 15,084        | 9,371         |\n| Securitisation                               | 880            | 1,115          | -             | -             |\n| Total unsubordinated debt                    | 82,336         | 66,406         | 65,755        | 49,696        |\n| Subordinated debt                            |                |                |               |               |\n| - ANZBGL Additional Tier 1 capital           | 8,232          | 7,705          | 8,287         | 7,763         |\n| - ANZBGL Tier 2 capital                      | 23,707         | 17,907         | 23,707        | 17,907        |\n| - Other subordinated debt securities         | 1,739          | 1,716          | 464           | 462           |\n| Total subordinated debt                      | 33,678         | 27,328         | 32,458        | 26,132        |\n| Total debt issued                            | 116,014        | 93,734         | 98,213        | 75,828        |\n| Residual contractual maturity  1 :           |                |                |               |               |\n| Within one year                              | 21,746         | 25,208         | 18,499        | 21,990        |\n| More than one year                           | 92,856         | 66,660         | 78,245        | 51,929        |\n| No maturity date (instruments in perpetuity) | 1,412          | 1,866          | 1,469         | 1,909         |\n| Total debt issued                            | 116,014        | 93,734         | 98,213        | 75,828        |\n| Carried on Balance Sheet at:                 |                |                |               |               |\n| Amortised cost                               | 114,678        | 92,623         | 95,881        | 72,757        |\n| Fair value through profit or loss            | 1,336          | 1,111          | 2,332         | 3,071         |\n| Total debt issued                            | 116,014        | 93,734         | 98,213        | 75,828        |\n\n## TOTAL DEBT ISSUED BY CURRENCY\n\nThe table below shows the Group's issued debt by currency of issue, which broadly represents the debt holders' base location.\n\n|                   |                                    | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                   |                                    | 2023  $m       | 2022  $m       | 2023  $m      | 2022  $m      |\n| USD               | United States dollars              | 32,723         | 25,527         | 24,074        | 17,206        |\n| EUR               | Euro                               | 26,990         | 19,923         | 21,356        | 14,049        |\n| AUD               | Australian dollars                 | 47,043         | 36,398         | 46,123        | 35,259        |\n| NZD               | New Zealand dollars                | 1,575          | 1,628          | 43            | 46            |\n| JPY               | Japanese yen                       | 1,993          | 2,159          | 1,993         | 2,159         |\n| CHF               | Swiss francs                       | 1,039          | 954            | -             | -             |\n| GBP               | Pounds sterling                    | 2,230          | 5,261          | 2,230         | 5,261         |\n| HKD               | Hong Kong dollars                  | 1,407          | 771            | 1,407         | 771           |\n| Other             | Chinese yuan and Singapore dollars | 1,014          | 1,113          | 987           | 1,077         |\n| Total debt issued | Total debt issued                  | 116,014        | 93,734         | 98,213        | 75,828        |\n\n## SUBORDINATED DEBT\n\nAt 30 September 2023, all subordinated debt issued by ANZBGL (other than its USD 300 million perpetual subordinated notes) qualifies as regulatory capital for the Group. Depending on their terms and conditions, the subordinated debt instruments issued by ANZBGL are classified as either Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital for the Group (in the case of the ANZ Capital Notes (ANZ CN) and ANZ Capital Securities (ANZ CS)) or Tier 2 capital for the Group (in the case of the term subordinated notes) for APRA's capital adequacy purposes.\n\nSubordinated debt issued externally by ANZ Bank New Zealand will constitute subordinated debt of both ANZ Bank New Zealand and the Group. Whilst it will constitute tier 2 capital for ANZ Bank New Zealand for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) capital requirements, it will not constitute Tier 2 capital for the Group as the terms of the subordinated debt does not satisfy APRA's capital requirements.\n\n131",

DEBT ISSUANCES (continued)\n\n## AT1 Capital\n\nAll outstanding AT1 capital instruments issued by ANZBGL are Basel III fully compliant instruments (refer to Note 24 Capital Management for further information about Basel III) for APRA's capital adequacy purposes. Each of the ANZ CN and ANZ CS rank equally with each other.\n\nDistributions on the AT1 capital instruments are non-cumulative and subject to the issuer's absolute discretion and certain payment conditions (including regulatory requirements). Distributions on ANZ CNs are franked in line with the franking applied to ANZGHL's ordinary shares.\n\nWhere specified, the AT1 capital instruments provide the issuer with an early redemption or conversion option on a specified date and in certain other circumstances (such as a tax or regulatory event). This redemption option is subject to APRA's prior written approval.\n\nEach of the AT1 capital instruments will immediately convert into a variable number of ANZGHL's ordinary shares (based on the average market price of the shares immediately prior to conversion less a 1% discount, subject to a maximum conversion number of ANZGHL's ordinary shares) if:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's or ANZBGL's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio is equal to or less than 5.125% - known as a Common Equity Capital Trigger Event; or\n- \u00b7 APRA notifies ANZBGL that, without the conversion or write-off of certain securities or a public sector injection of capital (or equivalent support), it considers that ANZBGL would become non-viable - known as a Non-Viability Trigger Event.\n\nWhere specified, AT1 capital instruments mandatorily convert into a variable number of ANZGHL's ordinary shares (based on the average market price of the shares immediately prior to conversion less a 1% discount):\n\n- \u00b7 on a specified mandatory conversion date; or\n- \u00b7 on an earlier date under certain circumstances as set out in the terms.\n\nHowever, the mandatory conversion is deferred for a specified period if certain conversion tests are not met.\n\nIf the AT1 capital securities convert, and the holders receive ANZGHL ordinary shares, then:\n\n- \u00b7 the AT1 capital securities are transferred to ANZGHL for their face value;\n- \u00b7 ANZBGL shall redeem the securities and simultaneously issue ordinary shares to its parent ANZ BH Limited (based on ANZBGL's share price calculated by reference to its consolidated net assets, subject to a maximum conversion number); and\n- \u00b7 ANZ BH Limited will issue shares to ANZGHL (calculated on the same basis for ANZ BH Limited).\n\nPreference shares issued externally by ANZ Bank New Zealand will constitute additional tier 1 capital for ANZ Bank New Zealand for the purposes of the RBNZ's capital requirements, however they will not constitute Additional Tier 1 capital for the Group as the terms of the preference shares do not satisfy APRA's capital requirements. The preference shares are included within non-controlling interests in Note 23 Shareholders' Equity.\n\nThe tables below show the key details of the ANZBGL's AT1 capital instruments on issue at 30 September in both the current and prior years:\n\n|                                                                          |                                                                          |                                                                          | Consolidated                                                             | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                                          |                                                                          |                                                                          | 2023  $m                                                                 | 2022  $m       | 2023  $m      | 2022  $m      |\n| ANZBGL's Additional Tier 1 capital (perpetual subordinated securities) 1 | ANZBGL's Additional Tier 1 capital (perpetual subordinated securities) 1 | ANZBGL's Additional Tier 1 capital (perpetual subordinated securities) 1 | ANZBGL's Additional Tier 1 capital (perpetual subordinated securities) 1 |                |               |               |\n| ANZ Capital Notes (ANZ CN)                                               | ANZ Capital Notes (ANZ CN)                                               | ANZ Capital Notes (ANZ CN)                                               |                                                                          |                |               |               |\n| AUD                                                                      | 970m                                                                     | ANZ CN3 2                                                                | -

immediately prior to conversion less a 1% discount, subject to a maximum conversion number).\n\nIf the Tier 2 capital securities convert, and the holders receive ANZGHL ordinary shares, then ANZBGL shall issue ordinary shares to its parent ANZ BH Limited (based on ANZBGL's share price calculated by reference to its consolidated net assets, subject to a maximum conversion number) and ANZ BH Limited will issue shares to ANZGHL (calculated on the same basis).\n\nThe table below shows the Tier 2 capital subordinated debt issued by ANZBGL at 30 September in both the current and prior

Interest expense on debt issuances is recognised using the effective interest rate method. Where the Group enters into a fair value hedge accounting relationship, the fair value attributable to the hedged risk is reflected in adjustments to the carrying value of the debt.\n\nSubordinated debt with capital-based conversion features (i.e. Common Equity Capital Trigger Events or Non-Viability Trigger Events) are considered to contain embedded derivatives that we account for separately at FVTPL. The embedded derivatives arise because the amount of shares issued on conversion following any of those trigger events is subject to the maximum conversion number, however they have no significant value as of the reporting date given the remote nature of those trigger events.",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND MODEL\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThe use of financial instruments is fundamental to the Group's businesses of providing banking and other financial services to our customers. The associated financial risks (primarily credit, market, and liquidity risks) are a significant portion of the Group's key material risks.\n\nWe disclose details of all key material risks impacting the Group, and further information on the Group's risk management activities, in the Governance and Risk Management sections of this Annual Report.\n\nThis note details the Group's financial risk management policies, processes and quantitative disclosures in relation to the key financial risks.\n\n## Key material financial risks\n\n## Key sections applicable to this risk\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe risk of financial loss resulting from:\n\n- \u00b7 a counterparty failing to fulfil its obligations; or\n- \u00b7 a decrease in credit quality of a counterparty resulting in a financial loss.\n\nCredit risk incorporates the risks associated with us lending to customers who could be impacted by climate change, changes to laws, regulations, or other policies adopted by governments or regulatory authorities. Climate change impacts include both physical risks (climate- or weather-related events) and transition risks resulting from the adjustment to a low emissions economy. Transition risks include resultant changes to laws, regulations and policies noted above.\n\n## Market risk\n\nThe risk to the Group's earnings arising from:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, volatility and correlations; or\n- \u00b7 fluctuations in bond, commodity or equity prices.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\nThe risk that the Group is unable to meet payment obligations as they fall due, including:\n\n- \u00b7 repaying depositors or maturing wholesale debt; or\n- \u00b7 the Group having insufficient capacity to fund increases in assets.\n- \u00b7 Credit risk overview, management and control responsibilities\n- \u00b7 Maximum exposure to credit risk\n- \u00b7 Credit quality\n- \u00b7 Concentrations of credit risk\n- \u00b7 Collateral management\n- \u00b7 Market risk overview, management and control responsibilities\n- \u00b7 Measurement of market risk\n- \u00b7 Traded and non-traded market risk\n- \u00b7 Equity securities designated at FVOCI\n- \u00b7 Foreign currency risk - structural exposure\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk overview, management and control responsibilities\n- \u00b7 Key areas of measurement for liquidity risk\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk outcomes\n- \u00b7 Residual contractual maturity analysis of the Group's liabilities\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n137",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\n## AN OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\n\nThis overview is provided to aid the users of the financial statements in understanding the context of the financial disclosures required under AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. It should be read in conjunction with the Governance and Risk Management sections of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group's Risk Management Framework (RMF). The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group's risk management policies. The BRC reports regularly to the Board on its activities.\n\nThe Board approves the strategic objectives of the Group including:\n\n- \u00b7 the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board's expectations regarding the degree of risk that the Group is prepared to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives and business plan; and\n- \u00b7 the Risk Management Strategy (RMS), which describes the Group's strategy for managing risks and the key elements of the RMF that give effect to this strategy. This includes a description of each material risk, and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how the Group identifies, measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and controls or mitigates material risks.\n\nThe Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and robust control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. At ANZ, risk is everyone's responsibility.\n\nThe Group has an independent risk management function, headed by the Chief Risk Officer who:\n\n- \u00b7 is responsible for overseeing the risk profile and the risk management framework;\n- \u00b7 can effectively challenge activities and decisions that materially affect the Group's risk profile; and\n- \u00b7 has an independent reporting line to the BRC to enable the appropriate escalation of issues of concern.\n\nThe Internal Audit Function reports directly to the Board Audit Committee (BAC). Internal Audit provides:\n\n- \u00b7 an independent evaluation of the Group's RMF annually that seeks to ensure compliance with, and the effectiveness of, the risk management framework;\n- \u00b7 facilitation of a comprehensive review every three years that seeks to ensure the appropriateness, effectiveness and adequacy of the risk management framework; and\n- \u00b7 recommendations to improve the framework and/or work practices to strengthen the effectiveness of day-to-day operations.\n\n138",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## CREDIT RISK\n\n## CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nGranting credit facilities to customers is one of the Group's major sources of income. As this activity is also a principal risk, the Group dedicates considerable resources to its management. The Group assumes credit risk in a wide range of lending and other activities in diverse markets and in many jurisdictions. Credit risks arise from traditional lending to customers as well as from interbank, treasury, trade finance and capital markets activities around the world.\n\nOur credit risk management framework ensures we apply a consistent approach across the Group when we measure, monitor and manage the credit risk appetite set by the Board. The Board is assisted and advised by the BRC in discharging its duty to oversee credit risk. The BRC:\n\n- \u00b7 sets the credit risk appetite and credit strategies; and\n- \u00b7 approves credit transactions beyond the discretion of executive management.\n\nWe quantify credit risk through an internal credit rating system (masterscales) to ensure consistency across exposure types and to provide a consistent framework for reporting and analysis. The system uses models and other tools to measure the following for customer exposures:\n\n| Probability of Default (PD)   | Expressed by a Customer Credit Rating (CCR), reflecting the Group's assessment of a customer's ability  to service and repay debt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Exposure at Default (EAD)     | The expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and  interest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest at the time of default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Loss Given Default (LGD)      | Expressed by a Security Indicator (SI) ranging from A to G. The SI is calculated by reference to the  percentage of loan covered by security which the Group can realise if a customer defaults. The A-G  scale is supplemented by a range of other SIs which cover factors such as cash cover and sovereign  backing. For retail and some small business lending, we group exposures into large homogenous pools |\n\nOur specialist credit risk teams develop and validate the Group's PD and LGD rating models. The outputs from these models drive our day-to-day credit risk management decisions including origination, pricing, approval levels, regulatory capital adequacy, economic capital allocation, and credit provisioning.\n\nAll customers with whom the Group has a credit relationship are assigned a CCR at origination via either of the following assessment approaches:\n\n| Large and more complex lending                                                                                                    | Retail and some small business lending                                                                                                      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rating models provide a consistent and structured assessment, with  judgement required around the use of out-of-model factors.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## CREDIT RISK (continued)\n\n## MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK\n\nFor financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount. In certain circumstances there may be differences between the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet and the amounts reported in the tables below. Principally, these differences arise in respect of financial assets that are subject to risks other than credit risk, such as equity instruments which are primarily subject to market risk, or bank notes and coins.\n\nFor undrawn facilities, this maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the committed facilities. For contingent exposures, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the Group would have to pay if the instrument is called upon.\n\nThe table below shows our maximum exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions before taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements.\n\n|                                     | Reported   | Reported   | Excluded 1   | Excluded 1   | Maximum exposure  to credit risk   | Maximum exposure  to credit risk   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Consolidated                        | 2023  $m   | 2022  $m   | 2023  $m     | 2022  $m     | 2023  $m                           | 2022  $m                           |\n| On-balance sheet positions          |            |            |              |              |                                    |                                    |\n| Net loans and advances              | 707,694    | 672,407    | -            | -            | 707,694                            | 672,407                            |\n| Other financial assets:             |            |            |              |              |                                    |                                    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents           | 168,154    | 168,132    | 1,070        | 1,147        | 167,084                            | 166,985                            |\n| Settlement balances owed to ANZ     | 9,349      | 4,762      | 9,349        | 4,762        | -                                  | -                                  |\n| Collateral paid                     | 8,558      | 12,700     | -            | -            | 8,558                              | 12,700                             |\n| Trading assets                      | 37,004     | 35,237     | 4,881        | 3,860        | 32,123                             | 31,377                             |\n| Derivative financial instruments    | 60,406     | 90,174     | -            | -            | 60,406                             | 90,174                             |\n| Investment securities               |            |            |              |              |                                    |                                    |\n| - debt securities at amortised cost | 7,752      | 7,943      | -            | -            | 7,752                              | 7,943                              |\n| - debt securities at FVOCI          | 88,271     | 76,817     | -            | -            | 88,271                             | 76,817                             |\n| - equity securities at FVOCI        | 946        | 1,353      | 946          | 1,353        | -                                  | -                                  |\n| - debt securities at FVTPL          | -          | 40         | -            | -            | -                                  | 40                                 |\n| Regulatory deposits                 | 646        | 632        | -            | -            | 646                                | 632                                |\n| Other financial assets 2            | 4,378      | 2,943      | -            | -            | 4,378                              | 2,943                              |\n| Total other financial assets        | 385,464    | 400,733    | 16,246       | 11,122       | 369,218                            | 389,611                            |\n| Subtotal                            | 1,093,158  | 1,073,140  | 16,246       | 11,122       | 1,076,912                          | 1,062,018                          |\n| Off-balance sheet positions         |            |            |              |              |                                    |                                    |\n| Undrawn and contingent facilities 3 | 290,055    | 285,041    | -            | -            | 290,055                            | 285,041                            |\n| Total                               | 1,383,213  | 1,358,181  | 16,246       | 11,122       | 1,366,967                          | 1,347,059                          |\n\n- 1.

The Group monitors its credit portfolio to manage risk concentration and rebalance the portfolio. The Group also applies single customer counterparty limits to protect against unacceptably large exposures to one single customer.\n\nComposition of financial instruments that give rise to credit risk by industry group are presented below:\n\n|                                                   | Loans  and advances   | Loans  and advances   | Other financial  assets   | Other financial  assets   |

Where there is sufficient collateral, an expected credit loss is not recognised. This is largely the case for certain lending products, such as margin loans and reverse repurchase agreements that are secured by the securities purchased using the lending. For some products, the collateral provided by customers is fundamental to the product's structuring, so it is not strictly the secondary source of repayment - for example, lending secured by trade receivables is typically repaid by the collection of those receivables. During the period there was no change in our collateral policies.\n\n149\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## MARKET RISK\n\n## MARKET RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nMarket risk stems from the Group's trading and balance sheet management activities and the impact of changes and correlations between interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, commodities, equities and the volatility within these asset classes.\n\nThe BRC delegates responsibility for day-to-day management of both market risks and compliance with market risk policies to the Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) and the Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO).\n\nWithin overall strategies and policies established by the BRC, business units and risk management have joint responsibility for the control of market risk at the Group level. The Market Risk team (a specialist risk management unit independent of the business) allocates market risk limits at various levels and monitors and reports on them daily. This detailed framework allocates individual limits to manage and control exposures using risk factors and profit and loss limits.\n\nManagement, measurement and reporting of market risk is undertaken in two broad categories:\n\n## Traded Market Risk\n\n## Non-Traded Market Risk\n\nRisk of loss from changes in the value of financial instruments due to movements in price factors for both physical and derivative trading positions. Principal risk categories monitored are:\n\n- 1. Currency risk - potential loss arising from changes in foreign exchange rates or their implied volatilities.\n- 2. Interest rate risk - potential loss from changes in market interest rates or their implied volatilities.\n- 3. Credit spread risk - potential loss arising from a movement in margin or spread relative to a benchmark.\n- 4. Commodity risk - potential loss arising from changes in commodity prices or their implied volatilities.\n- 5. Equity risk - potential loss arising from changes in equity prices.\n\n## MEASUREMENT OF MARKET RISK\n\nWe primarily manage and control market risk using Value at Risk (VaR), sensitivity analysis and stress testing.\n\nVaR measures the Group's possible daily loss based on historical market movements. The Group's VaR approach for both traded and non-traded risk is historical simulation. We use historical changes in market rates, prices and volatilities over a 500 business day window using a one-day holding period. Back testing is used to ensure our VaR models remain accurate.\n\nANZ measures VaR at a 99% confidence interval which means there is a 99% chance that a loss will not exceed the VaR for the relevant holding period.\n\n151\n\nRisk of loss associated with the management of non-traded interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange exposures. This includes interest rate risk in the banking book. This risk of loss arises from adverse changes in the overall and relative level of interest rates for different tenors, differences in the actual versus expected net interest margin, and the potential valuation risk associated with embedded options in financial instruments and bank products.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

The diversification benefit reflects risks that offset across categories. The high and low VaR figures reported for each factor did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported for the Group as a whole. Consequently, a diversification benefit for high and low would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the table.\n\n152",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## MARKET RISK (continued)\n\n## Non-traded market risk\n\n## Balance sheet risk management\n\nThe principal objectives of balance sheet risk management are to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to mitigate the negative impact of movements in interest rates on the earnings and market value of the Group's banking book, while ensuring the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due.\n\n## Interest rate risk management\n\nNon-traded interest rate risk relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market interest rates on the Group's future Net interest income. This risk arises from two principal sources, namely mismatches between the repricing dates of interest bearing assets and liabilities; and the investment of capital and other non-interest bearing liabilities and assets. Interest rate risk is reported using VaR and scenario analysis (based on the impact of a 1% rate shock). The table below shows VaR figures for non-traded interest rate risk for the combined Group as well as Australia, New Zealand and Rest of World geographies which are calculated separately.\n\n|                                         | 2023      | 2023               | 2023              | 2023                  | 2022      | 2022               | 2022              | 2022                  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| Consolidated                            | As at  $m | High for  year  $m | Low for  year  $m | Average  for year  $m | As at  $m | High for  year  $m | Low for  year  $m | Average  for year  $m |\n| Non-traded value at risk 99% confidence |           |                    |                   |                       |           |                    |                   |                       |\n| Australia                               | 81.2      | 93.2               | 72.0              | 82.2                  | 78.5      | 93.4               | 63.0              | 76.1                  |\n| New Zealand                             | 35.3      | 35.3               | 26.1              | 31.1                  | 25.4      | 27.1               | 20.2              | 23.9                  |\n| Rest of World                           | 32.2      | 32.8               | 23.2              | 27.9                  | 21.7      | 38.0               | 16.8              | 25.8                  |\n| Diversification benefit 1               | (52.6)    | n/a                | n/a               | (45.6)                | (38.1)    | n/a                | n/a               | (33.7)                |\n| Total VaR                               | 96.1      | 101.5              | 86.4              | 95.6                  | 87.5      | 104.9              | 66.8              | 92.1                  |\n\n|                                         | 2023      | 2023               | 2023              | 2023                  | 2022      | 2022               | 2022              | 2022                  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| The Company                             | As at  $m | High for  year  $m | Low for  year  $m | Average  for year  $m | As at  $m | High for  year  $m | Low for  year  $m | Average  for year  $m |\n| Non-traded value at risk 99% confidence |           |                    |                   |                       |           |                    |                   |                       |\n| Australia                               | 81.2      | 93.2               | 72.0              | 82.2                  | 78.5      | 93.4               | 63.0              | 76.1                  |\n| New Zealand                             | -         | 0.1                | -                 | -                     | 0.0       | 0.1                | 0.0               | 0.0                   |\n| Rest of World                           | 34.0      | 34.5               | 23.7              | 28.4                  | 22.1      | 37.7               | 16.7              | 25.6                  |\n| Diversification benefit 1               | (30.5)    | n/a                | n/a               | (26.6)                | (17.1)    | n/a                | n/a               | (20.2)                |\n| Total VaR                               | 84.7      | 92.4               | 76.4              | 84.0                  | 83.5      | 94.5               | 62.9              | 81.5                  |\n\n153\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## MARKET RISK (continued)\n\nWe undertake scenario analysis to stress test the impact of extreme events on the Group's market risk exposures. We model a 1% overnight parallel positive shift in the yield curve to determine the potential impact on our Net interest income over the next 12 months. This is a standard risk measure which assumes the parallel shift is reflected in all wholesale and customer rates.\n\nThe table below shows the outcome of this risk measure for the current and previous financial years, expressed as a percentage of reported Net interest income.\n\n|                                                                    | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                                    | 2023           | 2022           | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Impact of 1% rate shock on the next 12 months' net interest income |                |                |               |               |\n| As at period end                                                   | 0.96%          | 1.29%          | 0.73%         | 0.90%         |\n| Maximum exposure                                                   | 1.17%          | 2.08%          | 0.90%         | 1.65%         |\n| Minimum exposure                                                   | 0.38%          | 1.15%          | 0.02%         | 0.71%         |\n| Average exposure (in absolute terms)                               | 0.80%          | 1.56%          | 0.56%         | 1.11%         |\n\n## EQUITY SECURITIES DESIGNATED AT FVOCI\n\nOur investment securities contain equity investment holdings which predominantly comprises Bank of Tianjin. The market risk impact on these equity investments is not captured by the Group's VaR processes for traded and non-traded market risks. Therefore, the Group regularly reviews the valuations of the investments within the portfolio and assesses whether the investments are appropriately measured based on the recognition and measurement policies set out in Note 11 Investment Securities.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK - STRUCTURAL EXPOSURES\n\nOur investment of capital in foreign operations - for example, branches, subsidiaries or associates with functional currencies other than the Australian Dollar - exposes the Group to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates. Variations in the value of these foreign operations arising as a result of exchange differences are reflected in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. Where considered appropriate, the Group enters into hedges of the foreign exchange exposures from its foreign operations.\n\nSimilarly, the Group may enter into economic hedges against larger foreign exchange denominated revenue streams (primarily New Zealand Dollar, US Dollar and US Dollar correlated). The primary objective of hedging is to ensure that, if practical, the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the consolidated capital ratios are minimised.\n\n154",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group is either:\n\n- \u00b7 unable to meet its payment obligations (including repaying depositors or maturing wholesale debt) when they fall due; or\n- \u00b7 does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to fund increases in its assets.\n\nManagement of liquidity and funding risks are overseen by GALCO. The Group's liquidity and funding risks are governed by a set of principles approved by the BRC and include:\n\n- \u00b7 maintaining the ability to meet all payment obligations in the immediate term;\n- \u00b7 ensuring that the Group has the ability to meet 'survival horizons' under a range of ANZ specific, and general market, liquidity stress scenarios, at a country and Group-wide level, to meet cash flow obligations over the short to medium term;\n- \u00b7 maintaining strength in the Group's balance sheet structure to ensure long term resilience in the liquidity and funding risk profile;\n- \u00b7 ensuring the liquidity management framework is compatible with local regulatory requirements;\n- \u00b7 preparing daily liquidity reports and scenario analysis to quantify the Group's positions;\n- \u00b7 targeting a diversified funding base to avoid undue concentrations by investor type, maturity, market source and currency;\n- \u00b7 holding a portfolio of high quality liquid assets to protect against adverse funding conditions and to support day-to-day operations; and\n- \u00b7 establishing detailed contingency plans to cover different liquidity crisis events.\n\nFollowing the Restructure on 3 January 2023, the Group has operated under a non-operating holding company structure whereby:\n\n- \u00b7 ANZBGL's liquidity risk management framework remains unchanged and continues to operate its own liquidity and funding program, governance frameworks and reporting regime reflecting its authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI) operations;\n- \u00b7 ANZGHL (parent entity) has no material liquidity risk given the structure and nature of the balance sheet; and\n- \u00b7 ANZ Non-Bank Group is not expected to have separate funding arrangements and will rely on ANZGHL for funding.\n\nA separate liquidity policy has been established for ANZGHL and ANZ Bank Group to reflect the differing nature of liquidity risk inherent in each business model. ANZGHL will ensure that the parent entity and ANZ Non-Bank Group holds sufficient cash reserves to meet operating and financing requirements.\n\n## KEY AREAS OF MEASUREMENT FOR LIQUIDITY RISK\n\n## Scenario modelling of funding sources\n\nGroup's liquidity risk appetite is defined by a range of regulatory and internal liquidity metrics mandated by the ANZBGL Board. The metrics cover a range of scenarios of varying duration and level of severity.\n\nThe objective of this framework is to:\n\n- \u00b7 Provide protection against shorter term extreme market dislocation and stress.\n- \u00b7 Maintain structural strength in the balance sheet by ensuring that an appropriate amount of longer-term assets are funded with longer-term funding.\n- \u00b7 Ensure that no undue timing concentrations exist in the Group's funding profile.\n\nKey components of this framework are the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is a severe short term liquidity stress scenario and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) a longer term structural liquidity measure, both of which are mandated by banking regulators including APRA.\n\n## Liquid assets\n\nGroup holds a portfolio of high quality (unencumbered) liquid assets to protect Group's liquidity position in a severely stressed environment and to meet regulatory requirements. High quality liquid assets comprise three categories consistent with Basel III LCR requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 Highest-quality liquid assets - cash and highest credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\n- \u00b7 High-quality liquid assets - high credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities, high quality corporate debt securities and high quality covered bonds eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\n- \u00b7 Alternative liquid assets (ALA) - eligible securities that the RBNZ will accept in its domestic market operations and asset qualifying as collateral for the CLF.\n\nGroup monitors and manages the size and composition of its liquid assets portfolio on an ongoing basis in line with regulatory requirements and the risk appetite set by the ANZBGL Board.\n\n155\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK (continued)\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISK OUTCOMES 1\n\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio - ANZBGL's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) averaged 130% for 2023, (2022: 131%) and above the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n\nNet Stable Funding Ratio - ANZBGL's Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as at 30 September 2023 was 116% (2022: 119%), above the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n\n- 1. This information is not within the scope of the external audit of the Group Financial Report by the Group's external auditor, KPMG. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio are non-IFRS disclosures and are disclosed as part of the Group's APS 330 Public Disclosure which is subject to specific review procedures in accordance with the Australian Standard on Related Services (ASRS) 4400 Agreed upon Procedures Engagements to Report Factual Findings.\n\n## Liquidity crisis contingency planning\n\nGroup maintains APRA-endorsed liquidity crisis contingency plans for analysing and responding to a liquidity threatening event at a country and Group-wide level. Key liquidity contingency crisis planning requirements and guidelines include:\n\n| Ongoing business management        | Early signs/ mild stress           | Severe stress                                         |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u00b7 establish crisis/severity levels | \u00b7 monitoring and review            | \u00b7 activate contingency funding plans                  |\n| \u00b7 liquidity limits                 | \u00b7 management actions not requiring | \u00b7 management actions for altering asset and liability |\n| \u00b7 early warning indicators         | business rationalisation           | behaviour                                             |\n\nAssigned responsibility for internal and external communications and the appropriate timing to communicate\n\nSince the precise nature of any stress event cannot be known in advance, we design the plans to be flexible to the nature and severity of the stress event with multiple variables able to be accommodated in any plan.\n\n## Group funding\n\nGroup monitors the composition and stability of its funding so that it remains within the Group's funding risk appetite. This approach ensures that an appropriate proportion of the Group's assets are funded by stable funding sources, including customer deposits; longer-dated wholesale funding (with a remaining term exceeding one year); and equity.\n\n## Funding plans prepared\n\n## Considerations in preparing funding plans\n\n- \u00b7 3 year strategic plan prepared annually\n- \u00b7 annual funding plan as part of the Group's planning process\n- \u00b7 forecasting in light of actual results as a calibration to the annual plan\n- \u00b7 customer balance sheet growth\n- \u00b7 changes in wholesale funding including: targeted funding volumes; markets; investors; tenors; and currencies for senior, secured, subordinated, hybrid transactions and market conditions\n\n## RBA Term Funding Facility\n\nAs an additional source of funding, in March 2020, the RBA announced a Term Funding Facility (TFF) for the banking system to support lending to Australian businesses. The TFF is a three-year secured funding facility to ADIs at a fixed rate of 0.25% for drawdowns up to 4 November 2020, and reduced to 0.10% for new drawdowns from 4 November 2020 onwards. The TFF was closed to drawdowns on 30 June 2021.\n\nAs at 30 September 2023, $8.1 billion remains drawn under the RBA's TFF (2022: $20.1 billion).\n\n## RBNZ Funding for Lending Programme and Term Lending Facility\n\nBetween May 2020 and July 2021, the RBNZ made funds available under a Term Lending Facility (TLF) to promote lending to businesses. The TLF is a five-year secured funding facility for New Zealand banks at a fixed rate of 0.25%.\n\nIn November 2020 the RBNZ announced a Funding for Lending Programme (FLP) which aimed to lower the cost of borrowing for New Zealand businesses and households. The FLP is a three-year secured funding facility for New Zealand banks at a floating rate of the New Zealand Official Cash Rate (OCR). New Zealand banks were able to obtain initial funding of up to 4% of their lending to New Zealand resident households, non-financial businesses and non-profit institutions serving households as at 31 October 2020 (eligible loans). The initial allocation closed on 6 June 2022. An additional allocation of up to 2% of eligible loans was available, subject to certain conditions until 6 December 2022.\n\nAs at 30 September 2023, ANZ Bank New Zealand had drawn $0.3 billion under the TLF (2022: $0.3 billion) and $3.2 billion under the FLP (2022: $2.3 billion).\n\n156",

All outstanding debt issuance and subordinated debt is profiled on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay. All at-call liabilities are reported in the 'Less than 3 months' category unless there is a longer minimum notice period. The amounts represent principal and interest cash flows and therefore may differ from equivalent amounts reported on balance sheet.\n\nIt should be noted that this is not how the Group manages its liquidity risk.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued)\n\n## FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE\n\nThe fair valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities is generally determined at the individual instrument level.\n\nIf the Group holds offsetting risk positions, then we use the portfolio exception in AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement (AASB 13) to measure the fair value of such groups of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Group measure the portfolio based on the price that would be received to sell a net long position (an asset) for a particular risk exposure, or to transfer a net short position (a liability) for a particular risk exposure.\n\n## Fair value designation\n\nThe Group designate certain loans and advances and certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss:\n\n- \u00b7 where they contain a separable embedded derivative which significantly modifies the instruments' cash flow ensuring we recognise the fair value movements on the assets or liabilities in profit or loss in the same period as the movement on the associated hedging instruments; or\n- \u00b7 in order to eliminate an accounting mismatch which would arise if the asset or liabilities were otherwise carried at amortised cost. This mismatch arises due to measuring the derivative financial instruments (which we use to mitigate interest rate risk of these assets or liabilities) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nOur approach ensures that we recognise the fair value movements on the assets or liabilities in profit or loss in the same period as the movement on the associated derivatives.\n\nThe Group may also designate certain loans and advances, certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss where they are managed on a fair value basis to align the measurement with how the instruments are managed.\n\n## FAIR VALUE APPROACH AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES\n\nWe use valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities for recognition, measurement and disclosure purposes where no quoted price in an active market exists for that asset or liability. This includes the following:\n\n| Asset or Liability                                                                                                                                                                              | Fair Value Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial instruments classified as:  - Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities  (including trading and non-trading)  - Repurchase agreements < 90 days  - Net loans and advances | Discounted cash flow techniques are used whereby contractual future cash flows of  the instrument are discounted using wholesale market interest rates, or market  borrowing rates for debt or loans with similar maturities or yield curve appropriate for  the remaining term to maturity. |\n| - Securities sold short  - Debt and equity securities                                                                                                                                           | instruments with similar credit risk, maturity and yield characteristics.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued)\n\n## FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY\n\nThe Group categorises assets and liabilities carried at fair value into a fair value hierarchy in accordance with AASB 13 based on the observability of inputs used to measure the fair value:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 - valuations based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n- \u00b7 Level 2 - valuations using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for a similar asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - valuations where significant unobservable inputs are used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability.\n\nThe following table presents assets and liabilities carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value hierarchy:\n\n|                                                            | Fair value measurements                     | Fair value measurements                     | Fair value measurements            | Fair value measurements            | Fair value measurements              | Fair value measurements              | Fair value measurements   | Fair value measurements   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                            | Quoted price in  active markets   (Level 1) | Quoted price in  active markets   (Level 1) | Using observable  inputs (Level 2) | Using observable  inputs (Level 2) | Using unobservable  inputs (Level 3) | Using unobservable  inputs (Level 3) |                           |                           |\n|                                                            | 2023                                        | 2022                                        | 2023                               | 2022                               | 2023                                 | 2022                                 | 2023                      | 2022                      |\n| Consolidated                                               | $m                                          | $m                                          | $m                                 | $m                                 | $m                                   | $m                                   | $m                        | $m                        |\n| Assets                                                     |                                             |                                             |                                    |                                    |                                      |                                      |                           |                           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents (measured at fair value) 1       | -

During 2023, within the trading book in its Markets business, the Company commenced the management of repurchase agreements and associated reverse repurchase agreements on a fair value basis. This resulted in repurchase and associated reverse repurchase agreements being recognized and measured at FVTPL.\n- 2. During 2023, $2,139 million of assets were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 (2022: $1,043 million transferred from Level 1 to Level 2), and $1,155 million of assets were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 (2022: $1,677 million transferred from Level 2 to Level 1) due to a change of the observability of valuation inputs. There were no other material transfers during the year. Transfers into and out of levels are measured at the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred.\n- 3. During 2023, ANZBGL sold its equity interests in the 1835i trusts, TIN and Pollination to ANZ NBH Pty Ltd as part of the Restructure. These investments were classified as Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy in September 2022, with a fair valuation of $402 million.\n\n163",

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued)\n\n## FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT INCORPORATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET DATA\n\n## Level 3 fair value measurements\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments are a net asset of $1,669 million (2022: $1,802 million) for the Group and $1,676 million (2022: $1,429 million) for the Company.\n\nThe assets and liabilities which incorporate significant unobservable inputs are:\n\n- \u00b7 equity and debt securities for which there is no active market or traded prices cannot be observed;\n- \u00b7 loans and advances measured at fair value for which there is no observable market data; and\n- \u00b7 derivatives referencing market rates that cannot be observed primarily due to lack of market activity.\n\n## Level 3 Transfers\n\nDuring the year, the Group and the Company transferred $218 million (2022: $312 million) of Loan and advances measured at fair value from Level 2 to Level 3, as a result of valuation parameters becoming unobservable during the year. There were no other material transfers into or out of Level 3 during the period.\n\nThe material Level 3 financial instruments as at 30 September 2023 are listed as below:\n\n## i) Investment Securities - equity holdings classified as FVOCI\n\n## Bank of Tianjin (BoT)\n\nThe Group holds an investment in the Bank of Tianjin. The investment is valued based on comparative price-to-book (P/B) multiples (a P/B multiple is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity). The extent of judgement applied in determining the appropriate multiple and comparator group from which the multiple is derived resulted in the Level 3 classification. As at September 2023, the BoT equity holding balance was $849 million (2022: $854 million). The decrease in the BoT fair valuation was due to a decrease in the P/B multiple used in the valuation.\n\n## Other equity investments\n\nThe Group holds $89 million (2022: $491 million) and the Company holds $87 million (2022: $165 million) of unlisted equities classified as FVOCI for which there are no active markets or traded prices available, resulting in Level 3 classification. The decrease in unlisted equity holdings balance was due to the sale of equity securities to the ANZ Non-Bank Group as part of the establishment of the new Group organisational structure.\n\n## ii) Net loans and advances - classified as FVTPL\n\n## Syndication Loans\n\nThe Group holds $729 million (2022: $403 million) of syndication loans for sale which are measured at FVTPL for which there is no observable market data available for the valuation. The increase in the Level 3 loan balances during the financial year was mainly due to increased syndication loans for sale as at reporting date, and loans and advances transferred from Level 2 to Level 3.\n\n## Sensitivity to Level 3 data inputs\n\nWhen we make assumptions due to significant inputs to a valuation not being directly observable (Level 3 inputs), then changing these assumptions changes the Group's estimate of the instrument's fair value. Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined by changing the primary unobservable parameters used to derive the fair valuation.\n\n## Investment Securities - equity holdings\n\nThe valuation of the equity investments are sensitive to variations in select unobservable inputs, with valuation techniques used including P/B multiples and discounted cashflow techniques. If for example, a 10% increase or decrease to the primary input into the valuations were to occur (such as the P/B multiple), it would result in a $94 million increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio, which would be recognised in shareholders' equity in the Group ($93 million for the Company), with no impact to net profit or loss.\n\n## Net Loans and Advances\n\nSyndicated loan valuations are sensitive to credit spreads in determining their fair valuation. However as these are primarily investment-grade loans, an increase or decrease in credit spreads and or interest yield would have an immaterial impact on net profit or net assets of the Group.\n\n## Other\n\nThe remaining Level 3 balance is immaterial and changes in inputs have a minimal impact on net profit and net assets of the Group.\n\n## Deferred fair value gains and losses\n\nWhere fair values are determined using unobservable inputs significant to the fair value of a financial instrument, the Group does not immediately recognise the difference between the transaction price and the amount we determine based on the valuation technique (day one gain or loss) in profit or loss. After initial recognition, we recognise the deferred amount in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the life of the transaction or until all inputs become observable. Day one gains and losses which have been deferred are not material.\n\n164",

These financial assets and liabilities are either short term in nature or are floating rate instruments that are re-priced to market interest rates on or near the end of the reporting period.\n\n|                               |         |         | Categorised into fair value hierarchy   | Categorised into fair value hierarchy   | Categorised into fair value hierarchy   | Categorised into fair value hierarchy   | Categorised into fair value hierarchy              | Categorised into fair value hierarchy              |                  |                  |\n|-------------------------------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                               |         |         | Quoted price  active markets  (Level 1) | Quoted price  active markets  (Level 1) | Using observable  inputs (Level 2)      | Using observable  inputs (Level 2)      | With significant non- observable inputs  (Level 3) | With significant non- observable inputs  (Level 3) | Total fair value | Total fair value |\n|                               | 2023    | 2022    | 2023                                    | 2022                                    | 2023                                    | 2022                                    | 2023                                               | 2022                                               | 2023             | 2022             |\n| Consolidated                  | $m      | $m      | $m                                      | $m                                      | $m                                      | $m                                      | $m                                                 | $m                                                 | $m               | $m               |\n| Financial assets              |         |         |                                         |                                         |                                         |                                         |                                                    |                                                    |                  |                  |\n| Investment securities 1       | 7,752   | 7,943   | -

The Group therefore regularly evaluates the key valuation assumptions used in the determination of the fair valuation of financial instruments incorporated within the financial statements, as this can involve a high degree of judgement and estimation in determining the carrying values at the balance date.\n\nIn determining the fair valuation of financial instruments, the Group has considered the impact of related economic and market conditions on fair value measurement assumptions and the appropriateness of valuation inputs in these estimates, notably valuation adjustments, as well as the impact of these matters on the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nMost of the valuation models the Group uses employ only observable market data as inputs. For certain financial instruments, we may use data that is not readily observable in current markets. If we use unobservable market data, then we need to exercise more judgement to determine fair value depending on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Generally, we derive unobservable inputs from other relevant market data and compare them to observed transaction prices where available. When establishing the fair value of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group also considers any required valuation adjustments in determining the fair value. We may apply adjustments (such as credit valuation adjustments and funding valuation adjustments - refer to Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments) to reflect the Group's assessment of factors that market participants would consider in determining fair value of a particular financial instrument.\n\n166",

Goodwill is allocated at the date of acquisition to the cash generating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the related business combination.\n\nGoodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. We estimate the recoverable amount of each CGU to which goodwill is allocated using a fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCOD) approach, with a value-in-use (VIU) assessment performed where the FVLCOD is less than the carrying amount.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to the following CGUs based on the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored.\n\n|                        | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash generating units: | $m     | $m     |\n| Australia Retail       | 100    | 178    |\n| New Zealand            | 1,617  | 1,530  |\n| Institutional          | 1,261  | 1,198  |\n\n170",

GGOOOODDWWIILLLL  AANNDD  OOTTHHEERR  IINNTTAANNGGIIBBLLEE  AASSSSEETTSS ( (ccoonnttiinnuueedd))\n\nWe estimate the FVLCOD of each CGU to which goodwill is allocated by applying observable price earnings multiples of comparable companies to the estimated future maintainable earnings of each CGU. A deduction is then made for estimated costs of disposal. The valuation is considered to be level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to unobservable inputs used in the valuation.\n\nManagement's approach and the key assumptions used in determining FVLCOD are as follows:\n\n| Key assumption                | Approach to determining the value (or values) for each key assumption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Future maintainable earnings  | Future maintainable earnings for each CGU is estimated as the sum of:  \u00b7 The Group's 2024 financial plan for each CGU; and  \u00b7 An allocation of the central costs recorded outside of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.  Where relevant, adjustments are made to the Group's financial plan to reflect the long-term expectations for  items such as expected credit losses and investment spend.                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Price/Earnings (P/E) multiple | P/E multiples applicable to each CGU have been derived from a comparator group of publicly traded  companies, and include a 30% control premium, discussed below.  In the case of the New Zealand and Institutional CGUs, management has made downwards adjustments to  P/E multiples to address specific factors relevant to those CGUs.  A control premium has been applied which recognises the increased consideration a potential acquirer  would be willing to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to achieve control over the relevant activities of |\n| Costs of disposal             | Costs of disposal have been estimated as 2% of the fair value of the CGU based on those observed from  historical and recent transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n\nAs noted above, our impairment testing did not result in the identification of any material impairment of goodwill as at 30 September 2023.\n\nThe FVLCOD estimates for each CGU are sensitive to assumptions about P/E multiples, future maintainable earnings and control premium (30%). However, each CGU would continue to show a surplus in recoverable amount over carrying amount even where other reasonably possible alternative estimates were used.\n\n171",

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nManagement judgement is used to assess the recoverable value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the useful economic life of an asset, or whether an asset has an indefinite life. We reassess the recoverability of the carrying value at each reporting date.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nA number of key judgements are required in the determination of whether or not a goodwill balance is impaired including:\n\n- \u00b7 the level at which goodwill is allocated - consistent with prior periods the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated are the Group's revenue generating segments that benefit from relevant historical business combinations generating goodwill.\n- \u00b7 determination of the carrying amount of each CGU which includes an allocation, on a reasonable and consistent basis, of corporate assets and liabilities that are not directly attributable to the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.\n- \u00b7 assessment of the recoverable amount of each CGU including:\n- o selection of the model used to determine the fair value - the Group has used the market multiple approach to estimate the fair value; and\n- o selection of the key assumptions in respect of future maintainable earnings, the P/E multiple applied, including selection of an appropriate comparator group and determination of an appropriate control premium, and costs of disposal as described above.\n\n## Software and other intangible assets\n\nAt each reporting date, software and other intangible assets are assessed for indicators of impairment and, where such indicators are identified, an impairment assessment is performed. In the event that an asset's carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the carrying amount of the asset is written down immediately. Those assets not yet ready for use are tested for impairment annually.\n\nIn addition, the expected useful lives of intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date. The assessment requires management judgement, and in relation to our software assets, a number of factors can influence the expected useful lives. These factors include changes to business strategy, significant divestments and the pace of technological change.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n173",

OTHER PROVISIONS (continued)\n\n## Customer remediation\n\nCustomer remediation includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties and litigation costs and outcomes.\n\n## Restructuring costs\n\nProvisions for restructuring costs arise from activities related to material changes in the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner in which that business is undertaken and include employee termination benefits. Costs relating to on-going activities are not provided for and are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Non-lending losses, frauds and forgeries\n\nNon-lending losses include losses arising from certain legal actions not directly related to amounts of principal outstanding for loans and advances and losses arising from forgeries, frauds and the correction of operational issues. The amounts recognised are the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties that surround the events and circumstances that affect the provision.\n\n## Other\n\nOther provisions comprise various other provisions including workers compensation, make-good provisions associated with leased premises, warranties and indemnities provided in connection with various disposals of businesses and assets, and contingent liabilities recognised as part of a business combination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nThe Group recognises provisions when there is a present obligation arising from a past event, an outflow of economic resources is probable, and the amount of the provision can be measured reliably.\n\nThe amount recognised is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the timing and amount of the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the estimated cash flows required to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe Group holds provisions for various obligations including customer remediation, restructuring costs, non-lending losses, frauds and forgeries and litigation related claims. These provisions involve judgements regarding the timing and outcome of future events, including estimates of expenditure required to satisfy such obligations. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in light of such advice, provisions and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made.\n\nIn relation to customer remediation, determining the amount of the provisions, which represent management's best estimate of the cost of settling the identified matters, requires the exercise of significant judgement. It will often be necessary to form a view on a number of different assumptions, including the number of impacted customers, the average refund per customer, the associated remediation project costs, and the implications of regulatory exposures and customer claims having regard to their specific facts and circumstances. There is a heightened level of estimation uncertainty where the customer remediation provision relates to a legal proceeding or matter. The appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence including expert legal advice, and adjustments are made to the provisions where appropriate.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n175",

These are considered non-controlling interests of the Group.\n\nThe key terms of the PPS are as follows:\n\n## PPS dividends\n\nPPS dividends are payable at the discretion of the Directors of ANZ Bank New Zealand and are non-cumulative. ANZ Bank New Zealand must not authorise or pay a dividend on its ordinary shares, acquire its ordinary shares or otherwise undertake a capital reduction in respect of its ordinary shares until the next PPS dividend payment date if a PPS dividend is not paid.\n\nShould ANZ Bank New Zealand elect to pay a PPS dividend, the PPS dividend is 6.95% per annum until 18 July 2028, and a floating rate equal to the aggregate of the New Zealand 3 month bank bill rate plus 3.25%, multiplied by one minus the New Zealand company tax rate (where the PPS dividend is fully imputed) thereafter, with PPS dividend payments scheduled to be paid on 18 January, 18 April, 18 July and 18 October each year.\n\n## Redemption features\n\nHolders of PPS have no right to require that the PPS be redeemed. ANZ Bank New Zealand may at its option redeem all of the PPS on an optional redemption date (each PPS dividend date from 18 July 2028); or at any time following the occurrence of a tax event or regulatory event, in each case subject to prior written approval of RBNZ and other conditions being met.\n\n177\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

We achieve this through an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) whereby ANZ conducts detailed strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon.\n\nThe process involves:\n\n- \u00b7 forecasting economic variables, financial performance of ANZ's divisions and the financial impact of new strategic initiatives to be implemented during the planning period;\n- \u00b7 performing stress tests under different economic scenarios to determine the level of additional capital (stress capital buffer) needed to absorb losses that may be experienced under an economic downturn;\n- \u00b7 reviewing capital ratios and targets across various classes of capital against ANZ's risk profile; and\n- \u00b7 developing a capital plan, taking into account capital ratio targets, current and future capital issuances requirements and options around capital products, timing and markets to execute the capital plan under differing market and economic conditions.\n\nThe capital plan is approved by the Board and updated as required. The Board and senior management are provided with regular updates of ANZ's capital position. Any material actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval. Throughout the year, the Group maintained compliance with all the regulatory requirements related to Capital Adequacy in the jurisdictions in which it operates.\n\n179\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Australia\n\nAs the ANZ Bank Group is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) in Australia, it is primarily regulated by APRA under the Banking Act 1959 (Cth). ANZ Bank Group must comply with the minimum regulatory capital requirements, prudential capital ratios and specific reporting levels that APRA sets and which are consistent with the global Basel III capital framework. This is the common framework for determining the appropriate level of bank regulatory capital as set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. APRA minimum requirements are summarised below:\n\n## Regulatory Capital Definition\n\n| Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital                                                                                                              | Tier 1 Capital                                                                                                            | Tier 2 Capital                                                                                                                                                                      | Total Capital                            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Shareholders' equity adjusted for  specific items.                                                                                               | CET1 Capital plus certain  securities with complying loss  absorbing characteristics known  as Additional Tier 1 Capital. | Subordinated debt instruments  which have a minimum term of 5  years at issue date.                                                                                                 | Tier 1 plus Tier 2 Capital.              |\n| Minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs)                                                                                                         | Minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs)                                                                                  | Minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs)                                                                                                                                            | Minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs) |\n| CET1 Ratio                                                                                                                                       | Tier 1 Ratio                                                                                                              | Total Capital Ratio                                                                                                                                                                 |                                          |\n| CET1 Capital divided by total risk  weighted assets must be at least 4.5%.                                                                       | Tier 1 Capital divided by total risk  weighted assets must be at least  6.0%.                                             | Total Capital divided by total risk  weighted assets must be at least  8.0%.

APRA has determined that ANZ is a D-SIB.\n- \u00b7 a countercyclical capital buffer which is set on a jurisdictional basis. The requirement is currently set at 1% for Australia.\n\nAdditionally in December 2021, APRA announced that it requires all D-SIBs including ANZ to increase its minimum total capital ratio requirement by 3% of RWA by January 2024, and a further 1.5% of RWA by January 2026 (total increase of 4.5%). APRA expects this to be predominantly met by Tier 2 Capital, with an equivalent decrease in other senior funding. ANZ is on track to meet these requirements at reporting date.\n\n## Insurance and Funds Management\n\nAs required by APRA's Prudential Standards, insurance and funds management activities are:\n\n- \u00b7 de-consolidated for the purposes of calculating capital adequacy; and\n- \u00b7 excluded from the risk-based capital adequacy framework.\n\nWe deduct the investment in these controlled entities 100% from CET1 capital, and if we include any profits from these activities in the ANZ Bank Group's results, then we exclude them from the determination of CET1 capital to the extent they have not been remitted.\n\n## Outside Australia\n\nIn addition to APRA, ANZ's branch operations and major banking subsidiary operations are also overseen by local regulators such as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the US Federal Reserve, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. They may impose minimum capital levels on operations in their individual jurisdictions.\n\n180",

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## APRA Capital Reform\n\nAPRA released new bank capital adequacy requirements applying to Australian incorporated registered banks, which are set out in APRA's Banking Prudential Standard documents. ANZ implemented these new requirements from 1 January 2023.\n\nThe new capital adequacy key requirements include changes to APS 110 Capital Adequacy (APS 110), APS 112 Capital Adequacy: Standardised Approach to Credit Risk (APS 112) and APS 113 Capital Adequacy: Internal Ratings-based Approach to Credit Risk (APS 113) with key features of the reforms including:\n\n- \u00b7 improving the flexibility of the capital framework through larger capital buffers that can be used by banks to support lending during periods of stress;\n- \u00b7 changes to risk weighted assets (RWA) through more risk-sensitive risk weights increasing capital requirements for higher risk lending and decreasing it for lower risks;\n- \u00b7 changes to loss given default rates (LGD) including approved use of an internal ratings-based (IRB) approved LGD model for mortgage portfolios;\n- \u00b7 an increase in the IRB scaling factor (from 1.06x to 1.1x);\n- \u00b7 requirement that IRB ADIs calculate and disclose RWA under the standardised approach and the introduction of a capital floor at 72.5% of standardised RWA; and\n- \u00b7 use of prescribed New Zealand authority's equivalent prudential rules for the purpose of calculating the Level 2 regulatory capital requirement.\n\nIn addition, operational RWA is now calculated under APS 115 Capital Adequacy: Standardised Measurement Approach to Operational Risk (APS 115) which replaced the previous advanced methodology from December 2022.\n\nThe application of APRA Capital Reform in January 2023 reduced RWA by $34.5 billion, equivalent to a 100 bps CET1 ratio benefit. This was partially offset by APRA's expectations that ADIs operate a higher capital ratio to maintain an unquestionably strong level.\n\n## ANZ BANK GROUP 1\n\nThe following table provides details of ANZ Bank Group's capital adequacy ratios at 30 September:\n\n|                                                    | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                    | 2023  $m       | 2022  $m       |\n| Qualifying capital                                 |                |                |\n| Tier 1                                             |                |                |\n| Shareholders' equity and non-controlling interests | 69,114         | 66,401         |\n| Prudential adjustments to shareholders' equity     | (425)          | (175)          |\n| Gross Common Equity Tier 1 capital                 | 68,689         | 66,226         |\n| Deductions                                         | (10,895)       | (10,354)       |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 capital                       | 57,794         | 55,872         |\n| Additional Tier 1 capital 2                        | 8,232          | 7,686          |\n| Tier 1 capital                                     | 66,026         | 63,558         |\n| Tier 2 capital 3                                   | 24,959         | 19,277         |\n| Total qualifying capital                           | 90,985         | 82,835         |\n| Capital adequacy ratios (Level 2)                  |                |                |\n| Common Equity Tier 1                               | 13.3%          | 12.3%          |\n| Tier 1                                             | 15.2%          | 14.0%          |\n| Tier 2                                             | 5.8%           | 4.2%           |\n| Total capital ratio                                | 21.0%          | 18.2%          |\n| Risk weighted assets                               | 433,327        | 454,718        |\n\n181\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

Not owned by the Group. Control exists as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of the operations.\n\n## CHANGES TO MATERIAL CONTROLLED ENTITIES\n\nANZ Singapore Limited was deregistered on 18 August 2023. ANZ International (Hong Kong) Limited, ANZ (Thai) Public Company Limited (formerly ANZ Bank (Thai) Public Company Limited), and Chongqing Liangping ANZ Rural Bank Company Limited are in liquidation as at 30 September 2023.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS\n\nControlled entities that are subject to prudential regulation may be required to maintain minimum capital or other regulatory requirements which may, from time to time, limit the entity's ability to transfer assets, pay dividends or make other capital distributions to the parent entity or to other entities in the Group. The Group manages such restrictions within our risk management framework, as outlined in Note 17 Financial Risk Management and our capital management strategy, as outlined in Note 24 Capital Management.\n\nAs at 30 September 2023, restrictions on the ability of an entity within the Group to transfer assets, pay dividends or make other capital distributions to other entities in the Group were not material to the liquidity or capital management of the Group.\n\n182",

CONTROLLED ENTITIES (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries are those entities it controls through:\n\n- \u00b7 being exposed to, or having rights to, variable returns from the entity; and\n- \u00b7 being able to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nThe Group assesses whether it has power over those entities by examining the Group's existing rights to direct the relevant activities of the entity.\n\nIf the Group sells or acquires subsidiaries during the year, it includes their operating results in the Group results to the date of disposal or from the date of acquisition. When the Group's control ceases, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any related noncontrolling interest and other components of equity.\n\nIf the Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary changes in a way that does not result in a loss of control, then the Group accounts for that as a transaction with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders.\n\nAll transactions between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n183",

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (continued)\n\n## IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Group assesses the carrying value of its associates investments for impairment indicators.\n\nAt 30 September 2023, the impairment assessment of non-lending assets identified that one of the Group's associated investments PT Panin had indicators of impairment. No impairment was recognised as its carrying value is supported by its VIU calculations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence over its operating and financial policies but does not control. The Group accounts for associates using the equity method. Its investments in associates are carried at cost plus the post-acquisition share of changes in the associate's net assets less accumulated impairments. Dividends the Group receives from associates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. The Group includes goodwill recognised by the associate in the carrying amount of the investment. It does not individually test the goodwill incorporated in the associates carrying amount for impairment.\n\nAt least at each reporting date, the Group reviews investments in associates for any indication of impairment. If an indication of impairment exists, then the Group determines the recoverable amount of the associate using the higher of:\n\n- \u00b7 the associate's fair value less cost of disposal; and\n- \u00b7 its value-in-use.\n\nWe use a discounted cash flow methodology, and when applicable, other methodologies (such as capitalisation of earnings methodology), to determine the recoverable amount when determining a VIU.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are assessed at each reporting date and tested for impairment when there is an indication that the investment may be impaired. In addition, the Group is required to assess at each reporting date whether the recoverable amount of the Group's investment has increased to such a level as to support the reversal of prior period impairments.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required to determine the key assumptions underpinning the VIU calculation. Factors that may change in subsequent periods and lead to potential future impairments include lower than forecast earnings levels in the near term and/or a decrease in the long term growth forecasts, increases to required levels of regulatory capital and an increase in the post-tax discount rate arising from an increase in the risk premium or risk-free rates.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the VIU calculation are outlined below:\n\n| As at 30 September 2023                                          | PT Panin   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Post-tax discount rate                                           | 12.2%      |\n| Terminal growth rate                                             | 5.0%       |\n| Expected earnings growth (compound annual growth rate - 5 years) | 5.4%       |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (5 year average)                      | 12.8%      |\n\nThe VIU calculations are sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions with reasonably possible changes in key assumptions having a positive or negative impact on the VIU outcome, and as such the recoverable amount of the investment.\n\n- \u00b7 A change in the September 2023 post-tax discount rate by +/- 50bps would impact the VIU outcome for PT Panin by $(91 million)/ $105 million.\n- \u00b7 A change in the September 2023 terminal growth rate by +/- 25bps would impact the VIU outcome for PT Panin by $55 million/ ($51 million).\n\nThe investment would not be impaired if the discount rate were increased or the terminal growth rate reduced by the reasonably possible changes above.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n185",

STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nA Structured Entity (SE) is an entity that has been designed such that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in determining who controls the entity. SEs are generally established with restrictions on their ongoing activities in order to achieve narrow and well defined objectives.\n\nSEs are classified as subsidiaries and consolidated when control exists. If the Group does not control a SE, then it is not consolidated. This note provides information on both consolidated and unconsolidated SEs.\n\nThe Group's involvement with SEs is as follows:\n\n| Type                             | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Securitisation                   | The Group establishes SEs to securitise customer loans and advances that it has originated, in order to diversify  sources of funding for liquidity management. Securitisation programs include customer loans and advances  assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide either security for obligations payable on notes issued by the SEs  to external investors or create assets held by the Group eligible for repurchase agreements with applicable  central banks.                      |\n| Covered bond issuances           | Certain loans and advances have been assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for issuances of  debt securities by the Group. The Group retains control over these SEs and therefore they are consolidated.

These  MIS are financed through the issue of units to investors and the Group considers them to be SEs.

STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued)\n\n## UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\n## GROUP'S INTEREST IN UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nAn 'interest' in an unconsolidated SE is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement with a SE that exposes the Group to variability of returns from the performance of that SE. These interests include, but are not limited to: holdings of debt or equity securities; derivatives that pass-on risks specific to the performance of the SE, lending, loan commitments, financial guarantees, and fees from funds management activities.\n\nFor the purpose of disclosing interests in unconsolidated SEs:\n\n- \u00b7 no disclosure is made if the Group's involvement is not more than a passive interest - for example: when the Group's involvement constitutes a typical customer-supplier relationship. On this basis, exposures to unconsolidated SEs that arise from lending, trading and investing activities are not considered disclosable interests - unless the design of the structured entity allows the Group to participate in decisions about the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the entity's returns).\n- \u00b7 'interests' do not include derivatives intended to expose the Group to market-risk (rather than performance risk specific to the SE) or derivatives through which the Group creates, rather than absorbs, variability of the unconsolidated SE (such as purchase of credit protection under a credit default swap).\n\nThe table below sets out the Group's interests in unconsolidated SEs together with the maximum exposure to loss that could arise from those interests:\n\n|                                  | Securitisation   | Securitisation   | Structured finance   | Structured finance   | Total    | Total    |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------|----------|\n|                                  | 2023  $m         | 2022  $m         | 2023  $m             | 2022  $m             | 2023  $m | 2022  $m |\n| On-balance sheet interests       |                  |                  |                      |                      |          |          |\n| Investment securities            | 2,070            | 3,352            | -                    | -                    | 2,070    | 3,352    |\n| Gross loans and advances         | 10,367           | 9,433            | 24                   | 43                   | 10,391   | 9,476    |\n| Total on-balance sheet           | 12,437           | 12,785           | 24                   | 43                   | 12,461   | 12,828   |\n| Off-balance sheet interests      |                  |                  |                      |                      |          |          |\n| Commitments (facilities undrawn) | 3,270            | 2,078            | -                    | -                    | 3,270    | 2,078    |\n| Guarantees                       | 50               | 50               | -                    | -                    | 50       | 50       |\n| Total off-balance sheet          | 3,320            | 2,128            | -                    | -                    | 3,320    | 2,128    |\n| Maximum exposure to loss         | 15,757           | 14,913           | 24                   | 43                   | 15,781   | 14,956   |\n\nIn addition to the interests above, the Group earned funds management fees from unconsolidated investment funds of $177 million (2022: $181 million) during the year.\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to loss represents the maximum amount of loss that the Group could incur as a result of its involvement with unconsolidated SEs if loss events were to take place - regardless of the probability of occurrence. This does not in any way represent the actual losses expected to be incurred. Furthermore, the maximum exposure to loss is stated gross of the effects of hedging and collateral arrangements entered into to mitigate ANZ's exposure to loss.\n\nThe maximum exposure to loss has been determined as:\n\n- \u00b7 the carrying amount of Investment securities measured at amortised cost; and\n- \u00b7 the carrying amount plus the undrawn amount of any committed loans and advances.\n\nThe size of unconsolidated SEs is indicated by total assets which vary by SE with the largest single SE having a value of approximately $4.3 billion.\n\nThe Group did not provide any non-contractual support to unconsolidated SEs during the year (2022: nil) nor does it have any current intention to provide financial or other support to unconsolidated SEs.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n187",

STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued)\n\n## SPONSORED UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nThe Group may also sponsor unconsolidated SEs in which it has no disclosable interest.\n\nFor the purposes of this disclosure, the Group considers itself the 'sponsor' of an unconsolidated SE if it is the primary party involved in the design and establishment of that SE and:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group is the major user of that SE; or\n- \u00b7 the Group's name appears in the name of that SE, or on its products; or\n- \u00b7 the Group provides implicit or explicit guarantees of that SE's performance.\n\nThe Group has sponsored the ANZ PIE Fund in New Zealand, which invests only in deposits with ANZ Bank New Zealand. The Group does not provide any implicit or explicit guarantees of the capital value or performance of investments in the ANZ PIE Fund. There was no income received from, nor assets transferred to, this entity during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nSignificant judgement is required in assessing whether the Group has control over Structured Entities. Judgement is required to determine the existence of:\n\n- \u00b7 power over the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the entity's returns); and\n- \u00b7 exposure to variable returns of the entity.\n\n## 28. TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nIn the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions where it transfers financial assets directly to third parties or to SEs. These transfers may result in the Group fully, or partially, derecognising those financial assets - depending on the Group's exposure to the risks and rewards or control over the transferred assets. If the Group retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of a transferred asset, the transfer does not qualify for derecognition and the asset remains on the Group's balance sheet in its entirety.\n\n## SECURITISATIONS\n\nNet loans and advances include residential mortgages securitised under the Group's securitisation programs which are assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for obligations payable on the notes issued by the SEs. The holders of the issued notes have full recourse to the pool of residential mortgages which have been securitised and the Group cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets.\n\nIn some instances, the Group is also the holder of the securitised notes issued by the SEs. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual income of the SEs and sometimes enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets.\n\nThe Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with these securitisation SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group.\n\n## COVERED BONDS\n\nThe Group operates various global covered bond programs to raise funding in its primary markets. Net loans and advances include residential mortgages assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs associated with these covered bond programs. In respect of each program, a covered bond guarantor has guaranteed payments of interest and principal pursuant to a guarantee which is secured over its assets, including these residential mortgages. Substantially all of the assets of each covered bond guarantor consist of that covered bond guarantor's equitable interests in mortgage loans secured by residential real estate.\n\nThe covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool of assets. The issuer cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets, however, subject to legal arrangements it may repurchase and substitute assets as long as the required cover is maintained.\n\nThe Group is required to maintain the cover pool at a level sufficient to cover the bond obligations. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual income of the covered bond SEs (after all payments to the covered bond holders and external parties) and enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the majority of the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets.\n\nThe Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with the covered bond SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group. The covered bonds issued externally are included within debt issuances.\n\n188",

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS (continued)\n\n## REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nWhen the Group sells securities subject to repurchase agreements under which we retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, then those assets do not qualify for derecognition. An associated liability is recognised for the consideration received from the counterparty.\n\n## STRUCTURED FINANCE ARRANGEMENTS\n\nThe Group arranges funding for certain customer transactions through structured leasing. These transactions are recognised on Group's balance sheet as lease receivables or loans. At times, other financial institutions participate in the funding of these arrangements. This participation involves a proportionate transfer of the rights to the assets recognised by the Group. The participating banks have limited recourse to the leased assets and related proceeds. Where the Group continues to be exposed to some of the risks of the transferred assets through a derivative or other continuing involvement, the Group does not derecognise the lease receivable or loan. Instead, the Group recognises an associated liability representing its obligations to the participating financial institutions.\n\nThe tables below set out the balance of assets transferred that do not qualify for derecognition, along with the associated liabilities.\n\n|                                               |      |       | Covered bonds   | Covered bonds   | Repurchase  agreements   | Repurchase  agreements   | Structured finance  arrangements   | Structured finance  arrangements   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                               | 2023 | 2022  | 2023            | 2022            | 2023                     | 2022                     | 2023                               | 2022                               |\n| Consolidated                                  | $m   | $m    | $m              | $m              | $m                       | $m                       | $m                                 | $m                                 |\n| Current carrying amount of assets transferred | 886  | 1,121 | 31,188          | 27,575          | 47,552                   | 52,757                   | 27                                 | 36                                 |\n| Carrying amount of associated liabilities     | 880  | 1,115 | 18,223          | 12,967          | 44,454                   | 47,229                   | 27                                 | 36                                 |\n\n|                                               | 1,2   | 1,2   | Covered bonds   | Covered bonds   | Repurchase  agreements   | Repurchase  agreements   | Structured finance  arrangements   | Structured finance  arrangements   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                               | 2023  | 2022  | 2023            | 2022            | 2023                     | 2022                     | 2023                               | 2022                               |\n| The Company                                   | $m    | $m    | $m              | $m              | $m                       | $m                       | $m                                 | $m                                 |\n| Current carrying amount of assets transferred | 886   | 1,121 | 21,017          | 17,953          | 42,002                   | 47,846                   | -                                  | -                                  |\n| Carrying amount of associated liabilities     | 886   | 1,121 | 21,017          | 17,953          | 40,080                   | 42,940                   | -                                  | -                                  |\n\n189\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

In 2023, the Group made defined benefit contributions totalling $2 million (2022: $2 million). It expects to make contributions of approximately $2 million next financial year.\n\n## GOVERNANCE OF THE SCHEMES AND FUNDING OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT SECTIONS\n\nThe main defined benefit superannuation schemes in which the Group participates operate under trust law and are managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the relevant trust deed and rules and all relevant legislation. These schemes have corporate trustees, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group. The trustees are the legal owners of the assets, which are held separately from the assets of the Group, and are responsible for setting investment policy and agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial actuarial valuation process.\n\nThe Group has defined benefit arrangements in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Philippines, Taiwan and United Kingdom. The defined benefit section of the ANZ Australian Staff Superannuation Scheme, the ANZ UK Staff Pension Scheme and the ANZ National Retirement Scheme in New Zealand are the three largest plans. They have been closed to new members since 1987, 2004 and 1991 respectively. None of the schemes had a material deficit, or surplus, at the last funding valuation. The Group has no present liability under any of the schemes' trust deeds to fund a deficit (measured on a funding basis). A contingent liability of the Group may arise if any of the schemes were wound up.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## Defined benefit superannuation schemes\n\nThe Group operates a small number of defined benefit schemes. Independent actuaries calculate the liability and expenses related to providing benefits to employees under each defined benefit scheme. They use the Projected Unit Credit Method to value the liabilities. The balance sheet includes:\n\n- \u00b7 a defined benefit liability if the obligation is greater than the fair value of the schemes assets; and\n- \u00b7 an asset (capped to its recoverable amount) if the fair value of the assets is greater than the obligation.\n\nIn each reporting period, the movements in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the net movement relating to the current period's service cost, net interest on the defined benefit liability, past service costs and other costs (such as the effects of any curtailments and settlements) as operating expenses;\n- \u00b7 remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (which comprise actuarial gains and losses and return on scheme assets, excluding interest income included in net interest) directly in retained earnings through other comprehensive income; and\n- \u00b7 contributions of the Group directly against the net defined benefit position.\n\n## Defined contribution superannuation schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. It also contributes (according to local law, in the various countries in which it operates) to Government and other plans that have the characteristics of defined contribution plans. The Group's contributions to these schemes are recognised as personnel expenses when they are incurred.\n\n190",

EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS\n\nOn 3 January 2023, ANZBGL established, by a scheme of arrangement, a non-operating holding company, ANZGHL, as the new listed parent holding company of the ANZ Group. There is no impact to employee equity (deferred shares, deferred share rights, restricted rights and performance rights) as a result of the Restructure.\n\nANZ operates a number of employee share and option schemes under the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and the ANZ Share Option Plan which are operated by the Company's ultimate parent, ANZGHL. These are Group share based payment arrangements under which shares in ANZGHL (ANZ shares) are allocated or granted to employees of the Group.\n\n## ANZ EMPLOYEE SHARE ACQUISITION PLAN\n\nANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan schemes that operated during 2023 and 2022 were the Deferred Share Plan and the Variable Pay to Shares (VPS) Offer. The ANZ Incentive Plan (ANZIP) (the variable remuneration plan operating across ANZ) has Short Term Variable Remuneration or Variable Remuneration delivered under the Deferred Share Plan or ANZ Share Option Plan for eligible employees.\n\n## Deferred Share Plan\n\n## i) ANZ Incentive Plan (ANZIP) - Short term Variable Remuneration (STVR) and Variable Remuneration (VR) - deferred shares\n\n| Award Type                                                                                                                                                      | STVR (deferred shares)                                                                                                                        | STVR/VR historical (deferred shares)                                                                                                  | VR (deferred shares)                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Eligibility                                                                                                                                                     | Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Group Executive Committee (ExCo) and Group  General Manager Internal Audit (GGM IA) 1 .                        | Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Group Executive Committee (ExCo) and Group  General Manager Internal Audit (GGM IA) 1 .                | All other employees (excluding  select roles in the United Kingdom  (UK)/China 2 ) |\n| Financial Year (FY) of  grant                                                                                                                                   | 2022 Performance and  Remuneration Review (PRR): granted  in FY23                                                                             | 2021 PRR: granted in FY22  Historical grants: on foot during FY23  & FY22  Historical grants: on foot during FY23  & FY22             | 2022 and 2021 PRR: granted in FY23  & FY22                                         |\n| Grant approach                                                                                                                                                  | 50% of the CEO, ExCo and GGM IA's  Short Term Variable Remuneration  (STVR) deferred as shares.                                               | 50% of the CEO's STVR, 25% of ExCo's  Variable Remuneration (VR) (except  for the Chief Risk Officer (CRO)), and  deferred as shares. | If VR is at or exceeds AUD 100,000,  then 60% of total VR amount is                |\n| Deferred over years two and three, where year 1 includes the performance  period (i.e., 1 October to 30 September).

EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued)\n\n## iii) Further information\n\n| Cessation                     | Unless the Board 1  decides otherwise, employees forfeit their unvested deferred shares if they resign, are terminated  on notice, or are dismissed for serious misconduct. The deferred shares may be held in trust beyond the deferral  period.                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dividends                     | Dividends are reinvested in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Instrument                    | Deferred share rights may be granted instead of deferred shares in some countries as locally appropriate (see  deferred share rights section).                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Expensing value (fair  value) | We expense the fair value of deferred shares on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period and we  recognise the expense as a share-based compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Deferred  shares are expensed based on the one-day VWAP at the date of grant.                                                                 |\n| 2023 and 2022 grants          | During the 2023 year, we granted 2,244,181 deferred shares (2022: 1,971,715) with a weighted average allocation  value of $24.37 (2022: $27.52).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Downward adjustment           | Deferred shares remain at risk and the Board has the discretion to adjust the number of deferred shares downwards,  including to zero at any time before the vesting date (malus), and limited to select employees 2 , recovery post vesting  (i.e., clawback). ANZ's downward adjustment provisions are detailed in section 7.3 of the 2023 Remuneration Report. |\n\n- 1. References to 'the Board' throughout this note means the Boards of ANZGHL and ANZBGL.\n- 2. Clawback applies to the CEO, ExCo and GGM IA (for awards granted in 2023 financial year), and to select senior employees in jurisdictions where clawback regulations apply.\n\n## Variable Pay to Shares (VPS) Offer\n\n| Eligibility, grant  approach and  conditions   | VPS provides employees in Australia the opportunity to receive up to $1,000 worth of ANZ shares with concessional  tax treatment (where criteria are met). All ANZ shares are held by a custodian or nominee appointed by the Trustee  on the Trustee's behalf and are restricted for 3 years. During this time employees benefit from dividend payments  which are reinvested through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) and have voting entitlements. After the  restriction period has been reached the shares can sold or transferred.   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Allocation value                               | Granted based on the VWAP of ANZ shares traded on the ASX in the five trading days leading up to and including the  date of grant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Expensing value                                | Expensed based on the one-day VWAP at the date of grant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| 2023 grants                                    | During the 2023 year, we granted 55,600 shares on 22 November 2022 at an issue price of $24.46 (no grants were  made in relation to the VPS Offer in the 2022 year).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n## Expensing of the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan\n\nExpensing value (fair value)\n\nThe fair value of shares we granted during 2023 under the Deferred Share Plan and VPS Offer, measured as at the date of grant of the shares, is $56.5 million (2022: $52.6 million Deferred Share Plan only) based on 2,299,781 shares (2022: 1,971,715 Deferred Share Plan only) at VWAP of $24.57 (2022: $26.69).\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n193",

We do so in accordance with the requirements of AASB 2 Share-based Payments. The models take into account early exercise of vested equity, nontransferability and internal/external performance hurdles (if any).\n\nThe table below shows the significant assumptions we used as inputs into our fair value calculation of instruments granted during the period. We present the values as weighted averages, but the specific values we use for each allocation are the ones we use for the fair value calculation.\n\n|                                              | 2023                      | 2023               | 2023                | 2022                      | 2022                 |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|\n|                                              | Deferred   share   rights | Restricted  rights | Performance  rights | Deferred   share   rights | Performance   rights |\n| Exercise price ($)                           | 0.00                      | 0.00               | 0.00                | 0.00                      | 0.00                 |\n| Share closing price at grant date ($)        | 24.67                     | 24.54              | 24.51               | 26.62                     | 26.92                |\n| Expected volatility of ANZ share price (%) 1 | 20.0                      | 20.0               | 20.0                | 20.0                      | 20.0                 |\n| Equity term (years)                          | 2.1                       | 6.6                | 6.6                 | 2.2                       | 6.0                  |\n| Vesting period (years)                       | 2.0                       | 4.6                | 4.6                 | 2.1                       | 4.0                  |\n| Expected life (years)                        | 2.0                       | 4.6                | 4.6                 | 2.1                       | 4.0                  |\n| Expected dividend yield (%)                  | 6.25                      | 6.25               | 6.25                | 5.50                      | 5.50                 |\n| Risk free interest rate (%)                  | 3.20                      | 3.36               | 3.36                | 0.80                      | 1.25                 |\n| Fair value ($)                               | 21.81                     | 18.61              | 9.85                | 23.71                     | 10.38                |\n\n## SATISFYING EQUITY AWARDS\n\nAll shares underpinning equity awards may be purchased on market, reallocated or be newly issued shares, or a combination.\n\nThe equity we purchased on market during the 2023 financial year (either under the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and the ANZ Share Option Plan, or to satisfy options or rights) for all employees amounted to 816,023 shares at an average price of $24.35 per share (2022: 4,230,962 shares at an average price of $27.57 per share).\n\n197\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS\n\n## CREDIT RELATED COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\n|                                   | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                   | 2023  $m       | 2022  $m       | 2023  $m      | 2022  $m      |\n| Contract amount of:               |                |                |               |               |\n| Undrawn facilities                | 240,711        | 236,051        | 206,405       | 201,204       |\n| Guarantees and letters of credit  | 23,556         | 23,729         | 20,816        | 21,557        |\n| Performance related contingencies | 26,615         | 26,036         | 25,891        | 24,634        |\n| Total                             | 290,882        | 285,816        | 253,112       | 247,395       |\n\n## UNDRAWN FACILITIES\n\nThe majority of undrawn facilities are subject to customers maintaining specific credit and other requirements or conditions. Many of these facilities are expected to be only partially used, and others may never be used at all. As such, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not necessarily representative of future liquidity risks or future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Group or the Company may be required to pay, the full amount of undrawn facilities for the Group and the Company mature within 12 months.\n\n## GUARANTEES, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE RELATED CONTINGENCIES\n\nGuarantees, letters of credit and performance related contingencies relate to transactions that the Group has entered into as principal - including guarantees, standby letters of credit and documentary letters of credit.\n\nDocumentary letters of credit involve the Group issuing letters of credit guaranteeing payment in favour of an exporter. They are secured against an underlying shipment of goods or backed by a confirmatory letter of credit from another bank.\n\nPerformance-related contingencies are liabilities that oblige the Group to make payments to a third party if the customer fails to fulfil its nonmonetary obligations under the contract.\n\nTo reflect the risk associated with these transactions, we apply the same credit origination, portfolio management and collateral requirements that we apply to loans. The contract amount represents the maximum potential amount that we could lose if the counterparty fails to meet its financial obligations. As the facilities may expire without being drawn upon, the notional amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Group or the Company may be required to pay, the full amount of guarantees and letters of credit and performancerelated contingencies for the Group and the Company mature within 12 months.\n\n## OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nThere are outstanding court proceedings, claims and possible claims for and against the Group. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in the light of such advice, provisions (refer to Note 22 Other Provisions) and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made. In some instances we have not disclosed the estimated financial impact of the individual items either because it is not practicable to do so or because such disclosure may prejudice the interests of the Group.\n\nA description of contingent liabilities and contingent assets as at 30 September 2023 is set out below.\n\n## REGULATORY AND CUSTOMER EXPOSURES\n\nThe Group regularly engages with its regulators in relation to regulatory investigations, surveillance and reviews, reportable situations, civil enforcement actions (whether by court action or otherwise), formal and informal inquiries and regulatory supervisory activities in Australia and globally. The Group has received various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Group-specific reviews and has also made disclosures to its regulators at its own instigation. The nature of these interactions can be wide ranging and, for example, include or have included in recent years a range of matters including responsible lending practices, regulated lending requirements, product suitability and distribution, interest and fees and the entitlement to charge them, customer remediation, wealth advice, insurance distribution, pricing, competition, conduct in financial markets and financial transactions, capital market transactions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations, privacy obligations and information security, business continuity management, reporting and disclosure obligations and product disclosure documentation. There may be exposures to customers which are additional to any regulatory exposures. These could include class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with such reviews and possible exposures remain uncertain.\n\n201\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

The potential civil penalty or other financial impact is uncertain.\n\n## CAPITAL RAISING ACTION\n\nIn September 2018, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company alleging failure to comply with continuous disclosure obligations in connection with the Company's August 2015 underwritten institutional share placement. In October 2023, the Federal Court of Australia found that the Company should have notified the ASX of the joint lead managers' take-up of placement shares. No order has yet been made in respect of payment of legal costs or the amount of a civil penalty. The maximum penalty is $1 million.\n\n## ESANDA DEALER CAR LOAN LITIGATION\n\nIn August 2020, a class action was brought against the Company alleging unfair conduct, misleading or deceptive conduct and equitable mistake in relation to the use of flex commissions in dealer arranged Esanda car loans. The Company is defending the allegations.\n\n## ONEPATH SUPERANNUATION LITIGATION\n\nIn December 2020, a class action was brought against OnePath Custodians, OnePath Life and the Company alleging that OnePath Custodians breached its obligations under superannuation legislation, and its duties as trustee, in respect of superannuation investments and fees. The claim also alleges that the Company was involved in some of OnePath Custodians' investment breaches. The Company is defending the allegations.\n\n## NEW ZEALAND LOAN INFORMATION LITIGATION\n\nIn September 2021, a representative proceeding was brought against ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited, alleging breaches of disclosure requirements under consumer credit legislation in respect of variation letters sent to certain loan customers. ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited is defending the allegations.\n\n## CREDIT CARDS LITIGATION\n\nIn November 2021, a class action was brought against the Company alleging that certain interest terms in credit card contracts were unfair contract terms and that it was unconscionable for the Company to rely on them. The Company is defending the allegations.\n\n## ROYAL COMMISSION\n\nThe Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry released its final report on 4 February 2019. Following the Royal Commission there have been, and continue to be, additional costs and further exposures, including exposures associated with further regulator activity or potential customer exposures such as class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with these possible exposures remain uncertain.\n\n## SECURITY RECOVERY ACTIONS\n\nVarious claims have been made or are anticipated, arising from security recovery actions taken to resolve impaired assets. These claims will be defended.\n\n## WARRANTIES, INDEMNITIES AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT FEES\n\nThe Group has provided warranties, indemnities and other commitments in favour of the purchaser and other persons in connection with various disposals of businesses and assets and other transactions, covering a range of matters and risks. It is exposed to claims under those warranties, indemnities and commitments, some of which are currently active. The outcomes and total costs associated with these exposures remain uncertain.\n\nThe Group has entered an arrangement to pay performance management fees to external fund managers in the event predetermined performance criteria are satisfied in relation to certain Group investments. The satisfaction of the performance criteria and associated performance management fee remains uncertain.\n\n202",

COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS (continued)\n\n## OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)\n\n## CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nCertain group companies have a commitment to comply with rules governing various clearing and settlement arrangements which could result in a credit risk exposure and loss if another member institution fails to settle its payment clearing activities. The Group's potential exposure arising from these arrangements is unquantifiable in advance.\n\nCertain group companies hold memberships of central clearing houses, including ASX Clear (Futures), London Clearing House (LCH), SwapClear and RepoClear, Korea Exchange (KRX), Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX), Clearing Corporation of India and the Shanghai Clearing House. These memberships allow the relevant group company to centrally clear derivative instruments in line with cross-border regulatory requirements. Common to all of these memberships is the requirement for the relevant group company to make default fund contributions. In the event of a default by another member, the relevant group company could potentially be required to commit additional default fund contributions which are unquantifiable in advance.\n\n## PARENT ENTITY GUARANTEES\n\nCertain group companies have issued letters of comfort and guarantees in respect of certain subsidiaries in the normal course of business. Under these letters and guarantees, the issuing entity undertakes to ensure that those subsidiaries continue to meet their financial obligations, subject to certain conditions including that the subsidiary remains a controlled entity.\n\n## SALE OF GRINDLAYS BUSINESS\n\nOn 31 July 2000, the Company completed the sale to Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) of ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited (Grindlays) and certain other businesses. The Company provided warranties and indemnities relating to those businesses.\n\nThe indemnified matters include civil penalty proceedings and criminal prosecutions brought by Indian authorities against Grindlays and certain of its officers, in relation to certain transactions conducted in 1991 that are alleged to have breached the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. Civil penalties were imposed in 2007 which are the subject of appeals. The criminal prosecutions are being defended.\n\n## CONTINGENT ASSETS\n\n## NATIONAL HOUSING BANK\n\nThe Company is pursuing recovery of the proceeds of certain disputed cheques which were credited to the account of a former Grindlays customer in the early 1990s.\n\nThe disputed cheques were drawn on the National Housing Bank (NHB) in India. Proceedings between Grindlays and NHB concerning the proceeds of the cheques were resolved in early 2002.\n\nRecovery is now being pursued from the estate of the Grindlays customer who received the cheque proceeds. Any amounts recovered are to be shared between the Company and NHB.\n\n203",

The nature of non-audit services for the Group and the Company includes methodology, procedural and administrative reviews. Further details are provided in the Directors' Report.\n\nThe Group's Policy allows KPMG Australia or any of its related practices to provide assurance and other audit-related services that, while outside the scope of the statutory audit, are consistent with the role of an external auditor. These include regulatory and prudential reviews requested by regulators such as APRA. Any other services that are not audit or audit-related services are non-audit services. The Policy allows certain non-audit services to be provided where the service would not contravene auditor independence requirements. KPMG Australia or any of its related practices may not provide services that are perceived to be in conflict with the role of the external auditor or breach auditor independence. These include consulting advice and subcontracting of operational activities normally undertaken by management, and engagements where the external auditor may ultimately be required to express an opinion on its own work.\n\n204",

PENDING ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES IMPACTING FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS\n\n## Suncorp Bank Acquisition\n\nOn 18 July 2022, the ANZ Group announced an agreement to purchase 100% of the shares in SBGH Limited, the immediate non-operating holding company of Suncorp Bank. The acquisition was subject to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) authorisation or approval. The ACCC declined to grant authorisation for this acquisition in August 2023 and this decision is currently subject to review by the Australian Competition Tribunal. In addition, the acquisition remains subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including Federal Treasurer approval and certain amendments to the State Financial Institutions and Metway Merger Act 1996 (QLD). ANZBGL will also have a termination right under the Suncorp Bank Sale Agreement if APRA issues a written communication to ANZBGL under or in connection with APS 222 Associations with Related Entities to the effect that ANZBGL must not proceed with completion of the acquisition. Assuming these conditions are satisfied, and merger approval is granted, it is expected to occur in mid-calendar year 2024.\n\n## 35.

These models are reliant on data and estimates including multiple economic scenarios and key assumptions such as defining a significant increase in credit risk (SICR).\n\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments requires the Group and Company to measure ECLs on a forward-looking basis reflecting a range of economic conditions. Post-model adjustments are considered to address known ECL model limitations or emerging trends in the loan portfolios. We exercise significant judgement in challenging the economic scenarios and the judgmental post-model adjustments.\n\nAdditional subjectivity and judgement is required due to the heightened uncertainty associated with the impact of the economic outlook and its impact on customers, increasing our audit effort thereon.\n\nSICR identification, such as a decrease in customer credit rating (CCR), is a key judgement within the ECL methodology, as this criterion determines if a forward-looking 12 month or lifetime allowance is recorded.\n\nAdditionally, allowances for individually assessed wholesale loans exceeding specific thresholds are assessed. We exercise significant judgement in challenging the assessment of specific allowances based on the expected future cash repayments and estimated proceeds from the value of the collateral held in respect of the loans.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audits\n\nOur audit procedures for the allowance for ECL included assessing significant accounting policies against the requirements of the accounting standard. Additionally, our procedures included testing key controls in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 The ECL model governance and validation processes which involved assessment of model performance;\n- \u00b7 The assessment and approval of the forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenario weightings through challenge applied by internal governance processes;\n- \u00b7 Reconciliation of the data used in the ECL calculation process to gross balances recorded within the general ledger as well as source systems;\n- \u00b7 Customer credit rating (CCR) for wholesale loans (larger customer exposures are monitored individually). This covered elements such as: approval of new lending facilities against lending policies, monitoring of counterparty credit quality against exposure criteria for internal factors specific to the counterparty or external macroeconomic factors, and accuracy and timeliness of CCR and security indicator (SI) assessments against lending policies and regulatory requirements;\n- \u00b7 IT system controls which record retail loans lending arrears, group exposures into delinquency buckets, and re-calculate individual allowances. We tested automated calculation and change management controls and evaluated the oversight of the portfolios, with a focus on controls over delinquency monitoring.\n\nWe tested relevant General Information Technology Controls (GITCs) in relation to the key IT applications used in measuring ECL allowances as detailed in the IT Systems and Controls key audit matter below.\n\nIn addition to controls testing, our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Reperforming a sample of credit assessments for wholesale loans controlled by workout and recovery teams assessed as higher risk or impaired, and a sample of other loans, focusing on larger exposures assessed by the Group and Company as showing signs of deterioration, or in areas of emerging risk.\n- \u00b7 For each loan sampled, we challenged the Group and Company's assessment of CCR and SI using the customer's financial position, the valuation of security, and, where relevant, the risk of stranded assets, to inform our overall assessment of loan recoverability and the impact on the credit allowance. To do this, we used the information on the Group and Company's loan file and discussed the facts and circumstances of the case with the loan officer.\n- \u00b7 Exercising our judgement, our procedures included using our understanding of relevant industries and the macroeconomic environment and comparing data and assumptions used by the Group and Company in recoverability assessments to externally sourced evidence, such as commodity prices, publicly available audited financial statements and comparable external valuations of collateral held. Where relevant, we assessed the forecast timing of future cash flows in the context of underlying valuations and approved business plans and challenged key assumptions in the valuations;\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of the Group and Company's processes to determine ECL allowances, evaluating the ECL model methodologies against established market practices and criteria in the accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 Working with our credit risk specialists, we assessed the accuracy of the ECL model estimates by re-performing, for a sample of loans, the calculation of the ECL allowance using our independently derived calculation tools and comparing this to the amount recorded by the Group and\n\nCompany;\n\n208",

This involved sourcing independent inputs from comparable data in the market and available alternatives. We challenged and assessed any differences.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the appropriateness of the Group and Company's disclosures in the Financial Reports using our understanding obtained from our testing and against the requirements of the accounting standards.\n\n## CARRYING VALUE OF INVESTMENT IN PT PANIN ($1,440m)\n\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures in Note 26 to the Group Financial Report.\n\n## The key audit matter\n\nThe carrying value of the Group's investment in PT Panin is a key audit matter due to the impairment indicators identified at the reporting date and the assessment of the investment's recoverable amount involving judgement and the consideration of valuation models given historical volatility in the market price of the shares. Impairment has been recognised in prior periods.  We involved our valuation specialists to supplement our senior team members in assessing this key audit matter.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nWorking with our valuation specialists, our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Considering the appropriateness of the recoverable amount assessment used to conclude the carrying value of the investment is supportable;\n- \u00b7 Considering the appropriateness of the value in use valuation method applied against the requirements of the accounting standards. This included:\n- \u00b7 Assessing the integrity of the models used, including the accuracy of the underlying calculation formulas;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the key assumptions used in the models, such as, discount rates, forecast earnings and terminal growth rates by comparing to external observable metrics, historical experience, our knowledge of the markets and current market practice;\n- \u00b7 Independently developing discount rates range considered comparable using publicly available market data for comparable entities, adjusted for factors specific to the investments and the markets and industry they operate in;\n- \u00b7 Comparing the forecast earnings contained in the model to broker consensus reports and released financial results;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the accuracy of previous forecasts to inform our evaluation of current forecasts incorporated in the model;\n- \u00b7 Considering the sensitivity of the models by varying key assumptions, such as, discount rates, forecast cash flows and terminal growth rates, within a reasonable possible range. We did this to identify those assumptions at higher risk of bias or inconsistency in application and to focus our further procedures.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the recoverable amount at the reporting date against the recoverable amount of the investment when it was last impaired to critically assess potential reversal of previous impairment losses;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the Group's disclosures in the Financial Report using our understanding obtained from our testing and against the requirements of the accounting standards.\n\n210",

ANZGHL became the newly listed parent company of the Group. The Group also implemented a restructure to separate the banking and certain non-banking businesses into two distinct groups: ANZ Bank Group and ANZ Non-Bank Group.\n\nThe organisational restructure is a key audit matter due to:\n\n- \u00b7 The complexities involved in the implementation of the restructure steps plan as outlined in the Restructure Deed;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the accounting treatment associated with the establishment of ANZGHL as the newly listed parent entity in accordance with AASB 3 Business Combinations; and\n- \u00b7 The various considerations and implications arising from the transfer of assets out of ANZ Bank Group and into ANZ Non-Bank Group and the service company, including the evaluation of the accounting policy choice available under common control transactions.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audits\n\nOur audit procedures in relation to the organisational restructure included:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessing the accounting considerations involved in the establishment of ANZGHL and the acquisition of ANZBGL shares from existing shareholders to create the newly listed parent entity, in accordance with AASB 3 Business Combinations;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating, with the assistance of our transaction services specialists, the Restructure Deed and identifying and assessing the accounting implications inherent in each restructure step;\n- \u00b7 Testing the transfer of business assets from ANZ Bank Group to ANZ Non-Bank Group and the separate service company for completeness and accuracy by comparing transfers to the Restructure Deed. This included challenging and evaluating recognition and measurement criteria in accordance with accounting policies selected;\n- \u00b7 Checking the gain or loss on transfer and its basis of presentation against the Group's selected accounting policy choice;\n- \u00b7 Working with our tax specialists to evaluate the taxation considerations of the formation of a new tax consolidated group and potential stamp duty implications of the restructure steps; and\n- \u00b7 Assessing the appropriateness of the Group's disclosures in the Financial Report using our understanding obtained from our testing and against the requirements of the accounting standards.\n\n## IT SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS\n\n## The key audit matter\n\nAs a major Australian bank, the businesses utilise many complex, interdependent Information Technology (IT) systems to process and record a high volume of transactions. The controls over access, changes to and operation of IT systems are key to the recording of financial information and the preparation of financial reports which provide a true and fair view of the Group and Company's financial positions and performance.\n\nThe IT systems and controls, as they impact the financial recording and reporting of transactions, is a key audit matter as our audit approaches could significantly differ depending on the effective operation of the IT controls. We work with our IT specialists as a core part of our audit team.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audits\n\nOur  testing  focused  on  the  technology  control  environments  for  key  IT  applications  (systems)  used  in  processing  significant  transactions  and recording balances in the general ledgers, and the automated controls embedded within these systems which link the technology-enabled business processes. Our audit procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessing the governance and higher-level controls across the IT environments, including those regarding policy design, policy review and awareness, and IT Risk and cyber security management practices;\n- \u00b7 Design and operating effectiveness testing of key controls across the user access management lifecycle, including how users are on-boarded, reviewed for access levels assigned, and removed on a timely basis from key IT applications and supporting infrastructure. We also examined the management of privileged roles and functions across relevant IT application and the supporting infrastructure;\n- \u00b7 Design and operating effectiveness testing of key controls for IT change management including authorisation of changes prior to development, testing performed and approvals prior to migration into the production environment of key IT applications. We assessed user access to release changes to IT application production environments and whether access was commensurate with their job responsibilities;\n\n211\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

Our testing included:\n- \u00b7 Configurations to perform calculations, mappings and flagging of financial transactions, and automated reconciliation controls (both between systems and intra-system); and\n- \u00b7 Data integrity of key system reporting used by us in our audit to select samples and analyse data used to generate financial reporting.\n- \u00b7 Where our testing identified design and operating effectiveness matters relating to IT systems or application controls relevant to our audits, we performed alternative audit procedures, including consideration of mitigating controls.\n\n## OTHER INFORMATION\n\nOther Information is financial and non-financial information in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited's annual reporting which is provided in addition to the Financial Reports and the Auditor's Report. The Directors are responsible for the Other Information.\n\nOur opinions on the Financial Reports do not cover the Other Information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion.\n\nIn connection with our audits of the Financial Reports, our responsibility is to read the Other Information. In doing so, we consider whether the Other Information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Reports or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWe are required to report if we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this Other Information, and based on the work we have performed on the Other Information that we obtained prior to the date of this Auditor's Report we have nothing to report.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE FINANCIAL REPORTS\n\nThe Directors are responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 preparing the Financial Reports that give a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001\n- \u00b7 implementing necessary internal controls to enable the preparation of a Financial Reports that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error\n- \u00b7 assessing the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern and whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group and Company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL REPORTS\n\nOur objective is:\n\n- \u00b7 to obtain reasonable assurance about whether each of the Financial Reports as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and\n- \u00b7 to issue an Auditor's Report that includes our opinions.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Financial Reports.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audits of the Financial Reports is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at: https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1\\_2020.pdf.

Cash profit represents ANZ's preferred measure of the result of the core business activities of the Group, enabling readers to assess Group and Divisional performance against prior periods and against peer institutions. To calculate cash profit, the Group excludes non-core items from statutory profit as noted below. These items are calculated consistently period on period so as not to discriminate between positive and negative adjustments.\n\nGains and losses are adjusted where they are significant, or have the potential to be significant in any one period, and fall into one of three categories:\n\n1. gains or losses included in earnings arising from changes in tax, legal or accounting legislation or other non-core items not associated with the core operations of the Group;\n\n2. economic hedging impacts and similar accounting items that represent timing differences that will reverse through earnings in the future; and\n\n3. accounting reclassifications between individual line items that do not impact reported results, such as credit risk on impaired derivatives.\n\nCash profit is not a measure of cash flow or profit determined on a cash accounting basis.\n\n## Collectively assessed allowance for\n\nexpected credit loss represents the Expected Credit Loss (ECL), which incorporates forward-looking information and does not require an actual loss event to have occurred for a credit loss provision to be recognised.\n\n## Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF) The\n\nRBA established a CLF to offset the shortage of High-Quality Liquid Assets in Australia. In September 2021, APRA wrote to ADIs to advise that APRA and the RBA consider there to be sufficient HQLA for ADIs to meet their LCR requirements, and therefore the use of the CLF should no longer be required beyond calendar year 2022.\n\nCompany means ANZBGL.\n\nCovered bonds are bonds issued by an ADI to external investors secured against a pool of the ADI's assets (the cover pool) assigned to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. The primary assets forming the cover pool are mortgage loans. The mortgages remain on the issuer's balance sheet. The covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool assets. The mortgages included in the cover pool cannot be otherwise pledged or disposed of but may be repurchased and substituted in order to maintain the credit quality of the pool. The Group issues covered bonds as part of its funding activities.\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from the failure of ANZ's customers and counterparties to honour or perform fully the terms of a loan or contract.\n\n## Credit risk weighted assets (CRWA)\n\nrepresent assets which are weighted for credit risk according to a set formula as prescribed in APS 112/113.\n\nCustomer deposits represent term deposits, other deposits bearing interest, deposits not bearing interest and borrowing corporations' debt excluding securitisation deposits.\n\n## Funding for Lending Programme (FLP)\n\nrefers to three-year funding announced by the RBNZ in November 2020 and offered to New Zealand banks, which aimed to lower the cost of borrowing for New Zealand businesses and households.\n\n## Gross loans and advances (GLA) is made\n\nup of loans and advances, capitalised brokerage and other origination costs less unearned income.",

The risk generally arises from:\n\n- 1. Repricing and yield curve risk - the risk to earnings or market value as a result of changes in the overall level of interest rates and/or the relativity of these rates across the yield curve;\n- 2. Basis risk - the risk to earnings or market value arising from volatility in the interest margin applicable to banking book items; and\n- 3.

The amount of ASF is the portion of an ADI capital and liabilities expected to be a reliable source of funds over a one year time horizon. The amount of RSF is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of an ADI's assets and off-balance sheet activities. ADIs must maintain an NSFR of at least 100%.\n\nNet tangible assets equal share capital and reserves attributable to shareholders of the Company less unamortised intangible assets (including goodwill and software).\n\nNZX means New Zealand's Exchange.\n\nOECD means Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nRBA means Reserve Bank of Australia, Australia's central bank.\n\nRBNZ means Reserve Bank of New Zealand, New Zealand's central bank.\n\nRegulatory deposits are mandatory reserve deposits lodged with local central banks in accordance with statutory requirements.\n\nRestructure means the restructure of the ANZ Group, as part of the establishment of the non-operating holding company, implemented by the scheme of arrangement under the Corporations Act between ANZBGL and shareholders.\n\nReturn on average assets is the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, divided by average total assets.\n\nReturn on average ordinary shareholders' equity is the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, divided by average ordinary shareholders' equity.\n\nRisk weighted assets (RWA) are risk weighted according to each asset's inherent potential for default and what the likely losses would be in the case of default. In the case of non-asset backed risks (i.e. market and operational risk), RWA is determined by multiplying the capital requirements for those risks by 12.5.\n\n## Settlement balances owed to/by ANZ\n\nrepresent financial assets and/or liabilities which are in the course of being settled.
