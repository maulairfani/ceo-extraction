We have strongly executed against our strategy as several of our main ongoing projects have come to fruition. The strong performance of the Eni share in 2023 (+23% as measured in terms of the Total Shareholder Return), ranking one among the peer group, proves investors' confidence on the credibility of our transition pathway and on our execution capabilities.\n\nWe are embracing the triple challenge of ensuring affordable, reliable and  increasingly  sustainable  energy  supplies,  essential  for  the functioning of the economy and society, through a pragmatic and sustainable approach based on the centrality of gas, on synergies between traditional and transition businesses and on the satellite model with the creation of specialized companies to accelerate the decarbonization of end customers, while we're working on breakthrough technologies which could change the energy paradigm in the long-term, such as the nuclear fusion.\n\nIn 2023, the E&P segment delivered outstanding growth. The Baleine oilfield  off  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire,  Africa's  first  Net  Zero  emissions  project (Scope 1 & 2), started production less than two years after discovery, leveraging on our fast-track model to reduce the reserve time-tomarket. The \"Congo Floating LNG\" project has shipped its first cargo at the end of February 2024, thanks to the use of well-established technologies that have allowed us to devise a modular \"small-scale\" LNG development scheme, the first ever used in Africa, achieving\n\na start-up in record time. In Mozambique, the Coral South project,\n\nthe world's first example of floating LNG in ultra-deep waters, has\n\nreached the production plateau.\n\nExploration recorded yet another successful year with 900 million boe\n\nof new resources, mainly gas-focussed, driven by the extraordinary\n\nGeng discovery in Indonesia, the largest in the industry in 2023, as\n\nwell as near-field findings in Egypt, Congo and Mexico.\n\nHydrocarbon  production  increased  by  3%  to  1.65  million  boe/d,\n\ndespite continued capital discipline and focus on gas development.\n\nM&A activity has represented a key lever for strengthening the\n\nupstream portfolio. The acquisition of Neptune Energy, completed\n\nin January 2024, is highly synergistic with our gas assets portfolio\n\nand brings us significantly closer to our targets of a share of natural\n\ngas production of 60% by 2030 and of upstream decarbonization,\n\nas the acquired assets, are characterized by low emission intensity.\n\nWith approximately 4 bcm/y of gas for the European market, we are\n\nexpanding and diversifying our supply portfolio, while consolidating\n\nour position in Indonesia where, thanks to Neptune assets, the\n\nrecent Geng discovery and the acquisition of interests in the fields\n\nof the so-called IDD area, we have identified a mineral potential of\n\nover 280 bcm in the region, which will represent one of the major\n\ngrowth areas of our upstream going forward. Finally, with a view\n\nto ensure stable energy supplies for Europe, we have strengthened\n\nour strategic presence in Algeria, through the acquisition of bp's\n\ngas assets in the country.\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nANNEX",

The  business essentially ceased purchases of Russian gas, two years ahead of  schedule,  without  compromising  the  continuity  of  supplies and without financial shortfalls, while it continued to expand the contracted  LNG  portfolio  thanks  to  the  long-term  agreements in Congo, Indonesia and Qatar that will ensure up to 6.8 bcm/y between 2025/2026 to serve the commercial plans and in line with the strategy upstream-midstream integration.\n\nPlenitude and Enilive, Eni's two satellites focused on the marketing of decarbonized energy products and on the Scope 3 emission reduction of our clients, reported significant growth and excellent financial  performance.  Plenitude  has  reached  its  renewable capacity target of 3 GW, increased its network of EV charging points to 19,000 and consolidated a customer base of over 10 million clients.\n\nThe agreement with Energy Infrastructure Partners (EIP), where the investor has acquired a 7.6% minority stake in Plenitude with proceeds of \u20ac0.6 bln to Eni, gives visibility to the value of this business, currently estimated at \u20ac10 bln, allowing us to access aligned capital to support our growth plans.\n\nEnilive, our sustainable mobility and biorefining subsidiary, has launched  its  international  expansion  program  by  purchasing a  50%  share  in  the  Chalmette  biorefinery  in  Louisiana  (USA), which has increased processing capacity to 1.65 million ton/y. Strategic initiatives are under evaluation in South-East Asia with LG Chem and Petronas, while in Italy, a final investment decision has been made regarding the restructuring of the Livorno hub to transform it into a biorefinery following the successful industrial reconversion of Gela and Porto Marghera.\n\nIn 2023 the Chemical business was negatively and significantly affected by an unfavorable trading environment, the acquisition of Novamont, leader in the the circular bioeconomy development and in the market for  the  production  of  biodegradable  and  compostable  bioplastics and biochemicals, represents a primary driver of our restructuring\n\nstrategy of the business, which will leverage on integrating a unique and  complementary  technological  platform,  providing  a  significant contribution to the decarbonization of the product portfolio.\n\nIn  the  new  business  of  permanent  geological  storage  of  CO 2 \"CCS\", we have established our leadership in European projects. In the UK, the HyNet North West hub, where Eni is operator of the transportation and storage phases, is progressing towards a final investment decision thanks to the agreement in principle with the competent British authorities on economic conditions and return on invested capital, making the project the world's first regulated business in the CCS field. In addition, Eni was granted a second storage license for the depleted Hewett field. The two projects have a total storage capacity of 500 million ton of CO 2 . In Italy, the Callisto integrated project for the construction of a CCS hub in the Ravenna offshore, in synergy with Eni's depleted upstream reservoirs, has been included in the list of European Projects of Common Interest.\n\nTechnology is a milestone of Eni's transition path. Our approach leverages both technologies from traditional businesses and the research and application of break-through technologies able to reshape the future energy paradigm. For example, biorefining has  been  developed  from  traditional  refining  processes;  the new CCS business leverages on reservoir technologies and our know-how in natural gas storage.\n\nThe MIT spin-out company, CFS, of which Eni is a strategic investor and with which we have established a technological cooperation agreement, is working on the implementation of a pilot project related to magnetic confinement fusion that will contribute in a revolutionary way to the energy transition.\n\nVersalis has started the construction of the Hoop \u00ae technology demonstration plant for the chemical recycling of mixed plastic waste and is developing sustainable bioethanol from secondgeneration  sugars  for  fuel  production.  We  support  research and innovation both in CO 2 capture/storage and in its economic reuse through an experimental mineralization technology for recycling in the production of cementitious material.",

Our transformation process is irreversible and will allow us to achieve Carbon neutrality by 2050 with the zeroing of the process and product emissions (Scope 1, 2 & 3), in line with the expectations of civil society and the global decarbonization targets.\n\nIn 2023, Eni received the \"Gold Standard\" award from the United Nations,  as  part  of  the  Oil  and  Gas  Methane  Partnership  2.0 program, confirming the effectiveness of Eni's decarbonization strategy, with particular reference to the reduction of methane emissions,  an  issue  that  has  taken  on  a  central  role  in  the international climate debate. During the COP28, Eni announced its participation in the Oil & Gas Decarbonization Accelerator, a platform  launched  by  the  COP28  Presidency  to  demonstrate the  concrete  contribution  of  the  energetic  sector  to  the decarbonization  process.  As  part  of  the  sustainable  finance framework, we successfully placed a \u20ac1 bln convertible bond in 2023. We are working for a \"just transition\" in our African partner countries through the development of our original agri-business model  vertically  integrated  with  biorefining,  making  a  positive contribution to the local economy and employment.\n\nThese  initiatives  are  reflected  in  the  high  ESG/Climate  ratings received  by  Eni,  in  particular:  Climate  Action  100+  Net  Zero Benchmark ranked us among the top in the industry for the number of metrics met, thanks to the completeness of the GHG emission methodology,  the  medium/long-term  intermediate  targets  and the emission boundary extended to the entire Company. Carbon Tracker ranked us, for the 4 th consecutive year, the only company among the 25 largest companies in the O&G sector, due to the completeness of emission methodology and the ambition of the medium and long-term targets.\n\nIn 2023, we achieved outstanding economic and financial results. The proforma adjusted EBIT, which includes the contribution as Eni's share of the affiliates, was approximately \u20ac18 bln; the adjusted net profit was \u20ac8.3 bln.\n\nCash generation was robust with \u20ac16.5 bln of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital, which, net of organic capex of \u20ac9.2 bln, generates an organic FCF of \u20ac7.3 bln, higher than the significant\n\ncash return to shareholders of \u20ac4.8 bln for the year, including dividends of \u20ac3 bln and buy-back of \u20ac1.8 bln. These results have allowed the Group to maintain a solid capital structure with a leverage of 20%.\n\n## STRATEGY AND 2024-2027 PLAN\n\nWe confirm our transition strategy based on organic growth in both traditional and new businesses, on our distinctive satellite model and financial discipline, with the aim of achieve Carbon neutrality by 2050 and intermediate targets of Net Zero emissions, Scope 1 & 2, at our upstream segment by 2030, and for all Eni businesses by 2035.\n\nIn line with this strategy and leveraging on the achievements of 2023, the 2024-2027 plan includes growing/high-grading the E&P business with a focus on OECD countries, gas/LNG, and on the development of fast-track projects, as well as impact of emission reduction investments to  support  energy  security;  growth  in  the  value  of  new  business associated with the transition, and active portfolio management. E&P production is expected to grow at a rate of 3-4% per year until 2027, an average of 2%, after the planned divestments, driven by the startups/ramp-ups of new projects and by integrating Neptune assets. Exploration will focus on gas discoveries in near-field areas, in line with  our  expected  production  mix  targets,  emission  profile,  and unit cost control of discovery and development, targeting high-risk, high-potential initiatives supported by capex of over \u20ac1.5 bln in the\n\nfour-year period.\n\nThe installed renewable capacity is expected to grow to over 8 GW by 2027, and the biorefining capacity to over 3 million ton/y by 2026.\n\nThe Enilive network will be enhanced and improved to increase the offering of products and services for sustainable mobility and the Plenitude electric vehicles charging network will double the number of recharges between 2023 and 2027.\n\nThe  restructuring  and  transformation  of  Versalis,  through  the repositioning of its business towards specialized products such as bio-based chemicals and circularity, will generate an EBITDA in 2025 to breakeven and a positive EBIT by 2026.\n\nThose developments will be funded by a Group selective spending program with net capex of \u20ac27 bln in the four-year period, around \u20ac7 bln per year.",

Eni has a significant number of planned Final Investment Decision (FIDs) and options, in many cases at high equity participation, providing excellent visibility beyond the Plan and indicative of the impressive depth of the portfolio;\n- \u00b7 Net Upstream Capex, including portfolio activity, is seen at around \u20ac5 billion on average per year, down 20% versus the previous Plan reflecting project quality and investment optimization, plus the impact of accelerated divestment;\n- \u00b7 the acceleration of value delivery to the business by diluting high equity stakes projects as a part of Eni's dual exploration model. The Company will also continue to look to high-grade the portfolio by divesting tail assets. In total Upstream is expected to account for more than half of Eni's corporate divestment target;\n- \u00b7 exploration will continue to be a significant engine of value creation for Eni and it aims to invest more than \u20ac1.5 billion over the Plan.\n\n## GLOBAL GAS & LNG PORTFOLIO\n\nGGP will continue to secure full value from the gas value chain, while expanding existing trading and optimization activities, as well as contracts renegotiations, leveraging on its portfolio flexibility and will continue to generate value through the development of new LNG supply and relying on the integration with the upstream business.\n\nAdjusted proforma Ebit of GGP is seen at around \u20ac0.8 billion in 2024.\n\nThis is in line with the normalizing gas market assumption included in the plan, consistent with last year, and reflects the current lower prices for gas and, importantly, significantly lower market volatility. However, current markets remain highly sensitive to changed conditions induced by, for instance, geopolitical events, other supply issues, weather and demand effects. In this event Eni has clearly demonstrated that it has the supply portfolio, the infrastructure access and logistics positions, and the expertise to generate significant upside to over \u20ac1 billion.\n\n## CCUS\n\nThe Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an important lever in cutting net emissions and driving the energy transition. Eni has established a leadership position particularly in the UK and Italy and it is expanding in North Africa, the Netherlands and Norway. This means CCS will become one of the key platforms in Eni's Transition oriented portfolio, decarbonizing its operations and as a service to others. The Company's unrisked portfolio of opportunities is of the order of 3 GT of gross storage capacity. For Eni the goal is to reach a gross CO 2 reinjection capacity of more than15 MTPA before 2030 and progressively rising to around 40 MTPA in the following decade. Ravenna CCS Phase 1 will start up this year, with the Phase 2 expansion scheduled for 2027 and further expansion available. In the UK, the HyNet project is expected to be sanctioned this year simultaneously with that of the emitters.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT",

Eni recently sanctioned its third bio conversion at Livorno, while a fourth domestic one is currently under study. Two further international FIDs in South Korea and Malaysia are expected in 2024. More than 1 Mtpa SAF optionality is seen by 2026 - twice Eni's previous goal - with the potential to double by 2030. Agri-hub feedstock supply, a unique aspect of the Company's strategy, is expected to be over 700,000 tonnes in 2027, over 35% of Italian throughputs.\n- \u00b7 Results and capex : Eni expects proforma EBITDA of \u20ac1 billion in 2024 rising to over \u20ac1.6 billion by 2027. This reflects Eni's growing biorefining activities and the impact of the re-branding of its service stations and rising contribution from non-oil, expected to be about 40% of retail earnings by the end of the plan. Enilive capex will average \u20ac0.5 billon/ year over the plan.\n\n## PLENITUDE\n\n- \u00b7 Renewable installed capacity : installed renewable capacity will increase to 4 GW in 2024 and more than doubling to over 8 GW by 2027. This figure is expected to reach over 15 GW by 2030 maintaining the strong growth trajectory. This growth is supported by a pipeline of 2 GW under execution, 4 GW of high/medium maturity and 15 GW of low maturity. Charging points will reach 24,000 in 2024 and are expected to double between 2023 and 2027.\n- \u00b7 Results and capex : Eni expects proforma EBITDA of \u20ac1 billion in 2024 rising to \u20ac2 billion by 2027. Plenitude organic capex will average around \u20ac1.4 billon/year over the plan.\n\n## VERSALIS\n\nIn the context of the losses reported in 2023, impacted by the global chemical market scenario and the particular challenges of Europe, Eni is committed to a Versalis restructuring. Having acquired full control of Novamont in 2023 it is also committed to a transformation, re-positioning towards specialized products, bio-based chemistry and circularity more aligned with the broader strategic themes. Together these measures will deliver target EBITDA breakeven in 2025 and positive EBIT by 2026 representing a significant improvement of over \u20ac600 million to the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT",

The analysis  is  based  on  the  scope  of  the  work  and  risks  specific  of each  business  area  and  processes  aiming  at  defining  an  Integrated Risk Management policy; the CEO also ensures the evolution of the IRM process consistently with business dynamics and the regulatory environment. Furthermore, the Risk Committee, chaired by the CEO, holds the role of consulting body for the latter with regards to major risks.

INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT RISK KNOWLEDGE, FORMAZIONE E COMUNICAZIONE\n\nThe IRM process ensures the detection, consolidation and analysis of all Eni's risks and supports the BoD to verify the compatibility of the risk profile with the strategic targets, also in a medium/long-term approach. The IRM supports management in the decision-making process  by  strengthening  awareness  of  the  risk  profile  and  the associated mitigations. The process, regulated by the 'Management System Guideline (MSG) Integrated Risk Management'  is continuous,  dynamic  and  includes  the  following  sub-processes: (i) Risk governance, methodologies and tools (ii) Risk Strategy, (iii) Integrated  Risk  Management,  (iv)  Risk  knowledge,  training  and communication. Processo risk-based 1 2 RISK GOVERNANCE, METODOLOGIE E STRUMENTI RISK STRATEGY RMI - RISK MANAGEMENT INTEGRATO RMI - RISK MANAGEMENT INTEGRATO\n\nThe IRM process starts from the specialist contribution to the elaboration of the Strategic Plan provided on the basis of the overall risk management activity, with particular reference to the definition of the de-risking areas, the analysis of the risk profile underlying the Plan proposal and the identification of the main actions  with  effective  de-risking  of  the  strategic  company's top  risks.  The  results  of  the  activities  are  presented  to  the Administrative and Control structures in times consistent with the Strategic Planning process.\n\nThe 'Integrated  Risk  Management' sub-process  includes: periodic  risk  assessment  and  monitoring  cycles  in  order  to understand the risks taken on the basis of the strategic targets of the four year strategic plan also looking at the medium-long term, through the definition, evaluation and monitoring of the main  company's  risks  and  the  related  treatment  measures; contract  risk  management  and  analysis  aimed  at  the  best allocation of the contractual responsibilities with the supplier and  their  adequate  management  in  the  operational  phase;\n\nThe  risks  are  represented  on  the  basis  of  the  likelihood  of occurrence and the impact on matrices that allow their comparison and  classification  by  relevance.  Risks  with  economic/financial impact are also analyzed in an integrated perspective on the basis of quantitative models that allow to define on a statistical basis the distribution  of  risk  flows  or  to  simulate  the  aggregate  impact  of risks in the face of hypothetical future scenarios (what if analysis or stress test).\n\nIn 2023, two assessment sessions were performed: the Annual Risk Profile Assessment performed in the first half of the year, involving 136 companies and 47 Countries and the Interim Top Risk  Assessment  performed  in  the  second  half  of  the  year, relating to the update of the evaluation and treatment of Eni's top risks and the main business risks also considering the 2024-27 Strategic Plan.",

To ensure the presence of Directors and Statutory Auditors selected by  non-controlling  shareholders  a  slate  voting  mechanism  is used. Eni's Board of Directors and Board of Statutory Auditors, whose term runs from May 2023 until the Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the 2025 financial statements, are made up of 9 and 5 members, respectively. Three directors and two Standing Statutory  Auditors,  including  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Statutory Auditors, were elected by non-controlling shareholders, thereby giving minority shareholders (i.e. shareholders other than the controlling shareholder) a larger number of representatives than that provided for under law. For the composition of the Board, the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  May  10,  2023,  which  appointed the current Board of Directors, drew on the guidance provided to investors prior to the Shareholders' Meeting by the previous Board of Directors on the quantitative and qualitative composition considered to be optimal.\n\nIn  drafting  this  guidance,  which  takes  into  account  the  results of the self-assessment, the previous Board was assisted by the Nomination Committee and supported by the same independent external consultant that assisted the Board in the self-assessment. This  enabled  consideration  of  the  perspective  of  external stakeholders (filtered on the basis of the consultant's experience),\n\nthe relevant best practices and the indications of the leading proxy advisors and organisations of reference (in particular the Italian Corporate Governance Committee). The guidance highlighted the central role of sustainability, ESG and energy-transition expertise, also underlining the importance of ensuring that Eni's Directors have  knowledge  of  topics  related  to  sustainability  and  climate and environment risk control, gained in managerial or business roles and in industrial contexts comparable to those in which the Company  operates.  The  outcome  is  a  balanced  and  diversified Board of Directors, as also confirmed by the results of the annual self-assessment  conducted  by  the  Board,  which  resulted  in  a positive judgement on the level of professional expertise within the Board in terms of knowledge, experience and skills and on the individual contribution made by Directors to the Board, based on their areas of expertise, motivation and sense of belonging.\n\nSimilarly,  in  2023,  the  Board  of  Statutory  Auditors  expressed guidelines for shareholders providing indications on the composition of the body in relation to the tasks it is called upon to perform.\n\nThe composition of the Board of Directors and of the Board of Statutory Auditors is also more diversified in gender terms, in accordance with the provisions of applicable law and the Bylaws. The latter was promptly amended to be compliant with the law in February 2020 in view of the renewal of the corporate bodies. In particular, for 6 consecutive terms the management and control bodies shall be composed of at least 2/5 of the less represented gender.\n\nFurthermore, based on the assessments most recently carried out on February 15, 2024, the number of independent directors on the Board of Directors (7 2 of the 9 serving, of whom 8 are non-executive Directors including the Chairman) remains greater than the number provided for in the Bylaws and by Corporate Governance Code.",

Finally, the Board of Directors, acting on a recommendation of the Chairman, appoints the Secretary, charged with providing assistance and advice to the Chairman, the Board of Directors and the individual Directors 5 . In view of this role, the Secretary, who reports to the Board of Directors and, on its behalf, to the Chairman, must also meet professional requirements, as provided for in the Corporate Governance Code, while the Chairman oversees his independence.\n\nANNEX",

More  specifically,  the  Board  decided  that  the  Integrated  Risk Management function reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and created an Integrated Compliance function, also reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, separate from the Legal unit. Furthermore, in June 2020, the Board redefined the organizational structure of the Company with the establishment of two General Departments (Energy  Evolution  and  Natural  Resources),  launching  a  new structure consistent with the corporate mission and functional to the achievement of strategic objectives.\n\nAmong  the  Board  of  Directors'  most  important  duties  is  the appointment of people to key management and control positions in  the  Company,  such  as  the  officer  in  charge  of  preparing financial reports, the Head of Internal Audit, the members of the 231 Supervisory Body. In performing these duties, the Board of Directors is supported by the Nomination Committee.\n\n## Reporting flows\n\nIn order for the Board of Directors to perform its duties as effectively as possible, the Directors must be in a position to assess the decisions they are called upon to make, possessing appropriate expertise and information. The current members of the Board of Directors,  who  have  a  diversified  range  of  skills  and  experience, including on the international stage, are well qualified to conduct comprehensive assessments of the variety of issues they face from multiple perspectives. The Directors also receive timely complete briefings on the issues on the agenda of the meetings of the Board of Directors. To ensure this operates smoothly, Board meetings are  governed by specific procedures that establish deadlines for providing  members  with  documentation  and  the  Chairman  of the Board of Directors ensures that each Director can contribute effectively  to  Board  discussions.  The  same  documentation  is\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nprovided  to  the  Statutory  Auditors.  In  addition  to  meeting  to perform the duties assigned to the Board of Statutory Auditors by  Italian  law,  including  in  its  capacity  as  the  'Internal  Control and Audit Committee', and by US law in its capacity as the 'Audit Committee', the Statutory Auditors also participate in the meetings of the Board of Directors and, also through individual members, at meetings of the Board Committees, including the Control and Risk Committee thus ensuring the timely exchange of key information for the performance of their respective duties. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, in agreement with the Chief Executive Officer supported by the Board Secretary, ensures that the managers of the Company and those of the companies of the Group, who are competent on the issues concerned, participate in the relevant Board meetings, to provide appropriate insights on the items on the agenda, also at the request of individual Directors. Finally, the adequacy and timeliness of reporting flows towards the Board of Directors is subject to periodic review by the same Board as part of the annual self-assessment process (see next section).\n\n## Board Review and training\n\nOn  an  annual  basis,  the  Board  of  Directors  conducts  a  selfassessment (the Board Review) 7 , for which benchmarking against national  and  international  best  practices  and  an  examination  of Board dynamics are essential elements, also with a view to provide shareholders with guidelines on the most appropriate professional profiles for members of the Board. Following the Board Review, the Board of Directors develops an action plan, if necessary, to improve the functioning of the Board and its Committees.\n\nWith reference to financial year 2023, the Board Review was carried out  through  questionnaires  and  interviews  that  specifically  looked at: (i) the size, functioning and composition of the Board and the Committees, also taking into account elements such as professional characteristics, skills, expertise  and  experience,  including  in management, and diversity, including gender, of its members, as well as their seniority in office, and a series of other key aspects, listed below; (ii) the role of the Board in identification and examination of the strategic themes and monitoring of the Plan; (iii) effective integration of  the  risk  profiles  in  decision-making  and  governance  processes, particularly  regarding  the  internal  control  and  risk  management system; (iv) ESG/sustainability themes, in terms of the definition of priorities,  integration  of  decision-making  processes,  assessment of  specific  risk  profiles,  connection  to  managerial  remuneration mechanisms and performance of adequate training activity.",

These results particularly highlighted the following strengths of the Board:\n\n- \u00b7 appropriate  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  of  the Board, in accordance with the 2023 guidelines for shareholders, regarding the mix of expertise, experience and skills provided by the Directors;\n- \u00b7  level of expertise, motivation and sense of belonging of Directors;\n- \u00b7  dynamics of the Board, participation and involvement of Directors in debate;\n- \u00b7 operational activity of the Board of Directors and process fluidity;\n- \u00b7 optimal  information  flows,  in  terms  of  content,  appropriate timings and comprehensive nature of documentation;\n- \u00b7 clarity  and  effectiveness  of  presentations  to  the  Board  by management;\n- \u00b7 central  role  of  strategy  in  the  Board's  agenda  and  increasing involvement of the Board in definition of strategic plans;\n- \u00b7 role  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  in  terms  of leadership and balance, as well as effectiveness in guaranteeing functional planning and performance of the Board's activity;\n- \u00b7 role  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  unanimously  appreciated  in terms of leadership style, authority and comprehensive business expertise;\n- \u00b7 complementary  relationship  and  complete  harmony  between Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the BoD;\n- \u00b7 functioning and organisation of Board Committees;\n- \u00b7 support of the Board Secretary recognised as stand-out in terms of contribution to the organisation of the BoD's activity and the high quality of minute-taking;\n- \u00b7 quality  of  the  induction  programme,  particularly  important  in order to accelerate onboarding and effective performance of the roles of numerous newly appointed Board Members.\n\nThe  Board  of  Statutory  Auditors  also  conducted  its  own  selfassessment in 2023.\n\nFor a number of years now, Eni has supported the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors with an induction programme, which involves the presentation of the activities and organization of Eni by top management.\n\nFollowing the appointment of the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors, Eni prepared a training plan that started on May 11, 2023, with numerous induction sessions open to Directors and Statutory Auditors, also in the context of the meetings of Board Committees, on topics of general interest.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nThe new programme began with an introductory general presentation on the company's mission and business model and its macrostructure, focusing on the activities of the General Business Groups and the medium-to-long-term  Strategic  Plan.  Specific  sessions  were  held on Eni's Corporate Governance model and rules, on the compliance obligations related to issuers, on the rules of conduct for Directors, on the Eni regulatory system, and on the set-up and tools of the internal control and risk management system, on the integrated compliance model and on the structure and core activities of internal auditing.\n\nOn appointment of the new members of the Board Committees, induction  sessions  were  provided  focused  on  topics  of  specific relevance to these roles, in addition to a series of meetings, open to all Directors and Statutory Auditors, on topics of general interest.\n\nIn particular, also with a view to involvement of the Board in topics connected  with  the  creation  of  value  in  the  medium  and  long term, the following areas were explored: (i) key elements of Eni's Transition Plan, which has the goal of transformation of the energy portfolio, progressively switching over to alternative energy in line with international decarbonisation scenarios, and; (ii) the strategies pursued in terms of sustainable mobility, with illustration of Eni's approach  to  decarbonisation  of  the  transport  sector.  There  was also presentation of Eni's sustainability model, characterised by the integration of social and environmental themes into its mission and business processes with a systemic approach, and with particular focus on the central importance of the Board in this context. Finally, there  was  communication  of  the  reporting  methods  adopted, on  a  mandatory  and  voluntary  basis,  with  illustration  of  recent developments in the regulatory framework. With particular reference to  the  induction  and  onboarding  activities,  also  considering  the positive  results  of  the  self-assessment,  the  Board  recommended continuation, also for the next mandate, of investment in training, in order to promote ever greater understanding by all parties of the complexity of the energy sector, particularly regarding the energy transition and the more technical aspects of the business.\n\n## The governance of sustainability\n\nEni's governance structure supports the integration of sustainability, including in the form of 'sustainable success', into its business model.\n\nA central role is reserved for the Board of Directors, upon the proposal of the Chief Executive Officer, in the definition of the strategic guidelines and objectives of the Company and the Group, pursuing their sustainable success and monitoring their implementation. In detail, a central theme in which the Board of Directors plays a key role is the process of energy transition to a low carbon future 8 .",

In  particular,  as  already  indicated,  the Board, upon proposal of the Chairman of the BoD in agreement with the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  has  adopted  the  policy  for  managing dialogue with shareholders, also in order to ensure an orderly and consistent communication.\n\nAnother  central  issue  of  interest  for  the  Board  of  Directors  is respect for Human Rights. In this regard, in September 2023, the Board of Directors of Eni approved the Eni Human Rights Policy, which renews the company's commitment in this area and lays a foundation for updating and strengthening of the Company's management model, with the aim of guaranteeing implementation of the due diligence process according to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) and the OECD Guidelines for  Multinational  Enterprises,  also  considering  future  regulatory developments in this regard.\n\nEni's Board of Directors has a central role in the internal control and  risk  management  system,  within  which  the  economic  and environmental impacts and the impacts on people of the Company's activities are also important. Particular reference is made to the role of the Board of Directors: when approving business transactions reserved to it which also include the outcomes of the risk analysis and  any  assessments  of  the  ESG  impacts  associated  with  the transaction; when approving the strategic plan which also includes the assessment of the associated risks and ESG impacts; when promoting  dialogue  with  shareholders  and  stakeholders  and  the related information flows; in the quarterly review of the main risks, including  relevant  ESG  risks;  when  defining  the  guidelines  on  the management and control  of  financial  risks  when  establishing  the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee with the task of supporting it  with  sustainability  issues;  when  establishing  the  Control  and Risk Committee with the task of supporting it with issues related to the internal control and risk management system (ICRMS); when approving and reviewing the regulatory instruments used to monitor risks  and  when  receiving  information  flows  (such  as  regulatory instruments on transactions involving the interests of the Directors and Statutory Auditors and transactions with related parties, anticorruption and internal audits, as well as the ICRMS guidelines).\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Chief  Operating  Officers,  in exercising their delegated powers, for the implementation of the\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nstrategies defined by the Board, are responsible for the management of the aforesaid risks with the support of the specialist company functions  responsible,  in  particular,  for  sustainable  development, health, safety, environment and human resources.\n\nIn its strategic guidance role, the Board also approves the Company's Management, Supervision and Control Model for Health, Safety and Environment, Security and Public Safety Risks, and its substantial amendments; it conducts an annual evaluation of the HSE Report prepared  by  the  Head  of  the  competent  Company  function  and included in the flows relating to the ICRMS adequacy assessment.\n\nFor these issues, the Board also receives support from the Board Committees,  within  their  respective  remit,  by  virtue  of  their preparatory, advisory and consultative functions.\n\n## In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 Eni's Control and Risk Committee assesses whether the periodic financial  and  non-financial  information  is  suitable  to  correctly represent the business model and the strategies of the company, as well as the impact of its activities and the performance achieved, expressing an opinion on this matter to the Board and coordinating with  the  Sustainability  and  Scenarios  Committee  regarding periodic  non-financial  disclosure.  In  addition,  in  this  context,  it examines the content of periodic non-financial information relevant for the purposes of the internal control and risk management system. Also in relation to these tasks, it meets frequently with the competent company management for such issues, analysing, among other things: (i) the main issues with a view to drafting the annual and half-yearly financial reports as well as their essential connotations and the contents of the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement; (ii) the main results achieved by Eni in health, safety and environment, and the initiatives developed for the continuous improvement of the related performance, including through use of new technologies; (iii) security and cyber security issues; (iv) activities to protect asset integrity; (v) climate change risk and specific associated aspects;\n- \u00b7 the Sustainability and Scenario Committee performs preparatory, consultative  and  advisory  functions  to  the  Board  of  Directors on scenarios and sustainability issues, meaning the processes, initiatives and activities surrounding the Company's commitment to  sustainable  development  along  the  entire  value  chain,  with specific reference to: climate transition and  technological innovation  issues;  access  to  energy  and  energy  sustainability; environment and energy efficiency; local development, in particular economic diversification,  health,  well-being  and  safety  of  people and communities; respect for and protection of rights, especially human rights; integrity and transparency; diversity and inclusion. To  this  end,  it  receives  information  from  the  managers  of  the company functions involved in said processes, who may be invited to attend the Committee meetings.",

The Remuneration Policy of Directors and top management also contributes  to  the  company's  strategy,  through  incentive  plans connected to the fulfilment of preset, measurable and complementary targets that fully represent the essential priorities of the Company, in line with the Strategic Plan and the expectations of shareholders and other stakeholders, in order to promote a strong focus on results and combine the operating, economic and financial soundness with social and environmental sustainability, coherently with the longterm nature of the business and the related risk profiles.\n\nIn particular, relating to social and environmental sustainability, the Policy defined for 2024 provides the confirmation:\n\n- \u00b7  in the Short-Term Plan of Incentive of Short-Term with deferral, of a target related to environmental sustainability and human capital (weight 25%), focused on safety and reduction of GHG emission intensity (Scope 1 + Scope 2), as well as, from 2021, a specific target  related  to  the  increase  of  renewables  installed  apacity (weight 12.5%);\n- \u00b7 the 2023-2025 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan includes a target related  to  environmental  sustainability  and  energy  transition (overall weight 35%), articulated on a series of goals linked to the processes of decarbonization and energy transition and to the circular economy.\n\nThe  Remuneration  Policy  for  2024  maintains  the  remuneration levels defined in the previous Policy unchanged and provides for the introduction of a Widespread Share Ownership Plan (PAD) for all Eni employees, pursuing the following targets: (i) strengthening\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nEni's sense of belonging and participation in the objectives and growth of corporate value, promoting alignment with shareholders' interests  and  a  culture  of  financial  investment,  also  with  coinvestment  mechanisms;  (ii)  income  support,  in  relation  to  the erosion of the purchasing power of wages due to inflation. For the Chief Executive Officer, the General Managers, the Managers with Strategic Responsibilities and the Executives participating in the ILT Share Plan, the assignment will be purely symbolic.\n\nThe  Remuneration  Policy  described  in  the  first  section  of  the Remuneration  Report,  available  on  the  Company's  website www.eni.com,  is  prepared  taking  into  account  the  orientations of shareholders and institutional investors, through the implementation  annual  engagement  plans,  is  presented  for  a binding vote at the Shareholders' Meeting, with the adence required by its duration and in any case at least every three years or in the event of changes to it 12 . The results of the hareholders' meeting are reported in the Summary of the mentioned relation.\n\n## Internal Control and Risk Management System 13\n\nEni has adopted an integrated and comprehensive internal control and risk management system at different levels of the organizational and corporate structure, based on a set of rules, procedures and organizational structures aimed at allowing an effective identification, measurement, management and monitoring of the main risks, in order to contribute to the sustainable success of the Company.\n\nThe internal control and risk management system is also based on Eni's Code of Ethics, which sets out the rules of conduct for the appropriate management of the Company's business and which must be complied with by all the members of the Board, as well as of the other corporate bodies and all other third parties working with or in name or for the interest of Eni.\n\nFurthermore, Eni has adopted rules for the integrated governance of the internal control and risk management system, the guidelines of which were approved by the Board. Furthermore, on adopting the Corporate Governance Code, Eni's Board of Directors established various  actions  and  application  and  improvement  methods to  comply  with  the  recommendations  on  the  ICRMS,  already generally accepted as in line with the best practices of Corporate Governance 14 .\n\n- (12) In accordance with Art. 123 ter, paragraph 3 bis of the Italian Decree Law No. 58/98.\n- (13) For more information, please see the 2023 Corporate Governance and Shareholding Structure Report.\n- (14) For more information, please see the 2023 Corporate Governance and Shareholding Structure Report.",

The  Integrated  Compliance  process was designed to stimulate integration between those who work in the business activities and the corporate functions that oversee the various compliance risks.\n\nEni  gained  ISO  37301:2021  certification  of  its  Management  and Compliance  System  from  RINA  Services  SpA,  a  leading  Italian certification  company.  This  confirms  the  robust  nature  of  the integrated  compliance  model  adopted  by  the  company,  which enables  effective  and  structured  management  of  compliance risks, guaranteeing the alignment of its processes with applicable regulations and the central importance of sustainable success as a key strategic pillar.\n\nFurthermore, acting on the proposal of the Chief Executive Officer, having obtained a favourable opinion from the Control and Risk Committee, the Board of Directors of Eni approved the internal rules concerning the Market Information Abuse (Issuers). These, by updating the previous Eni rules for the aspects relating to 'issuers', incorporate  the  amendments  introduced  by  Regulation  No. 596/2014/EU of April 16, 2014 and the associated implementing rules, as well as the national regulations, taking account of Italian and foreign institutional guidelines on the matter.\n\nThe internal rules lay down principles of conduct for the protection of confidentiality of corporate information in general, to promote\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nmaximum compliance, as also required by Eni's Code of Ethics and corporate security measures. Eni recognizes that information is a strategic asset to be managed in such a way as to ensure the protection of the interests of the Company, shareholders and the market.\n\nIn order to ensure the protection of corporate assets, of the interests of  shareholders  and  the  market,  as  well  as  the  transparency and integrity of conduct, Eni has adopted - in compliance with Consob  regulatory  provisions  -  rules  on  transactions  involving the interests of Directors and Statutory Auditors and transactions with related parties. These rules were most recently updated in 2023 by the Board of Directors, with the unanimous and favourable opinion of the Control and Risks Committee. The changes primarily regard alignment with the new Eni Regulatory System and further refinement on the basis of practical experience and from a riskbased perspective.\n\nThe  prevention,  identification  and  management  of  conflicts  of interest is governed by the Company's Code of Ethics, the rules for identification and management of conflicts of interest and the rules on transactions involving the interests of Directors and Statutory Auditors and transactions with related parties. In these documents, Eni personnel are requested to promote the company's interests by making objective decisions and avoiding situations in which conflicts of interest could arise.\n\nFurthermore, the regulations on the function and organisation of the Board of Directors, most recently approved at the meeting on May 11, 2023, state, in line with the provisions of Art. 2391 of the Italian Civil Code, that before each item on the Board meeting's agenda is discussed, each Director and Statutory Auditor must disclose whether they hold any personal interest or interest on behalf of third parties in relation to the matters or issues to be discussed,  clarifying  their  nature,  terms,  origin  and  extent.  The aforesaid  regulations  also  state  that,  during  Board  resolutions, Directors holding an interest in issues to be deliberated upon do not normally take part in the discussion and resolution, leaving the meeting room.\n\nAn integral part of the Eni internal control system is the internal control  system  over  financial  reporting,  the  objective  of  which is  to  provide  reasonable  certainty  of  the  reliability  of  financial reporting and the ability of the financial report preparation process to generate such reporting in compliance with generally accepted international accounting standards.\n\nEni's  CEO  and  the  Officer  in  charge  of  preparing  financial reports (Financial Reporting Officer), who avail itself of Chief Financial  Officer  (CFO)  units,  are  responsible  for  planning, establishing and maintaining the internal control system over",

A  central  role  in  the  Company's  internal control and risk management system is played by the Board of  Statutory  Auditors,  which  in  addition  to  the  supervisory and control functions provided for in the Consolidated Law on Financial Intermediation, also monitors the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management  systems,  consistent  with  the  provisions  of  the Corporate  Governance  Code,  including  in  its  capacity  as  the 'Internal Control and Audit Committee' pursuant to Italian law and as the 'Audit Committee' under US law.\n\nTaking into account the development of mandatory sustainability reporting and supplementing of financial reporting, the responsibilities of the Financial Reporting Officer have been updated to include oversight of activity for the establishment, monitoring and assessment of the internal control system for sustainability reporting, activity for drafting of the Non-Financial Statement and support in the definition of 'Eni For'.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nThe  responsibilities  assigned  and  the  regulatory  and  reporting instruments  defined  as  part  of  Eni's  internal  control  and  risk management system, in particular for the purposes of assessing its  adequacy  and  efficacy,  also  make  it  possible  to  identify  the 'critical concerns', understood as any complaints with potential impacts on the Company's stakeholders.\n\nOf  the  ICRMS  instruments,  since  2006,  Eni  has  adopted  rules (published on the Company's website) governing receipt, analysis and  processing  of  reports  (so-called  whistleblowing),  including those transmitted to Eni SpA and to its subsidiaries. The rules allow anyone (employees or third parties) to report behaviours - related to members of the corporate administrative and control bodies and employees of Eni, or to all those who operate or have operated in Italy and abroad in the name or on behalf or in the interest of Eni - in violation of laws and regulations, provisions of the Authorities Code  of  Ethics,  231  Models  or  Compliance  Models  for  foreign subsidiaries and internal regulations.",

The reserves life index was 10.6 years (11.3 years in 2022).\n\n## PORTFOLIO\n\n- \u00b7  In  January  2024,  the  Neptune  acquisition  was  finalized  and  will contribute to 2024 results. The transaction, comprising Neptune's entire portfolio other than its operations in Norway (purchased by V\u00e5r Energi owned at 63% by Eni) and Germany (carved out of the transaction). Eni acquired an asset portfolio which features strong  complementarity  at  both  operational  and  strategic  level with its own, strengthening the presence in key geographic areas, like the United Kingdom, Algeria, Indonesia, and Australia. V\u00e5r will consolidate its position in Norway. The deal is expected to increase Eni production plateau by over 100 kboe/d including its share of V\u00e5r, by adding cost-competitive, low-emission volumes that will underpin the Group strategy of growing its share of natural gas production and speeding up the transition, while at the same time enhancing security of energy supplies to Europe.\n- \u00b7  In March 2024, finalized with Perenco the sale of Eni's participating interest in several production licences in Congo.\n- \u00b7  In  September  2023,  signed  an  agreement  with  the  local  partner Oando PLC (Nigeria's leading indigenous energy solutions provider) to divest Eni' subsidiary Nigerian Agip Oil Company Ltd (NAOC Ltd), with onshore oil & gas exploration and production activities, as well as the ancillary power generation business. The agreement does not include Eni's interest in the SPDC JV.\n\n## EXPLORATION\n\n- \u00b7  Exploration activities delivered an outstanding performance also in 2023, with around 900 million boe of new resource additions to the reserve base at competitive costs. In particular:\n- -the Geng North-1 gas discovery, in the offshore North Ganal license, in Indonesia, was one of the top in the oil and gas industry\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nin 2023. Preliminary estimated discovered volume was 5 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas and 400 mmbbl condensate in place. This discovery, together with the acquisition of Neptune that owns shares in the assets in the area and with the purchase of Chevron interests in the Rapak and Ganal blocks, already participated by Eni,  give access to massive resources whose development in  synergyc  with  Eni's  operating  fields  and  the  Bontang  LNG export terminal, offering the prospect of transforming the Kutei basin into a new world class gas hub. Indonesia is expected to become one of the major growth drivers of natural gas in E&P;\n\n- -in Egypt, with the significant Nargis 1X discovery in the East Med area (Eni's interest 45%) with estimated resources of around 2.8 TCF of gas in place. Further discoveries were in the Sinai, Nile Delta and Western Desert concessions. These discoveries confirm the positive track-record of Eni's exploration in the Country;\n- -in  Mexico,  with  the  Yatzil  discovery  in  the  offshore  Block  7 exploration  prospect  (Eni  operator  with  45%  interest),  in  the Sureste basin. Yatzil was the second commitment well of the Block 7 and the eighth successful exploration well drilled by Eni in this area;\n- -in Congo, with two discoveries in the Marine VI Bis permit (Eni's interest 65%);\n- -other discoveries were made in Algeria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates as well as Angola and Norway.\n- \u00b7  In February 2024, the Cronos-2 well was successfully drilled to appraise the Cronos discovery made in 2022, in the operated Block 6 (Eni's interest 50%), in offshore Cyprus. The Cronos-2 appraisal well underwent a full production test and an extensive data  acquisition  confirming  the  excellent  production  gas capacity of the discovery. The drilling of Cronos-2 confirms the Eni's and its partner TotalEnergies commitment to accelerate the  selection  of  the  most  suitable  and  economically  viable development solution.\n- \u00b7   Reloading exploration portfolio with the addition of approximately 21,400 square kilometers with new leases in Egypt, Timor Leste, Indonesia,  Algeria,  Norway,  Angola,  the  United  Kingdom  and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\n- \u00b7  In 2023 exploration expenses were \u20ac687 million (\u20ac605 million in 2022) and included the write-off of unsuccessful wells and of unproved exploration rights, amounting to \u20ac482 million (\u20ac385 million in 2022) associated to projects with negative outcome. In particular, exploration and appraisal activities comprised writeoffs of unsuccessful exploration wells costs for \u20ac420 million mainly in Egypt, Mexico, Mozambique, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon. Write-offs of \u20ac85 million are related to exploration licenses due mainly to exiting from marginal areas. In addition, 105 exploratory drilled wells are in progress at yearend (48.1 net to Eni).",

Production  start-up was achieved in less than two years after the discovery and less than a year and a half after the Final Investment Decision. This  is  thanks  to  Eni's  distinctive  phased  development  and fast-track approach. Baleine stands out as the first emissionsfree  -  Scope  1  and  2  -  production  project  in  Africa.  The associated  gas  production  will  be  delivered  freely  to  the national company, enabling the Country to meet its domestic electricity requirements, facilitating access to energy, and local development, within Eni's dual flag partnerships;\n- -the commissioning of the Tango FLNG vessel in block Marine XII off Congo, which will deliver the first LNG cargo in the first quarter 2024 on schedule. The Congo LNG project will monetize the gas volumes in the Marine XII block, leveraging also existing assets  and  through  a  phased  and  modular  development, targeting zero routine flaring. In addition, the project will support the Country's energy needs and by exploiting the surplus gas for LNG production. The project is expected to target a liquefaction capacity  of  approximately  160  BCF/y  a  plateau.  According to the agreements recently signed, all LNG production will be marketed by Eni.\n- \u00b7  Finalized the acquisition of bp's assets in Algeria including the two gas-producing concessions 'In Amenas' and 'In Salah', jointly operated with Sonatrach and Equinor.\n- \u00b7  Acquired Chevron offshore production and development assets in Indonesia. The operation will ensure the fast-track development of ongoing projects in the area and the integration with Neptune Energy assets. This acquisition is also in line with Eni's energy transition strategy to increase the share of natural gas production to 60% by 2030.\n- \u00b7  Signed an agreement with the National Oil Corporation of Libya (NOC)  to  develop  the  A&E  Structures,  to  increase  natural  gas production destined both to the domestic market and to export volumes in Europe. The project also comprises construction of an onshore hub for carbon capture and storage (CCS), in line with Eni's decarbonization strategy.\n- \u00b7  Signed a Memorandum of Understandig (MoU) with the ADNOC state company in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi for future jointly project\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nin the areas of energy transition, sustainability and decarbonization. The agreement includes to explore potential opportunities in the sector  of  renewable  energy,  blue  and  green  hydrogen,  carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), in the reduction of GHG and methane  gas  emissions,  energy  efficiency,  routine  gas  flaring reduction and the commitment in the Global Methane Pledge, to support global energy security and a sustainable energy transition.\n\n- \u00b7  Within COP28, announced to join the Oil & Gas Decarbonisation Charter, a platform launched by the COP28 Presidency to accelerate the oil and gas industry contribution for the decarbonization process, also  the  commitment  of  several  state-owned  companies.  There are three main targets in this initiative, where Eni's decarbonization strategy  is  already  in  line:  (i)  achieve  Net  Zero  Scope  1  and  2 emissions by or before 2050; (ii) the goal of zero methane emissions in the upstream sector by 2030; (iii) zero routine gas flaring by 2030.\n- \u00b7  Eni  announced  its  financial  support  to  the  Global  Flaring  and Methane Reduction trust fund (GFMR), a program sponsored by the World Bank to help governments and operators in developing Countries eliminate routine flaring and reduce methane emissions from the O&G sector to near zero by 2030.\n- \u00b7   Ranked as Gold Standard within the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) program. The recognition of the United Nations is  based  on  Eni's  positive  assessment  for  having  significantly improved its implementation plan for reporting methane emissions, in line with the OGMP 2.0 program recommendations. This confirms the effectiveness of the decarbonization strategy and a continuous focus on reducing methane emissions.\n- \u00b7  Signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Libya to evaluate possible  opportunities  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  and  develop sustainable  energy  in  the  Country.  Under  the  terms  of  the memorandum, Eni will work on reducing CO 2 emissions through the reduction of routine gas flaring, fugitive emissions and venting, as well as possible projects for the reduction of hard-to-abate sector emissions.\n- \u00b7  Development expenditure amounted to \u20ac6.3 billion, in particular in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Congo, Egypt, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, Libya and Algeria.\n- \u00b7  In 2023, overall R&D expenditure amounted to \u20ac38 million (\u20ac41 million in 2022).",

        "page_content": "## RESERVES\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Company has adopted comprehensive classification criteria for the estimate of proved, proved developed and proved undeveloped oil & gas reserves in accordance with applicable US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, as provided for in Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10. Proved oil & gas reserves are those quantities of liquids (including condensates and natural gas liquids) and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain.\n\nOil and natural gas prices used in the estimate of proved reserves are obtained from the official survey published by Platt's Marketwire, except  when  their  calculation  derives  from  existing  contractual conditions.  Prices  are  calculated  as  the  unweighted  arithmetic average  of  the  first-day-of  the-month  price  for  each  month  within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements.\n\nEngineering  estimates  of  the  Company's  oil  &  gas  reserves  are inherently uncertain. Although authoritative guidelines exist regarding engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil & gas reserves can be designated as 'proved', the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and  geological  interpretation  and  evaluation.  Consequently,  the estimated proved reserves of oil and natural gas may be subject to future revision and upward and downward revisions may be made to the initial booking of reserves due to analysis of new information.\n\nProved reserves to which Eni is entitled under concession contracts are  determined  by  applying  Eni's  equity  interest  to  total  proved reserves of the contractual area, until expiration of the relevant mineral right. Eni's proved reserves entitlements at PSAs are calculated so that the sale of production entitlements cover expenses incurred by the Group for field development (Cost Oil) and recognize a share of profit set contractually (Profit Oil). A similar scheme applies to service contracts.\n\n## Reserves governance\n\nEni  retains  rigorous  control  over  the  process  of  booking  proved reserves, through a centralized model of reserves governance. The Reserves Department of the Exploration & Production segment is in charge of: (i) ensuring the periodic certification process of proved\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nreserves; (ii) updating the Company's guidelines on reserves evaluation and  classification  and  the  internal  procedures;  and  (iii)  providing training of staff involved in the process of reserves estimation.\n\nCompany guidelines have been reviewed by DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), an independent petroleum engineering company, which stated that those guidelines comply with the SEC rules 1 .\n\nD&M has also stated that the Company guidelines provide reasonable interpretation  of  facts  and  circumstances  in  line  with  generally accepted practices in the industry whenever SEC rules may be less precise. When participating in exploration and production activities operated by other entities, Eni estimates its share of proved reserves on the basis of the above guidelines.\n\nThe process for estimating reserves, as described in the internal procedure, involves the following roles and responsibilities: (i) the business  unit  managers  (geographic  units)  and  Local  Reserves Evaluators (LRE) are in charge with estimating and classifying gross reserves including assessing production profiles, capital expenditure, operating expenses and costs related to asset retirement obligations; (ii) the petroleum engineering department and the operations unit at the head office verify the production profiles of such properties where significant changes have occurred and operating expenses, respectively; (iii) geographic area managers verify the commercial conditions and the progress of the projects; (iv) the Planning and Control Department provides the economic evaluation of reserves; and (v) the Reserves Department, through the Headquarter Reserves Evaluators  (HRE),  provides  independent  reviews  of  fairness  and correctness of classifications  carried  out  by  the  above-mentioned units and aggregates worldwide reserves data.\n\nEni's  Head  of  Reserves  holds  a  Master's  degree  in  Petroleum Engineering from the Polytechnic of Turin and 5-years Degree in Civil Hydraulic Engineering from the Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna. He has 20 years of experience in the upstream industry and in reserves evaluation. Staff involved in the reserves evaluation process  fulfils  the  professional  qualifications  requested  by  the  role and  complies  with  the  required  level  of  independence,  objectivity and confidentiality  in  accordance  with  professional  ethics.  Reserves Evaluators qualifications comply with international standards defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.\n\n## Reserves independent evaluation\n\nEni has its proved reserves audited on a rotational basis by independent oil engineering companies 2 .\n\nThe description of qualifications of the persons primarily responsible for the reserves audit is included in the third-party audit report. In the preparation of their reports, independent evaluators rely upon information  furnished  by  Eni,  without  independent  verification,\n\n- (1) The reports of independent engineers are available on sec.gov in 'Item 19 - Exhibits' of the Annual Report on Form 20-F 2009.\n- (2) For the past three years we have availed ourselves of the independent certification service of DeGolyer and Mac Naughton, Ryder Scott, Societ\u00e8 Generale de Surveillance and Sproule.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Net additions to proved reserves were 417 mmboe and derived from: (i) revisions of previous estimates were positive for 312 mmboe (including the effect of an updating of the gas conversion factor of 21 mmboe) including increases in Bouri and Area D fields in Libya, Val d'Agri field in Italy and  M'boundi  Gas  field  in  Congo,  offset  by  reductions  in  Egypt  for the reconfiguration of the Zohr phase 2 project and Blacktip field in Australia. Revisions to previous estimates include a positive price effect of 30 mmboe, mainly due to the change in the Brent benchmark marker from 101 $/barrel in 2022 to 83 $/barrel in 2023. This price effect was determined to the removal of volumes reserves which have become uneconomical in the 2023 scenario more than offset by net higher reserves entitlements under PSA contracts; (ii) new\n\ndiscoveries and extensions of 105 mmboe mainly as a result of the final investment decision on the Hail and Ghasha project in the United Arab Emirates, as well as the Merakes East project in Indonesia.\n\nPortfolio  transactions  were  negative  for  13  mmboe  and  mainly related to the sale of Alliance assets in the United States and a reduction in the stake of the Ghasha concession in the United Arab Emirates offset by the acquisition of bp assets in Algeria, and of an interest in the Block 3/05a in Angola by Azule Energy.\n\nThe organic 6 and all sources reserves replacement ratio was 69% and 67%, respectively. The reserves life index was 10.6 years (11.3 years in 2022).\n\nFor further information, please see the additional information on Oil & Gas producing activities required by the SEC in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n(6) Organic ratio of changes in proved reserves for the year resulting from revisions of previously reported reserves, improved recovery, extensions and discoveries, to production for the year. All sources ratio includes sales or purchases of minerals in place. A ratio higher than 100% indicates that more proved reserves were added than produced in a year. The Reserves Replacement Ratio is not an indicator of future production because the ultimate development and production of reserves is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These include the risks associated with the successful completion of large-scale projects, including addressing ongoing regulatory issues and completion of infrastructure, as well as changes in oil and gas prices, political risks and geological and environmental risks.",

At year-end, proved undeveloped reserves of liquids amounted to 1,109 mmbbl and of natural gas amounted to 6,859 bcf, mainly concentrated in Africa and Asia. Proved undeveloped reserves  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  amounted  to  740  mmbbl of liquids and 4,832 bcf of natural gas. The table below provide a summary of changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2023:\n\n|                                                     | (mmboe)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2022 | 2,423     |\n| Additions                                           | (187)     |\n| Revisions of previous estimates                     | 121       |\n| Improved recovery                                   |           |\n| Portfolio                                           | (42)      |\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2023 | 2,419     |\n\nDuring  2023,  Eni  matured  187  mmboe  of  proved  undeveloped reserves  to  proved  developed  reserves  due  to  progress  in development activities, production start-ups and project revisions. The main reclassifications to proved developed reserves related to the following fields/projects: Breidablikk, Fenja, Tommeliten Alpha, Bauge and Frosk in Norway in V\u00e5r Energi, Baleine in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Zohr in Egypt and Amoca in Mexico.\n\nFor further information, please see the additional information on Oil & Gas producing activities required by the SEC in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn 2023, capital expenditure amounted to approximately \u20ac9.1 billion to progress the development of PUDs.\n\nReserves  that  remain  proved  undeveloped  for  five  or  more  years are a result of several factors that affect the timing of the projects development and execution, such as the complexity of development project  in  adverse  and  remote  locations,  physical  limitations  of infrastructures  or  plant  capacity  and  contractual  limitations  that establish production levels. The Company estimates that 0.8 bboe of proved undeveloped reserves have remained undeveloped for five years or more at the balance sheet date and increased from 2022. The proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more at the balance sheet date mainly related to: (i) certain Libyan  gas  fields  (0.5  bboe)  where  development  completion  and production start-ups are planned according to the delivery obligations set forth in a long-term gas supply agreement currently in force; (ii) Johan Castberg project for V\u00e5r Energi, the development of which is ongoing and first oil is expected in the last quarter of 2024 (0.1 bboe); (iii) other fields in Italy and Iraq (0.1 bboe) where development activities are in progress; and (iv) in the Umm Shaif reservoir (0.1 bboe) in the United Arab Emirates where development activity is ongoing.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\n## Delivery commitments\n\nEni, through  consolidated  subsidiaries  and  equity-accounted entities,  sells  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  from  its  producing operations  under  a  variety  of  contractual  obligations.  Some  of these contracts, mostly relating to natural gas, specify the delivery of fixed and determinable quantities.\n\nEni is contractually  committed  under  existing  contracts  or agreements to deliver in the next three years mainly natural gas to third parties for a total of approximately 612 mmboe from producing assets located mainly in Algeria, Australia, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Libya, Nigeria, Norway and Venezuela.\n\nThe  sales  contracts  contain  a  mix  of  fixed  and  variable  pricing formulas that are generally indexed to the market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products. Management believes it  can  satisfy  these  contracts  from  quantities  available  mainly from production of the Company's proved developed reserves and supplies from third parties based on existing contracts. Production is  expected  to  account  for  approximately  99.7%  of  delivery commitments.\n\nEni has met all contractual delivery commitments as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION\n\nIn 2023 hydrocarbon production averaged 1.655 mmboe/d, up 3% compared to 2022. Production was supported by the ramp-up in Mozambique and Mexico, start-up of the Baleine project in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, higher  activity  in  Algeria,  which  also  benefited  from  the  business acquisitions, in Kazakhstan due to unplanned events occurred in the same period 2022, as well as in Indonesia. These increases were offset by lower production due to mature fields decline.\n\nLiquid  production  was  769  kbbl/d,  up  2%  compared  to  2022. Production growth in Kazakhstan and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was partly offset by mature fields decline.\n\nNatural  gas  production  was  4,635  mmcf/d,  up  2%  compared  to 2022. Production increases were reported in Algeria, Mozambique in relation to the ramp-up of the Coral Floating LNG project, Indonesia and Kazakhstan, offset by mature fields decline.\n\nOil and gas production sold amounted to 546 mmboe. The 58 mmboe difference over production (604 mmboe) mainly reflected volumes  of  natural  gas  consumed  in  operations  (46  mmboe), changes in inventory levels and other variations. Approximately 67% of liquids production sold (279.6 mmbbl) was destined to Eni's downstream business. About 14% of natural gas production sold (1,394 bcf) was destined to Eni's Global Gas & LNG Portfolio segment.",

Effective January 1, 2023, the conversion rate of natural gas from cubic feet to boe has been updated to 1 barrel of oil = 5,232 cubic feet of gas (it was 1 barrel of oil = 5,263 cubic feet of gas). The effect of this update on production\n- expressed in boe was approximately 2 mmboe for the full year of 2023. Other per-boe indicators were only marginally affected by the update (e.g. realized prices, costs per boe) and also negligible was the impact on depletion charges. Other oil companies may use different conversion rates.",

As  of  December  31,  2023,  Eni's  mineral  right portfolio consisted of 744 exclusive or shared rights of exploration and development oil and gas activities. Total acreage amounts to 301,308 square kilometers net to Eni (total acreage was 308,550 square kilometers net to Eni as of December 31, 2022). Developed acreage was 27,069 square kilometers and undeveloped acreage was 274,239 square kilometers net to Eni.\n\nIn 2023 new leases were purchased or awarded in Egypt, Timor Leste, Indonesia, Algeria, Norway, Angola, the United Kingdom and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire for a total increase in acreage of approximately 21,400 square kilometers. Relinquishment for the year related mainly to Kenya,  Vietnam,  Indonesia,  Gabon,  Egypt,  Algeria,  Mozambique, Lebanon  and  Norway  covering  an  acreage  of  approximately 31,800 square kilometers. Interest increases were reported mainly in Kenya, Indonesia, Mexico, and Norway for a total acreage of\n\napproximately 7,200 square kilometers. Partial relinquishment was reported mainly in Algeria, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Mexico, Italy, Egypt and Lebanon for approximately 4,100 square kilometers.\n\nThe gross undeveloped acreages that will expire in the next three years  are  related  to  exploration  leases,  blocks,  concessions  in: (i) Rest of Europe, in particular in Cyprus and Albania; (ii) Rest of Asia,  in  particular  in  Oman,  Vietnam,  Indonesia  and  the  United Arab Emirates; (iii) North Africa, in particular in Morocco, Libya and Egypt; (iv) Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular in Kenya, Angola, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Mozambique; and (v) Americas, in particular in Mexico. In  most  cases  extension  or  renewal  options  are  contractually defined and may or may not be exercised depending on the results of the studies and the planned activities. Management believes that a significant amount of acreage will be maintained following extension or renewal.",

These cover virtually all aspects of exploration and production activities, including matters such as license acquisition, production rates, royalties, pricing, environmental protection, export, taxes and foreign exchange. The terms and condition of the leases, licenses and contracts under which these Oil & Gas interests are held vary from Country to Country. These leases, licenses and contracts are generally granted by or entered into with a government entity or state company and are sometimes entered into with private property owners. These contractual arrangements usually take the form of concession agreements or production sharing agreements.\n\nConcessions contracts. Eni operates under concession contracts mainly  in  Western  Countries.  Concessions  contracts  regulate relationships between States and oil companies with regards to hydrocarbon exploration and production activity. Contractual clauses governing mineral concessions, licenses and exploration permits regulate the access of Eni to hydrocarbon reserves. The company holding the mining concession has an exclusive right on exploration, development and production activities, sustaining all the operational risks and costs related to the exploration and development activities, and it is entitled to the productions realized. As a compensation for mineral concessions, pays royalties on production (which may be in cash or in-kind) and taxes on oil revenues to the state in accordance with local tax legislation. Both exploration and production licenses are  granted  generally  for  a  specified  period  of  time  (except  for production licenses in the United States which remain in effect until production ceases): the term of Eni's licenses and the extent to which these licenses may be renewed vary by area. Proved reserves to which Eni is entitled are determined by applying Eni's share of production to total proved reserves of the contractual area, in respect of the duration of the relevant mineral right.\n\nProduction Sharing Agreement (PSA). Eni operates under PSA in several of the foreign jurisdictions mainly in African, Middle Eastern, Far Eastern Countries. The mineral right is awarded to the national oil company jointly with the foreign oil company that has an exclusive right to perform exploration, development and production activities and can enter into agreements with other local or international entities. In this type of contract, the national oil company assigns to the international contractor the task of performing exploration and production with the  contractor's  equipment  (technologies)  and  financial  resources. Exploration risks are borne by the contractor and production is divided into two portions: 'Cost Oil' is used to recover costs borne by the contractor and 'Profit Oil'  is  divided  between  the  contractor  and  the national company according to variable schemes and represents the profit  deriving  from  exploration  and  production.  Further  terms  and conditions  of  these  contracts  may  vary  from  Country  to  Country. Pursuant  to  these  contracts,  Eni  is  entitled  to  a  portion  of  a  field's\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nreserves, the sale of which is intended to cover expenditures incurred by the Company to develop and operate the field. The Company's share of production volumes and reserves representing the Profit Oil includes the share of hydrocarbons which corresponds to the taxes to be paid, according to the contractual agreement, by the national government on behalf of the Company. As a consequence, the Company has to recognize at the same time an increase in the taxable profit, through the increase of the revenues, and a tax expense. Proved reserves to which Eni is entitled under PSAs are calculated so that the sale of production entitlements should cover expenses incurred by the Group to develop a field (Cost Oil) and recognize the Profit Oil set contractually (Profit Oil). A similar scheme applies to some service contracts.\n\n## Italy\n\nIn  the  gas  assets  of  the  Adriatic  Sea,  activities  concerned:  (i) maintenance and production optimization intervention at the Hera Lacinia, Luna and Naomi Pandora fields; and (ii) production start-up at the Donata field.\n\nDecommissioning  plan  to  plug-and-abandon  depleted  wells  and to remove non-productive platforms progressed during the year in compliance with Italian Ministerial Decree February 15, 2019 'Linee guida  nazionali  per  la  dismissione  mineraria  delle  piattaforme per  la  coltivazione  in  mare  e  delle  infrastrutture  connesse'.  The decommissioning process is ongoing for 10 platforms in compliance with the above-mentioned decree. In addition, campaign to plug-andabandon non-productive onshore and offshore wells is ongoing.\n\nIn the Val d'Agri production concession, activities carried out during the year concerned: (i) sidetrack of existing wells, mainly in the Monte Enoc area, based on the approved 'Work Program'; and (ii) production optimization activities to mitigate field decline.\n\nIn 2023, activities were launched within the Memorandum of Intent signed in 2022 by Eni, Shell and the Basilicata Region for a sustainable local development associated to the ten-year program of the Val d'Agri concession.  In  particular,  the  agreement  provides  for  many  'nonoil' initiatives and projects for a total commitment of \u20ac90 million by concessionaries. In June 2023 the Basilicata Region selected and approved the following programs: (i) regional development of e-mobility network; (ii) the establishment of the Eni School for Business center (Joule); (iii) initiatives to support the local sustainable development in collaboration with the Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM); and (iv) the development agricultural activities in the biofuels supply chain. In addition an agreement has been defined with the Basilicata Region and Acquedotto Lucano to develop an energy transition project supporting the water sector in the area. The project includes the construction of photovoltaic plants for approximately 50 MW total installed capacity, with  energy  costs  reduction  of  the  Acquedotto  Lucano  and  then reflecting in the bill of lower income groups.\n\nProgressed  the  'Agricultural  Center  for  Experimentation  and Training' project activities in the Energy Valley area nearby the Val d'Agri Oil Center by means of sustainable agricultural initiatives and",

Within the Memorandum of Understanding for the Gela area, signed with the Ministry of Economic Development in November 2014, the construction activities of the Argo and Cassiopea project (Eni's interest 60%) have progressed. During 2023, the installation of the sealine transporting the gas from the offshore well to the onshore treatment facilities was completed. The onshore plant construction is ongoing and nearing completion. Natural gas production start-up is expected in the first half of 2024. Project configuration and design will support to achieve the carbon neutrality target (Scope 1 and 2).\n\nWithin  the  local  support  communities'  initiatives,  according  to the  ratification  of  the  framework  agreement  with  the  Fondazione Banco Alimentare Onlus, Banco Alimentare della Sicilia Onlus and the  Municipality  of  Gela,  activities  progressed  to  create  a  food storage and distribution center for disadvantaged communities. In addition, in 2023, a project was launched to support the logistics and distribution of foodstuffs by the Banco Alimentare della Sicilia Onlus to local people participating in the program.\n\n## Rest of Europe\n\nNorway Exploration activities yielded positive results with: (i) the Countach oil and gas discovery in the Goliat the PL 229 licence located in the Barents Sea; (ii) the Kim oil discovery in the PL 185 license in the North Sea; (iii) the Crino oil and gas discovery in the North Sea; (iv) the Norma gas discovery in the PL 984 license in the North Sea; and (v) the Svalin M S\u00f8r oil discovery in the PL 169 license.

In particular:\n\n- \u00b7  signed in Congo a purchase contract for LNG volumes from the Congo LNG project of up to approximately 4.5 bcm/year starting from the first quarter of 2024. The project and the relative offtakes will have two phases: in the first phase the Tango FLNG facility will have a liquefaction capacity of around 1 bcm/year, then a second FLNG with a capacity of around 3.5 bcm/year will begin production in 2025;\n- \u00b7 signed a 0.8 bcm/year LNG sales and purchase agreement with Merakes LNG Sellers, starting from January 2024 for 3 years. This agreement, in addition to the contract with Jangkrik LNG Sellers for 1.4 bcm/year, in place since 2017, expands the overall LNG available from Bontang facility;",

LNG  will  be  delivered  at  the  receiving  terminal 'FSRU Italia', currently located in Piombino, Italy, with expected deliveries starting from 2026 with a duration of 27 years. The LNG production in Qatar will increase by 45 bcm in addition to the current 108 bcm. This agreement expands the import portfolio from Qatar given that Eni is already importing in Europe 2.9 bcm/year since 2007.\n\nThese  new  LNG  contracts  contribute  to  the  build-up  of  the overall LNG contracted portfolio by leveraging on Eni's integrated approach in the countries where we operate and are in line with the company's energy transition strategy, which aims to progressively increase the share of gas in overall upstream production to 60% by 2030, while also increasing the contribution of equity LNG.\n\nIn  the  perspective  of  an  increasingly  greater  diversification  of LNG  supplies  and  the  expansion  of  areas  of  cooperation  and collaboration, in April, Eni and SPP, the Slovakia's largest energy supplier,  signed  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MoU)  for a commercial cooperation in the gas and LNG sector, aimed at evaluating initiatives in the areas of trading and management of  regasification  and  transportation  capacities  to  secure  and strengthen supplies of natural gas to the Slovak Republic.\n\nRegarding  the  liquefaction  activity,  during  2023,  ships  \"Tango\" Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) and \"Excalibur\" Floating Storage  Unit  (FSU)  have  been  launched  from  Dubai  towards Congolese waters. The Tango FLNG facility has a liquefaction capacity  of  about  1  bcm/year  and  is  moored  alongside  the Excalibur Floating Storage Unit (FSU) and has been initiated the introduction of gas at the floating liquefaction plant.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nIn 2023, with the aim of continuing the plan to consolidate gas supplies  in  response  to  the  energy  crisis  caused  by  the  difficult international situation, was signed an agreement with Open EP to guarantee the flow of gas from France to Switzerland and Italy in the event of interruptions or significant flow reductions from Germany. The agreement promotes the efficient use of the Swiss Transitgas transport infrastructure for gas flows from France to Italy through Switzerland to support Swiss supply security.\n\n## NATURAL GAS\n\n## Supply of natural gas\n\nEni's consolidated subsidiaries supplied 50.05 bcm of natural gas, decreased by 10.54 bcm or by 17% from the full year 2022.\n\nGas volumes supplied outside Italy from consolidated subsidiaries (44.34 bcm), imported in Italy or sold outside Italy, represented approximately 89% of total supplies, decreased by 12.85 bcm or by 23% from the full year 2022. This mainly reflected lower volumes purchased in Russia (down by 11.04 bcm), in France (down by 1.28 bcm), in Egypt (down by 0.80 bcm), in UK (down by 0.49 bcm), in Norway (down by 0.26 bcm) and in Libya (down by 0.10 bcm), partly offset by higher purchases in Qatar (up by 0.35 bcm), in Netherlands (up by 0.23 bcm), in Algeria (up by 0.20 bcm) and in Indonesia (up by 0.20 bcm). Supplies in Italy (5.71 bcm) reported an increase of 68% from the full year 2022.\n\nIn 2023, main gas volumes from equity production derived from: (i) certain Eni fields located in the British and Norwegian sections of the North Sea (2.1 bcm); (ii) Italian gas fields (1.8 bcm); (iii) Indonesia (0.9 bcm); (iv) Libyan fields (0.6 bcm). Supplied gas volumes from equity production were about 5.4 bcm representing around 11% of total volumes available for sale.",

Proprietary technologies matured within our traditional businesses are one of the drivers of our decarbonization Path and are being used to CCUS projects and the development of innovative and distinctive models related to agri-business and carbon offset initiatives.\n\n## CCUS PROJECTS\n\nWithin  the  CO 2 capture  and  storage  solutions,  Eni's  distinctive model is based on technologies and expertise of the gas reservoir and storage matured in the past, in synergy with depleted or near to depletion gas fields and partial use of existing infrastructures. Eni targets to achieve before 2030 a CO 2 gross storage capacity of over 15 mmtonnes/year and increase to approximately 40 mmtonnes/ year after 2030. Eni's portfolio CCUS project is large and in different Countries.\n\nIn Italy, the Ravenna CCS project is currently under development jointly with Snam, through a 50/50 joint venture. In particular, the project includes a Phase 1 with start-up during the second quarter of 2024 and a Phase 2 on a larger industrial scale with CO 2 injection start-up expected in the second half of the decade. In Phase 1, approximately  25,000  tonnes/year  of  CO 2 will  be  captured  from the Eni's natural gas treatment plant Casalborsetti (Ravenna) and subsequently transported to an offshore platform in the Adriatic Sea to be injected into the depleted Porto Corsini Mare Ovest gas field, operated by Eni. The Phase 2 planned a CO 2 injection capacity of 4 mmtonnes/year by 2030 to reduce CO 2 emissions, both from Eni sites and from third parties. The conversion of depleted gas fields in the Adriatic Sea into CO 2 storage sites and the reuse of some existing infrastructure will ensure very competitive CO 2 storage costs.\n\nIn November 2023, the Ravenna CCS project has been included in the European list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI Projects) as CO 2 storage and transportation infrastructure within the integrated Callisto Mediterranean CO 2 Network project (Carbon Liquefaction\n\nTransportation and Storage), developed in collaboration with Air Liquide.\n\nThe Callisto project provides for the CO 2 storage in the CCS hub in  Ravenna  from  Italian  hard-to-abate  industrial  areas,  starting with Ravenna and Ferrara, and from the Marseille Fos in France, promoting the creation of a CCS value chain in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean basin.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there are two ongoing Eni's development projects and concerned the CCS storage hubs of HyNet North West and the Bacton Thames Net Zero. The two projects will significantly contribute to achieve the decarbonization goals define by the UK Government with expected CO 2 capture and storage target of 20-30 mmtonnes/year in 2030 for the CCS projects.\n\nThe HyNet North West integrated project targets to decarbonize the industrial area of the north west England and north Wales by means of the capture, transportation and storage of CO 2 emitted by existing local  hard-to-abate  industrial  activities  and  future  low  carbon hydrogen production. In this project Eni operates the transportation and storage of CO 2 and will convert and reuse of its offshore depleted fields and part of existing infrastructures in the Liverpool Bay. The project has been selected by the UK authorities between the two priority CCS projects (Track 1) and start-up is expected in the second half of the decade with CO 2 injected volumes of 4.5 mmtonnes/year in the first phase and increasing up to 10 mmtonnes/year after 2030. In March 2023 the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero  (DESNZ)  has  selected  8  priorities  CO 2 capture projects to access the funds allocated by the UK Government to support CCS initiatives. Out of the 8 selected projects, 5 belong to emitters of the HyNet North West Consortium for an overall CO 2 storage emissions volumes of 3 mmtonnes/year.\n\nIn October 2023, Eni finalized with the UK Government's Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) the head of term of the business model for the CO 2 transportation and storage (T&S) of the HyNet project. The Final Agreements and the subsequent issue of the T&S commercial license is expected by 2024.\n\nFinally, in December 2023 DESNZ launched the Track 1 Expansion program to select, in the second half of 2024, additional CO 2 capture projects to be linked to the HyNet cluster by 2030 to fill the storage capacity of 4.5 mmtonnes/year expected in the first development phase and to identify potential emitters to support the HyNet future expansion of storage volumes after 2030.\n\nThe Bacton Thames Net Zero project provides for the CO 2 storage into  the  depleted  Hewett  gas  fields  and  was  launched  by  Eni  in November  2022  with  the  Bacton  Thames  Net  Zero  Cooperation Agreement including 13 industrial partners in hard-to-abate sectors. Within the agreement Eni operates the T&S phase and supports the industrial emitters. The project is strategically positioned to contribute to the decarbonisation of the South East UK and the London industrial area, as well as European industrial sites.\n\nIn  August  2023  the  UK  North  Sea  Transition  Authority  (NSTA) awarded to Eni UK an exploration license for the CO 2 storage into the depleted Hewett gas field, in the Bacton offshore area.",

This model with end-to-end approach targets to ensure volumes of vegetable oil at competitive cost to support the expansion of Eni's biorefining activities with significant positive impacts on local development and employment.\n\nIn  this  context,  Eni  finalized  agreements  with  the  Authorities  and various  partners  in  Kenya,  Congo,  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire,  Angola,  Rwanda, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, Italy, Kazakhstan and Vietnam.\n\nAccording to the model, production is entirely delegated to local farmers for the cultivation of oil plants on their own land or deriving from the collection of waste and residues from agro-industrial sector. Eni processes the raw materials received to produce vegetable oil by means the construction of oil collection and extraction centers (agrihubs) or using existing third-party ones, relating to the industrial maturity of the production country.\n\nThe vegetable oil's byproducts are recovered and transformed into feed and fertilizers with positive impacts on the food security in these countries.\n\nEni's  agri-feedstock  initiatives  allow  significant  environmental  and socio-economic benefits targeting the restoration of many hectares of abandoned and degraded land also trough farmers' supporting with high quality oilseeds, agricultural inputs, and the best agricultural practices  adoption;  and  the  local  development  by  means  of  job creation, access to new market opportunities and additional income as well as training programs.\n\nEni's agri-feedstock supply chains are certified according to the ISCCEU (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification) sustainability scheme,  one  of  the  main  voluntary  standards  recognized  by  the European Commission for the certification of biofuels (EU RED II).\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nMain targets reached during 2023 within these initiatives are: (i) in Kenya,  the  second  agri-hub  was  launched  ensuring  to  achieve  a vegetable oil capacity of 70 ktons/year. The project involved currently approximately 80 thousand farmers and the cultivation of more than 40 thousand hectares in 2023; (ii) in Congo, where Eni realized the first agri-hub with a capacity of 30 ktons/year. The agri-feedstock initiatives will develop a family farming to promote the transfer of skills and knowhow and to support the knowledge development in the country, in the agro-industrial and food sectors; (iii) in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the agri-feedstock initiatives are focused on the valorization of the agricultural and forestry waste, such as rubber seeds from plantations already on the country. Production  of  the  first  vegetable  oil  was  achieved  in  October  2023; (iv) in Mozambique, Eni realized some pilot projects promoting castor cultivation with smallholder farmers and the agro-industrial residues valorization. Production of the first vegetable oil was achieved during in 2023 leveraging on existing third-party plant; and (v) in Italy, project in partnership with Bonifiche Ferraresi progressed. The project plans the cultivation of energy crops in rotation and cover crops.\n\nOther initiatives concerned programs in Angola where the cultivation of  pilot  fields  was  started  with  smallholder  farmers  and  local  agroindustrial companies; in Rwanda where ongoing programs concerned high value-added initiatives and sharing know-how to produce oilseeds for Eni's agri-feedstock initiatives in other African countries; and in Vietnam, where new collaboration and pilot project were launched to valorize rubber cultivation residues.\n\nIn 2023 training agri-feedstock activities of farmers, start-up and local stakeholders progressed in the African countries. In this context, Eni continued its collaboration with the United Nations Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), to facilitate dialogue and sharing of experiences on the acceleration of the energy transition and the development of renewable energy and launched a new collaboration with the International Labour Organization (ILO), to improve safety and health of smallholder farmers for Eni's agro-industrial initiatives in Kenya and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\n\n## CARBON OFFSET INITIATIVES\n\nThese  initiatives  are  expected  to  achieve  a  carbon  credits portfolio to offset residual emissions for less than 25 million tons of CO 2 in 2050.\n\n## NATURAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS\n\nWithin the Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) area, starting from 2019 Eni launched the forest protection, conservation and sustainable",

The forest projects are considered the most significant at internationally level within climate change mitigation strategies. These projects are framed in the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) scheme. The REDD+ scheme was designed by the United Nations (in particular within the UNFCCC - United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and involves conservation forest activities to reduce emissions and improve the natural storage capacity of CO 2 , as well as supporting, with a different development model, the local communities through socio-economic projects,  in  line  with  sustainable  management,  forest  protection and  biodiversity  conservation.  In  this  scheme,  Eni's  protection forest activities support national governments, local communities and UN agencies in the REDD+ strategies, in line with the NDCs (Nationally  Determined  Contributions)  and  National  Development Plans and, mainly, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of UN. Eni built solid partnerships over time with recognized international developers of REDD+ projects that allows to oversee every phase of the projects, from the design to the implementation up to verify the reduction emissions, with an active role in the governance of the project. The Eni's role is essential to allow the alignment with the REDD+ scheme and also with highest standards for certification of  the  carbon  emissions  reduction  (Verified  Carbon  Standard  VCS) and social and environmental effects (Climate Community & Biodiversity Standards - CCB), internationally recognized.\n\nMain initiatives in the forest protection and conservation supported by Eni are Luangwa Community Forest Project (LCFP) and Lower Zambezi  REDD+  Project  (LZRP)  and  Kafue  in  Zambia,  Kulera  in Malawi, Ntakata Mountains and Makame in Tanzania, Mai Ndombe in  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo,  Limpopo  REDD+  Project in Mozambique and Amigos de Calakmul in Mexico. In 2023 Eni achieved allowance of carbon credits by the projects to offset GHG emissions equivalent to about 3.3 million tons of CO 2 . Eni continues\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nto  evaluate  further  NCS  initiatives  in  restoration  and  sustainable management ecosystems in Africa, Latin America, and Asia.\n\n## TECHNOLOGICAL PROJECTS\n\nThe technological application in different areas is one of the levers in  the  residual  emission  reduction.  In  particular,  Eni  launched projects to promote the Improved Cookstoves (ICS) distribution. This clean cooking systems ensure a reduction of more than 60% in woody biomass used by households targeting to improve health conditions and promote forest conservation. The program started in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Congo, Mozambique, Angola and Rwanda and is being evaluated the expansion in other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In addition to the positive impact on health and the environment, the industrial approach to the access to clean cooking allows to promote the development of local entrepreneurship and economy. To this end, these initiatives are particularly based on the development of local solutions both for the stoves production and for the subsequent distribution. In particular: (i) in Mozambique, two new projects were launched in 2023. It is expected that 300,000 families from suburbs of Maputo and two central districts of the Country will benefitted from these projects; (ii) in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the distribution of ICS, launched in 2022, achieved 60,000 ICS at the end of 2023. All stoves are produced by a local star-up supported by Eni in the improvement and production industrialization targeting to involve at least 450,000 families in the next 7 years with the opening of a production hub in the center and west of the Country; (iii) in Congo, project started in 2023 and is expected to cover in 6 years the entirely people need in the Brazzavile and Pointe Noire cities; (iv) in Angola, the distribution of 200,000 ICS in the Luanda, Benguela, Huambo, Cuanza Norte and Cuanza Sul districts was launched; and (v) in Rwanda, the distribution of 250,000 ICS was launched starting from the Nyagatare district.",

The  company  is  engaged  in biorefining activities, biomethane production, smart mobility solutions, including Enjoy car sharing, as well as in marketing and distribution of all energy sources for mobility. Through over 5,000 service stations in Europe, Enilive is aimed to provide services and products progressively decarbonized for the energy transition, accelerating the path to the reduction of emissions among their entire life cycle. The wide range of  products  is  processed  in  several  plants,  including  biorefineries in Venice, Gela and Louisiana (USA), as well as, 22 plants for the production of biomethane in Italy. In addition projects are ongoing to realize new biorefineries in Italy and South East Asia.\n\n## DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BIOREFINING BUSINESS\n\nIn line with the decarbonization strategy and the transformation plan for traditional refineries, in 2023 Eni reached significant achievements through the finalization of several agreements and partnerships. In particular:\n\n- \u00b7  finalized the 50-50 joint venture between Enilive and PBF Energy Inc. (PBF) in St. Bernard Renewables LLC (SBR), a biorefinery co-located with the Refinery of Chalmette in Louisiana (USA). The biorefinery entered in operation with a total processing capacity of about 1.1 million tons/year of raw materials with complete pretreatment capabilities. In the second half of 2023, were processed 204 ktons of products;\n- \u00b7  signed with LG Chem a joint venture agreement, a further step towards  the  final  investment  decision  for  the  project  of  a  new biorefinery in South Korea. The target is to complete the plant by 2026 and to process about 400 ktons of biogenic raw materials using  Eni's  Ecofining  technology  to  make  several  products available, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel, HVO-Diesel biofuel and bionaphtha. The final investment decision is expected by 2024;\n- \u00b7   started a collaboration between Eni, Euglena and Petronas to evaluate the  economic  feasibility  of  construction  and  management  of  a biorefinery in Malaysia in the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) which will enter into operation by 2025. The expected processing capacity of the biorefinery is about 650 ktons/y with a production capacity of biofuels expected up to 12,500 barrels/d, processed from raw materials, not in competition with the food chain;\n- \u00b7  confirmed the decision for the realization of a third biorefinery in Italy at Livorno site, with a capacity of 500 ktons/y. The project, pending the completion of the authorization process, refers to the construction of a unit for the biogenic pretreatment, an Ecofining system and a plant for the production of hydrogen from methane gas. Completion and start-up are expected by 2026;\n- \u00b7  signed an agreement with Saipem aimed at the study and possible construction of plants for the production of biojet, sustainable fuel for aviation, and HVO-Diesel, produced 100% from renewable raw materials.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\n## SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY INITIATIVES\n\nIn order to develop and widespread the use of HVOlution diesel, the first  Enilive  biodiesel  produced  from  100% renewable raw materials (waste raw materials, vegetable residues and oils generated from crops not competing with the food chain), important agreements with several partners were finalized. In particular:\n\n- \u00b7  as part of the path to decarbonize transport and mobility, Enilive and the Spinelli Group, leader in the integrated logistics sector, signed a two-year contract to supply the fleet of the Spinelli Group with HVOlution. The supply of biofuel to the Spinelli Group is realized leveraging on the network of Enilive stores;\n- \u00b7  signed with RINA, a multinational company engaged in inspection, certification and engineering consultancy, an important agreement to develop the use of HVO produced by Eni in the biorefineries of Venice and Gela and other energy sources in the marine sector. The agreement also provides initiatives in order to reduce CO 2 emissions among the entire value chain;\n- \u00b7  in  line  with  the  development  of  the  decarbonization  projects addressed to the aviation segment, Kenya Airways made its first flight  with  the  SAF  (Sustainable  Aviation  Fuel)  by  Enilive.  JetA1 conventional fuel is blended with Eni Biojet produced by the Livorno refinery through the distillation of bio-components produced in the biorefinery of Gela;\n- \u00b7  Enilive signed an agreement for the supply and use of HVOlution towards  the  Azimut-Benetti  Group.  This  is  the  first  agreement relating to the yachting industry aimed at decarbonization of the nautical sector;\n- \u00b7  finally, Enilive signed a Letter of Intent with Ryanair for a long-term supply of sustainable aviation fuel in some airports in Italy where the airline operates. This agreement will allow Ryanair to access up to 100 ktons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) between 2025 and 2030.\n\n## SMART MOBILITY\n\nIn line with Enilive's strategy addressed to increase services supplied to customers, the car sharing service \"Enjoy\" already active in free floating  mode  in  the  cities  of  Milan,  Rome,  Turin,  Bologna  and Florence, starting from November 2023, has been extended to the city of Padua with Enjoy Point mode, which includes the activation and the end of rental at dedicated sales points.\n\nIn  September  2023,  the  first  'ALT  Stazione  del  Gusto'  station was  inaugurated  in  Rome.  It  is  the  first  restaurant  of  Enilive  in collaboration  with  'Niko  Romito  Academy'.  Enilive  confirms  its commitment to renew and expand services supplied in its over 5,000 stores in Europe, transforming Eni stations into \"mobility points\" able to meet the increasing customers' needs. The partnership includes a development plan, also through franchising, with the target of reaching 100 openings in the next four years.",

Eni Rewind, through its integrated end-to-end model, guarantees the supervision of every phase of the process reclamation and waste management, planning projects from the early stages to enhance and reuse resources (soils, water, waste), making them available for new development opportunities.\n\n## STRATEGICALLY RELEVANT INITIATIVES\n\nOn June 30, 2023, Eni Rewind acquired 30% of the share capital of Labanalysis Environmental Science, a leading company in the field of environmental analysis, with the aim of strengthening the integrated offering  of  environmental  services  to  be  proposed  in  the  foreign market and consolidating its presence in a fundamental sector for the correct direction of environmental remediation solutions and waste management.\n\nIn  July  2023,  Eni  and  Edison  signed  an  agreement  establishing collaboration between the two companies for the management of environmental remediation projects at all industrial sites transferred in 1989 from Montedison to Enimont. The agreement will regulate the equal economic contribution for remediation interventions, already initiated  by  Eni  Rewind  and  Versalis,  in  execution  of  the  projects decreed  by  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment.  The  implementation of  the  agreement  on  a  site-by-site  basis,  along  with  the  related planning activities, cost sharing, and relations with institutions, will be coordinated by a joint technical-legal committee between the two companies.\n\n## RECLAMATION ACTIVITIES\n\nBased on the expertise gained and in agreement with the Authorities and stakeholders, Eni Rewind identifies projects for the enhancement\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nand reuse of remediated areas, allowing for the environmental recovery of former industrial sites and the revitalization of the local economy. Eni Rewind operates in 17 sites of national priority and over 100 sites of regional priority, consolidating in recent years its role as a global contractor  for  all  Eni  businesses.  Among  the  main  remediation projects  at  owned  sites,  interventions  particularly  stand  out  at: Assemini, Avenza, Brindisi, Cengio, Crotone, Gela, Porto Marghera, Porto Torres, Priolo, and Ravenna.\n\nThe Ponticelle Project in Ravenna, where Eni Rewind is committed to enhance the abandoned industrial area through Permanent Safety Measures of the site and the design of targeted improvements for the industrial  requalification,  is  particularly  relevant.  Planned  activities relate to the construction of a multifunctional platform for the preprocessing of waste in partnership with Herambiente and a biorecovery platform (biopile) for land to be reused in service stations after remediation, reducing landfilling disposal and consumption of vergin resources.\n\nIn this regard, it is noted that in June 2023, the Regional Single Authorizing Provision (PAUR) was obtained for the construction of treatment platforms (Eni Rewind Platform for the bio-recovery of soils at a capacity of 80,000 tons/year and a polyfunctional platform at a capacity of 60,000 tons/year developed by HEA, a joint venture with Herambiente), and subsequently, the relevant tender contracts were awarded. Primary urbanization works are underway, and the construction of the photovoltaic plant by Plenitude for green energy production has been initiated. The primary urbanization works are currently underway, and the construction of the photovoltaic plant\n\nby Plenitude for the production of green energy has been initiated. In addition, important progress has been made in the permitting process of the 'Viggiano Blue Water' project during 2023, which will allow the treatment of up to 1,700 cubic meters per day of produced water within the extraction activity in Val d'Agri. In Porto Marghera, Eni Rewind has submitted the PAUR application to build a drying plant aimed at the energy recovery of sludge from the purification of civil wastewater. In the context of circular economy, the facility will be located in a certified environmental intervention area owned by Eni, with the triple objective of enabling its reuse through industrial redevelopment, avoiding the consumption of new land, and benefiting from the existing infrastructure, services, and utilities on-site.",

During 2023, the project of automation and digitalization of groundwater treatment plants progressed as a part of a larger optimization initiative,  in  order  to  increase  business  competitiveness  and sustainability, quality of work and process security. The main drivers of the optimization project are represented by the implementation of optimized operational model for plant management, leveraging on the technological enhancement of San Donato Milanese Control Room and the digitalization of its related sites.\n\nAnother area of digitization is that of the maintenance process, which has seen the adoption of specific maintenance management software.\n\nCurrently,  there  are  44  treatment  plants  fully  in  operation  and managed  in  Italy,  with  over  35  million  cubic  meters  of  treated water in 2023. The recovery and reuse of treated water for the production of demineralized water for industrial use and as part of the operational plans for the remediation of contaminated sites is undergoing. In 2023 about 9 million cubic meters of water have been reused after treatment.\n\nAt the end of 2023, completed the installation of 60 devices using the proprietary technology E-Hyrec \u00ae for the selective removal of hydrocarbons from groundwater to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of groundwater reclamation, with significant reductions in extraction times and avoiding the disposal of more than 3,000 tons of waste equivalent.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nEni Rewind also operates as Eni's competence center for management of waste deriving from Eni's environmental remediation activities and production activities in Italy, thanks to its model allowing to minimize costs and environmental impacts, by adopting the best technological solutions available on the market.\n\nIn 2023, Eni Rewind managed a total of approximately 1.5 million tonnes of waste by sending for recovery or disposal at external plants.\n\nIn  particular,  the  recovery  index  (ratio  of  recovered/recoverable waste) in 2023 was 75%: the slight increase compared to 2022 (74%) is due to the qualitative and particle size characteristics of  the  reclamation  waste,  detected  during  characterization, notwithstanding  the  consistency  of  used  equipped  plants  with technologies available for recovery did not increase. Out of the total indicated volumes, the portion managed on behalf of Eni's clients amounts to approximately 79%.\n\n## CERTIFICATION\n\nEni Rewind holds SOA Certification, the mandatory certification for participation in tenders to execute public works contracts with a basic auction amount exceeding \u20ac150,000.00, for its core activities in the OG 12 - Reclamation and protection works and plants environmental and  in  the  specialized  categories  OS  22  -  Drinking  water  and purification plants and OS 14 - Waste disposal and recovery plants.\n\nDuring 2023, the company obtained the VIII Class - unlimited for the SOA Category OS 22, which joins similar rankings already obtained for OG 12 and OS 14.",

In particular, in  January  2023,  was  signed  a  contract  between  Anas  and  the Temporary Business Grouping (RTI), where Eni Rewind is the lead company, to carry out investigation and characterization services in the Adriatic Lot. The activity has a four-year duration.\n\nIn March 2023, was signed a contract between Kuwait Petroleum International (KPI) and the Temporary Business Grouping (RTI), where Eni Rewind acts as the lead company for the remediation of the former plant in Naples (Areas Ex Refinery, Ex Chemical and Via Del Pezzo), which is part of the National Interest Site of Eastern Naples. Eni  Rewind  is  responsible  for  the  design  activities,  environmental analysis, and the supply, installation, and management of the thermal desorption plant used for the remediation of the land.\n\nIn May 2023, the renewal contract with Acciaierie d'Italia was acquired, which  will  further  enhance  Eni  Rewind's  distinctive  expertise  in hydrogeological modeling and environmental engineering ongoing at the National Interest Site of Taranto.\n\nIn  July  2023,  Eni  Rewind  entered  a  contract  with  Edison  for  the remediation of soil and groundwater at the former Montedison sites in Crotone. This contract adds to a similar agreement already made for the Mantova areas in 2020.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nAlso, in the month of July, a contract was finalized between Eni Rewind and Roma Capitale regarding the feasibility study for the remediation of the Tor Fiscale quarry area.\n\nIn September 2023, the RTI, in which Eni Rewind participates as the lead company, was awarded the tenders issued by Invitalia for the Remediation of the Bagnoli Site, Lot I and Lot II. Eni Rewind's activities include detailed design, environmental analysis, and on-site thermal desorption operations for the remediation of the land.\n\nIn October 2023, Eni Rewind participated as lead company in the RTI, along with other leading companies in the sector, in the tender for the Permanent Safety Measures of the Malagrotta Landfill in Rome, the largest waste disposal site in Europe.\n\n## ENI REWIND OUTSIDE ITALY\n\nSince 2018, Eni Rewind has been making its expertise available to Eni's subsidiaries, located outside Italy, to manage environmental issues, in particular for management and enhancement activities of the water resource, soil, as well as training and knowledge sharing. In  2023,  in  support  of  the  subsidiary  Eni  Kenya  BV,  Eni  Rewind conducted a feasibility study aimed at assessing the potential for biogas production in five urban waste landfills located in Kenya. The feasibility study concluded in October, and discussions with local Authorities are ongoing to define the next steps of the project. As part of the new mandate for the remediation of service stations entered with Eni Live effective from January 1st, 2023, the support of Eni Rewind has been envisaged in the design phase of environmental interventions, including the remediation of service stations within the European network.",

In 2023, crude oil prices averaged 83 $/bbl and declined by 18% compared to the average of 101 $/bbl recorded in 2022, featuring another year of highly volatile with larger decrease and short-lived rebounds due to economic trends and geopolitical developments such as the resurge of tensions in Middle East culminating in Israelis military invasion of the Gaza strip. Natural gas prices in Europe experienced a deeper correction than that of crude oil amidst massive volatility, as they were down by over 60% on average in 2023 compared to 2022. This decline was driven by a milder-than-usual winter season, the increase in US natural gas production that has repeatedly broken record after record, fueling  massive  export  volumes  thanks  to  rising  liquefaction capacity and a corresponding economic and financial increases in\n\nLNG terminals in Europe, ongoing economic slowdown, growing\n\ncompetition from renewables as well as adequate storage levels.\n\nIn the chemical business, weak market fundamentals were due\n\nto low dynamics in European demand, competitive pressure from\n\ngeographies with competitive cost structure as well as deepening\n\nstructural  weaknesses  in  European  chemicals  linked  to  high\n\nenergy costs and environmental obligations.\n\nThe Enilive and Refining segment benefited from still generally\n\nfavorable market conditions in 2023 after the record year of 2022,\n\nthanks to the positive trend in fuel demand driven in particular by\n\nthe civil aviation and road transport segments, bottlenecks in the\n\nsystem/delays in start-ups and significantly gas prices reduction.\n\nThe Standard Eni Refining Margin in 2023 was still historically\n\nstrong  and  reported  an  average  of  approximately  10  $/barrel\n\n(up 19% from 2022). However, it is noted that under the current\n\ncircumstances  of  narrowing  differentials  between  heavy/sour\n\ncrudes vs. lighter/sweet grades and product crack spreads, the\n\nSERM does not entirely capture the effective refining margin.",

In particular, the breakdown by business segment is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 E&P  reported  an  adjusted  operating  profit  of  \u20ac9.9  billion,  a decrease of 40% compared to 2022, affected by weaker realized prices, partly offset by the higher hydrocarbon production, up by 3% compared to 2022;\n- \u00b7 GGP adjusted operating profit was a record \u20ac3.2 billion, up by 57% compared to 2022, driven by an optimized natural gas & LNG portfolio and contract renegotiations benefits;\n- \u00b7 Enilive achieved financial and operational targets delivering an adjusted operating profit of \u20ac0.73 billion, up by 8% compared to 2022, benefitting from a resilient Marketing performance, and expanding its international presence by purchasing of a 50% interest in the Chalmette biorefinery in the United States;\n- \u00b7 Refining business reported an adjusted operating profit decreasing by  70%,  due  to  narrowing  differentials  between  heavy/sour\n\n## Breakdown of special items\n\nAdjusted net profit includes special items consisting of net charges of \u20ac3,149 million, mainly relating to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the accounting effect of certain fair-valued commodity derivatives lacking the formal criteria to be classified as hedges or to be elected under the own use exemption (net charges of \u20ac1,255 million) and to a lower extent, some derivatives part of a general annual hedging program prorated over the 2023 quarters;\n- \u00b7 impairment  losses  of  upstream  business  recorded  at  certain Italian gas properties driven by lower natural gas prices and at certain oil and gas USA properties following reserve revisions (\u20ac1,037 million);\n- \u00b7 impairment  losses  of  chemical  plants  to  reflect  a  reduced profitability  outlook  following  a  worsening  trading  environment (\u20ac405 million);\n- \u00b7 the write-down of capital expenditures made for compliance and stay-in-business at certain CGU with expected negative cash flows in the Refining business (\u20ac359 million);\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nvs. light/sweet crude qualities due to the shortage of the heavy crudes  supply  resulting  from  the  sanctions  regime  against Russian Ural crude and OPEC production cuts;\n\n- \u00b7 Versalis, impacted by a slowdown in the macro environment and comparatively higher production costs in Europe for energy inputs and reported the adjusted operating loss of \u20ac0.61 billion in 2023;\n- \u00b7 Plenitude & Power reported an adjusted operating profit of \u20ac0.68 billion, up by 11% compared to 2022, thanks to good results on retail business and to the ramp-up in renewable installed capacity equal to 3 GW at the end of 2023.\n\nFor a detailed disclosure on businesses performance, see the paragraph 'Results by business segments'. In 2023, the Group reported an adjusted net profit of \u20ac8,322 million, a decrease of \u20ac5 billion compared to 2022, due to lower operating profit and results from associates, partly offset by decreasing  financial  expenses  mainly  driven  by  the  positive effect of a declining yield curve on the fair value of financial assets held for trading at year end, as well as by higher interest income due to increased average interest rates on cash deposit balances  for  the  year  compared  to  the  effect  on  fixed-rate financial liabilities.\n\n- \u00b7 environmental charges (\u20ac648 million) mainly related to the progress of remediation and decommissioning activities on certain industrial sites and ancillary facilities;\n- \u00b7 the difference between the value of gas inventories accounted for under  the  weighted-average  cost  method  provided  by  IFRS  and management's own measure of inventories, which moves forward at the time of inventory drawdown, the margins captured on volumes in inventories above normal levels leveraging the seasonal spread in gas prices net of the effects of the associated commodity derivatives (charges of \u20ac655 million);\n- \u00b7 provision for redundancy incentives (\u20ac158 million);\n- \u00b7 credit loss provisions in the upstream business (\u20ac129 million);\n- \u00b7 a gain of \u20ac834 million (including the fair value evaluation of stake retained in the company) in connection to the sale of a 49.9% stake in the equity interests of Eni's subsidiaries managing the TTPC/Transmed pipelines and the relevant transportation rights of natural gas volumes imported from Algeria following the agreement with Snam SpA.",

This trend is due to the effect of the fall in oil prices (Brent price decreased by 18%, from 101 $/bbl in 2022 to 83 $/bbl in 2023) and in gas prices (in Italy and Europe gas spot prices reduced by over 60%), impacted by the economic slowdown  in  Europe,  uncertainties  about  China's  recovery  and OPEC+ productive management initiatives.\n\nThe Chemical business has been affected by weak fundamentals connected  to  the  lack  of  dynamism  in  European  demand  and competitive  pressure  from  geographies  with  competitive  cost\n\nstructure.  The  Enilive  and  Refining  segment  benefitted  from  still generally favourable market conditions after 2022, a record year, thanks to the positive trend in fuel demand and the significant reduction in the cost of gas. These positives were offset by the reduction of the spread between heavy and light crude and by product crack spreads, in particular the decrease of gasoil profitability, impacted by the slowdown of the industrial activity. The retail gas and power was affected by reduced market demand and lower consumptions.\n\nOther  income  and  revenues amounting  to  \u20ac1,099  million  were broadly  unchanged  from  2022  and  include  the  share  of  lease repayments debited to joint operators in Eni-led upstream projects (\u20ac121  million),  as  well  as  revenues  from  patents,  licenses  and royalties.\n\n## OPERATING EXPENSES\n\n|                                                                              | (\u20ac million)   | 2023   | 2022    | 2021   | Change   | % Ch.   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------|---------|--------|----------|---------|\n| Purchases, services and other                                                |               | 73,836 | 102,529 | 55,549 | (28,693) | (28.0)  |\n| Impairment losses (impairment reversals) of trade and other receivables, net |               | 249    | (47)    | 279    | 296      | ..      |\n| Payroll and related costs                                                    |               | 3,136  | 3,015   | 2,888  | 121      | 4.0     |\n| of which: provision for redundancy incentives and other                      |               | 258    | 202     | 193    |          |         |\n|                                                                              |               | 77,221 | 105,497 | 58,716 | (28,276) | (26.8)  |\n\nOperating  expenses  for  2023  (\u20ac77,221  million)  decreased  by \u20ac28,276 million from 2022, down by 26.8%. Purchases, services and other (\u20ac73,836 million) decreased by 28% compared to 2022 mainly reflecting lower hydrocarbon supply costs (gas under long-\n\nsupply  contracts  and  refinery  and  chemical  feedstocks). Payroll and related costs (\u20ac3,136 million) increased from 2022 (up by \u20ac121 million, or 4%) mainly due to the extraordinary Group employees benefit plan in Italy, implemented at the end of 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT",

This reduction is mainly driven by the reduction of lower finance expense related to net borrowings (up \u20ac452 million) due to the positive effect of a declining yield curve on the fair value of financial assets held for trading at year end (up \u20ac303 million), as well as by higher interest\n\nincome due to increased average interest rates on cash deposit balances for the year compared to the effect on fixed-rate financial liabilities (net effect of \u20ac220 million). These positives were partly offset by the negative change in fair valued interest rate derivatives (\u20ac79 million) lacking the formal criteria to be designated as hedges under IFRS 9.\n\n## NET INCOME (EXPENSE) FROM INVESTMENTS\n\n| 2023                                                      | (\u20ac million)   | Exploration  & Production   | Global  Gas & LNG  Portfolio   | Enilive,  Refining and  Chemicals   | Plenitude  & Power Corporate  and other  activities   | Group   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Share of gains (losses) from equity-accounted investments |               | 1,009                       | 49 343                         | (55)                                | (10)                                                  | 1,336   |\n| Dividends                                                 |               | 194                         |                                | 60                                  | 1                                                     | 255     |\n| Net gains (losses) on disposals                           |               | 8                           | 420                            | 2                                   |                                                       | 430     |\n| Other income (expense), net                               |               | (1)                         | 444                            | (13)                                | (7)                                                   | 423     |\n|                                                           |               | 1,210                       | 913 392                        | (55)                                | (16)                                                  | 2,444   |\n\nNet income from investments amounted to \u20ac2,444 million and related to:\n\n- \u00b7 gains  due  to  the  share  of  results  from  equity-accounted investments (\u20ac1,336 million) mainly relating to the JV V\u00e5r Energi, Azule and ADNOC Refinery, as well as Eni's share of the Saipem joint venture results;\n- \u00b7  dividends of \u20ac255 million paid by minor investments in certain entities which were designated at fair value through OCI under IFRS  9  except  for  dividends  which  are  recorded  through  profit.\n\nThese entities mainly comprised Nigeria LNG (\u20ac179 million) and Saudi European Petrochemical Co.

On an adjusted basis, the tax rate stabilized at around 44%.",

These negative trends were partly offset by positive volumes/mix effects.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nAdjusted operating profit excluded special items of \u20ac1,385 million. The segment reported an adjusted net profit of \u20ac5,516 million, down by 49% compared to 2022, due to lower operating performance and results at JV and associates.\n\nIn  2023  tax  rate  increased  by  over  9  percentage  points  when compared to 2022 due to: (i) the impact of lower oil and gas prices; (ii) the impact of the UK Energy Profit Levy which is recognized as a recurring item (effective from the the third quarter of 2022); and (iii) the impact of certain non-deductible tax expenses (i.e. exploration write-offs).\n\n## GLOBAL GAS & LNG PORTFOLIO\n\n|                                                 | 2023   | 2022    | 2021   | Change   | % Ch.   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|----------|---------|\n| Operating profit (loss)                         | 2,431  | 3,730   | 899    | (1,299)  | (34.8)  |\n| Exclusion of special items:                     | 816    | (1,667) | (319)  | 2,483    |         |\n| - impairment losses (impairment reversals), net | (1)    | (12)    | 26     | 11       |         |\n| - provision for redundancy incentives           | 4      | 4       | 5      |          |         |\n| - commodity derivatives                         | 97     | (1,805) | (207)  | 1,902    |         |\n| - exchange rate differences and derivatives     | (105)  | 244     | 206    | (349)    |         |\n| - other                                         | 821    | (98)    | (349)  | 919      |         |\n| Adjusted operating profit (loss)                | 3,247  | 2,063   | 580    | 1,184    | 57.4    |\n| Net finance (expense) income (a)                | 1      | (17)    | (17)   | 18       |         |\n| Net income (expense) from investments (a)       | 49     | 4       |        | 45       |         |\n| of which: SeaCorridor                           | 49     |         |        | 49       |         |\n| Income taxes (a)                                | (924)  | (1,068) | (394)  | 144      |         |\n| Adjusted net profit (loss)                      | 2,373  | 982     | 169    | 1,391    |         |\n\n(a) Excluding special items.\n\nIn 2023, the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio segment achieved an adjusted operating profit of \u20ac3,247 million representing an increase of \u20ac1,184 million  or  up  by  57%  compared  to  2022,  driven  by  an  optimized natural gas & LNG portfolio and contract renegotiations benefits while maintaining stability and reliability of supplies to European markets and\n\ncompensating for the reduction of Russian volumes.

These increases were partly offset by negative exchange rate translation differences (the periodend exchange rate of EUR vs. USD was 1.105, up by 4% compared\n\nto 1.067 as of December 31, 2022) and DD&A, impairment charges and write-offs.\n\nThe  increase  in  'Right  of  use'  refers  to  the  FLNG  development projects in Congo and Baleine, offshore C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\n\nNet working capital (-\u20ac13,398 million) decreased by \u20ac194 million from December 31, 2022. The lower value of oil, natural gas and product inventories due to the weighted-average cost method of accounting in an environment of declining prices (down by \u20ac1,523 million) as well as an increase in other current liabilities net (down by \u20ac1,208 million) due to fair value changes of derivative instruments were partly offset by a decreased balance between trade receivables and trade payables (up by \u20ac1,924 million).",

It  enables  investors  to understand the connection existing between changes in cash and cash equivalents (deriving from the statutory cash flows statement) and  in  net  borrowings  (deriving  from  the  summarized  cash  flow statement) that occurred in the reporting period. The measure which links the two statements is represented by the 'free cash flow' which is  calculated as difference between the cash flow generated from operations and the net cash used in investing activities. Starting from\n\nfree cash flow it is possible to determine either: (i) changes in cash and cash equivalents for the period by adding/deducting cash flows relating to financing debts/receivables (issuance/repayment of debt and receivables related to financing activities), shareholders' equity (dividends paid, net repurchase of own shares, capital issuance) and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences;  and  (ii)  change  in  net  borrowings  for  the  period  by adding/deducting cash flows relating to shareholders' equity and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences.\n\n## SUMMARIZED GROUP CASH FLOW STATEMENT (a)\n\n|                                                                                                    | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | Change   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| Net profit (loss)                                                                                  | 4,860   | 13,961  | 5,840   | (9,101)  |\n| Adjustments to reconcile net profit (loss) to net cash provided by operating activities:           |         |         |         |          |\n| -

Furthermore, in determining the business segments' adjusted results, finance charges on finance debt and interest income are excluded (see below).\n\nIn determining adjusted results, inventory holding gains or losses are  excluded  from  base  business  performance,  which  is  the difference between the cost of sales of the volumes sold in the period based on the cost of supplies of the same period and the cost of sales of the volumes sold calculated using the weighted average cost method of inventory accounting as required by IFRS, except in those business segments where inventories are utilized as a lever to optimize margins.\n\nFinally, the same special charges/gains are excluded from the Eni's share of results at JVs and other equity accounted entities, including any profit/loss on inventory holding.\n\nManagement is disclosing Non-GAAP measures of performance to facilitate a comparison of base business performance across periods, and to allow financial analysts to evaluate Eni's trading performance on the basis of their forecasting models.\n\nNon-GAAP  financial  measures  should  be  read  together  with information determined by applying IFRS and do not stand in for them. Other companies may adopt different methodologies to determine Non-GAAP measures.\n\nFollows  the  description  of  the  main  alternative  performance measures adopted by Eni. The measures reported below refer to the performance of the reporting periods disclosed in this press release.\n\n## Adjusted operating and net profit\n\nAdjusted operating profit  and  adjusted  net  profit  are  determined by excluding inventory holding gains or losses, special items and, in  determining  the  business  segments'  adjusted  results,  finance charges  on  finance  debt  and  interest  income.  The  adjusted operating  profit  of  each  business  segment  reports  gains  and losses on derivative financial instruments entered into to manage exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which\n\nimpact industrial margins and translation of commercial payables and  receivables.  Accordingly,  also  currency  translation  effects recorded  through  profit  and  loss  are  reported  within  business segments'  adjusted  operating  profit.  The  taxation  effect  of  the items excluded from adjusted operating or net profit is determined\n\nbased on the specific rate of taxes applicable to each of them.\n\nFinance charges or income related to net borrowings excluded from the adjusted net profit of business segments are comprised of interest charges on finance debt and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents not related to operations. Therefore, the adjusted net profit of business segments includes finance charges  or  income  deriving  from  certain  segment  operated assets, i.e., interest income on certain receivable financing and securities  related  to  operations  and  finance  charge  pertaining to the accretion of certain provisions recorded on a discounted basis (as in the case of the asset retirement obligations in the Exploration & Production segment).\n\n## Inventory holding gain or loss\n\nThis is the difference between the cost of sales of the volumes sold in the period based on the cost of supplies of the same period and the cost of sales of the volumes sold calculated using the weighted average cost method of inventory accounting as required by IFRS.\n\n## Special item\n\nThese include certain significant income or charges pertaining to either: (i) infrequent or unusual events and transactions, being identified  as  non-recurring  items  under  such  circumstances; (ii) certain events or transactions which are not considered to be representative of the ordinary course of business, as in the case of environmental provisions, restructuring charges, asset impairments or write ups and gains or losses on divestments even though they occurred in past periods or are likely to occur in future ones. Exchange rate differences and derivatives relating to industrial activities and commercial payables and receivables, particularly  exchange  rate  derivatives  to  manage  commodity pricing formulas which are quoted in a currency other than the functional  currency  are  reclassified  in  operating  profit  with  a corresponding adjustment to net finance charges, notwithstanding the handling of foreign currency exchange risks is made centrally by  netting  off  naturally-occurring  opposite  positions  and  then dealing with any residual risk exposure in the derivative market. Finally, special items include the accounting effects of fair-valued commodity  derivatives  relating  to  commercial  exposures,  in addition to those which lack the criteria to be designed as hedges, also  those  which  are  not  eligible  for  the  own  use  exemption, including the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges, as well as",

The deferral of both the unrealized portion of fair-valued commodity and other derivatives and evaluation effects are reversed to future reporting periods when the underlying transaction occurs.\n\nAs provided for in Decision No. 15519 of July 27, 2006 of the Italian market  regulator  (CONSOB),  non-recurring  material income or charges are to be clearly reported in the management's discussion and financial tables.\n\n## Leverage\n\nLeverage  is  a  Non-GAAP  measure  of  the  Company's  financial condition, calculated as the ratio between net borrowings and shareholders' equity, including non-controlling interest. Leverage is the reference ratio to assess the solidity and efficiency of the Group balance sheet in terms of incidence of funding sources including third-party funding and equity as well as to carry out benchmark analysis with industry standards.\n\n## Gearing\n\nGearing  is  calculated  as  the  ratio  between  net  borrowings and capital employed net and measures how much of capital employed net is financed recurring to third-party funding.\n\n## Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital at replacement cost\n\nThis is defined as net cash provided from operating activities before changes in working capital at replacement cost. It also excludes certain  non-recurring  charges  such  as  extraordinary  credit allowances and, considering the high market volatility, changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives lacking the formal criteria to be designed as hedges, including derivatives which were not eligible for the own use exemption, the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges, as well as the effects of certain settled commodity derivatives whenever it is deemed that the underlying transaction is expected to occur in future reporting periods.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nFree  cash  flow  represents  the  link  existing  between  changes  in cash and cash equivalents (deriving from the statutory cash flows statement) and in net borrowings (deriving from the summarized cash  flow  statement)  that  occurred  from  the  beginning  of  the period to the end of period. Free cash flow is the cash in excess of\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\ncapital expenditure needs. Starting from free cash flow it is possible to determine either: (i) changes in cash and cash equivalents for the  period  by  adding/deducting  cash  flows  relating  to  financing debts/receivables  (issuance/repayment  of  debt  and  receivables related to financing activities), shareholders' equity (dividends paid, net repurchase of own shares, capital issuance) and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences; (ii) changes in net borrowings for the period by adding/deducting cash flows relating to shareholders' equity and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences.\n\n## Net borrowings\n\nNet borrowings is calculated as total finance debt less cash, cash equivalents, financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss and financing receivables held for nonoperating purposes. Financial  activities  are  qualified  as  'not  related  to  operations' when these are not strictly related to the business operations.\n\n## ROACE Adjusted\n\nIs the return on average capital invested, calculated as the ratio between net income before minority interests, plus net financial charges on net financial debt, less the related tax effect and net average capital employed.\n\n## Coverage\n\nFinancial discipline ratio, calculated as the ratio between operating profit and net finance charges.\n\n## Current ratio\n\nMeasures  the  capability  of  the  Company  to  repay  short-term debt, calculated as the ratio between current assets and current liabilities.\n\n## Debt coverage\n\nRating companies use the debt coverage ratio to evaluate debt sustainability.  It  is  calculated  as  the  ratio  between  net  cash provided by operating activities and net borrowings, less cash and cash-equivalents, securities held for non-operating purposes and financing receivables for non-operating purposes.\n\n## Net Debt/EBITDA adjusted\n\nNet Debt/adjusted EBITDA is the ratio between the profit available to  cover  the  debt  before  interest,  taxes,  amortizations  and impairment. This index is a measure of the company's ability pay off its debt and gives an indication as to how long a company would need to operate at its current level to pay off all its debt.\n\n## Proforma adjusted EBIT\n\nIs  the  measure  adding  the  operating  margin  of  the  equity accounted  entities  to  the  adjusted  EBIT,  introduced  by  the",

In  the  short  term,  crude  oil  prices  are mainly determined by the balance between global oil supplies and  demand,  the  global  levels  of  commercial  inventories  and producing countries' spare capacity, as well as by expectations of financial operators who trade crude oil derivatives contracts (futures  and  options)  influencing  short-term  price  movements via their positioning. A downturn in economic activity normally triggers  lower  global  demand  for  crude  oil  and  possibly oversupplies and inventories build-up, because in the short-term producers  are  unable  to  quickly  adapt  to  swings  in  demand. Whenever global supplies of crude oil outstrip demand, crude oil prices weaken. Factors that can influence the global economic activity in the short-term and demand for crude oil include several, unpredictable events, like trends in the economic growth which shape crude oil demand in big consumer countries like China, India and the United States, financial crisis, monetary variables (the level of inflation and of interest rates), geo-political crisis, local conflicts and wars, social instability, pandemic diseases, the flows of international commerce, trade disputes and governments' fiscal policies, among others.\n\nLong-term demands for crude oil is driven, on the positive side, by demographic growth, improving living standards and GDP (Gross Domestic product) expansion; on the negative side, factors that in  the  long-term  may  significantly  reduce  demands  for  crude  oil include availability of alternative sources of energy (e.g., nuclear and renewables), technological breakthroughs, shifts in consumer preferences,  and  finally  measures  and  other  initiatives  adopted or planned by governments to tackle climate change and to curb carbon-dioxide  emissions  (CO 2 emissions),  including  stricter regulations and control on production and consumption of crude oil.  Eni's  management  believes  the  push  to  reduce  worldwide\n\ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  and  the  ongoing  energy  transition\n\ntowards a low carbon economy are likely to materially affect the\n\nworldwide energy mix in the long-term and may lead to structural\n\nlower crude oil demands and prices. See the section dedicated to\n\nthe discussion of climate-related risks below.\n\nNotwithstanding the USA being the first oil producer in the world\n\nsince  the  shale  oil  revolution  of  2011,  global  oil  supplies  are\n\ncontrolled to a large degree by the Organization of the Petroleum\n\nExporting Countries ('OPEC') cartel and its allied countries, like\n\nRussia and Kazakhstan, known as the OPEC+ alliance. Saudi Arabia\n\nplays a crucial role within the cartel, because it is estimated to hold\n\nhuge amounts of reserves and a vast majority of worldwide spare\n\nproduction capacity. This explains why geopolitical developments\n\nin the Middle East and particularly in the Gulf area, like regional\n\nconflicts, acts of war, strikes, attacks, sabotages, and social and\n\npolitical  tensions  can  have  a  big  influence  on  crude  oil  prices.\n\nFurthermore, due to expectations of a slowdown in the growth\n\nrate of the US shale oil production or of a possible decline in the\n\nlong-term  due  to  capital  discipline  and  industrial  factors  like  a\n\nshrinking number of premium locations and high-yield wells, the\n\nOPEC+ alliance could exert in perspective an increasingly larger\n\ninfluence over the crude oil market. Finally, sanctions imposed by\n\nthe United States and the EU against certain producing countries\n\nmay influence trends in crude oil prices.\n\nTo a lesser extent, extreme weather events, such as hurricanes in\n\nareas of highly concentrated production like the Gulf of Mexico, and\n\noperational issues at key petroleum infrastructures may have an\n\nimpact on crude oil prices.\n\nIn 2023, the price of the Brent benchmark crude declined by 18%\n\ncompared to 2022 due to rising production levels in non-OPEC\n\ncountries  and  expectations  among  financial  market  participants\n\nof  a  slowdown  in  economic  activity  and  hence  in  demand  for\n\ncrude oil, whereas the China recovery was elusive, and the Europe\n\neconomies  have  been  stagnating.

Differently from crude oil, the absolute levels of natural gas prices change from region to region due to specific supply dynamics (e.g. in 2023 the price of natural gas in USA was one fifth that of Europe, because Europe is a net importer, whilst the USA is currently an oversupplied market due to growing domestic production), while consumption of  natural  gas  is  significantly  exposed  to  seasonal  patterns  and competition  from  renewables.  All  those  trends  may  result  in  a higher degree of volatility in natural gas prices compared to crude oil. In the long-term, demands for natural gas are exposed to the risks of the transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nIn 2023, natural gas prices declined significantly compared to 2022, with European benchmarks down more than 60%, due to an  oversupplied  global  market  and  lower  consumption  driven by lower industrial activity in Europe, energy savings measures, competition from renewables and mild winter weather. We expect weak natural gas prices in 2024 due to continuation of the trends observed in 2024.\n\nThe  volatility  of  hydrocarbons  prices  significantly  affects  the Group's financial performance. Lower hydrocarbon prices from one year to another negatively affect the Group's consolidated results of operations and cash flow; the opposite occurs in case of a rise in prices. This is because lower prices translate into lower revenues recognised in the Company's Exploration & Production segment at the time of the price change, whereas expenses in this segment are either fixed or less sensitive to changes in crude oil prices than revenues. In 2023, lower hydrocarbons prices, down by 18% and 66% respectively for the Brent crude oil and the European spot price of  natural  gas,  reduced  our  operating  profit  and  cash  flow  from operating activities by an estimated amount of approximately \u20ac5 billion and \u20ac3 billion respectively.\n\nFinally, movements in hydrocarbons prices significantly affect the reportable amount of production and proved reserves under our production sharing agreements ('PSAs'), which represented about 55% of our proved reserves as of end of 2023. The entitlement mechanism  of  PSAs  foresees  the  Company  is  entitled  to  a portion of a field's reserves, the sale of which is intended to cover expenditures incurred by the Company to develop and operate the field.  The  higher  the  reference  prices  for  Brent  crude  oil  used  to estimate Eni's proved reserves, the lower the number of barrels necessary  to  recover  the  same  amount  of  expenditure,  and vice versa. In 2023 our reported production and reserves were increased by an estimated amount of respectively 3 KBOE/d and by\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\n30 mmBOE due to a decreased Brent reference price. Considering the current portfolio of oil & gas assets, the Company estimates its production to vary by up to 1 KBOE/d for each one-dollar change in the price of the Brent crude oil.\n\nEni's  Enilive,  Refining  and  Chemical  businesses  are  in  cyclical economic sectors. Their results are impacted by trends in the supply and demand of oil products and plastic commodities, which are influenced by the macro-economic scenario and by product margins. Margins for refined and chemical products depend upon the speed at which products' prices adjust to reflect movements in oil prices. All these risks may adversely and materially impact the Group's results  of  operations,  cash  flow,  liquidity,  business  prospects, financial  condition,  and  shareholder  returns,  including  dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price\n\nof Eni's share.\n\n## Risks in connection with Russia's military aggression of Ukraine and the Middle East conflict in the Gaza strip\n\nRussia's military aggression of Ukraine began in late February 2022 and has continued to drag throughout 2023 without any prospects of quick solution. This conflict has already negatively impacted the global economy by triggering an energy crisis in Europe, by souring the political relationships between Western countries and Russia, by disrupting supply chains and by increasing cybersecurity threats. In response to Russia's aggression, the EU nations, the UK, and the USA have adopted massive economic and financial sanctions to curb Russia's ability to fund the war, which is negatively affecting the economic activity.\n\nAn uncertain global macroeconomic backdrop has been further compounded since last October by a resurgence of tensions in Middle East, culminating in Israelis military invasion of the Gaza strip and risks of enlargement of the conflict.\n\nA  prolonged  armed  conflict  in  those  two  areas,  a  possible escalation of the military action in Middle East, and a further tightening up of the economic sanctions against Russia represent elements  of  uncertainty  that  could  eventually  sap  consumers' confidence and deter investment decisions, increasing the risks of a worldwide macroeconomic recession and with it, expectations of a reduction in hydrocarbons demands. This scenario would lead  to  lower  commodity  prices  and  would  adversely  and significantly affect our results of operations and cash flow, as well as business prospects, with a possible lower remuneration of our shareholders.",

In the past, the volumes supplied from Russia have represented a material amount of our global portfolio of natural gas supplies. In 2023, natural gas supplies from Russia decreased  materially  to  12%  of  our  total  purchases  of  natural gas (down from 28% in 2022) due to unilateral decisions from our Russian supplier to suspend deliveries, against the backdrop of a commercial dispute between the two parties. We intend to continue our effort to substitute Russian-origin natural gas in our portfolio, with the aim to continue to reduce such dependence in the shortest possible timeframe, including the termination of the current contracts.\n\nThe Group's business plans have been factoring the assumption of  reducing  to  zero  the  supplies  from  Russia  and  sales  plans have been adapted accordingly by limiting sales commitments. To cope with the expected reduced availability of Russian natural gas, the Group has increased purchases from other geographies through various commercial initiatives, such as using contractual flexibilities to increase deliveries from existing long-term contracts or by developing integrated upstream-midstream projects leveraging  equity  natural  gas  reserves  and  new  liquefactions capacity.  The  process  of  replacing  Russian-origin  natural  gas, including terminating existing contracts, may entail operational and financial risks which may be significant.\n\nOther Eni assets in Russia are immaterial to the Group results of operations.\n\n## There  is  strong  competition  worldwide,  both within the oil industry and with other industries, to supply energy and petroleum products to the industrial,  commercial,  and  residential  energy markets\n\nThe  current  competitive  environment  in  which  Eni  operates  is characterized by volatile prices and margins of energy commodities, limited product differentiation and complex relationships with stateowned companies and national agencies of the countries where hydrocarbons  reserves  are  located  to  obtain  mineral  rights.  As commodity prices are beyond the Company's control, Eni's ability to remain competitive and profitable in this environment requires continuous focus on technological innovation, the achievement of efficiencies  in  operating  costs,  effective  management  of  capital resources and the ability to provide valuable services to energy buyers.  It  also  depends  on  Eni's  ability  to  gain  access  to  new investment opportunities. Competitive trends represent a risk to the profitability of all Eni's business segment:\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\n- \u00b7 E&P may be negatively affected by its relatively smaller scale compared to other players in the industry;\n- \u00b7 the business of marketing natural gas in the European wholesale market  managed  by  the  GGP  segment  is  exposed  to  pricing competition  considering  anticipated  weak  demand  trends  in Europe and an oversupplied market;\n- \u00b7 the businesses  of  oil  refining and  production  of  basic petrochemicals  conducted  in  Europe  are  exposed  to  industry cyclicality, weak  demand,  overcapacity,  competition  from players  with  wider  scale  and  cost  advantages  which  are operating in geographies characterized by lower energy costs and  environmental  exposures  compared  to  Europe,  and  finally growing market penetration on more sustainable products and solutions; and\n- \u00b7 the  business  of  marketing  natural  gas  and  electricity  to  the retail market, which is managed by our subsidiary Plenitude, is exposed to the competitive nature of the retail market that is characterized by an almost full liberalization, a large number of suppliers and customers' ability to switch rapidly from one supplier to another.\n\nRising concerns about climate change and effects of the energy transition could continue to lead to a fall in demand and potentially lower prices for hydrocarbons. Climate change could also have a physical impact on our assets and supply chains. This risk may also lead to additional legal and/or regulatory  measures,  resulting  in  project  delays or  cancellations,  potential  additional  litigation, operational restrictions, and additional compliance obligations\n\nSocietal  demand  for  urgent  action  on  climate  change  has increased, especially since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report of 2018 on 1.5\u00b0C effectively made the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius the default target. This increasing focus on climate change and drive for an energy transition have created a risk environment that is changing rapidly, resulting in a wide range of governmental actions at global, local and company levels, increasing pressure from civil society and the investing and lending community to speed up our decarbonization plans. The potential impact and likelihood of the associated exposure for Eni could vary across different time horizons, depending on the specific components of the risk.\n\nWe expect that a growing share of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  will  be  subject  to  regulation,  resulting  in  increased compliance costs and operational restrictions. Regulators may seek to limit certain oil and gas projects or make it more difficult to obtain required permits. Additionally, climate activists are challenging the",

We expect that these challenges and protests are likely to continue and could delay or prohibit operations in certain cases. Our strategy to achieve our target of becoming Net Zero on all emissions from our operations has resulted in and could continue to require additional costs. We also expect that actions by customers to reduce their emissions will continue to lower demand and potentially affect prices for fossil fuels, as will GHG emissions regulation through taxes, fees and/or other incentives. This could be a factor contributing to additional provisions for our assets and result in lower earnings, cancelled projects and potential impairment of certain assets.\n\nThe pace and extent of the energy transition could pose a risk to Eni if we decarbonize our operations and the energy we sell is not aligned to the demand of to society. If we are slower than society, customers may prefer a different supplier, which would reduce demand  for  our  products  and  adversely  affect  our  reputation besides materially affecting our earnings and financial results. If we move much faster than society, we risk investing in technologies, markets or low carbon products that are unsuccessful because there is limited demand for them.\n\nThe physical effects of climate change such as, but not limited to, increases in temperature and sea levels and fluctuations in water levels could also adversely affect our operations and supply chains. Certain investors have decided to divest their investments in fossil fuel companies. If this were to continue, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access  capital  markets.  Stakeholder  groups  are  also  putting pressure on commercial and investment banks to stop financing fossil fuel companies. Some financial institutions have started to limit their exposure to fossil fuel projects. Accordingly, our ability to use financing for these types of future projects may be adversely affected. This could also adversely affect our potential partners' ability to finance their portion of costs, either through equity or debt. In  some  countries,  governments,  regulators,  organizations,  and individuals have filed lawsuits seeking to hold oil companies liable for costs associated with climate change or seeking to have oil companies condemned to speed up decarbonization plans based on alleged crimes against the environment or human rights violations. While we believe these lawsuits to be without merit, losing could have a material adverse effect on our business. We expect to see additional regulatory requirements to provide disclosures related to climate risks.\n\nIn summary, rising climate change concerns, the pace at which we decarbonize our operations relative to society and effects of the energy transition have led and could lead to a decrease in demand and  potentially  affect  prices  for  fossil  fuels.  The  Company's traditional  oil  and  gas  business  may  increase  or  decrease depending upon regulatory or market forces, among other factors. If  we  are  unable  to  find  economically  viable,  publicly  acceptable solutions that reduce our GHG emissions and/or GHG intensity for\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nnew and existing projects and for the products we sell, we could experience financial penalties or extra costs, delayed or cancelled projects, potential impairments of our assets, additional provisions and/or  reduced  production  and  product  sales.  Future  results of  operations,  cash  flow,  liquidity,  business  prospects,  financial condition, shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares may be adversely and significantly affected.\n\nThe above mentioned risks may emerge in the short, medium, and long-term.\n\n- a)  Regulatory risk: increasing worldwide efforts to tackle climate change may lead to the adoption of stricter regulations to curb  carbon  emissions  and  this  could  lead  to  increasing expenditures in the short term and may end up suppressing demands for our products in medium-to-long term\n\nRegulatory  actions  intended  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions include adoption of cap-and-trade regimes, carbon taxes,  carbon-based  import  duties  or  other  trade  tariffs, minimum renewable usage requirements, restrictive permitting, increased  mileage  and  other  efficiency  standards,  mandates for sales of electric vehicles, mandates for use of specific fuels or technologies, and other incentives or mandates designed to  support  transitioning  to  lower-emission  energy  sources. Depending  on  how  policies  and  regulations  are  formulated and  applied,  such  policies  and  regulations  could  negatively affect  our  investment  returns,  make  our  hydrocarbon-based products more expensive or less competitive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon  alternatives.  Current  and  pending  greenhouse  gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.\n\n- b)  Market/Technological  risk:  in  the  long-term  demands  for hydrocarbons  may  be  materially  reduced  by  the  projected mass adoption of electric vehicles, the development of green hydrogen, the deployment of massive investments to grow renewable  energies  also  supported  by  governments  fiscal  policies and the development of other technologies to produce clean feedstock, fuels, and energy\n\nIn the long-term, the weight of hydrocarbons in the global energy mix may decline due to an expected increase in the amount of energy generated by renewables, the possible emergence of new products and technologies, as well as changing consumers' preferences.\n\nA large portion of Eni's business depends on the global demand for oil and natural gas.

Courts could be more likely to hold companies who  have  allegedly  made  the  most  significant  contributions to  climate  change  to  account.  Courts  may  condemn  oil  & gas  companies  to  compensate  individuals,  communities, and states for the economic losses due to global warming as a  consequence  of  their  alleged  responsibility  in  supporting hydrocarbons and their alleged awareness of knowingly hurting the environment. In some cases, companies' boards have been summoned for having allegedly failed to take effective actions to contrast climate change.\n\nFor  example,  we  are  defending  in  California  against  claims brought to us by local administrations and certain associations of  individuals  who  are  seeking  compensation  for  alleged economic losses and environmental damage due to climate change.\n\nPrivate individuals, associations and NGOs may also bring legal actions against states or companies to get them condemned to adopt stricter targets in reducing GHG emissions and that could entail more restrictive measures on businesses. For example, in 2023, certain NGOs and several private citizens filed a complaint before an Italian court alleging that Eni and agencies of the Italian State are liable for climate change. The plaintiffs claimed economic losses and other damages and requested that Eni revises its decarbonisation strategy and immediately stops any harmful conducts, alleging several environmental crimes and violations of human rights.\n\nAs such, climate litigation represents a significant risk. In case the Company is condemned to reduce its GHG emissions at a much faster rate than planned by management or to compensate for damage related to climate change due to ongoing or potential lawsuits, we could incur a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business's prospects.\n\n- d) Reputational risk: the consideration of oil & gas companies as  poorly  performing  investments  from  an  environmental standpoint by financial market participants, could reduce the \n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\n## attractiveness of their securities or limit their ability to access the capital markets. Activist investors have been seeking to interfere in companies' plans and strategies through matter of  shareholders' resolutions\n\nThe  reputational  risk  of  oil  &  gas  companies  owes  to  the growing  perception  by  governments,  financial  institutions, and the general public that those companies may be liable for global warming due to GHG emissions across the hydrocarbon value chain, particularly related to the use of energy products, and may be poorly performing players in the ESG dimensions. This  could  possibly  impair  their  reputation  and  make  their securities  and  debt  instruments  less  attractive  than  other industrial sectors to investors.\n\nBanks, financing institutions, lenders and insurance companies are cutting exposure to the fossil fuel industry due to the need to comply with ESG mandate or to reach emission reduction targets  in  their  portfolios  and  this  could  limit  our  ability  to access new financing, could drive a rise in borrowing costs to us or increase the costs of insuring our assets.\n\nAs a result of those developments, we could expect the cost of capital to the Company to rise in the future and reduced ability on part of Eni to obtain financing for future projects in the oil & gas business or to obtain it at competitive rates, which may curb our investment opportunities or drive an increase in financing expenses,  negatively  affecting  our  results  of  operations  and business prospects.\n\n## e)  Climate  change  adaptation:  extreme  weather  phenomena, which are allegedly caused by climate change, may disrupt our operations\n\nThe scientific community has concluded that increasing global average  temperature  produces  significant  physical  effects, such as the increased frequency and severity of hurricanes, storms, droughts, floods, or other extreme climatic events that could interfere with Eni's operations and damage Eni's facilities. Extreme and unpredictable weather phenomena can result in material  disruption  to  Eni's  operations,  and  consequent  loss of or damage to properties and facilities, as well as a loss of output,  loss  of  revenues,  increasing  maintenance  and  repair expenses and cash flow shortfall.\n\nAs a result of these trends, climate-related risks could have a  material  and  adverse  effect  on  the  Group's  results  of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, and shareholder returns, including dividends and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## Investments  in  our  low  carbon  products  and services may not achieve expected returns\n\nWe are building our portfolio of low carbon products and services such as electricity generated from solar and wind power, biofuels,",

In expanding  our  offerings  of  these  low  carbon  products and  services,  we  expect  to  undertake  acquisitions  and  form partnerships. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to realise the synergies from combining our respective resources  and  capabilities,  including  the  development  of  new processes, systems and distribution channels. For example, it may take time to develop these areas through retraining our workforce and recruitment for the necessary new skills. It may take longer to realise the expected returns from these transactions.\n\nThe operating margins for our low carbon products and services may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically in our oil & gas operations.\n\nTherefore,  developing  our  low  carbon  products  and  services  is subject to challenges which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial  condition,  shareholder  returns,  including  dividends,  the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares may be adversely and significantly affected.\n\n## Risks  deriving  from  Eni's  exposure  to  weather conditions\n\nSignificant changes in weather conditions in Italy and in the rest of Europe from year to year may affect demand for natural gas and some refined products. In colder years, demand for such products is higher. Accordingly, the results of operations of Eni's businesses engaged in the marketing of natural gas and, to a lesser extent, the Enilive and Refining business, as well as the comparability of results over different periods may be affected by such changes in weather conditions. Over recent years, this pattern could have been possibly affected by the rising frequency of weather trends like milder winter or extreme weather events like heatwaves or unusually cold snaps, which are possible consequences of climate change.\n\n## The  Group  is  exposed  to  significant  operational and economic risks associated with the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas\n\nThe  exploration  and  production  of  oil  and  natural  gas  require high  levels  of  capital  expenditures  and  are  subject  to  specific operational and economic risks as well as to natural hazards and other uncertainties. The natural hazards and the economic risks described below could have an adverse, significant impact on Eni's future growth prospects, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and shareholders' returns.\n\n## a)  Operational  risks  in  connection  to  drilling  and  extraction operations\n\nThe physical and geological characteristics of oil and gas fields entail  natural  hazards  and  other  operational  risks  including\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nrisks of eruptions of hydrocarbons, discovery of hydrocarbon pockets with abnormal pressure, crumbling of well openings, oil spills, gas leaks, risks of blowout, fire or explosion and risks of earthquake in connection with drilling and extraction activities. Eni has material offshore operations which are inherently riskier than onshore activities. In 2023, approximately 70% of Eni's total oil  &  gas  production for the year derived from offshore fields, mainly in Egypt, Norway Libya, Angola, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Venezuela,  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  Congo  and  the  United States. Offshore accidents and oil spills could cause damage of catastrophic proportions to the ecosystem and to communities' health and security due to the apparent difficulties in handling hydrocarbons  containment  in  the  sea,  pollution,  poisoning of  water  and  organisms,  length  and  complexity  of  cleaning operations and other factors. Furthermore, offshore operations are subject to marine risks, including storms and other adverse weather conditions and perils of vessel collisions, which may cause material adverse effects on the Group's operations and the ecosystem.\n\n## b)  Exploratory drilling efforts may be unsuccessful\n\nExploration activities are mainly subject to the mining risk, i.e. the  risk  of  dry  holes  or  failure  to  find  commercial  quantities of  hydrocarbons.  The  costs  of  drilling  and  completing  wells have  margins  of  uncertainty,  and  drilling  operations  may  be unsuccessful because of a large variety of factors, including geological failure, unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or heterogeneities in formations, equipment failures, well control (blowouts) and other forms of accidents. A large part of the Company  exploratory  drilling  operations  is  located  offshore, including in deep and ultra-deep waters, in remote areas and in environmentally sensitive locations (such as the Barents Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, deep water leases off West Africa, Indonesia, the Mediterranean Sea and the Caspian Sea). In these locations, the  Company  generally  experiences  higher  operational  risks and more challenging conditions and incurs higher exploration costs than onshore. Furthermore, deep  and  ultra-deep water  operations  require  significant  time  before  commercial production of discovered reserves can commence, increasing both  the  operational  and  the  financial  risks  associated  with these activities.\n\nBecause  Eni  plans  to  make  significant  investments  in executing exploration projects, it is possible that the Company will incur significant amounts of dry hole expenses in future years.  Unsuccessful  exploration  activities  and  failure  to discover additional commercial reserves could reduce future production of oil and natural gas, which is highly dependent on the rate of success of exploration projects and could have an adverse impact on Eni's future performance, growth prospects and returns.",

Those activities  include  appraising  a  discovery,  defining  contractual and fiscal terms and conditions with state-owned entities and other partners to reach a final investment decision, and building and commissioning large-scale plants and equipment. Delays in the construction of key plants and facilities or in obtaining all necessary  authorizations  from  competent  authorities, costs overruns due to unplanned drilling and other operational conditions, as well as unexpected events resulting in temporarily stoppage of activities (e.g. third-party claims, environmentalists protests, changes to the work scope requested by governmental authorities, contractors' underperformance) could significantly and  adversely  affect  projects'  expected  returns.  Moreover, projects  executed  with  partners  and  joint  venture  partners reduce the ability of the Company to manage risks and costs, and  Eni  could  have  limited  influence  over  and  control  of  the operations and performance of its partners. The occurrence of any of such risks may negatively affect the time-to-market of the reserves and may cause cost overruns and start-up delays, lengthening  the  project  pay-back  period.  Those  risks  would adversely  affect  the  economic  returns  of  Eni's  development projects  and  the  achievement  of  production  growth  targets, also considering that those projects are exposed to the volatility of oil and gas prices which may be substantially different from those  estimated  when  the  investment  decision  was  made, thereby leading to lower return rates.\n\nFinally, if the Company is unable to develop and operate major projects as planned, or in case actual reservoir performance and natural field decline do not meet management's expectations, it could incur significant impairment losses of capitalized costs associated with reduced future cash flows of those projects.\n\nThe  Group  is  currently  engaged  in  the  execution  of  several development projects to put into production its proved oil and natural gas reserves. The Company has changed its approach on how to manage development projects in the hydrocarbon segment,  which  normally  feature  long-lead  times.  In  recent years we have implemented a phased approach to developing activities so to accelerate the production start-up, as well we have  favoured  near  field  development  to  exploit  synergies with existing infrastructures and reutilization/reconversion of existing plants and vessels. This strategy in developing activities is intended to shorten the time-to-market of reserves and to accelerate the pay-back period. However, the achievement of the expected time-to-market and execution of development projects on time and on budget depends on several elusive factors which are inherently difficult to schedule:\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\n- \u00b7  appraising a discovery to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of a development project;\n- \u00b7 finalizing negotiations with joint venture partners, governments and state-owned companies, suppliers and potential customers to define project terms and conditions, including, for example, the fiscal take, the production sharing terms with the first party, or negotiating favorable long-term contracts to market gas reserves;\n- \u00b7 obtaining  timely  issuance  of  permits  and  licenses  by government  agencies,  including  obtaining  all  necessary administrative authorizations to drill locations, install producing infrastructures,  build  pipelines  and  related  equipment  to transport and market hydrocarbons;\n- \u00b7 effectively  carrying  out  the  front-end  engineering  design  in order to prevent the occurrence of technical inconvenience during the execution phase;\n- \u00b7 timely  manufacturing  and  delivery  of  critical  plants  and equipment by contractors, like floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels, floating units for the production of liquefied natural gas (FLNG) and platforms, as well as building transport infrastructures to export production to final markets;\n- \u00b7 preventing risks associated with the use of new technologies and the inability to develop advanced technologies to maximise the  recoverability  rate  of  hydrocarbons  or  gain  access  to previously inaccessible reservoirs;\n- \u00b7  carefully planning the commissioning and hook-up phase where mismanagement might lead to delays to achieve first oil;\n- \u00b7 changes  in  operating  conditions  and  cost  overruns.  We expect the prices of key input factors such as labour, basic materials  (steel,  cement,  and  other  metals)  and  utilities to remain elevated in the next year or two until inflationary pressures throughout the entire supply chain moderate on the back of a slowing economy. We also expect daily rates of leased rigs and other drilling vessels and facilities to not come down as much as oil companies competes for a stable amount of supply of this kind of equipment considering the restructuring the oilfield service sector has undergone due to reduced capital spending by their clients.\n\nAll the  above-mentioned  factors  can  cause  delays  and cost overruns therefore negatively impacting expected rate of returns of projects, also considering the volatility of hydrocarbons prices.\n\n## d)  Inability to replace oil and natural gas reserves could adversely impact results of operations and financial condition, including  cash flows\n\nFuture oil and gas production is a function of the Company's ability  to  access  new  reserves  through  new  discoveries, application of improved techniques, success in development",

If Eni is  unsuccessful  in  meeting  its  long-term  targets  of  reserve replacement, Eni's future total proved reserves and production will decline.\n\n## e)  Uncertainties in estimates of oil and natural gas reserves\n\nThe accuracy of proved reserve estimates and of projections of  future  rates  of  production  and  timing  of  development costs depends on several factors, assumptions and variables, including:\n\n- \u00b7  the  quality  of  available  geological,  technical  and  economic data and their interpretation and judgment;\n- \u00b7 management's assumptions regarding future rates of production and costs and timing of operating and development costs. The projections of higher operating and development costs may impair the ability of the Company to economically produce reserves leading to downward reserve revisions;\n- \u00b7 changes  in  the  prevailing  tax  rules,  other  government regulations and contractual terms and conditions;\n- \u00b7  results of drilling, testing and the actual production performance of Eni's reservoirs after the date of the estimates which may drive substantial upward or downward revisions; and\n- \u00b7 changes in oil and natural gas prices which could affect the quantities  of  Eni's  proved  reserves  since  the  estimates  of reserves are based on prices and costs existing as of the date when these estimates are made. Lower oil prices may impair the ability of the Company to economically produce reserves leading to downward reserve revisions.\n\nMany of the factors, assumptions and variables underlying the estimation of proved reserves involve management's judgment or  are  outside  management's  control  (prices,  governmental regulations) and may change over time, therefore affecting the estimates of oil and natural gas reserves from year-to-year.\n\nThe prices used in calculating Eni's estimated proved reserves are,  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange Commission  (the  'U.S.  SEC')  requirements,  calculated  by determining the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-dayof-the-month commodity prices for the preceding 12 months. For the 12-months ending at December 31, 2023, average prices were based on 83 $/barrel for the Brent crude oil, lower than the 2022 reference price 101 $/barrel, resulting in us having 37 million BOE of reserves that have become uneconomical at a lower price and were therefore removed from proved reserves. Accordingly, the estimated reserves reported as of the end of 2023 could be significantly different from the quantities of oil\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nand natural gas that will be ultimately recovered. Any downward revision in Eni's estimated quantities of proved reserves would indicate lower future production volumes, which could adversely impact  Eni's  business  prospects,  results  of  operations,  cash flows and liquidity.\n\n## f)  The development of the Group's proved undeveloped reserves  'PUD' may take longer and may require higher levels of capital  expenditures  than  it  currently  anticipates,  or  the  Group's  proved undeveloped reserves may not ultimately be developed or produced\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 38% of the Group's total estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped and may not be ultimately developed or produced. Recovery of PUD requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling  operations.  The  Group's  reserve  estimates  assume it can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate and are subject to the risk of a structural decline in the prices of hydrocarbons, which could reduce available funds to  develop  PUD  and/or  make  development  uneconomical. The Group's reserve report as of December 31, 2023 includes estimates of total future development and decommissioning costs  associated  with  the  Group's  proved  total  reserves of approximately  \u20ac42.6  billion (undiscounted,  including consolidated subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities; \u20ac44.3 billion in 2022). It cannot be certain that estimated costs of the development of these reserves will prove correct, development will occur as scheduled, or the results of such development will  be  as  estimated.  In  case  of  change  in  the  Company's plans to develop those reserves, or if it is not otherwise able to  successfully  develop  these  reserves  as  a  result  of  the Group's inability to fund necessary capital expenditures due to a prolonged decline in the price of hydrocarbons or otherwise, it will be required to remove the associated volumes from the Group's reported proved reserves.\n\n## g)  The  oil  &  gas  industry  is  a  capital-intensive  business  and needs large amount of funds to find and develop reserves. In  case the Group does not have access to sufficient funds its oil  & gas business may decline\n\nThe oil and gas industry is a capital intensive business. Eni makes  and  expects  to  continue  making  substantial  capital expenditures in its business for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. Historically, Eni's capital  expenditures  have  been  financed  with  cash  generated from operations, proceeds from asset disposals, borrowings under its credit facilities and proceeds from the issuance of debt and bonds. The actual amount and timing of future capital expenditures may differ materially from Eni's estimates as a",

Eni's  cash  flows  from  operations and access to capital markets are subject to several variables, including but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of Eni's proved reserves;\n- \u00b7 the volume of crude oil and natural gas Eni is able to produce and sell from existing wells;\n- \u00b7 the prices at which crude oil and natural gas are marketed;\n- \u00b7 Eni's ability to acquire, find and produce new reserves; and\n- \u00b7 the ability and willingness of Eni's lenders to extend credit or of participants in the capital markets to invest in Eni's bonds considering  that  adoption  of  ESG  targets  by  lenders  may restrict our access to third-party financing.\n\nIf cash generated by operations, cash from asset disposals, or cash available under Eni's liquidity reserves or its credit facilities or issuance of new bonds is not sufficient to meet capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of operations relating to development of  Eni's  reserves,  which  in  turn  could  adversely  affect  its results of operations and cash flows and its ability to achieve its  growth  plans.  In  the  four-year  plan  we  are  forecasting significant capital expenditures in a range of \u20ac5.5-6 billion on average per year to fund new exploration and development projects and production ramp-ups and considering expected continuation of inflationary trends in upstream costs. In case of a decline in hydrocarbons prices, we may be forced to take on new finance debt from banks and financing institutions to pursue our development plans and that could increase our financial risk profile. Finally, funding Eni's capital expenditures with additional debt will increase its leverage and the issuance of additional debt will require a portion of Eni's cash flows from operations to be used for the payment of interest.\n\n## h) Oil and gas activity may be subject to increasingly high levels of income taxes and royalties\n\nOil and gas operations are subject to the payment of royalties and income taxes, which tend to be higher than those payable in other commercial activities. Management believes that the marginal tax rate in the oil and gas industry tends to increase in correlation with higher oil prices, which could make it more difficult for Eni to translate higher oil prices into increased net profit. However, the Company does not expect that the marginal tax rate will decrease in response to falling oil prices. Adverse  changes  in  the  tax  rate  applicable  to  the  Group's profit before income taxes in its oil and gas operations would\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nhave a negative impact on Eni's future results of operations and cash flows.\n\nIn 2022, in response to a surge in hydrocarbons and electricity prices also due to the disruption risks in connection with the Russian military aggression of Ukraine, governments of EU member states and of UK enacted solidaristic contributions in the form of one-off or temporary windfall levies to increase the fiscal take on the profits of energy companies relating to the portion of those profits deemed to exceed historical averages, to collect funds to alleviate the financial burden on households and businesses due to rising costs of fuels and energy. These windfall taxes negatively affected our results of operations and cash flow in 2022 and, to a lesser extent, in 2023.\n\nNotwithstanding  hydrocarbons  and  electricity  prices  have significantly declined in 2023 compared to 2022, they are still perceived to remain at historically high values by governments and consumers. Given rising pressures on public finances due to an expected economic slowdown and the general consideration that  the  oil  &  gas  companies  may  be  benefiting  from  the ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East, management cannot rule out the possibility of the introduction of new windfall taxes and other extraordinary levies targeting the  hydrocarbons  sector,  which  could  negatively  affect  the Group's results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## i)  The  present  value  of  future  net  revenues  from  Eni's  proved  reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of Eni's estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves\n\nIn the Supplementary oil & gas information, it is indicated the present value of future net revenues from Eni's proved reserves that may differ from the current market value of Eni's estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with the SEC rules, Eni bases the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months. Actual future prices may be materially higher or lower than the SEC pricing method in the calculations. Actual  future  net  revenues  from  crude  oil  and  natural  gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the  actual  prices  Eni  receives  for  sales  of  crude  oil  and natural gas;\n- \u00b7 the actual cost and timing of development and production expenditures;\n- \u00b7  the timing and amount of actual production; and\n- \u00b7 changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\n\nThe timing of both Eni's production and its incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual",

Additionally, the 10% discount factor Eni uses when calculating discounted future net revenues may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with Eni's reserves or the crude oil and natural gas industry in general.\n\n## The Group may fail to execute in whole or in part its asset disposition plan and/or realise the returns and proceeds expected from it\n\nOur  financial  plan  for  the  next  four-year  period  2024-2027 contemplates a gross capital expenditures program of around \u20ac35 billion and asset dispositions of about \u20ac8 billion (net of expected disbursements for acquisitions) leading to a net cash flow for investing activities of about \u20ac7 billion per year on average. The ability of the Group to successfully realize such asset dispositions is exposed to several risks, such as the Group's failure to find purchasers of the assets and effect the dispositions at the price or on the terms that were anticipated. These risks are particularly significant in the current environment dominated by high interest rates, where, therefore, financing for perspective buyers could be limited, and volatility, where asset valuations can fluctuate significantly and unpredictably. The Group's failure to realise in whole or in part its disposition plan and/or realise the expected returns and proceeds may adversely affect the Group's cash flows and, therefore, the Group's ability to fund its capital expenditure programs and/or distribution policy.\n\nFurther,  dispositions  have  their  own  risks  associated  with  the separation of operations and personnel, the potential provision of transitional services and the allocation of management resources. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement of the Group in the divested business, such as through guarantees, indemnities  or  other  financial  obligations  and  may  result  in  lost synergies that could negatively impact our balance sheet, income statement and cash flows.\n\n## Risks related to political considerations\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, about 82% of Eni's proved hydrocarbon reserves were located in non-OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, mainly in Africa, Central Asia  and  Middle  East  where  the  socio-political  framework,  the financial system and the macroeconomic outlook are less stable than in the OECD countries. In those non-OECD countries, Eni is exposed to a wide range of political risks and uncertainties, which may impair Eni's ability to continue operating economically on a temporary or permanent basis, and Eni's ability to access oil and gas reserves. Particularly, Eni faces risks in connection with the following potential issues and risks:\n\n- \u00b7 socio-political instability leading to internal conflicts, revolutions, establishment of non-democratic regimes, protests, attacks, and other forms of civil disorder and unrest, such as strikes, riots,\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nsabotage, blockades, vandalism and theft of crude oil at pipelines, acts of violence and similar events. These risks could result in disruptions to economic activity, loss of output, plant closures and shutdowns, project delays, loss of assets and threats to the security of personnel. They may disrupt financial and commercial markets, including the supply of and pricing for oil and natural gas, and generate greater political and economic instability in some of the geographical areas in which Eni operates. Additionally, any possible reprisals because of military or other action, such as acts of terrorism in Europe, the United States or elsewhere, could have a material adverse effect on the world economy and hence on the global demand for hydrocarbons;\n\n- \u00b7 lack of well-established and  reliable legal systems  and uncertainties surrounding the enforcement of contractual rights;\n- \u00b7 unfavorable  enforcement  of  laws,  regulations  and  contractual arrangements leading, for example, to expropriation, nationalization  or  forced  divestiture  of  assets  and  unilateral cancellation or modification of contractual terms, tax or royalty increases  (including  retroactive  claims)  and  restrictions  on exploration, production, imports and exports;\n- \u00b7 sovereign default or financial instability since those countries rely heavily on petroleum revenues to sustain public finance. Financial difficulties  at  country  level  often  translate  into  failure  by  stateowned companies and agencies to fulfil their financial obligations towards Eni relating to funding capital commitments in projects operated by Eni or to timely paying for supplies of equity oil and gas volumes;\n- \u00b7 difficulties  in  finding  qualified  international  or  local  suppliers  in critical operating environments; and\n- \u00b7 complex  processes  of  granting  authorizations  or  licenses affecting time-to-market of certain development projects.\n\nAreas where Eni operates and where the Company is particularly exposed  to  political  risk  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  Libya, Venezuela, Nigeria, and Egypt.\n\nEni's operations in Libya are exposed to significant geopolitical risks. The social and political instability of the Country dates to the revolution of 2011 that brought a change of regime and a civil war with a material impact on our operations in that year. A divided political landscape emerged from those events, which caused  a  prolonged  period  of  internal  instability  which  has triggered several acts of internal conflict, clashes, civil turmoil, and unrest involving the opposing factions amidst failed attempts to  hold  general  elections  and  appoint  a  national  government, resulting in several disruptions to Eni's activities in the Country in that timeframe, albeit of a smaller scale compared to 2011. In 2023, notwithstanding a stalemate in the process of reunification of the Country, the coexistence of the Government of National Unity installed in Tripoli and the self-appointed National Stability Government installed in the east of the country has paved the way",

In 2023, Eni production in Libya was 169 kboe/d, equal to 11% of the Group's total production, and was in line with management's plans. Management believes that  Libya's  geopolitical  situation  will  continue  to  represent  a source of risk and uncertainty to Eni's operations in the country and to the Group's results of operations and cash flow.\n\nThe financial difficulties of Venezuela partly due to the US sanction regime have impaired our ability to conduct profitable operations in the country. Currently, after having completely impaired other projects in past reporting periods, the Company retains just one asset in Venezuela: the 50%-participated Card\u00f3n IV joint venture, which is operating an offshore natural gas field and is supplying its production to the national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA ('PDVSA'), under a long-term supply agreement. PDVSA has failed to regularly pay the receivables for the gas volumes supplied by  Card\u00f3n  IV  venture  and  consequently  a  significant  amount of overdue receivables is outstanding at the closing date of the financial  year  2023  and  a  credit  loss  provision  has  been  booked to  reflect  the  counterparty  risk.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  Eni's invested capital in Venezuela was approximately \u20ac1 billion, mainly relating to trade receivable owed to us by PDVSA. Due to a partial lifting of US sanctions on the trade of Venezuelan crude oil, Eni was able in 2023 to obtain the reimbursement in-kind of a portion of its trade receivables, so to partly offset the increase of the year due to the current natural gas production and revenues. However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about any possible evolution of the US sanctions against Venezuela and our ability to recover our outstanding receivables.\n\nThe  Group  has  significant  credit  exposure  towards  state-owned and privately-held local companies in Nigeria in relation to their share of funding of petroleum projects operated by Eni. A significant amount of receivables owed to us was past due as at December 31, 2023 because of Eni's Nigerian counterparts inability to reimburse their share of expenditures funded by us reflecting a deteriorated financial framework of the Country.\n\nFurthermore, Eni's operations in Nigeria were negatively affected by continuing acts of theft of oil at onshore pipelines in past years and, to a lesser extent, also in 2023.\n\nEgypt  has  been  experiencing  financial  restraints  due  to  an economic  slowdown  and  a  contraction  in  reserves  of  foreign currencies. Eni is currently supplying its equity share of natural gas production to local state-owned oil companies that have failed to pay trade receivables owed to us in a timely manner. On the basis of the commitments of the country's authorities to normalize the outstanding exposure towards Eni, an expected credit loss was estimated taking into account the expected timing of collection.\n\n## Sanction targets\n\nThe most relevant sanction programs for Eni are those issued by the European Union and the United States of America and, as\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nof today, the restrictive measures adopted by such authorities in respect of Russia.\n\nAs consequence of Russia's military aggression of Ukraine, the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and the G7 countries adopted a comprehensive system of sanctions against Russia to weaken its economy and its ability to finance the war. The sanction system is constantly evolving.\n\nThe main targets of the sanctions are the Russian Central Bank and the major financial institutions of the country, as well as Russia's exports of crude oil and refined products to international markets. Considering the complexity of the sanctions and the existing Eni's contracts for natural gas supply from Russia and the need to make payments to Russian counterparties, the Company is exposed to the risk of possible violations of the sanction's regime.\n\nEni adopted the necessary measures to ensure that its activities are carried out in accordance with the applicable rules, ensuring continuous monitoring of the evolution in the sanction framework, to  adapt  on  an  ongoing  basis  its  activities  to  the  applicable restrictions.\n\nFurthermore, an escalation of the international crisis, resulting in a  tightening  of  sanctions,  could  entail  a  significant  disruption  of energy supply and trade flows globally, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\n\nFrom 2017, the United States have enacted a regime of economic and  financial  sanctions  against  Venezuela.  The  scope  of  the restrictions, initially targeting certain financial instruments issued or sold by the Government of Venezuela, was gradually expanded over 2017 and 2018 and then significantly broadened during the course of 2019 when PDVSA, the main national state-owned enterprise, was added to the 'Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List' and the Venezuelan government and its controlled entities became subject to assets freeze in the United States. Even if such U.S. sanctions are substantially 'primary' and therefore dedicated in principle to U.S. persons only, retaliatory measures and other adverse consequences may also interest foreign entities which operate with Venezuelan listed entities and/or in the oil sector of the country. The U.S. sanction regime against Venezuela was further tightened in 2020 by restricting any Venezuelan oil exports, including  swap  schemes  utilized  by  foreign  entities  to  recover trade and financing receivables from PDVSA and other Venezuelan counterparties. This latter tightening of the sanction regime has reduced the Group's ability to collect the trade receivable owed to Eni for its activity in the country in 2021 and 2022, except for limited waivers agreed with U.S. relevant authorities, which have recently relaxed the sanction regime. In the final part of 2023, the U.S. sanction regime against Venezuela was relaxed and that has enabled Eni to lift some PDVSA's entitlements of crude oil and to compensate overdue amounts of trade receivables owed to us in connection with our supplies of equity natural gas to PDVSA.",

In any case, the U.S. sanctions  add  stress  to  the  already  complex  financial,  political, and operating outlook of the country, which could further limit the ability of Eni to recover its investments in Venezuela.\n\n## Specific  risks  of  the  Company's  gas  business in Italy\n\n- a)  Current, negative trends in the competitive environment of the European natural gas sector may impair the Company's ability  to fulfil its minimum off-take obligations in connection with its  take-or-pay, long-term gas supply contracts\n\nEni is currently party to a few long-term gas supply contracts with state-owned companies of key producing countries, from where most of the gas supplies directed to Europe are sourced via pipeline (Russia, Algeria, Libya and Norway). These contracts which were intended to support Eni's sales plan in Italy and in other European markets, provide take-or-pay clauses whereby the Company has an obligation to lift minimum, preset volumes of gas in each year of the contractual term or, in case of failure, to pay the whole price, or a fraction of that price, up to a minimum contractual quantity. Similar considerations apply to ship-or-pay contractual obligations which arise from contracts with transmission system operators or pipeline owners, which the Company has entered into to secure long-term transport capacity.  Long-term  gas  supply  contracts  with  take-or-pay clauses expose the Company to a volume risk, as the Company is obligated to purchase an annual minimum volume of gas, or in case of failure, to pay the underlying price. The structure of the Company's portfolio of gas supply contracts is a risk to the profitability outlook of Eni's wholesale gas business due to the current competitive dynamics in the European gas markets. In past downturns of the gas sector, the Company incurred significant  cash  outflows  in  response  to  its  take-or-pay obligations. Furthermore, the Company's wholesale business is exposed to volatile spreads between the procurement costs of gas, which are linked to spot prices at European hubs or to the price of crude oil, and the selling prices of gas which are mainly indexed to spot prices at the Italian hub.\n\nEni's  management  is  planning  to  continue  its  strategy  of renegotiating  the  Company's  long-term  gas  supply  contracts in  order  to  constantly  align  pricing  terms  to  current  market conditions  as  they  evolve  and  to  obtain  greater  operational flexibility to better manage the take-or-pay obligations (volumes and delivery points among others), considering the risk factors described above. The revision clauses included in these contracts state the right of each counterparty to renegotiate the economic terms and other contractual conditions periodically, in relation to ongoing changes in the gas scenario. Management believes that\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nthe outcome of those renegotiations is uncertain in respect of both the amount of the economic benefits that will be ultimately obtained and the timing of recognition of profit. Furthermore, in case Eni and the gas suppliers fail to agree on revised contractual terms, both parties can start an arbitration procedure to obtain revised contractual conditions. All these possible developments within the renegotiation process could increase the level of risks and uncertainties relating the outcome of those renegotiations.\n\n## b)  Risks  associated  with  the  regulatory  powers  entrusted  to the  Italian  Regulatory  Authority  for  Energy,  Networks  and  Environment in the matter of pricing to residential customers\n\nEni's wholesale gas and retail gas and power businesses are subject to regulatory risks mainly in Italy's domestic market. The  Italian  Regulatory  Authority  for  Energy,  Networks  and Environment (the 'Authority') is entrusted with certain powers in the matter of natural gas and power pricing. Specifically, the Authority retains a surveillance power on pricing in the natural gas market in Italy and the power to establish selling tariffs for the supply of natural gas to residential and commercial users who opt to adhere to regulated tariffs until the market is fully opened. Developments in the regulatory framework intended to increase the level of market liquidity or of deregulation or intended to reduce operators' ability to transfer to customers cost increases in raw materials may negatively affect future sales margins of gas and electricity, operating results, and cash flow. In the current environment characterized by rising energy costs, it is possible that the Authority may enact measures intended to limit revenues of inframarginal power generation and to reduce the indexation of the cost of the raw materials in pricing formulae applied by retail companies that market natural gas and electricity to residential customers and that development could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow in the domestic retail business of natural gas and  power.  In  the  current  energy  context,  characterized  by many regulatory interventions at EU and national level aimed at ensuring security of supply and curbing consumptions and energy prices for final customers, also our GGP business that engages in the wholesale marketing of natural gas and the power generation business that sell produced electricity on the spot market could be exposed to a regulatory risk, although on a smaller scale than the retail business due to well-established and liquid spot markets for natural gas and electricity.\n\n## Risks related to environmental, health and safety regulations and legal risks\n\n## a)  The Group is exposed to material HSE risks due to the nature  of its operations\n\nThe Group engages in the exploration and production of crude oil  and  natural  gas,  processing,  transportation  and  refining",

Flammability  and  toxicity  of  hydrocarbons,  technical  faults, malfunctioning  of  plants,  equipment  and  facilities,  control systems  failure,  human  errors,  acts  of  sabotage,  attacks, loss of containment and climate-related hazards can trigger adverse  consequences  such  as  explosions,  blowouts,  fires, oil  and  gas  spills  from  wells,  pipeline  and  tankers,  release of contaminants and pollutants in the air, ground and water, toxic emissions, and other negative events. The magnitude of these risks is influenced by the geographic range, operational diversity,  and  technical  complexity  of  Eni's  activities.  Eni's future results of operations, cash flow and liquidity depend on its ability to identify and address the risks and hazards inherent to operating in those industries.\n\n## b)  Eni  expects  to  incur  material  operating  expenses  and  expenditures in future years in relation to compliance with applicable  environmental,  health  and  safety  regulations, including  compliance  with  any  national  or  international regulation on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n\nEni's  activities  are  highly  regulated.  Laws  and  regulations intended  to  preserve  the  environment  and  to  safeguard health  and  safety  of  workers  and  communities  impose several  obligations,  requirements,  and  prohibitions  to  the Company's businesses due to their inherent nature because of flammability, dangerousness, and toxicity of hydrocarbons and  of  objective  risks  of  industrial  processes  to  explore, develop,  extract,  refine,  handling  and  transport  oil,  natural gas,  liquified  natural  gas  and  products.  These  laws  and regulations require acquisition of a permit before drilling for hydrocarbons may commence, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with exploration, drilling and production activities, including refinery and petrochemical plant operations, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain protected  areas,  require  to  remove  and  dismantle  drilling platforms and other equipment and well plug-in once oil and gas operations have terminated, provide for measures to be taken to protect the safety of the workplace, the health of employees,  contractors  and  other  Company  collaborators and  of  communities  involved  by  the  Company's  activities, and  impose  criminal  and  civil  liabilities  for  polluting  the environment or harming employees' or communities' health and safety as result from the Group's operations. These laws and regulations control the emission of scrap substances and pollutants, discipline the handling of hazardous materials and\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nwaste and set limits to or prohibit the discharge of soil, water or groundwater contaminants, emissions of toxic gases and other air pollutants or can impose taxes on carbon dioxide emissions, as in the case of the European Trading Scheme that requires the purchase of an emission allowance for each tons of carbon dioxide emitted in the environment above a preset threshold, resulting from the operation of oil and natural gas extraction and processing plants, petrochemical plants, refineries,  service  stations,  vessels,  oil  carriers,  pipeline systems and other facilities owned or operated by Eni.\n\nBreaches  of  environmental,  health  and  safety  laws  and regulations  as  in  the  case  of  negligent  or  willful  release of  pollutants  and  contaminants  into  the  atmosphere,  the soil,  water  or  groundwater  or  exceeding  the  concentration thresholds of contaminants set by the law expose the Company to the incurrence of liabilities associated with compensation for  environmental,  health  or  safety  damage  and  expenses for environmental remediation and clean-up. Furthermore, in the case of violation of certain rules regarding the safeguard of the environment and the health and safety of employees, contractors, and other collaborators of the Company, and of communities, the Company may incur liabilities in connection with the negligent or willful violations of laws by its employees as per Italian Law Decree No. 231/2001.\n\nManagement  expects  that  the  Group  will  continue  to  incur significant  amounts  of  operating  expenses  and  expenditures in the foreseeable future to comply with laws and regulations and to safeguard the environment and the health and safety of  employees,  contractors  and  communities  involved  by  the Company operations, including:\n\n- \u00b7 costs to prevent, control, eliminate or reduce certain types of  air,  soil  and  water  emissions  and  handle  waste  and other  hazardous  materials,  including  the  costs  incurred in connection with government action to address climate change (see the specific section below on climate-related risks);\n- \u00b7 remedial and clean-up measures related to environmental contamination  or  accidents  at  various  sites,  including those owned by third parties, as well as decommissioning costs  of  productive  infrastructures  and  well  plugging  of industrial hubs and oil and gas fields once production and manufacturing activities are discontinued;\n- \u00b7 damage compensation claimed by individuals and entities, including local, regional or state administrations in case Eni is found liable of a HSE incident, contamination, pollution of groundwater, soil or the atmosphere, or violations of HSE laws.\n\nAs a further consequence of any new laws and regulations or  other  factors,  like  the  actual  or  alleged  occurrence  of",

Furthermore,  in  certain  situations  where  Eni  is  not  the operator, the Company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks.\n\n## c) The Group is exposed to operational risks in connection with the transportation of hydrocarbons\n\nAll of Eni's segments of operations involve, to varying degrees, the transportation of hydrocarbons. Risks in transportation activities depend on several factors and variables, including the  hazardous  nature  of  the  products  transported  due  to their flammability and toxicity, the transportation methods utilized  (pipelines,  shipping,  river  freight,  rail,  road  and gas  distribution  networks),  the  volumes  involved  and  the sensitivity of the regions through which the transport passes (quality of infrastructure, population density, environmental considerations). All modes of transportation of hydrocarbons are  particularly  susceptible  to  risks  of  blowout,  fire  and loss of containment and, given that normally high volumes are involved, could present significant risks to people, the environment and the property.\n\n## d)  The Group is not insured against all potential HSE risks\n\nEni retains worldwide third-party liability insurance coverage, which is designed to hedge part of the liabilities associated with  damage  to  third  parties,  loss  of  value  to  the  Group's assets  related  to  adverse  events  and  in  connection  with environmental clean-up and remediation. Management believes that its insurance coverage is in line with industry practice and is enough to cover normal risks in its operations. However,  the  Company  is  not  insured  against  all  potential risks. In the event of a major environmental disaster, such as the incident which occurred at the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico several years ago, Eni's third-party liability insurance would  not  provide  any  material  coverage  and  thus  the Company's liability would far exceed the maximum coverage provided by its insurance. The loss Eni could suffer in case of a disaster of material proportions would depend on all the facts and circumstances of the event and would be subject to a whole range of uncertainties, including legal uncertainty as to the scope of liability for consequential damages, which may include economic damage not directly connected to the disaster. The Company cannot guarantee that it will not suffer any uninsured loss and there can be no guarantee, particularly in the case of a major environmental disaster or industrial accident, that such a loss would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest significant financial  resources to continuously upgrade the methods and systems for safeguarding the reliability of its plants, production facilities, well execution,  vessels,  transport  and  storage infrastructures,  the  safety  and  the  health  of  its  employees, contractors,  local  communities,  and  the  environment,  to prevent risks, to comply with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unforeseen incidents. However, these measures may ultimately not be completely successful in preventing and/or altogether eliminating risks of adverse events. Failure to properly manage these risks as well as accidental events like human errors, unexpected system failure, sabotages, cyberattacks or other unexpected drivers could cause any if the incidents described herein of various magnitude which could lead in a worst case scenario serious consequences, including loss of life, damage to properties, environmental pollution, legal liabilities and/or damage claims and consequently a disruption in operations and potential economic losses that could have a material and adverse effect on the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## Legal, it and financial risks\n\n## a)  Eni is exposed to the risk of material environmental liabilities  in connection with pending litigation\n\nEni has incurred in the past and may incur in the future material environmental liabilities in connection with the environmental impact of its past and present industrial activities which has given  rise  to  litigation  with  administrative  bodies  and  third parties. Eni is also exposed to claims under environmental requirements and, from time to time, such claims have been made  against  the  Company.  Furthermore,  environmental regulations  in  Italy  and  elsewhere  typically  impose  strict liability. Strict liability means that in some situations Eni could be  exposed  to  liability  for  clean-up  and  remediation  costs, environmental damage, and other damages as a result of Eni's conduct of operations that was lawful at the time it occurred or of the management of industrial hubs by prior operators or other third parties, who were subsequently taken over by Eni. In addition, plaintiffs may seek to obtain compensation for  damage  resulting  from  events  of  contamination  and pollution or in case the Company is found liable for violations of any environmental laws or regulations. Due to the history and development of the Group, Eni is particularly exposed to this kind of risk in Italy. The Group is performing remediation and  cleaning-up  activities  at  several  Italian  industrial  hub where  the  Group's  products  were  produced,  processed, stored, distributed, or sold, such as chemical plants, mineralmetallurgic plants, refineries, and other facilities, which were",

Eni  has  been  alleged  to  be  liable  for  having  polluted  and contaminated  proprietary  or  concession  areas  where  those dismissed industrial hubs were located. State or local public administrations  have  sued  Eni  for  environmental  and  other damages  and  for  clean-up  and  remediation  measures  in addition to those which were performed by the Company, or which the Company has committed to performing, including allegations  of  violations  of  criminal  laws  (for  example  for alleged environmental crimes such as failure to perform soil or  groundwater  reclamation,  environmental  disaster  and contamination, discharge of toxic materials, amongst others). Although Eni believes that it may not be held liable for having exceeded in the past pollution thresholds that are unlawful according to current regulations, but were allowed by laws then effective, or because the Group took over operations from third parties, it cannot be excluded that Eni could potentially incur such environmental liabilities. Eni's financial statements account for provisions relating to the expected costs to clean up and remediate contaminated areas and groundwater at Eni's shut-down Italian sites, where legal or constructive obligations exist and the associated costs can be reasonably estimated in a reliable manner, representing management's best estimates of the Company's existing environmental liabilities.\n\nAlthough the Company has provided for known environmental obligations  that  are  probable  and  reasonably  estimable,  it is likely that the Company will continue to incur additional liabilities.  The  amount  of  additional  future  costs  are  not fully  determinable  due  to  such  factors  as  the  unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the Company's liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. These future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, but the Company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.\n\n## b) Risks related to legal proceedings and compliance with anticorruption legislation\n\nEni is the defendant in a number of civil and criminal actions and  administrative  proceedings.  In  future  years  Eni  may incur  significant  losses  due  to:  (i)  uncertainty  regarding the final outcome of each proceeding; (ii) the occurrence of new  developments  that  management  could  not  take  into consideration  when  evaluating  the  likely  outcome  of  each proceeding in order to accrue the risk provisions as of the date of the latest financial statements or to judge a negative outcome only as possible or to conclude that a contingency\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nloss could not be estimated reliably; (iii) the emergence of new  evidence  and  information;  and  (iv)  underestimation  of probable future losses due to circumstances that are often inherently difficult to estimate. Certain legal proceedings and investigations in which Eni or its subsidiaries or its officers and employees are defendants involve the alleged breach of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and other ethical misconduct. Ethical misconduct and noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, including noncompliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, by Eni, its officers and employees, its partners, agents or others that act on the Group's behalf, could expose Eni and its employees to criminal and civil penalties and could be damaging to Eni's reputation and shareholder value.\n\n## c)  Risks from acquisitions\n\nEni  is constantly  monitoring  the  market  in  search  of opportunities to acquire individual assets or companies with a view of achieving its growth targets or complementing its asset portfolio. Acquisitions entail an execution risk - the risk that the acquirer will not be able to effectively integrate the purchased assets to achieve expected synergies. In addition, acquisitions entail a financial risk - the risk of not being able to recover the purchase costs of acquired assets, in case of a prolonged decline in the market prices of commodities. Eni may also incur unanticipated costs or assume unexpected liabilities and losses in connection with companies or assets it acquires. If  the  integration  and  financial  risks  related  to  acquisitions materialize, expected synergies from acquisition may fall short of  management's  targets  and  Eni's  financial  performance and shareholders' returns may be adversely affected. At the beginning of 2024, Eni completed the acquisition of the group Neptune Energy with a transaction value of \u20ac2 billion, which represent the largest acquisition made by Eni in recent years and this deal could entail integration risks.\n\n## d)  Eni's crisis management systems may be ineffective\n\nEni has developed contingency plans to continue or recover operations  following  a  disruption  or  incident.  An  inability  to restore or replace critical capacity to an agreed level within an agreed period could prolong the impact of any disruption and could severely affect business, operations and financial results. Eni has crisis management plans and the capability to deal with emergencies at every level of its operations. If Eni does not respond or is not seen to respond in an appropriate manner to either an external or internal crisis, this could adversely impact the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.",

The Group's IT systems, some of which are managed by third parties, are susceptible to being compromised, damaged, disrupted or shutdown due to failures during the process of upgrading  or  replacing  software,  databases  or  components, power  or  network  outages,  hardware  failures,  cyberattacks (viruses, computer intrusions), user errors or natural disasters. The  cyber  threat  is  constantly  evolving.  The  oil  and  gas industry  is  subject  to  fast-evolving  risks  from  cyber  threat actors, including nation states, criminals, terrorists, hacktivists and insiders. Attacks are becoming more sophisticated with regularly renewed techniques while the digital transformation amplifies  exposure  to  these  cyber  threats.  The  adoption  of new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) or the migration to the cloud, as well as the evolution of architectures for increasingly interconnected systems, are all areas where cyber  security  is  a  very  important  issue.  The  Group  and  its service providers may not be able to prevent third parties from breaking  into  the  Group's  IT  systems,  disrupting  business operations or communications infrastructure through denial of service, attacks, or gaining access to confidential or sensitive information held in the system. The Group, like many companies, has been and expects to continue to be the target of attempted cybersecurity  attacks.  While  the  Group  has  not  experienced any such attack that has had a material impact on its business, the Group cannot guarantee that its security measures will be sufficient to prevent a material disruption, breach or compromise in the future. As a result, the Group's activities and assets could sustain serious damage, services to clients could be interrupted, material intellectual property could be divulged and, in some cases, personal injury, property damage, environmental harm and regulatory violations could occur. If any of the risks set out above materialise, they could adversely impact the Group's results  of  operations,  cash  flow,  liquidity,  business  prospects, financial condition, and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's share.\n\n## f)  Violations of data protection laws carry fines and expose the  Company and/or its employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits\n\nData protection laws and regulations apply to Eni and its joint ventures  and  associates  in  the  vast  majority  of  countries in  which  they  do  business.  The  General  Data  Protection Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  (GDPR)  came  into  effect  in  May 2018 and increased penalties up to a maximum of 4% of global\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nannual turnover for breach of the regulation. The GDPR requires mandatory breach notification, a standard also followed outside of  the  EU  (particularly  in  Asia).  Non-compliance  with  data protection laws could expose Eni to regulatory investigations, which could result in fines and penalties as well as harm the Company's reputation. In addition to imposing fines, regulators may also issue orders to stop processing personal data, which could disrupt operations. The Company could also be subject to litigation from persons or corporations allegedly affected by  data  protection  violations.  Violation  of  data  protection laws is a criminal offence in some countries, and individuals can be imprisoned or fined. If any of the risks set out above materialise, they could adversely impact the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition,  and  shareholder  returns,  including  dividends,  the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## g)  Eni is exposed to treasury and trading risks, including liquidity  risk,  interest  rate  risk,  foreign  exchange  risk,  commodity price risk and credit risk and may incur substantial losses in connection with those risks\n\nEni's business is exposed to the risk that changes in interest rates, foreign  exchange  rates  or  the  prices  of  energy commodities and products will adversely affect the value of assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The Group does not hedge its exposure to volatile hydrocarbons prices in  its  business  of  developing  and  extracting  hydrocarbons reserves  and  other  types  of  commodity  exposures  (e.g. exposure to the volatility of refining margins and of certain portions  of  the  gas  long-term  supply  portfolio)  except  for specific  markets  or  business  conditions.  The  Group  has established risk management procedures and enters financial derivatives  contracts  to  hedge  its  exposures  to  different commodity  indexations  and  to  currency  and  interest  rates risks.  However,  hedging  may  not  function  as  expected.  In addition,  Eni  undertakes  commodity  trading  to  optimize commercial margins or with a view of profiting from expected movements  in  market  prices.  Although  Eni  believes  it  has established sound risk management procedures to monitor and control commodity trading, this activity involves elements of  forecasting  and  Eni  is  exposed  to  the  risk  of  incurring significant losses if prices develop contrary to management expectations and to the risk of default of counterparties.\n\nEni is exposed to the risks of unfavorable movements in exchange rates primarily because Eni's consolidated financial statements are prepared in Euros, whereas Eni's main subsidiaries in the Exploration & Production sector are utilizing the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. This translation risk is unhedged. As a rule of thumb, a depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro",

Based on the methodologies used by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, a potential downgrade of Italy's credit rating may have a potential knock-on effect on the credit rating of Italian issuers such as Eni and make it more likely that the credit rating of the debt instruments issued by the Company could be downgraded.\n\nEni is exposed to credit risk. Eni's counterparties could default, could  be  unable  to  pay  the  amounts  owed  to  it  in  a  timely manner or meet their performance obligations under contractual\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\narrangements.  These  events  could  cause  the  Company  to recognize loss provisions with respect to amounts owed to it by debtors of the Company and cashflow shortfall.\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the Group may not be available, or that the Group is unable to sell its assets on the marketplace to meet short-term financial requirements and to settle obligations. Such a situation would negatively affect the Group's results of operations and cash flows as it would result in Eni incurring higher borrowing expenses to meet its obligations or, under the worst conditions, the inability of Eni to continue as a going concern. If any of the risks set out above materializes, this could adversely impact the Group's results  of  operations,  cash  flow,  liquidity,  business  prospects, financial condition, and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.",

In addition, the NFI includes the disclosure requirements for listed companies as stipulated in Article 8 of EU Regulation 852/2020. In continuity with previous editions, the document is structured according to the three levers of the integrated business model, Carbon Neutrality by 2050, Operational Excellence and Alliances for Development, which aim to create long-term value for all stakeholders. The contents of the 'Carbon Neutrality by 2050' chapter have been organised according to the voluntary recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board. In addition, the main United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which constitute an important reference for Eni in the conduct of its activities, are mentioned in the various chapters. The NFI is included in the Management Report in the Annual Report, to meet the information needs of Eni stakeholders in a clear and concise manner, further favouring the integrated disclosure of financial and non-financial information. In order to avoid duplication of information and ensure that disclosures are as concise as possible, the NFI provides integrated disclosures, which may include references to other sections of the Management Report, the Corporate Governance and Shareholding Structure Report and the Report on Remuneration Policy and remuneration paid, when the issues required by Legislative Decree 254/2016 are already contained therein or for further details. Specifically, the Management Report describes the Eni business model and governance, the main results and targets, the integrated risk management system and the risk and uncertainty factors in which the main risks, possible impacts and treatment actions are detailed, in line with the disclosure requirements of Italian regulations. The NFI contains detailed information on corporate policies, management and organisational models, an in-depth analysis of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) risks, the strategy on the topics covered, the most important initiatives of the year, the main performances with related comments and the 2023 materiality analysis. In the 2023 NFI, the 'core' metrics defined by the World Economic Forum 2 (WEF) in the 2020 White Paper 'Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism - Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation' were also included. As in previous years, on the occasion of the Shareholders' Meeting, Eni will also publish Eni for 2023 - A Just Transition, the voluntary sustainability report that aims to further enhance non-financial information. The Eni for 2023 - Human Rights 3 report is scheduled to be published during the year.

Eni recognises and supports the economy's transition process towards a low carbon model and the objectives of the COP 21 in Paris. A decarbonization strategy for the Group's products and industrial processes was therefore developed that aims for carbon neutrality by 2050. Furthermore, the mission integrates the UN's 'Sustainable Development Goals'. Eni intends to contribute to these, aware that business development can no longer be separated from them. Eni's commitment is to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2050, with a view to sharing social and economic benefits with workers, the value chain, communities and customers in an inclusive, transparent and socially equitable manner. First and foremost, the energy transition is a technological transition: only with solid industrial, innovative capacity, as well as a willingness to combine forces and skills, will Eni be able to implement the transition\n\nby improving at the same time the opportunities for people. Eni is  working  to  ensure  that  the  decarbonization  process  offers opportunities for converting existing activities and developing new production supply chains with significant opportunities for workers, economies and communities in the Countries where the company operates.  At  the  same  time,  Eni  is  committed  to  managing  any potential negative impact that may be associated with the energy transition on workers, communities, consumers and suppliers. This will be achieved by involving all of the parties, especially unions and workers representatives, institutions, community representatives and industry organisations. In addition, to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs and to the growth of the countries in which it operates, Eni is committed to building alliances with national and international development  cooperation  actors.  Explained  in  the  mission,  this approach  is  also  confirmed  by  the  application  from  January  1 st , 2021  of  the  2020  Corporate  Governance  Code,  which  identifies 'sustainable success' as the guiding objective for the management body's action and consists of creating long-term value for the benefit of shareholders, taking into account the interests of other relevant stakeholders (see pp. 32-43).\n\n## MAIN REGULATORY INSTRUMENTS, GUIDELINES AND MANAGEMENT MODELS RELATED TO THE SCOPE OF LEGISLATIVE DECREE 254/2016\n\nIn  order  to  implement  the  mission  in  actual  practice  and  to ensure  integrity,  transparency,  correctness  and  effectiveness  in its processes, Eni adopts rules for the performance of corporate activities and the exercise of powers, ensuring compliance with the general principles of traceability and segregation.\n\nAll  of  Eni's  operating  activities  can  be  grouped  into  a  map  of processes functional to the corporate activities and integrated with control requirements and principles set out in the compliance and governance models and based on the By-laws, the Code of Ethics and the Corporate Governance Code 4 , the Model 231 5 , Eni's control system for financial reporting 6 principles and the CoSO Report Framework 7 .\n\nOn 26 January 2023, the Eni SpA Board of Directors updated the fundamental  lines  of  the  Regulatory  System  Policy  after  updating and reviewing a project that led to an evolution in the architecture, instruments  and  rules  of  the  Regulatory  System  in  line  with  the operational and governance needs required by Eni's new strategy, based on an increasing diversification of activities and types of companies\n\nmanaged. It confirms an architecture based on four levels, with both management and co-ordination instruments towards subsidiaries and corporate operations. Roles and responsibilities have been updated in line with the Regulatory System's new architecture and instruments. With regard to the types of instruments that make up the Regulatory System:\n\n- \u00b7 the Ethics, Compliance & Governance (ECG) 8 Policies consist of 'Fundamental Guidelines' and 'Application Modalities' and define (i) Eni's values and principles (Ethics); (ii) a systematic framework (model) for the implementation of specific regulatory requirements, regulations  or  international  frameworks  (Compliance);  (iii)  the rules of reference for Corporate Governance, based on regulatory and  statutory  requirements,  best  practices  and  international frameworks  (Governance).  They  identify  roles,  responsibilities, behaviours, information flows, principles and/or control standards aimed  at  pursuing  the  defined  objectives  and  managing  risks. These regulatory instruments cut across the business processes;\n\n(4) On 23 December 2020, the Eni BoD resolved to adhere to the new Code. Therefore, from that date, roles, responsibilities and regulatory instruments must consider the new recommendations on the subject and the BoD's decisions on how to apply these recommendations.\n\n- (5) The Board of Directors approved the latest version of Model 231 on 18 November 2021.\n- (6) US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n- (7) Framework issued by the 'Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (CoSO)'.\n- (8) ECG Policies are mandatory unless incompatible with specific regulations applicable to companies or organisational specificities for listed subsidiaries.",

Where deemed necessary, Global Procedures can also be business-specific;\n- \u00b7 Company Procedures are issued and applicable to each company. Eni  SpA's  Company  Procedures  define  the  detailed  design  of end-to-end  sub-processes/operating  methods  related  to  ECG subject  areas,  where  there  is  no  need  to  ensure  management and coordination activities. Subsidiaries adopt Global Procedures by  drawing  up  a  Company  Procedure,  transposing  operational requirements and adapting to local needs. In addition, subsidiaries may  issue  their  own  Company  Procedures  governing  subprocesses/activities specific to their own reality;\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE CODE\n\nPRINCIPLES OF ENI'S FINANCIAL\n\nREPORTING CONTROL SYSTEM\n\nPOLICY ETHICS, COMPLIANCE & GOVERNANCE\n\nPROCESS MSG\n\nGLOBAL PROCEDURE/COMPANY PROCEDURE\n\nOPERATING INSTRUCTION\n\n- \u00b7 Operating Instructions describe how specific activities, methodologies and/or technical aspects are carried out: (i) a single area/professional  family,  regardless  of  the  corporate  location  of the resources belonging to it (Professional Operating Instructions); (ii) specific business  areas/functions/branches/sites/corporate organisational units (Local Operating Instructions).\n\nThe regulatory instruments are published on the dedicated system accessible from the Company's Intranet site and, in some cases, on the Company's website. In addition, in 2020 Eni updated its Code of Ethics in which it renewed the corporate values that characterise the commitment of Eni people and all third parties who work with the  Company:  integrity,  respect  and  protection  of  human  rights, transparency,  promotion  of  development,  operational  excellence, innovation, teamwork and collaboration.\n\nIn  the  first  of  the  next  two  tables  (pp.  144-145),  in  addition  to  the ECG Policies and Code of Ethics, other Eni regulatory instruments approved  by  the  CEO  and/or  the  BoD  are  also  considered.  The second table (pp. 146-147) shows the management and organisation models, including management systems, multi-year plans, processes and interfunctional working groups.\n\n(9) Process MSGs are normally mandatory, except for specific requirements for unlisted subsidiaries, which have been submitted to the Process Owner for technical evaluation in advance. (10) The operational requirements of the Global Procedures are normally mandatory, except for specific requirements for non-listed subsidiaries, which have been submitted to the Process Owner for technical evaluation in advance.\n\nCoSO REPORT\n\nFRAMEWORK",

Risks are assessed considering both the probability of occurrence and the impacts on Eni's quantitative and qualitative objectives that would occur in a given time frame if the risk occurs; based on the probability of occurrence and impact, risks are also represented in matrices that allow comparison and classification by relevance. The top risks, including the ESG risks, are submitted to the Board of Statutory Auditors (BoSA), the Control and  Risk  Committee  and  the  BoD  half-yearly.  The  company's risk  profile  is  assessed  against  the  objectives  of  the  four-year Strategic Plan, also from a medium-to-long-term perspective. In this context, Climate Change risk is confirmed as one of the main risks. This is also reflected in other risks in the portfolio due to the increasing prominence of legal and regulatory aspects and the scrutiny of the sector by stakeholders (e.g. risk of involvement in HSE investigations and litigation). As the main de-risking action, implementation  of  the  transition  plan  broken  down  as  per  the following guidelines continued:\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT MODEL\n\nTRANSV ERSAL THEMES\n\n| SCOPE OF  LEGISLATIVE  DECREE 254/2016   | RISK EVENT                                                                             | TOP  RISK   | MAIN TREATMENT  ACTIONS                                                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| TRANSVERSAL  RISKS                       | \u00b7  Risks associated with research and development  activities and innovation ecosystem |             | NFI  - Carbon neutrality by 2050 pp. 152-158;  Safety, pp. 166-168: Respect for the Environment,  pp. 168-174                                                 |\n|                                          | \u00b7  Cyber Security                                                                      |             | AR  - Integrated Risk Management, pp. 26-31;  Cyber Security Risk, p. 137                                                                                     |\n|                                          | \u00b7  Relationship with local stakeholders                                                |             | AR  - Integrated Risk Management, pp. 26-31;  Country Risk, pp. 131-132; Specific risks associated  with hydrocarbon exploration and production,  pp. 127-130 |\n|                                          |                                                                                        |             | NFI  - Alliances for development, pp. 183-185                                                                                                                 |\n|                                          | \u00b7  Global security risk and political and social  instability                          |             | AR  - Integrated Risk Management, pp. 26-31;  Country Risk, pp. 131-132                                                                                       |\n|                                          | \u00b7  Risks connected with Corporate governance                                           |             | AR  - Integrated Risk Management, pp. 26-31;                                                                                                                  |\n\nTop risk\n\nUpstream  decarbonization;  development  of  Carbon  Capture  and Storage initiatives for 'hard-to-abate' industrial cycles; expansion of biofuels with feedstock diversification by leveraging vertical integration with  the  agri-business  chain;  transformation  and  repositioning  of the chemicals business towards specialised products such as biobased chemistry and circularity; growth of customer portfolio with progressive decarbonization of the product offered and development of the renewable capacity; initiatives to accelerate the development of breakthrough technologies oriented to decarbonization. Continuing the risk portfolio analysis, the 'biological risk' (referred to as the spread of pandemics and epidemics) continues to decrease thanks to the dwindling global health emergency linked to COVID-19, while the level of alertness in the cyber sphere remains high, with active monitoring of events even outside the Eni boundary, to intercept possible threats and ensure immediate reactivity. For the effects arising from the geopolitical context, please refer to the dedicated paragraph of the AR (p. 122-132). The table below provides a summary view of Eni ESG risks classified according  to  the  areas  of  Legislative  Decree  254/2016.  For  each risk event, the type of risk - top risk and non-top risk - and the page references, where the main treatment actions are set out, are indicated.",

In terms of ensuring transparency for its  stakeholders,  Eni  has  long  been  committed  to  promoting comprehensive and effective disclosure on climate change and confirms its commitment to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board, which Eni has adopted since 2017, the first year applicable for reporting. Disclosure on Carbon Neutrality by 2050 is organised according to the four thematic areas indicated by theTCFD: Governance, Risk Management, Strategy and Metrics and Targets. The key elements of each area are presented below; for further details, please see 'Eni for - A Just Transition' and Eni's disclosure to CDP Climate Change 2023 questionnaire. In addition, Eni has an ongoing monitoring exercise on the development of soft and hard law related to the climate issue, aimed at assessing the resilience of its instruments and their possible adaptation (with particular attention to the recent explication of the issue in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises as of June 2023, the CSRD and ESRS, and the CS3D proposal). This exercise may lead to an integration of corporate climate tools and disclosure.\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\nRole of the BoD. Eni's decarbonization strategy is an integral part of Eni's business strategy and is also implemented through a structured system of Corporate Governance, where the BoD and the CEO play a central role in managing key climate change issues. The Board of Directors, in particular, examines and approves, at the proposal of the CEO, the Strategic Plan (four-year plan and medium/long-term  plan),  which  includes  industrial  business targets,  financial  results  and  sustainability  targets,  including emission targets. Eni's economic and financial exposure to the risks of carbon pricing mechanisms is examined by the BoD both in the phase leading up to the authorisation of each investment and in the following half-yearly monitoring of the entire project portfolio. The BoD is also informed annually on the results of the impairment test carried out on the main Cash Generating Units in the E&P sector. Since 2021, the IEA's Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario has been included among the scenarios for portfolio evaluations  (see  pp.  124-127,  para.  'Climate  Change  Risk'). Finally, the BoD is informed on a quarterly basis on the results of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe risk assessment and monitoring activities related to Eni's top risks, including climate change. Furthermore, with reference to the composition of the BoD, it should be noted that based on the selfassessment conducted, a balanced and diversified BoD emerged. It has been recognised positively for its professionalism in terms of knowledge, experience, skills and the individual contribution each BoD member believes they can bring based on their preparation, motivation and sense of belonging. This also holds for energy transition and sustainability, issues that have characterised the work of the new BoD since the start of its mandate, also through targeted training initiatives. In particular, on these latter issues, since 2014, the Board of Directors has been supported by the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee (SSC). This is an internal council committee set up on a voluntary basis, which performs investigative, advisory and propositional functions in relation to processes,  initiatives  and  activities  aimed  at  overseeing  Eni's commitment to sustainable development along the value chain (for the topics discussed in detail during the year, see pp. 38-40). The SSC facilitates discussion and training on these issues, which are recognised by all Board members as growing in perspective, along with strategy and business issues. Regarding the training of  the  Board  of  Directors,  immediately  after  appointment  of the  bodies,  the  Board  Induction  session  was  conducted  for directors and statutory auditors. Among other topics, it covered issues related to Eni's business related to the decarbonization process  and  environmental  and  social  sustainability.  Specific induction sessions, open to the participation of all directors and statutory auditors, were held on the occasion of SSC meetings to  discuss  issues  of  general  interest,  such  as  (i)  Eni's  energy transition plan and the related energy portfolio transformation objectives; (ii) the strategies pursued in the area of sustainable mobility and decarbonization of the transport sector; (iii) Eni's integrated sustainability model, which establishes its priorities in the Mission and business processes, using a systemic approach, with a specific focus also on the related reporting methods, on a mandatory and voluntary basis, and on the recent evolutions of the reference regulatory framework. In addition, the SSC explored several topics related to climate change, including: the Oil Majors' strategy with regard to the energy transition, Eni's positioning in ESG indices and ratings, energy storage technologies, updates on sustainable finance instruments, and actions and levers to support Oil & Gas in its transition.\n\nRole of management. All company structures are involved in the definition  or  implementation  of  the  carbon  neutrality  strategy that  is  reflected  in  Eni's  organisational  structure  with  the  two",

As of 2019, climate strategy and long-term planning issues are managed by the CFO area through dedicated structures with the aim of overseeing the process of defining Eni's decarbonization objectives and the related portfolio of initiatives. The strategic commitment to carbon footprint reduction is part of the Company's essential goals and is also reflected in the Variable Incentive  Plans  for  the  CEO  and  the  Company's  management, approved by the BoD. In particular, in line with the previous plan, the Long-Term Stock-based Incentive Plan provides specific objectives for  decarbonization,  energy  transition  and  circular  economy projects. These have a total weight of 35%, as per the objectives communicated to the market and with the aim of aligning with the interests of all stakeholders. In line with the previous plan, the Short-Term Incentive Plan is closely linked to Eni's strategic transformation  targets,  including  decarbonization  and  energy transition objectives consistent with the Long-Term Incentive Plan. These have an overall weight of 25% for the CEO and, according to  weights  consistent  with  the  responsibilities  assigned,  for  all Company management.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe process for identifying and assessing climate-related risks is part of Eni's Integrated Risk Management Model (see section 'Integrated Risk Management' of the AR, pp. 26-31) developed to ensure that decisions made consider risks from an integrated, comprehensive  and  forward-looking  perspective.  The  process ensures  the  detection,  consolidation  and  analysis  of  all  Eni's risks and supports the BoD in checking the compatibility of the\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nrisk  profile  with  the  strategic  targets,  in  a  long-term  perspective and  monitoring  the  evolution  of  the  main  risks  and  the  derisking  actions.  Risks,  including  climate  change  are  assessed considering both the probability of occurrence and the impacts on Eni's quantitative and qualitative objectives that would occur in a given time frame if the risk occurs. Risks are also represented in matrices  that  allow  comparison  and  classification  by  relevance. Risks  related  to  climate  change  are  analysed,  assessed  and managed  by  considering  the  TCFD  recommendations,  which refer both to energy transition risks (market scenario, regulatory and technological evolution, reputation issues) and physical risk (acute and chronic) through an integrated transversal approach that involves the responsible functions as well as business lines. Risks related to the implementation of planned strategic actions to mitigate the risk of climate change are also considered. Regarding physical  risk,  Eni  has  adopted  a  structured  risk  management process for the identification  and  analysis  of  assets  exposed  to potential prospective changes in natural events (acute and chronic) in the medium/long-term, which could impact the operability and safety conditions of the assets themselves. This process envisages considering  different  prospective  climate  scenarios,  consistent with different emission scenarios and short (5/10 years), medium (10/20  years)  and  long-term  (20/30  years)  periods.  Based  on information  provided  by  specialist  data  providers,  the  assets' inherent risk is assessed (intrinsic exposure that an asset has with respect to a specific natural event due solely to its location and the evolution of the climate scenario) and the residual risk (risk level assessed after taking into account the mitigations already in place or planned). Assets that are still at risk after mitigation actions are analysed in more detail as part of the Asset Integrity process. The table below summarises the main climate risks and opportunities identified by Eni in relation to the energy transition.

series  of  objectives  that  foresee  Net  Zero  emissions  (Scope  1+2) for the upstream businesses by 2030 and for Eni's group by 2035, then reach Net Zero emissions by 2050 for all Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions associated with the life-cycle of the energy products sold.\n\n- \u00b7 Net  Zero  Carbon  Footprint  Upstream  (Scope  1+2)  @2030,  with intermediate targets of: -50% @2024; -65% @2025 vs. 2018 and Net Zero Carbon Footprint Eni @2035;\n- \u00b7 -35%  Net  GHG  Lifecycle  Emissions  (Scope  1+2+3)  @2030  vs. 2018, -55% @2035, -80% @2040 and Net Zero @2050;\n- \u00b7 -15%  Net  Carbon  Intensity  of  energy  products  sold  @2030  vs. 2018, -50% @2040 and Net Zero @2050.\n\nThe  residual  emissions  will  be  compensated  through  offsets, mainly  from  Natural  Climate  Solutions,  which  by  2050  will contribute to about 5% of the overall reduction of the value chain emissions. This path consists of a multitude of levers depending on market dynamics, in line with the evolution of society and the so-called energy trilemma, i.e. the need to combine the three key objectives of environmental sustainability, security of supply and energy equity.\n\nIn recent years, a significant effort has been made that has already enabled important milestones to be reached and which form the basis for future goals:\n\n- \u00b7 A progressive rebalancing of the upstream portfolio in favour of the gas component is underway, thanks to recent extraordinary transactions (e.g., Neptune Energy and bp Algeria). These operations reflect  a  commitment  to  aim  for  a  production  level  of  the  gas component (which from 2024 includes condensates) more than 60% of total production by 2030, and more than 90% after 2040;\n- \u00b7 The  development  of  biorefining  continues  with  the  Chalmette plant's start-up in the US, with the conversion agreements of the Livorno refinery and the agreements for the potential development of  plants  in  South  Korea  and  Malaysia.  These  actions  are instrumental  in  achieving  a  biorefining  capacity  of  more  than  5 million tonnes by 2030. Eni's agribusiness will grow to account for over 35% of the feedstock processed in Eni's Italian biorefineries by 2027;\n- \u00b7 Progressive increase in Plenitude installed renewable capacity with over 15 GW by 2030, to reach 60 GW in 2050 within a customer base growth to more than 20 million in 2050;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT",

The share of expenditures related to the Oil & Gas business will be gradually reduced, and main investment projects will be evaluated consistently with emission reduction targets and the commitment to gradually phase out investments in 'unabated' activities or products with high emissions as a necessary condition to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century. Spending on zero and lowcarbon activities will amount to \u20ac12.8 billion in the 2024-2027 period. The decarbonization plan is integrated into Eni's financing strategy, which aligns economic and environmental sustainability, and, in 2023, the finalisation of various sustainability-linked bonds, specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 issue of the \u20ac2 billion, five-year bond placed with the Italian retail public;\n- \u00b7 issue of the \u20ac750 million Euro Medium Term Note bond with a term of four years;\n- \u00b7 issue of the \u20ac1 billion, 7-year convertible bond;\n- \u00b7 underwriting of a \u20ac3 billion, five-year committed credit line.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\nHistorically, Eni has been committed to reducing its GHG emissions. Since 2016, it has been among the first in the industry to have defined a series of objectives aimed at improving emissions performance from operated assets. Starting in 2020, Eni increased its ambitions by defining equity-based indicators that will accompany it on the path to Net Zero by 2050. These indicators consider all energy products sold,  including  purchases  from  third  parties,  and  all  emissions generated along the entire supply chain.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nTo  further  strengthen  its  commitment,  the  new  indicators  are accounted for by adopting a methodology developed in cooperation with independent experts that considers all energy products sold, including  purchases  from  third  parties,  and  all  emissions  they generate  along  the  entire  supply  chain  (well-to-wheel  approach). This methodology complements reporting according to international standards (GHG Protocol, IPIECA). All the indicators are subject to third-party verification as part of Eni's GHG data verification process (see the Eni for 2022 - Sustainability Performance for the auditor's report and GHG Statement).\n\nThe performance of the key equity indicators on a net basis (offset through high-quality carbon credits, mainly.\n\nNet GHG Lifecycle Emissions : this indicator refers to the absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions associated with all energy products sold by Eni, including both those deriving from its own production and those purchased from third parties. In 2023, the indicator decreased by about 5% compared to 2022, mainly driven by the decline in gas sales in the GGP sector. Carbon credits offsetted 5.9 MtCO 2 eq. (vs. 3 MtCO 2 eq. in 2022) 12 .\n\nNet Carbon Intensity : this indicator is calculated as the ratio of Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions to the energy content of energy products sold by Eni. In 2023, there was a slight reduction in the indicator (-1%) mainly due to the lower emission impact of the third-party gas portfolio mix and the gradual growth of renewable energy production. These metrics are integrated with specific  indicators to monitor operational emissions:\n\nNet Carbon Footprint Upstream : the indicator considers Scope 1+2 GHG emissions from all upstream assets operated by Eni and by third parties. In 2023, the indicator improved by about 10% compared to 2022 due to a decrease in emissions.\n\nNet Carbon Footprint Eni : the indicator considers Scope 1+2 GHG emissions from activities operated by Eni and by third parties. In 2023, the indicator improved by about 13%, mainly due to a decrease in emissions related to the Power 13 , GGP, Upstream and Chemicals businesses.\n\nStarting  this  year,  an  additional  indicator  has  been  introduced: Net GHG Emissions . The indicator includes all group Scope 1+2 emissions and Scope 3 emissions from the use of products sold (cat. 11) calculated as an equity share of upstream production, consistently  with  international  and  industry  standards  (GHG Protocol and IPIECA). This indicator differs from Net GHG Lifecycle",

In 2023, Net GHG Emissions were broadly in line (+3%) with 2022.\n\nWith reference to operated/cooperated assets , the following is a summary of the performance of the main indicators relating to  flaring  and  methane,  100%  accounted  for  according  to  the operator criterion.\n\nThe volumes of hydrocarbons sent for routine flaring Upstream 14 decreased by around 8% in 2023 compared to 2022, mainly due to energy efficiency and flaring-down interventions in Egypt, Nigeria, and Ghana.\n\nMethane  Upstream  emissions decreased  significantly  (-21%) compared to 2022 thanks to the implementation of LDAR (Leak Detection And Repair) fugitive emissions and methane monitoring campaigns, carried out in line with the requirements of the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 on Upstream 15 , assets, as well as the impact of portfolio operations.\n\nUpstream methane emissions intensity is improving and equal to 0.06%, which is in line with the commitment to maintain it below 0.2%.\n\nThe performance of additional indicators related to the assets operated/co-operated :\n\nDirect Scope 1 GHG emissions in 2023 amounted to 38.7 million tons of CO 2 eq., a slight reduction compared to 2022, mainly due to the decrease of emissions in the Chemicals, Power and GGP business, partially compensated for by the increase in the Upstream\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nsector. The Upstream Scope 1 emission intensity index is broadly in line with 2022 (+0.5%).\n\nIndirect Scope 2 GHG emissions decreased by about 8% in 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower consumption in the Chemicals and Upstream sector. These emissions are related to the purchase of energy from third parties for the consumption of the operated assets and are marginal for Eni as electricity is generated mainly through its own installations.\n\nThe energy efficiency interventions implemented throughout the year resulted in actual primary energy savings compared to baseline consumption of about 394 ktoe/year, resulting mainly from upstream projects (about 86%), with an emission reduction benefit of about 1 million tons of CO 2 eq. If Scope 2 emissions, i.e., those from power and heat purchase, are also considered, the net CO 2 savings from energy saving projects amount to about 1.03 million tons of CO 2 eq. In 2023, Eni's consumption of primary sources  increased  overall  due  to  the  entry  of  new  upstream assets in Algeria (In Amenas and In Salah), with an increase in fuel gas consumption. The total energy consumed was 516.2 million GJ: E&P 234 million GJ, Plenitude & Power 159 million GJ, R&M and Chemicals 110 million GJ, Global Gas & LNG Portfolio 12 GJ and Corporate and Other businesses 1.4 million GJ.\n\nIn 2023, the renewables business reached an installed capacity of renewable sources of 3.1 GW (+35% compared to 2022), an increase of approximately 0.8 GW compared to December 31, 2022. This is mainly due to the acquisitions made in Spain (Bonete) and the United States (Kellam), the organic development of projects in Italy, Spain and Kazakhstan, as well as the acquisition of three photovoltaic plants in the United States with a total capacity of approximately 0.38  GW  (agreement  signed  in  December  2023  and  transaction closing in February 2024). Renewable energy production reached 4.2 TWh (+50% compared to 2022), mainly due to the contribution of acquired assets and the commissioning of organically developed projects. The production of biofuels increased (+48% compared to 2022), benefiting from the contribution of the Chalmette biorefinery and higher volumes processed at the Gela biorefinery. Production of biofuel is being increased through the acquisition of a 50% stake in the Chalmette biorefinery in the US.",

In particular, this expenditure includes the issues of biorefining, chemistry and energy production from renewable sources (including biomass); energy storage; CO 2 capture, transport, storage and reuse; carbon  footprint  reduction  of  processes;  gas  utilisation  for  blue hydrogen production; production of green hydrogen.\n\nClimate  disclosure: transparency  in  climate  related  reporting and the strategy implemented have enabled Eni to be confirmed, once again in 2023, as a leading company in CDP Climate Change Programme. The A- rating achieved by Eni is higher than both the global average (C) and the sector rating of B, on a rating scale of D (lowest) to A (highest). Furthermore the assessment of Carbon Tracker, independent think tank focused on  transition issues, in 2023 placed Eni first among its peers for the completeness of the GHG emissions methodology, the medium/long-term intermediate targets and the emission boundary extended to the entire company. Recently, the CA100+, leading shareholder engagement initiative on the issues of climate change, confirmed Eni, for the third year in a row, as one of the companies most aligned with the Net Zero Company  Benchmark  requirements  regarding  GHG  emission reduction targets, governance and climate disclosure. The CA100+ valuation is one of the primary references for the dialogue with investors on aspects related to climate strategy.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nCommitment  to  partnerships: partnerships  are  one  of  the strategic drivers of Eni's decarbonization path, as the company has long been working with the academic world, civil society, institutions  and  businesses  to  promote  the  energy  transition, making  it  possible  to  exploit  and  generate  knowledge,  share best practices and support initiatives that can simultaneously create value for the company and its stakeholders. As part of its  partnerships  and  advocacy  activities,  Eni  has  developed responsible  climate  change  engagement  guidelines,  to  which it adheres within the associations to which it belongs. It also periodically assesses the alignment between its own positioning and that of the associations in which it participates. Among the many international climate initiatives Eni participates in, the 'Oil and Gas Climate Initiative' (OGCI) plays a key role in accelerating the Oil & Gas industry's response to the challenges of climate change.  Established  in  2014  by  five  companies,  including  Eni, OGCI  now  counts  twelve  Oil  &  Gas  companies,  representing about one-third of the global hydrocarbon production. The CEOs of  the  participating  companies  sit  on  the  initiative's  Steering Committee. In addition, Eni participates in the multi-donor trust fund, launched by the World Bank at COP28, to support NOCs in  reducing  methane  emissions  and  flaring  (Global  Flaring  and Methane Reduction). At the last COP, Eni adhered to the Oil & Gas Decarbonisation Charter, an initiative that includes a commitment for  of  O&G  companies  to  achieve  'Net  Zero  Scope  1  and  2' emissions operated by 2050, 'near zero methane emissions' by 2030 and 'ending routine flaring' by 2030.\n\n## KPIS (a) RELATED TO MEDIUM-LONG TERM TARGETS\n\n|                                               |                           | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | Target                       |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|------------------------------|\n| Net Carbon Footprint upstream (Scope 1+2)     | (million tonnes CO 2 eq.) | 8.9    | 9.9    | 11.0   | UPS Net Zero @2030           |\n| Net Carbon Footprint Eni (Scope1+2)           |                           | 26.1   | 29.9   | 33.6   | ENI Net Zero @2035           |\n| Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions (Scope 1+2+3) (b) |                           | 398    | 419    | 456    | Net Zero @2050               |\n| Net Carbon Intensity (Scope 1+2+3) (b)        | (gCO 2 eq./MJ)            | 65.6   | 66.3   | 66.5   | Net Zero @2050               |\n| Renewable installed capacity (c)              | (MW)                      | 3,056  | 2,256  | 1,188  | 15 GW @2030                  |\n| Capacity of biorefineries                     | (milion tonnes/year)      | 1.65   | 1.10   | 1.10   | >5 million tonnes/year @2030 |\n\n- (a) Indicators accounted for on an equity basis.\n- (b) GHG emissions associated with the lifecycle of energy products sold by Eni.

These elements allow Eni to seize the opportunities deriving from the possible developments in the energy market and to progress its transformation path.\n\n## PEOPLE\n\nThe Eni business model is based on internal competencies, an asset in which Eni continues to invest to ensure their alignment with business needs, in line with its long-term strategy. Planned evolution  of  business  activities,  strategic  directions  and  the challenges posed by changes in technology and the labour market in general imply an important commitment to increase the value of human capital over time through upskilling and reskilling initiatives, aimed at enriching or redirecting the set of skills required. In 2023, initiatives continued to communicate and assimilate a new model of capabilities and behaviours aimed at effectively managing the transition, initiating processes to revise professional models and upgrading  skills  to  promote  the  growth  of  more  complete  and integrated  professionalism.  Concerning  the  management  of  its resources, Eni launched a new model for resource management that defines development paths throughout the corporate lifecycle. These paths are diversified and consistent with the new business model  to  enhance  the  various  professional  skills  and  talents in  an  inclusive  logic  while  fostering  people's  motivation,  sense of  belonging  and  proactivity.  In  this  respect,  the  appointment processes for about 350 senior profiles identified within the planned pathways were finalised in 2023. The revision of the professional models and self-evaluation of the skills of about 3,500 resources was completed, and the models were updated to involve a further 7,500  resources.  In  addition,  internal  mobility  initiatives  have resumed, recording an increase of around 10% in 2023 over the previous year, thanks to improvements to the internal job posting site  and  international  mobility  initiatives.  These  actions  have strengthened a cross-cultural approach that enhances the richness of continuous exchange and comparison between contexts.\n\n## A CULTURE OF PLURALITY AND PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT\n\nEni's  approach  to  Diversity  &  Inclusion  (D&I)  is  based  on  the fundamental principles of non-discrimination, equal opportunities and inclusion of all forms of diversity, as well as of integrating and balancing work with personal and family concerns of Eni people.\n\nThe focus on an inclusive culture is stated in the Mission and in the body of regulations, expanded in November 2023, when the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfirst  specific  Policy  on  that  was  issued,  which  includes  the  D&I model, the reference principles and the commitments made by Eni in its activities in Italy and abroad. In particular, the principles and  commitments  relate  to:  (i)  enhancement  of  diversity,  with a  commitment  to  recognising  the  expression  of  individual characteristics and to preventing discrimination in relation to colour, gender, religion, ethnic origin, political opinion, social or national origin, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, social status, age or any other form of diversity covered by international law. With this in mind, Eni supports the development of an international business based on fairness, dignity, equal opportunities, dissemination of ethical values and integration; (ii) equity, ensuring a physically and socially fair work environment, providing each person with the tools necessary to have equal access to company resources and opportunities, freedom of expression and promoting gender equality and women's empowerment at work, in business practices, and in relations with communities, integrating a gender equality perspective into the processes and activities promoted, including through the implementation of specific assessments; (iii) uniqueness, which promotes listening to each employee to develop an organisational culture that enhances the distinctive features of each one; (iv) inclusiveness, which promotes a culture of plurality for  a  participatory  work  environment  that  supports  listening, dialogue and the dissemination of an inclusive and collaborative mindset starting from a strong management commitment aimed at valuing diversity.\n\nOverall coordination is ensured by a dedicated unit that develops the D&I strategy and coordinates the portfolio of initiatives. The other corporate functions ensure the success of the inclusion initiatives, defining objectives (performance management) for the development of  human  resources.  To  consolidate  individual  commitment  and empowerment,  listening,  awareness-raising  and  communication actions  are  organised  on  D&I  issues.  In  particular,  the  following initiatives should be noted in 2023: (i) D&I Matters, a training course focused on certain areas of diversity, analysed under the lens of unconscious  bias  and  on  actions  to  overcome  stereotypes;  (ii) EniforInclusion, an internal communication format for sharing stories of inclusion with the involvement of Eni people and external expert",

In addition, partnerships were set up to strengthen women's  empowerment  and  entrepreneurship  (e.g.  Women  X Impact, collaboration in Valore D initiatives).\n\nEni has been monitoring the wage gap between women and men on an annual basis, finding a substantial alignment of remuneration. In  addition,  in  relation  to  ILO  (International  Labour  Organization) standards, Eni performs annual analyses on the remuneration of local personnel in the main Countries in which it operates, which show  minimum  salary  levels  of  Eni  personnel  significantly  higher than both the minimum legal salaries and the minimum market remuneration  levels,  identified  for  each  Country  by  international providers  (for  further  information,  see  Report  on  Remuneration Policy and remuneration paid 2024).\n\n## TRAINING\n\nEni considers training a fundamental tool to support change and ensures  its  use  through  classroom  training  (with  an  increase  in hours  from  43%  in  2022  to  57%  in  2023)  and  remote  learning. Energy transition and digital transition are two central areas in the development of Eni people's skills that are in line with corporate strategy.  Eni's  effort  is  to  impact  soft  skills  and  hard  skills  by accompanying and supporting people in the ongoing transformation process.  This  includes  training  initiatives  on  topics  such  as  the circular  economy,  decarbonization  and  renewable  energy,  aimed at  ensuring  continuous  upskilling.  In  2023,  Eni  made  a  significant commitment to D&I issues through a path available to all employees and to 'Zero Tolerance: Violence and Harassment in the workplace', which affected over 80% of Eni's colleagues.\n\n## INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS\n\nIn Italy, the expansion contract signed between Eni, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies and the trade unions, valid for two years (2022-2023), was also confirmed in 2023 as an instrument to  support  the  energy  transition  transformation.  It  allows  for\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\ngenerational change by including new key professional figures for the decarbonization process, the implementation of an essential investment  for  training  with  up-skilling  and  reskilling  paths, and at the same time a critical turnover plan. In 2023, meetings continued  with  trade  unions  under  the  TOGETHER-INSIEME Protocol 'Industrial relations model to support the energy transition process'.  New  initiatives  were  launched  to  strengthen  welfare with interventions in the areas of health, social security, income support, housing and support for family management envisaged by NOI-Protocol on initiatives and services for the well-being of Eni people. The aim of the NOI Protocol is to seek a fair balance of work activities, with an increasingly personal and social approach that is closer to people's needs, by improving the existing range of\n\nservices, making them easier to access throughout the territory. Abroad, in July 2023, the international industrial relations meetings of the European Works Council (EWC) of Eni employees and the European Observatory  for  Health,  Safety  and  the  Environment  were  held  in Madrid, and, in November, the annual meeting envisaged by the Global Framework  Agreement  on  International  Relations  and  Corporate Social  Responsibility.  Among  other  topics,  the  meetings  focused on  an  in-depth  review  of  the  Strategic  Plan  2023-2026,  the  main employment and health and safety indicators, and included training on recent supranational labour guidelines. On the other hand, the regular meetings of the EWC Select Committee deepened the examination of some specific businesses and information on significant organisational changes in 2023. The gradual extension of Smart Working to foreign companies also continued throughout the year.\n\n## CORPORATE WELFARE AND WORK-LIFE BALANCE\n\nEni  has  a  system  of  corporate  welfare  and  benefits  that  includes a set of services, initiatives and instruments aimed at improving the  well-being  of  employees.  Eni's  Smart  Working  (SW)  model (agreement signed in October 2021) provides all employees in Italy with 8 days/month for office sites and 4 days/month for operational sites and numerous Welfare options to support not only parenting and disability but also the health of individuals or their cohabiting family members. It is further enriched by an opportunity to manage a cohabiting family member's temporary, sudden and unplannable health problem. Furthermore, with reference to parenting issues in all the Countries where it operates, Eni continues to recognise: 10 working days 100% paid to both parents, 14 minimum weeks' leave for the primary carer as per the ILO convention and the payment of an allowance equal to at least 2/3 of the salary received in the previous period. As far as welfare services are concerned, Eni offers initiatives that respond to needs in the family sphere (from recreational and educational  services  for  children,  assistance  for  non-self-sufficient family members), the promotion of health and psycho-physical wellbeing (dedicated prevention initiatives, psychological counters and the  availability  of  affiliated  sports  facilities)  and  income  support measures  (subsidised  loans,  complementary  social  security  and",

The year 2023 was characterised by the implementation of important new initiatives that enriched the existing offer by strengthening health, parenting support and income support services, as defined in the NOI Protocol signed with the trade unions.\n\n## HEALTH\n\nEni considers health a fundamental Human Right and promotes the psycho-physical and social well-being of its employees, their families and the communities of the Countries in which it operates considering  the  bio-psycho-social  dimension  of  health  and  one of the highest international standards. The extreme variability of working contexts requires a constant effort to update health risk matrices and makes it particularly challenging to guarantee health at every stage of the business cycle. In a continuously changing epidemiological  context  and  in  consideration  of  the  energy transition  and  climate  challenges,  promoting  a  culture  of  health and access to adequate health services is increasingly strategic. To rise to these challenges, Eni has developed a health management system that ensures services to its people, covering occupational health, industrial hygiene, traveller medicine, health assistance and medical  emergency,  health  promotion  initiatives,  assessment  of the impacts of business operations on the health of communities, as well  specific  programs  to  support  the  communities  in  which  it operates (regarding community health, see the chapter Alliances for Development). In addition to the maintenance and continuous improvement  of  health-related  services,  the  health  management strategy is oriented to (i) enhancing access to care for all Eni people, strengthening interventions in favour of communities, reinforcing emergency  facilities (with particular reference to infectious diseases  and  possible  epidemic  and  pandemic  outbreaks),  and strengthening  services  and  initiatives  in  support  of  vulnerable situations (with particular reference to mental health protection); (ii) disseminating the culture of health through initiatives in favour of workers, their families and communities identified based on data available on the state of health of the population; (iii) implementing occupational medicine activities with the contribution  of  scientific research activities, in view of the risks associated with new projects and industrial processes and in light of industrial hygiene activity findings;  (iv)  promoting  the  digitalization  of  health  processes  and services through the use of information technologies, telemedicine, and mobile communications. In 2023 in all of the Group companies continued the implementation of the health management systems with  the  objective  of  promoting  and  maintaining  the  physical, mental and social well-being and health of Eni people and ensuring adequate risk management in the workplace through awareness and prevention activities using new digital instruments for internal communication. Research activities continued in collaboration with\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nresearch centres and universities to assess the health impact of new production processes and business models related to the energy transition,  with  special  attention  given  to  biorefineries  and  agribusinesses. Collaboration with health institutions in the countries of presence and with international organisations was strengthened, including  the  IOGP  -  IPIECA  Health  Committee  (International Organisation of Oil & Gas Producers), and a project was launched in collaboration with the International Labour Organisation to improve the occupational safety and health of small farmers involved in Eni's agro-business initiatives in Kenya and Ivory Coast.\n\n## Performance metrics and comments\n\n## EMPLOYMENT AND DIVERSITY\n\nOverview - Overall employment amounts to 32,321 people, of whom 21,336 in Italy (66% of Eni's employees) and 10,985 abroad (34% of Eni's employees). In 2023, employment worldwide grew by 945 people compared to 2022, or +3%, with a concentrated increase in Italy (+865 employees), while abroad of (+80 resources). The increase in total employment is mainly attributable to M&A operations (acquisitions in the Energy Evolution business area partially offset by disposals in the Natural Resources business area). In 2023, the female presence increased by +0.5 p.p. compared to 2022, with simultaneous growth also in positions of responsibility (+0.7 p.p. vs. 2022). Furthermore, there is a higher percentage of women (3.8% of the total female employees) with part-time contracts, compared to men, who represent 0.2% of the total male employees.\n\nHires - Overall, in 2023, 2,630 people were hired (+4.2% approx. vs. 2022), of which 1,949 had permanent contracts (approx. +8.5% vs. 2022). About 46% of permanent hires involved employees up to the age of 30. Of the total number of hires, approximately 64% were for the Energy Evolution Department, mainly to support business development  associated  with  energy  transition  such  as  energy production from renewable sources, circular economy, and energy efficiency (total 1,678, including 1,267 permanent hires and 411 with fixed-term  contracts),  18%  in  the  Natural  Resources  Department (total  467,  306  permanent  hires  and  161  fixed-term  contracts) and the remaining 18% Support Functions (total 485 of which 376 permanent hires and 109 on fixed-term contracts) both in traditional activities and in Technical areas (IT, R&D and Engineering) to support business development.\n\nTerminations - 2,368 contracts were terminated (1,268 in Italy and 1,100 abroad), 1,942 of which were permanent hires 16 ,  with  fixedterm contracts and were executed using extraordinary instruments",

In the area of inclusiveness, the figures for female personnel turnover increased vs. 2022 by +0.6 p.p. (female turnover 16.8% vs. male turnover 10.9%).\n\nDiversity & Inclusion - In 2023, the percentage of female personnel grew by 0.5 p.p. compared to 2022 and stood at 27.38% (ratio of women to total employment): The incidence of women on the individual qualifications is as follows (ratio of female qualification to  total  qualification):  18.17%  senior  managers,  30.34%  middle managers,  30.77%  white-collar  workers,  and  15.1%  blue-collar workers;  these  percentages  are  increased  for  all  qualifications compared  to  2022.  The  overall  percentage  of  women  in  the management  bodies  and  supervisory  bodies  of  subsidiaries increased compared to 2022 (28% and 43%, respectively). In 2023, the percentage of women in positions of responsibility rose to 29.2% compared to 28.5% in 2022. At Eni, 33% of those reporting directly to the CEO are women. There were 763 permanent female hires in 2023 out of 1,949, counting for 39.2%, an increase vs. 2022 of approx. +2.3 p.p., with growth in line with the process undertaken by Eni to encourage a higher replacement rate for women than for men to achieve gender balance more quickly. The number of non-Italian employees in positions of responsibility in recent years has averaged around 20%; the 2023 figure is basically in line with 2022 with a slight decrease of -0.7 p.p. due to M&A operations. Eni's population consists of 110 different nationalities. In Italy, in 2023, there were 70 new hires of personnel belonging to protected categories  (Law  68/99),  for  a  total  of  about  670  resources  at Eni and its subsidiaries. In addition, Eni has signed institutional commitments for the placement of approximately 120 resources over the next few years, a commitment that will be increased to approximately 250 resources.\n\nEmployment in Italy - There were 1,472 hires in Italy, of which 1,329 permanent contracts (38.7% women). The increase in employment of +865 (+4.2%) was mainly due to M&A operations (Novamont acquisition in Energy Evolution). A +20.7% increase in the Under-30 population  promoted  a  slight  decrease  in  the  senior  age  group: the population over 50 decreased by -0.7%. Again in Italy, in 2023, there were 1,268 terminations, 1,146 of which related to employees with permanent contracts (of which 30% were women). Personnel turnover  was  achieved  through  extraordinary  instruments  to minimise the social impact (Expansion Contract and 'Isopensione'\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\n- - Early Retirement), almost entirely offset by new hires. Overall, in Italy, at the end of 2023, there was a replacement ratio between new permanent  hires  and  terminations  of  approximately  1.16:1  (1.16 hires to 1 termination).\n\nEmployment  abroad - The average presence of local personnel abroad has remained substantially constant at around 87% over the last three years. In 2023, there were 1,158 new hires abroad, of  which  620  with  permanent  contracts  (40.2%  women).  The balance between hires and terminations abroad at year-end was +58, of which 1,158 hires (65% Energy Evolution Department; 22% Natural Resources Department; 13% Support Functions) and 1,100 terminations, of which 796 were permanent contracts. Of these terminations 11.8% regarded employees under the age of 30, and 34.9% were female personnel. Abroad, compared to the previous year, there was a growth of +80 resources (+0.7%) as follows: -35  local  resources  (-0.4%),  Italian  expatriates  remain  stable, +115 international resources (+30%). Abroad there are a total of 1,499 expatriates (including 1,001 Italians and 498 international expatriates).\n\nEmployment by business unit - About 20% of permanent hires were in the Plenitude sector, 19% in Chemicals and Support, and smaller percentages in the others business lines that further consolidated their  skills  and  expertise.  Terminations  mainly  related  to  the Chemicals (27%), Upstream (21%) and Support (20%) businesses.\n\nAverage age - The average age of Eni people worldwide is 44.7 years (45.5 in Italy and 43.3 abroad), younger than in 2022 (45.1); this result was achieved thanks to the important turnover work carried out  through  the  use  of  extraordinary  early  retirement  incentive tools (Expansion contract and 'Isopensione' - Early Retirement) combined  with  an  important  recruitment  programme  aimed  in particular  at  innovative  professionals  and  the  Junior  figures:  In detail, the average ages per category are: 53.2 years (53.4 in Italy and 52.5 abroad) for senior managers, 48.5 years (49 in Italy and 47.1 abroad) for middle managers, 43.7 years (44.2 in Italy and 42.6 abroad) for white collar workers and 40.3 years (40.2 in Italy and 40.3 abroad) for blue-collar workers.\n\nPerformance appraisals - In 2023, the performance appraisal and management review processes covered 85% and 95% of the target population. Potential appraisal activities covered 95% of the planned total. This slight decrease, especially abroad, was mainly due to physiological  turnover  and  specific  contingencies  (e.g.  mobility  of resources or company reorganisation).\n\n## REMUNERATION\n\nEni annually monitors wage equity, a principle explicitly referred to in the annual implementation provisions for remuneration policies, also for the purpose of evaluating any corrective actions.

The indicator, calculated by professional category shows a substantial alignment also for men's remuneration for middle managers and white collars; while for senior managers and blue collar workers the deviations are mainly related to a smaller female presence. In terms of the ratio of CEO/DG's median remuneration to employees in Italy (main operating location), the 2023 indicator is 35 for fixed remuneration and 172 for total remuneration; considering all employees, these ratios are 36 and 180, respectively. The total average remuneration of all employees compared to 2022 varied by 2.5% while that of the CEO/DG varied by 32% mostly due to the change in the Long-Term Share Incentive awarded due to the increase in Eni's share price over the reporting period (EUR 15.27 vs. EUR 8.21).\n\n## INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS\n\nIn Italy, 100% of employees are covered by collective bargaining by  virtue  of  current  regulations.  Abroad,  in  relation  to  the  specific regulations operating in the individual Countries, this percentage stands at 56.28%. In Countries where employees are not covered by collective bargaining, Eni ensures in any case full compliance with international  and  local  legislation  applicable  to  the  employment relationship  as  well  as  some  higher  standards  of  protection guaranteed by Eni throughout the group through the application of its Company policies worldwide.\n\n## TRAINING\n\nIn 2023, there is an upward trend compared to 2022 for all training indicators.  Total  hours  used  increased  by  23%,  and  the  average value by 18%. All professional categories showed an increase, but the highest percentage is found in the white and blue collar worker categories. There the average expenditure also increased by 11% due to both an increase in training hours and a significant upswing in classroom training, which accounts for 57% of total hours in 2023 compared to 43% in 2022. Of the more than 1 million training hours over the year, 80% were taken by men and 20% by women.\n\n## HEALTH\n\nIn 2023, the number of health services provided by Eni was 346,523, of which 222,806 for employees, 58,202 for family members, 56,965 for contractors and 8,550 for others (e.g. visitors and external patients).\n\nThe number of participants in health promotion initiatives in 2023 was 90,798, of whom 65,074 were employees, 23,632 contractors and 2,092 family members. As concerns occupational diseases, in 2023 there were 54 claims, of which 17 related to current employees and 37 related to former employees. Of the 54 occupational disease claims submitted in 2023, 2 were submitted by heirs (all relating to former employees). As part of digital initiatives to monitor the healthiness of indoor working environments, 49 sensors were tested at onshore operational sites in Italy in 2023. It is planned to extend testing to 100 sensors, including offshore and abroad, by 2027.",

Eni constantly invests in the implementation of all the necessary actions to be taken to ensure safety at work, in particular in the development of models and tools for risk assessment and management and in the promotion of a culture of safety, in order to pursue its commitment to  eliminating  injuries  and  protecting  the  integrity  of  its  assets. However, despite these efforts, a fatal injury involving a contractor worker abroad occurred in 2023. The analysis of all incidental events during the year revealed a prevalence of causes belonging to the Integrated  Systems  &  Human  Performance  area,  mainly  related to work direction and execution of the activity. To prevent such incidents from repeating in the future, in addition to the continuous update of management documents and operational instructions, initiatives  were  introduced  to  strengthen  the  awareness  and involvement of employees and contractors in the HSE field (Safety Leadership,  Coaching  Programme,  promotion  of  the  Stop  Work Authority 17 ), as well as activities aimed at improving work areas in terms of personnel safety , and the implementation of new digital technologies to support operational safety. These efforts focus on non-technical  skills,  technical  skills  and  digitalization.  Regarding non-technical skills, human behaviour and reliability analysis (model based on THEME methodology) was applied in 2023 to five sites to  identify  action  strategies  to  fortify  human  barriers  and  safe behaviour. With regard to technical skills, the new Eni Safety Golden Rules and Principles 18 , campaign was launched with emphasis on the Stop Work Authority and the Line of Fire 19 . It aims to promote the basic principles and minimum safety requirements to be applied to  risky  activities  to  prevent  accidents.  Regarding  digitalization, the Safety Pre-Sense tool, i.e. the artificial intelligence tool capable of  predicting  recurring  dangerous  situations  from  weak  signals recorded in safety databases, generated 139 alerts that led to the implementation  of  157  targeted  preventive  actions.  Preparatory activities were also completed to extend Smart Safety, the digital system using wearable devices for alerting workers in dangerous and emergency conditions, to 60 contracting companies over the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nperiod of 2024-2027 plan. Finally, the evolution and promotion of the HSEni App, to report unsafe conditions, fill-in checklists, and consult Eni's safety rules on the move continued. Roll-out to about 11,000 users on more than 200 sites worldwide was completed.\n\nIn the area of Process Safety , to minimise accidents and improve performance,  Eni  carried  out  several  activities:  creation  and widespread communication of vademecum with the Process Safety Fundamentals (the principles of process safety to be followed during plant activities); training of more than 1000 technical/operative and HSEQ area personnel on the specific course on Process Safety in Eni; in-depth  study  of  fluid  management  safety  issues  for  new  energy chains, revising process safety standards to include specific design requirements for hydrogen, CO 2 and other substances from new supply chains.\n\nEni applies the Asset Integrity process to all its plants to ensure correct design and adequate construction with the most suitable materials,  to  apply  the  utmost  rigour  in  the  operation  of  the plants and to implement their correct decommissioning, manage residual risks with respect for the safety of people, environment and reputation. As part of the risks associated with acute and chronic natural events, Eni also addresses climate change risks with  the  most  advanced  scientific  and  technical  tools.  In  this regard, in 2023, Eni has equipped itself with scientifically advanced data  providers  and  models  so  that  working  hypotheses,  tools and technical solutions are always in line with Eni's values and objectives  when  managing  these  risks.  Regarding contractor management ,  a  dedicated  unit,  the  Safety  Competence  Centre (SCC), was identified to improve the safety of contract works and provide specialised training services, as well as HSE operational support for the business. SCC continued to proactively monitor and support the process of improvement of contracting companies towards management models characterised by a more preventing safety culture and environmental protection, monitoring over 3,000 suppliers, (70% of those with potential HSE critical issues in Italy), SCC manages the anomalies detected with immediate corrective actions and valorises innovative good practices, ensuring they are shared with all the contractors. In addition, Safety and Environment\n\n- (17) With the Stop Work Authority, every worker at any Eni site has the authority to stop an activity when they detect a dangerous behaviour or condition.\n\n(18) The Principles are transversal and apply in all work situations. The Golden Rules apply good practice criteria and highlight prevention-related behavioural aspects.\n\n- (19) The principle calls for staying outside the fire line and checking that all other workers do the same.",

In 2024 the Pact will be extended to Algeria, Ivory Coast, Kenya and Oman. In the area of product safety, Eni continues to promote technological innovation in line with European and non-European regulatory developments, in particular with the Chemical Strategy for Sustainability (CSS), an EU strategy that aims to protect against harmful  chemicals  and  promote  safer  and  more  sustainable chemical  products  towards  the  development  of  a  responsible product  management  system  along  the  entire  value  chain.  To this end, Eni has developed a transparent, smart and user-friendly system aimed at all stakeholders that simplifies the management of  all  chemical  products  along  the  value  chain  and  all  related information  and  documentation.  Thanks  to  its  digital  nature,  it enables continuous and real-time monitoring of this information, providing  valuable  support  in  the  collection  of  documentation required for regulatory compliance and significantly improving the ability to comply with legislative standards.\n\nRegarding the management system relating to occupational health and  safety Eni's  HSE  regulatory  system  establishes  criteria  for clustering the operational units of Eni SpA and its subsidiaries based on the HSE risk of the activities performed. Three types of clusters are identified: significant HSE risk clusters (industrial activities), for which there is an obligation to adopt an HSE management system, certification to ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 20 standards and annual internal  HSE  audits;  limited  HSE  risk  clusters  (office  activities  or activities of limited relevance), for which there is an obligation to adopt (but not certify) an HSE management system and annual or five- yearly internal HSE audits; and no HSE risk clusters (absence of employees and operating activities), for which there are no specific obligations.  Within  this  context,  all  companies  at  significant  risk have  ISO  45001  and  ISO  14001  certification  or  have  planned  to achieve it. All companies at limited risk have implemented an HSE management system or have planned its development. In particular, by the end of 2023: 84% of those with significant risk have already achieved ISO 45001 certification and 83% ISO 14001, while 83%\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nof those required to develop an HSE management system have already implemented an HSE management system. During 2023, more than 1,200 internal audits on HSE issues were carried out in addition to third-party audits for maintaining certifications.\n\n## Performance metrics and comments\n\nIn 2023, the Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) of the workforce decreased compared to 2022 (0.40 with respect to 0.41 in 2022), due to a reduction in the number of total contractors' recordable injuries (78 compared to 88 in 2022), while the total number of total employees' recordable injuries increased (44 vs. 25 in 2022). In Italy, the number of total recordable injuries increased (54 events compared to 42 in 2022, of which 24 employees and 30 contractors) and the Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) deteriorated (+20%). Abroad, the number of injuries increased (68 events compared to 71 in 2022, of which 20 employees and 48 contractors) and the total recordable injury rate improved by 15%. One fatal injury was reported for a contractor in Nigeria, who was struck by an object during maintenance activities. The workforce fatality index was 0.33. The value of the high-consequence 21 work-related injuries rate (calculated based on injuries with more than 180 days of absence and consequences such as total or partial permanent disability) is 0.003, related to a single event that caused the permanent partial disability of a Turkmenistan employee. In 2023, there was a further decrease in the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 22 process safety incidents. It has decreased steadily since 2016, indicating an increased focus on process safety issues at all Eni sites. In particular, 10 Process Safety Events (PSEs) Tier 1 were recorded and 10 Tier 2. 60% of the  events  were  related  to  upstream  activities,  30%  to  refining (15%) and petrochemicals (15%), and the remaining 10% to the Enilive and Eni Rewind business units. Over half (55%) of the PSEs resulted in  a  spill  of  product,  30%  in  a  fire  and  15%  in  a  release into  the  atmosphere.  Concerning  reporting  of  possible  hazards at work, thanks to initiatives and tools to strengthen the reporting and analysis of weak signals, 2023 continues the growth trend of reporting unsafe conditions and unsafe acts.\n\n(20) ISO 14001 relates to environmental management systems, while ISO 45001 relates to health and safety management systems.\n\n(21) The figure reported is the best available at the date of publication of the NFI for the current year.\n\n- (22) Process safety incidents are classified as a function of the severity into Tier 1 (more serious), Tier 2, or Tier 3.1 (less serious).",

Particular attention is paid to the efficient use of natural resources (like water), minimising atmospheric emissions, reducing oil spills, managing waste, and managing the interaction with biodiversity and  ecosystem  services.  The environmental  culture spread through communication,  training  and  awareness  initiatives is  a  lever  to  ensure  greater  awareness  in  the  management  of environmental  aspects.  In  2023,  the  campaign  to  promote Environmental Golden Rules continued, launching a series of seven web episodes for the adoption of virtuous behaviour by employees and suppliers, reflecting Eni's values, commitment and standards. Suppliers were also involved in 16 safety and environment pacts signed in 2023 in Italy and abroad. These are committed to tangible and  measurable  improvement  actions  through  the  Safety  and Environment Performance Index. In addition, the 'Environmental Talks'  initiative  on  topical  issues  continued,  and  the  'Together for  the  Environment'  awareness-raising  course  was  expanded, enriched with new modules aimed at strengthening the ability to intercept  and  manage  week  environmental  signals.  In  addition, specific  engagement  activities  were  conducted  in  Italy  and  in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\none entity abroad to raise corporate commitment and leadership in managing environmental issues. In continuity with last years, Eni  has  continued  the  activities  dedicated  to  environmental digitalization for process optimisation through, for example, the creation of centralized IT tools to facilitate the management of environmental  compliance  and  dedicated  site-specific  technicalmanagement assessment models. In the end, to ensure efficient management of water resources , Eni assesses water use and its impact on the ecosystem, other users and the organisation itself. Especially in water-stressed areas, Eni maps and monitors water risks  and  drought  scenarios  to  define  short-,  medium-  and  longterm actions to prevent and mitigate the effects of climate change. Additionally, using water resources is an element of deepening in Eni's relationship with suppliers and a stimulus for improvement. In 2021, Eni published its own position on water resources , in which it undertakes to pursue the CEO Water Mandate 23 and, in particular, to minimise its freshwater withdrawals in areas under water stress. Within IPIECA, Eni is committed to promoting best practices in water resource management through a training programme and sharing industry experiences, and is active in defining water stewardship criteria for the O&G sector and alternative energies, including solar, wind, hydrogen and biofuel. The commitments undertaken lead\n\n(23) The CEO Water Mandate is a special initiative established in 2007 by the UN Secretary General and the UN Global Compact (UNGC) in cooperation with the Pacific Institute to promote water stewardship by companies worldwide.",

In terms of transparency, in 2023, Eni responded publicly to the CDP Water Security questionnaire, obtaining a B rating, better than the industry average. Eni pursues the reduction of freshwater withdrawals  by  acting  on  two  levers:  increasing  the  efficiency or  internal  recycling  of  fresh  water  and  replacing  high-quality freshwater  sources  (aquifer,  surface,  municipal  or  third-  party) with low-quality water, e.g. remediated, wastewater or desalinated water. Eni Rewind is committed to making the treated water from its contaminated groundwater treatment plants (TAF) available for industrial use, reducing high-quality water withdrawals. Efforts to increase the share of re-injected produced water can reduce sea or  brackish  water  withdrawals,  contributing  to  the  preservation of  water  resources,  especially  in  water-stressed  areas 24 . The implementation of  specific  projects  is  carried  out  in  compliance with the necessary local authorisations, which may require the involvement of local stakeholders. In addition, Eni has adopted precise  internal  standards  to  be  used  when  mandatory  local regulations are less stringent or absent concerning environment and water resource conservation, ultimately complying with the primary international standards. Concerning potentially hazardous substances 25 for which discharges are treated, Eni monitors its water discharge, particularly hydrocarbons in the discharge water after treatment and total oils in the discharge produced water. Internal pre-alarm thresholds are also adopted if the concentration of micropollutants in discharged water is exceeded, specific to each production activity, to initiate timely corrective action, if necessary. The circular economy is one of the key levers to achieving global nature  conservation  goals.  Eni  has  adopted  the  principles  of  a circular economy in its business model, existing supply chains and the development of new product chains. Circular approaches were adopted, e.g. upstream with the reuse of assets and equipment and the recycling of materials, in procurement by increasing the awareness and  involvement  of  suppliers,  downstream  with  transformation initiatives  involving  traditional  refineries  and  logistics,  and  through the production of biofuels from the valorisation of waste, residues and waste. In addition, recycling technologies for plastics and rubber are being developed, as are projects for valorising soil, water, and industrial and remediation waste. In 2023, Eni continued developing its  circularity  measurement  model  in  various  corporate  contexts validated  by  a  third-party  certification  authority.  Furthermore,  in 2023, Eni started a pilot project to apply the experimental UNI TS 11820 standard for measuring circularity and is collaborating on the update and revision of the standard, which is planned for 2024.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nAs for waste management, Eni pays particular attention to the traceability of the entire process and the verification of the parties involved in the disposal/recovery chain, searching for all feasible solutions  to  prevent  waste  generation.  Almost  all  Eni  waste  in Italy is managed by Eni Rewind 26 , which uses the digitalization instruments implemented over the past few years to improve the efficiency  and  monitoring  of  its  waste  management  process.  In order to limit the negative impacts related to waste, exclusive use is made of authorised parties, favouring recovery over disposal, in line with the priority criteria indicated by European and national regulations.  Eni  Rewind,  on  the  basis  of  the  characteristics  of the individual waste, selects technically viable recovery/disposal solutions, prioritising recovery, treatment operations that reduce the quantities to be sent for final disposal and suitable plants at a shorter distance from the waste production site; furthermore, audits are carried out on environmental suppliers, to assess their operational waste management.\n\nWith regard to the management of risks associated with oil spills , Eni is constantly engaged in every area of intervention: prevention, preparedness, followed by mitigation, response and recovery. In terms of the preventing oil spills in Italy, on the Val d'Agri production line, yearly maintenance was performed on the e-vpms \u00ae27 and Early Warning - Kassandra Meteo Forecast weather warning monitoring system, which is applied to continuous control of hydrogeological risk, Centro Olio Val D'Agri water discharge management, and monitoring of agricultural crops (Agri-Hub). Still within Italy, in the retail network, the precautionary reconditioning of underground tanks and remediation and removal from service of other exhaust oil tanks continued. In Nigeria, during 2023, as part of the oil spill management strategy, operational testing of the e-vpms \u00ae system installed on some main and secondary sections and pipelines of  the  network  continued.  Additionally,  drones  were  tested  to improve the identification of illegal activities and better support surveillance  agencies  and  authorities  in  reducing  sabotage attempts.  Intervention  teams  have  also  been  strengthened  to identify and repair illegal withdrawal points, resulting in a further reduction of environmental impact, facilitating a further reduction, compared  to  2022,  of  oil  spills  related  to  operating  activities. Eni  continues  its  efforts  in  terms  of  verification,  monitoring and  replacement  of  onshore  and  offshore  pipelines  to  ensure asset integrity and prevent oil spills. During 2023, as part of the methodologies for assessing environmental impacts following oil spills: (i) the methodology aimed at assessing the risks arising from natural events that may affect pipelines was further refined; (ii)  the  'Spill  Impact  Mitigation  Assessment'  forecast  study based on IPIECA guidelines was carried out in Libya to identify\n\n(24) Water-stressed areas are identified using Aqueduct, a tool developed by the World Resources Institute, and monitored annually through an internal analysis carried out down to the detail of the individual operational site.\n\n- (25) As regulated by Legislative Decree No. 152 (Consolidated Environmental Act) or similar regulatory reference for foreign Countries.\n\n(27) e-vpms \u00ae is a technology for detecting vibro-acoustic variations in the structure of pipelines and the fluid transported by the same, aimed at identifying potential spills in progress.",

Eni continues to collaborate with IPIECA and IOGP (International Association of Oil & Gas Producers) to strengthen marine pollution response capacity following spills (of oil and other chemicals), participating  in  regional  initiatives  in  collaboration  with  IMO (International  Maritime  Organisation)  and  GI  WACAF  (Global initiative West, Central and Southern Africa), and monitoring the activities of the OSPRI (Oil Spill Preparedness Regional Initiative). In the context of the IPIECA and IOGP working group, some Good Practice  Guidance  on  oil  spill  emergency  management  was updated  and  disseminated  during  2023.  Operating  globally  in contexts with different ecological sensitivities, Eni has developed a  science-based Biodiversity  and  Ecosystem  Services (BES) management model over time through long-term collaborations with  recognised  international  organisations  and  leaders  in biodiversity  conservation.  Among  the  collaborations  active  in 2023  were:  Fauna  &  Flora  International  (since  2003),  Wildlife Conservation Society (since 2016), and IUCN - International Union for Conservation of Nature (since 2022); since 2008, Eni has been a member of Proteus, a partnership managed by UNEP/WCMC (World Conservation Monitoring Centre) for the collection and dissemination of ecosystem and biodiversity data and information on a global level. For years, this model has been an integral part of  the  Integrated  HSE  Management  System,  confirming  the awareness of the risks for the natural environment resulting from Eni sites and activities. The BES management model is a riskbased approach applied to existing operations and new projects. It ensures that the interactions between environmental aspects (such as BES, climate change and water resource management) and social aspects (such as the development of local communities) are identified and managed from the early planning stages. For each phase of the project, BES studies assess the significance of an impact, combining the magnitude with the sensitivity of the BES element for the area involved, as well as the opportunities to provide a positive contribution to the conservation of priority BES aspects. This is done through the systematic application of the Mitigation Hierarchy. It prioritises preventative measures over  corrective  ones  and  drives  continuous  improvement  of BES management performance towards no net loss or net gain of biodiversity depending on project-specific risks and context. Consultation  and  collaboration  with  communities,  indigenous peoples and other local stakeholders helps to understand their expectations and concerns, determine how ecosystem services and biodiversity are being used, and identify management options that include local needs. Exposure to biodiversity risk exposure is  periodically  assessed  by  mapping  Eni's  operational  sites concerning their geographical proximity to protected areas and areas important for biodiversity conservation. This allows priority sites  for  performing  additional  investigations  to  be  identified based  on  the  characteristics  of  the  operational-environmental context  and  to  assess  potential  impacts  to  avoid  or  mitigate\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nthrough  the  BAP-Biodiversity  Action  Plan.  Furthermore,  BAPs specify  the  targets,  monitoring,  timelines,  responsibilities  and performance indicators. They are updated regularly throughout the project's life, ensuring effective risk exposure management. Eni  has  adopted  a  'NO  GO'  policy  in  natural  areas  UNESCO recognises  as  sites  with  'Outstanding  Universal  Value'  (OUV). In  2019,  Eni communicated  its  commitment not  to  carry  out exploration and development activities in Natural Sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List; furthermore, in joint ventures where Eni is not the operator, Eni promotes the development and adoption of good management practices in line with the Eni BES Policy with its partners. In addition, Eni participates in associations (e.g. IPIECA  and  WBCSD)  to  promote  good  management  practices for the potential impact of the energy sector on biodiversity and ecosystems. Finally, in 2023, the in-depth section on the website eni.com , to illustrate in greater detail the results of biodiversity risk exposure assessments for its portfolio operations and mitigation actions, as required by the transparency recommendations of the Convention  on  Biological  Diversity's  'Kunming-Montreal  Global Biodiversity Framework Agreement'.\n\n## Performance metrics and comments\n\nIn 2023, seawater withdrawals (1,089 Mm 3 , equal to 89% of total water  withdrawals)  were  down  by  more  than  15%  compared to 2022, particularly due to the trends recorded in the R&M and Chemicals sectors (-158 Mm 3 due to maintenance shutdowns at the Porto Marghera and Porto Torres petrochemical plants), E&P (-31 Mm 3 due to the exit from the domain of Eni Angola SpA) and Corporate and Other Activities (-15 Mm 3 , due to the exit from the domain of ILCV SpA).\n\nFreshwater withdrawals, amounting to about 10% of total water withdrawals  and  more  than  80%  attributable  to  the  R&M  and Chemicals sector, recorded an overall increase compared to 2022 (+7%),  mainly  attributable  to  the  Mantua  petrochemical  plant. Withdrawals  at  the  Livorno  refinery  also  increased  due  to  the resumption of operations after the shutdown in early 2022. On the other hand, freshwater withdrawals in E&P declined, mainly due to reduced consumption in Algeria, Nigeria and Egypt, and Eni Pakistan's exit from dominance. Eni's freshwater reuse rate was  90%,  which  aligns  with  2022.  At  Versalis,  which  accounts for more than 70% of recycled volumes, the reduction recorded at the Mantua site was offset by the restoration of the Dunkirk contribution (following the 2022 plant shutdown).\n\nThe percentage of reinjected produced water in the E&P sector increased to 60% (59% in 2022), mainly due to the resumption of activities at the Libyan sites of El Feel and Abu Attifel. Analysis of the stress level of hydrographic basins and further local studies show  that  freshwater  withdrawals  from  areas  under  stress account for 2% of Eni's total water withdrawals in 2023 (data stable compared to 2022). In 2023, in particular, Eni withdrew",

Sea  water  and  brackish  water  withdrawals  in  water-stressed areas amounted to 922 Mm 3 and 9 Mm 3 , respectively. Onshore produced water in water-stressed areas was 23.4 Mm 3 . In 2023, Eni discharged 112 Mm 3 of fresh water, of which 25.2 Mm 3 was in water-stressed areas, equal to 23% (19% in 2022). In 2023, Eni's fresh water consumption was 128 Mm 3 (29.9 Mm 3 in waterstressed areas). In 2023, volumes spilled due to operational oil spills (amounting to 7,728 barrels) increased compared to 2022 due to a fuel oil spill at the Sannazzaro refinery of over 7,500 barrels, a quantity fully recovered. The events recorded abroad accounted  for  less  than  2%  of  the  total  quantities  spilled,  a more than 83% reduction compared to 2022. Egypt (14 events, 93 barrels spilled) and Nigeria (5 events, 20 barrels spilled) were the most impacted countries. Almost 99% of the operational oil spill volumes in 2023 were recovered. Oil spills from sabotage , at 5,094 barrels, decreased by 3% compared to 2022, despite an increase in events (373 compared to 244 in 2022). All the events (except one that occurred along the Sannazzaro-Volpiano pipeline for a total of 2 barrels) occurred in Nigeria. The largest spill (218 barrels, of which over 214 were recovered) occurred on the Ogoda-Brass section. Almost 78% of the operational oil spill volumes from sabotage were recovered. Volumes spilled from operational oil spills impacted 99% of soil and less than 1% of water bodies, while those from sabotage impacted 96% of soil and 4% of water bodies. Volumes spilled as a result of chemical spill (2,260 barrels in total) increased compared to 2022 due to a spill that occurred in Indonesia at Eni East Seppingan due to a product leak from a subsea injection line (2,234 barrels); control and maintenance activities were intensified following the event. Waste from production activities generated in 2023 increased by 25% compared to 2022, mainly due to increased wastewater from  El  Gamil  (Egypt)  and  industrial  and  plant  water  in  Zohr (Egypt). Non-hazardous waste shows a reduction (-23%) due to the reduction of production water disposed of by the Centro Oli Val D'Agri (Italy). Recovered and recycled waste remained stable at 15% of the total disposed waste 28 . Disposed waste at third parties was 49% of the total (34% hazardous waste and 83% non-\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nhazardous waste). In comparison, waste recovered and recycled at third parties was 98% of the total (100% hazardous waste and 96% non-hazardous waste). In 2023, a total of 2.8 million tons of  waste  were  generated  by  remediation  activities  (of  which 2.5 million from Eni Rewind), consisting of over 59% of treated water from TAF plants, partly reused and partly returned to the environment.\n\nEmissions  of  atmospheric  pollutants  decreased,  except  for particulate matter  (PM)  emissions,  which  remained  stable compared to the previous year. The decrease in SO x emissions is  mainly  related  to  reducing  the  contribution  from  safety  flaring at the Southern District COVA centre. The reduction in NO x and NMVOC emissions was influenced by the exit of Eni Pakistan, Eni Angola and Sergaz; lower consumption of diesel in Egypt and fuel gas in Congo and Nigeria; and some maintenance shutdowns at petrochemical plants and the Sannazzaro refinery.\n\nThe  2023  biodiversity  risk  exposure  assessment  showed  that there is overlap, even partial, with biodiversity important areas 29 at 29 operational sites 30 , all located in Italy except for two sites in Spain and one in France; an additional 59 sites 30 in 10 Countries (Italy, Australia, Austria, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, Hungary and the USA) are located less than 1 km from protected areas or KBA. The increase in sites compared to last year is related to new acquisitions of solar and wind farms. About 55% of the sites in, or adjacent to, biodiversity important areas are sites for renewable energy generation, the remainder are petrochemical plants,  refineries  or  depots.  As  regards  the  upstream  sector,  28 concessions 30 partially overlap with protected areas or KBAs, with operating activities within the overlapping area. These concessions are found in five Countries: Italy, Nigeria, the United States (Alaska), Egypt and the United Kingdom. In general, for all the Business Line, the greatest exposure in Italy and Europe is to the protected areas of the Natura 2000 31 Network spread across Europe; this exposure is more pronounced than last year due to the acquisition of nine wind and solar power parks in Italy. In no case, in Italy or abroad, is  there  any  overlap  of  operating  activities  with  UNESCO  World Heritage Sites (WHS 32 ); only one Upstream 33 site is located in the vicinity of a WHS natural site (Mount Etna), but there are no operating activities within the protected area, nor has significant impact been identified that could threaten the OUV - Outstanding Universal Value. Again in 2023, habitat restoration or biodiversity protection activities\n\n(28) Specifically, in 2023, 10% of the hazardous waste resulting from production activities disposed of by Eni was recovered/recycled, 1% was subjected to chemical/physical/biological treatment, 2% was incinerated, 1% was disposed of in landfill, while the remaining 86% was sent to other types of disposal (including transfer to temporary storage plants before final disposal). Concerning non-hazardous waste resulting from production activities, 25% was recovered/recycled, 6% was incinerated, 8% was disposed of in a landfill, 1% underwent chemical/physical/biological treatment. In comparison, the remaining 60% was sent to other types of disposal (including transfer to temporary storage plants before final disposal and incineration of small quantity).\n\n(33) Although it is not included among the consolidated boundary, the Zubair field (Iraq) is located near the Ahwar site classified as a mixed WHS site (natural and cultural). In this case, too, no operational infrastructure or operating activity was identified within these protected areas, nor was significantly threatening impact identified on the site Outstanding Universal Value (UNESCO definition).",

The main actions  implemented  concern  ecological  restoration  of  forests or  other  natural  habitats,  species  monitoring  and  conservation activities, community and worker awareness-raising activities. For example, in Alaska, a BAP has been running since 2009 to mitigate impact, and demonstrate progress towards the No Net Loss goal, and,  where  possible,  to  help  improve  the  status  (net  gain)  and knowledge  of  biodiversity  in  the  Alaska  North  Slope  area.  Key actions in 2023 include: (i) the updating of the BAP and ongoing polar bear movements monitoring activities within the operational area; (ii) the initiation of a new trial approaches to detect polar bear dens  using  drones  instead  of  aircraft  to  minimise  the  potential disturbance to the species; (iii) the conduct of a workshop on the Arctic tundra to summarise current knowledge on the opportunities and risks involved in restoring this habitat and identify information gaps  to  be  filled  by  ad  hoc  research  studies.  The  workshop  was attended by representatives of local and national regulators, experts,\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nresearchers, members of local communities and other stakeholders from the North Slope. In 2023, the analysis conducted on the global IUCN Red List database 34 showed a decrease in the number of endangered species with habitats in the areas of operational sites. The analysis is only carried out for sites and concessions that overlap with protected areas and KBAs. The negative variance is mainly due to the release of upstream concessions in Pakistan, although there is a slight decrease for the other business lines as well. The analysis indicates the possible presence of 50 critically endangered, 141 endangered and 269 vulnerable species near Eni's 35 operational areas. The near-threatened and least concern species are 317 and 4,039, respectively. Finally, it should be noted that there are 294 species  listed  as  'data  deficient',  so  the  information  at  the  global level is inadequate for a direct or indirect assessment of the risk of extinction. Data-poor species are treated by Eni in the same way as intermediate risk categories because they have a high probability of being endangered species, given the lack of adequate data to assess the risk of extinction.",

This commitment was reinforced in 2023 with the adoption of the ECG Policy - Respect for Human Rights in Eni , (which  replaced  Eni's  Statement  on  Respect  for  Human  Rights) based on the dignity of each human being and on the responsibility of  the  Company  to  contribute  to  the  well-being  of  people  and communities in the Countries in which it operates. The new Policy aims to outline a single, transversal model to ensure respect for Human Rights in the design of all corporate regulatory processes, considering  ongoing  regulatory  developments  on  the  subject.  It sums up the important internal regulatory heritage developed by Eni over the years in a single document. The document highlights the priority areas on which. Eni exercises in-depth due diligence, according to an approach developed in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) 36 and the  OECD  Guidelines  for  Multinationali 37 Enterprises.  To  ensure transparency and accountability about its activities, starting from 2019  a  dedicated  report,  Eni  for  Human  Rights 38 ,  is  published, providing a full representation of the management model adopted on the issue and the activities carried out in recent years, using the UNGPs Reporting Framework to report commitments and results.\n\n- (36) UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).\n- (37) OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n- (38) https://www.eni.com/assets/documents/eng/just-transition/2022/eni-for-2022-human-rights-eng.pdf.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to the involvement in the approval process of the new Policy, Eni's Board of Directors took part in an in-depth session on the international scenario and challenges on human rights and business held by the International Human Rights and Business. This session was held during the annual meeting with the SSC, at which the main updates to the human rights management system and the activities conducted during the year are presented to the Directors. The SSC and BoD are also involved in the annual approval of the Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement. This document is drafted  in  compliance  with  the  British  and  Australian  'Modern Slavery Act'. Moreover, in 2023, Eni continued awarding management incentives associated with human rights performance, assigning specific objectives to all managerial levels, including  those  reporting  directly  to  the  CEO.  A  course  was developed  with  IPIECA  and  promoted  internally  and  to  Eni's contractors  and  suppliers  to  raise  awareness  of  responsible working  conditions,  to  facilitate  understanding  of  the  workers' rights and to identify, manage and mitigate the risks of lack of respect  of  these  rights.  Eni's human  rights  commitment, management model and activities focus on the issues considered most  significant  for  the  Company  -  as  also  requested  by  the UNGPs - in light of the business activities conducted and the contexts in which Eni operates.

Starting in 2020, a 'risk-based' evaluation model for respecting human rights at the workplace was introduced to segment Eni subsidiaries based on quantitative  and  qualitative  parameters  that  capture  the  specific characteristics and risks of the Country/operating context and are linked to the human resources management process (including the fight against all forms of discrimination, gender equality, working conditions, freedom of association and collective bargaining). This approach  identifies  possible  areas  of  risk  or  improvements, requiring specific actions to be defined and monitored over time. During 2023, the application of the model in the Energy Evolution subsidiaries was specifically evaluated (after having introduced it in  2022),  and  a  follow-up  was  performed  with  the  upstream businesses involved with the application of the model in 2021. A set of standard mitigation actions resulting from applying this riskbased model for assessing the respect for human rights in the workplace  was  also  disseminated  to  all  Eni  companies.  Eni  is committed to preventing possible negative impacts on the human rights of individuals and host communities resulting from the implementation  of  industrial  projects.  To  this  end,  in  2018,  Eni adopted a risk-based model (updated in 2021) that uses elements related to the operating context, such as risk indexes of the data provider Verisk Maplecroft, and project characteristics, to classify upstream business projects according to potential human rights risks and to identify appropriate management measures. Higherrisk projects are specifically investigated through a 'Human Rights Impact Assessment' (HRIA) or a 'Human Rights Risk Analysis' (HRRA)  to  identify  measures  to  prevent  potential  impacts  on human rights and manage the existing ones. In 2023, in-depth HRIA studies launched in 2022 were finalised in Kenya and Congo 39 , focusing on decultivation of agri-feedstock to produce biofuels. A follow-up assessment  was  also  conducted  to  verify  the implementation of the three-year action plan related to the HRIA study conducted in Mexico in 2019, and the action plan related to Mozambique was finalised. The implementation and monitoring of existing action plans also continued. All HRIA reports and relative action plans adopted, including the periodic reports on the progress of the action plans, are publicly available on the Eni website 40 . In some  Countries,  such  as  Australia  and  Alaska,  Eni  operates  in areas where indigenous peoples are present, towards which it has adopted  specific  policies  to  protect  their  rights,  culture  and traditions and to promote their free, prior and informed consultation.\n\n- (39) https://www.eni.com/en-IT/actions/energy-sources/bioenergy.html.\n- (40) https://www.eni.com/en-IT/sustainability/people-community/human-rights.html.\n- (41) https://www.eni.com/assets/documents/Alaska\\_Indigenous\\_\\_Peoples\\_Policy\\_Febbraio\\_2022.pdf.\n- (42) Analysis of the grievances submitted through the grievance mechanisms adopted in the countries mentioned above did not reveal any critical human rights issues.\n- (43) Based on vulnerabilities and probabilities related to specific conditions such as the level of training and skills needed, the level of labour intensity, the use of manpower agencies, HSE risks. Industrial activities (such as maintenance, construction, assembly, logistics) and general goods and services (such as cleaning services, catering, security services and property management) have been classified as high-risk activities.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nThe  most  recent  of  these  Policies,  referring  to  the  indigenous peoples in Alaska 41 affected by the business activities carried out by  the  subsidiary  Eni  US  Operating  Company  in  the  area,  was adopted in 2020 and renewed in 2021. No violations of the rights of these populations 42 were ascertained during the year. Respect for human rights in the supply chain is an essential requirement for Eni, managed through a procurement process that includes the adoption of an assessment model dedicated to human rights, as well as transparent, impartial, consistent and non-discriminatory conduct in the selection of suppliers, the evaluation of bids and the verification  of  the  activities  set  in  the  contracts  (see  chapter 'Suppliers' pp. 178-179). To set off and reinforce their commitment to fundamental values, and in particular on the respect of human rights, companies working with Eni are required to sign the 'Supplier Code of Conduct', a pact that guides and characterises relations with  suppliers  at  all  stages  of  the  procurement  process  (from candidature  to  qualification,  purchasing  procedures  to  the execution phase) based on the principles of social responsibility, including human rights. Human rights assessment and monitoring are applied in procurement processes through a risk-based model. This  model  allows  the  analysis  and  classification  of  suppliers based on a level of potential risks related to the Country context and the activities 43 carried out. To reinforce the management on the topic and especially on the risks related to forced/compulsory labour  and  the  right  to  freedom  of  association  and  collective bargaining,  in  2023,  the  risk-based  model  was  extended  to  6 additional  foreign  companies,  for  a  total  of  30.  It  allowed  the identification  of  Nigeria,  Iraq  and  Libya  as  Countries  with  the highest number of suppliers at risk. In addition to activities such as due  diligence,  tender  evaluation,  performance  feedback,  and updates  with  dedicated  questionnaires,  the  risk-based  model foresees  auditing  suppliers  to  monitor  the  respect  for  human rights, aligned with the SA8000 international standards. In 2023, more than 450 in-depth document and field audits were carried out on direct and indirect suppliers, an increase of 30% compared to 2022 audits. In 29% of such assessment led to improvement plans for the companies involved. To promote the knowledge on human rights management remote training programmes and workshops dedicated to procurement colleagues were organised. Furthermore, free access to the 'IPIECA Online Labour Rights training' course was  made  avalilable  for  colleagues  who  deal  with  purchasing abroad and their suppliers. Further actions to counteract forms of modern  slavery  and  human  trafficking  and  to  prevent  the exploitation of minerals associated with human rights violations in the supply chain are discussed respectively in the 'Slavery and",

The latter describes the policies and Eni's systems for the procurement of 'conflict minerals' (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold), with the aim of minimising the risk that the procurement of these  minerals  may  contribute  to  financing,  directly  or  indirectly, human rights violations in the Countries concerned. Eni manages its security operations in accordance with international principles, including  the  Voluntary  Principles  on  Security  &  Human  Rights promoted by the Voluntary Principles Initiative (VPI), a multistakeholder initiative that combines major energy companies in the respect and promotion of Human Rights. Eni, a 'Full Member' of the Voluntary Principles Initiative (VPI) since 2022, conducted a series of actions in 2023 to confirm its commitment and increase sensitivity  and  awareness  of  human  rights.  In  this  regard,  the Conflict Analysis Tool , proposed and developed by the VPI in 2022 with  the  objective  of  analysing  the  causes  of  conflict  in  a  given area/country, was applied in 2023 in Mozambique by conducting interviews at the local level to analyse the causes of conflict in the country, and preparing an action plan containing relevant mitigation actions.  Finally,  in  line  with  the  principles  of  'responsible contracting'  suggested  by  the  best  practices  and  international guidelines on Business & Human Rights, Eni has adopted a series of standard clauses on human rights compliance to be included on the basis of a risk-based approach in the main Eni contractual typologies, and provides support to the business for their definition and negotiation. These clauses, which can be supplemented and adapted to the case in point, are classified according to the type of counterparty  and  contractual  case:  (i)  light  (referring  mainly  to preliminary  agreements  and  with  public  counterparties);  (ii) medium (referring to commodity contracts, consultancy contracts and active supply contracts); (iii) elaborate (referring to passive supply contracts or complex transactions such as M&A).\n\n## Performance metrics and comments\n\nFollowing the 2022 conclusion of the training campaign for senior managers and middle managers (Italy and abroad) on human rights, in  2023,  the  three  specific  courses  ('Security  and  Human  Rights', 'Human Rights and Relations with Communities' and 'Human Rights\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nin the Supply Chain'), were made available to all employees along with the other paths already offered on sustainability and human rights  issues.  Awareness  and  training  activities  on  contrasting violence and harassment at work continued in 2023 and extended to operational sizes (plants and districts).\n\nIn 2023, the percentage of personnel from the Security professional area  trained  on  human  rights  reached  90%:  this  number  reflects the  qualitative/quantitative  turnover  of  incoming  and  outgoing resources from the Professional Area year on year. In addition, since 2009 Eni has been conducting a training programme for public and private security forces at its subsidiaries, which was recognized as a best practice in the 2013 joint publication by the Global Compact and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) of the United Nations. To this end, the Security Workshop & Human Rights was held from 13 to 15 November 2023 in Basra, Iraq. The workshop was  conducted  by  an  independent  consultancy  firm  specialised in  security  management  and  respect  for  Human  Rights  in  the international arena, with more than 300 participants, (170 belonging to  the  armed  forces  and  security  forces),  including  the  Italian Ambassador to Iraq, parliamentarians from the Iraqi federal state, the Governor of the region, all the top military leaders from southern Iraq and the Ministry of the Interior, and other personalities from local and international bodies. This Workshop represented the 22 nd edition of the training initiative that has so far involved 15 Countries. Regarding  to  whistleblowing  reports,  in  2023  investigations were completed on 80 files 46 , of which 46 included human rights issues,  mainly  concerning  potential  impacts  on  workers'  rights and occupational health and safety. Among these, 62 assertions were  verified;  for  8  of  these,  the  reported  facts  were  confirmed, even partially, and corrective actions were taken to mitigate and/or minimise their impacts. In particular, the following were undertaken: (i) actions on the Internal Control and Risk Management System relating  to  the  implementation  and  strengthening  of  controls  in place; (ii) awareness on the topics of the Code of Ethics and the 'Zero Tolerance' policy; and (iii) actions against employees, including disciplinary measures, in line with the collective agreements and other  applicable  national  laws.  At  the  end  of  the  year,  13  files were still open, 9 of which referred to human rights issues, mainly concerning potential impacts on workers' rights.\n\n(44) Under the English Modern Slavery Act 2015 and, from this year, the Australian Commonwealth Modern Slavery Act 2018.\n\n- (45) Compliance with the US SEC regulations.\n\n(46) Whistleblowing file: a summary document of the investigations carried out on the whistleblowing report (s) (which may contain one or more detailed and verifiable assertions) in which the summary of the investigation carried out, on the facts that are the subject of the report, the outcome of the investigations carried out and any action plans identified are reported. Specifically, since 2006, Eni has had regulations (most recently updated in March 2024) governing the process of receiving, analysing and processing whistleblowing reports (so-called whistleblowing) received by Eni SpA and its Subsidiaries concerning alleged conduct - referable to Eni's people or to all those who operate or have operated in Italy or abroad in the name or on behalf or in the interest of Eni - which has occurred or which is very likely to occur - in breach of laws and regulations, provisions of the Authorities, the Code of Ethics, Model 231 or Compliance Models for foreign subsidiaries and internal regulations (such as the Anti-Corruption MSG, etc.). The regulation (published on the Company's website) defines the operating procedures for whistleblowing and managing reports the Board of Statutory Auditors (which, as the Audit Committee pursuant to the SOA regulation, examines all whistleblowing files), to the Supervisory Board and, for reporting activities to falling within the competence of each Subsidiary, to the respective Supervisory Bodies, where present.",

        "page_content": "## SUPPLIERS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEni's Sustainable  Procurement  strategy  is  based  on  shared values, commitments and objectives with its supply chain and is based  on  three  pillars:  a  systemic  and  inclusive  approach,  ESG pervasiveness  in  the  procurement  process,  and  the  development and acknowledgement of best practices. The systemic and inclusive approach aims to involve every level of the supply chain on a path of  improvement  and  sustainable  development,  sharing  common goals and adopting a diversified model according to companies' ESG maturity. Eni provides specific tools for the sustainable development of small and medium-sized enterprises and asks large players to lead the transformation process to support supply chains. To foster convergence  towards  sustainable  models  along  the  entire  value chain,  Eni  promotes  multi-stakeholder  initiatives  such  as  Openes, which was launched by Eni with Boston Consulting Group and Google Cloud in 2021. This system-wide initiative unites the industrial, financial and association worlds to support companies along the path to measuring and growing the ESG dimensions to create value and benefits for the entire entrepreneurial. Thanks to its open and inclusive approach, more than 20 partners have joined Open-es, including major industrial  companies,  financial  institutions  and  associations.  More than 15,000 companies have registered, of which about 6,000 belong to the Eni supply chain (Italian and foreign). ESG pervasiveness in the  procurement process is represented by integrating the principles of environmental protection, social growth and economic development at every stage. With this approach, Eni has adopted the 'Sustainable Supply Chain Framework', a governance mechanism that combines corporate  objectives,  legislative  requirements,  targets  and  specific action plans that affect the procurement process and, more generally, the  supply  chain.  This  framework  involves  cross-monitoring  the various dimensions of sustainability, with a focus on priority ESG topics periodically identified  based on the company's strategic plan and the evolution of the regulatory framework. In particular, crossmonitoring calls for: (i) all suppliers to sign the Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nas a mutual commitment to recognise and protect the value of all people, to commit to tackling climate change and its effects, to operate with integrity, protect company resources, to promote the adoption of these principles to their people and their supply chain; (ii) periodic qualification and due diligence to verify the ESG position, the  ethical  and  reputational,  economic  and  financial,  technical  and operational reliability, and the application of supervision in the areas of health, safety, environment, governance, cyber security and protection of human rights, and minimise the risks along the supply chain; (iii) collection and monitoring of ESG data and information through the\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOpen-es platform; (iv) contract allocation logic also based on the ESG 47 characteristics relevant to the subject matter of the contract; (v) periodic monitoring of the supplier's compliance with its commitments and  behaviour  through  performance  feedback  management;  (vi) implement  improvement  actions  on  the  supplier  if  critical  issues emerge at any stage of the relationship or restrict/inhibit participation in tenders if the supplier does not meet the minimum acceptability standards. In addition to transversal monitoring, in 2023, concerning some ESG dimensions that are priorities for Eni SpA (such as climate change, supply chain governance, human rights, dignity and equality, cybersecurity and safety), Assessments and in-depth analysis were carried out on ESG Relevant Player 48 . Specific minimum criteria were introduced to evaluate bids, and dedicated standard contract clauses.\n\nThe development  and  enhancement  of  best  practices consist of  supporting  suppliers  in  fulfilling  the  various  ESG  requirements, providing tools to support their sustainable development path and, more generally, the competitiveness of their business; these initiatives consist of tools for: (i) Measurement and improvement. Thanks to the Open-es platform, through a pathway based on standardised metrics and  aligned  with  the  evolving  regulatory  environment,  companies can measure their degree of ESG maturity, compare themselves with industry benchmarks, and access customised development plans and solutions offered by selected ESG specialists. Free events are held periodically to increase the sustainability knowledge of participating companies, as well as training programmes, such as the SME campus launched in 2023 in cooperation with KPMG, focusing on corporate sustainability  management;  (ii)  Financial  support.  Eni  promotes and supports its supply chain with the 'Basket Bond - Sustainable Energy'  programme,  and  through  the  'Sustainable  Supply  Chain Finance' initiative, launched in 2023. This initiative allows its suppliers to request early payment of invoices without impacting credit lines, incentivising  the  improvement of the company's ESG profile thanks to the synergy with the Open-es platform. Eni also offers its suppliers products and services on favourable terms, such as solutions for energy  efficiency  and  the  use  of  HVOlution  biofuel  in  transport;  (iii) Enhancement. Eni recognises excellence with the HSE & Sustainability Supply Chain Award. It is an opportunity to share best practices in ESG with its suppliers and to reward companies that have distinguished themselves for their performance and innovative projects. Furthermore, in 2023, Eni launched the supplier diversity programme 'Inclusion Development Partnership' to create a more inclusive and diverse supplier base and increase the participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in the procurement process.\n\n(47) The procedures have rewarding mechanisms related to both environmental aspects (such as energy efficiency or the use of renewables) and social aspects (such as gender equality\n\nor maintaining employment levels).\n\n(48) For each priority ESG theme, clusters of relevant suppliers were identified given the high risk associated with the product areas in which they operate for Eni.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moreover, since 2009, Eni has designed and developed the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program , in compliance with the applicable provisions in force and international conventions and taking into account guidance and best practices, as well as the policies adopted by leading international organisations. It is an organic system of rules, controls and organisational safeguards to prevent corrupt practices, and is also instrumental to the prevention of the phenomenon of money laundering in the context of the nonfinancial activities of Eni SpA and its subsidiaries. At the regulatory level, the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program is represented by the Anti-Corruption MSG 50 and by regulatory instruments to regulate the  specific  activities  at  risk  and  the  control  tools  Eni  makes available to its people to prevent and counter the risk of corruption and money laundering. Subsidiaries, in Italy and abroad, adopt by resolution of its Board of Directors 51 anti-corruption regulations issued by Eni, while companies in which Eni holds a non-controlling interest are encouraged to comply with the standards defined in internal  anti-corruption  regulatory  instruments  by  adopting  and maintaining an adequate internal control system consistent with the laws. Eni's Anti-Corruption Compliance Programme is continuously updated to ensure continuous improvement. In this context, Eni SpA,  in  January  2017,  was  the  first  Italian  company  to  receive ISO 37001:2016 'Anti-bribery Management Systems' certification and,  in  January  2024,  was  among  the  first  Italian  companies  to\n\nobtain ISO 37301:2021 certification of its Compliance Management System 52 . Eni SpA is subject to annual periodic surveillance and a full review of its Compliance Systems every three years to maintain these  certifications.  To  guarantee  the  effectiveness  of  the  AntiCorruption Compliance Program, Eni supports its subsidiaries in Italy  and  abroad,  providing  specialised  assistance  in  the  activity relative to assessing the reliability of potential counterparties at risk (so-called 'due diligence'), the management of any critical issues/ red flags that emerge and the development of the related contractual safeguards. In particular, specific Business Integrity clauses (code of ethics, corporate administrative liability, anti-corruption and antimoney laundering) are included in contracts with counterparties, which also provide for a commitment to view and abide by the principles contained in Eni's Code of Ethics, Model 231, and AntiCorruption MSG. In the qualification process of potential suppliers (see the section on Suppliers), their ethical and reputational reliability profile is assessed, as well as is their adoption by them of an AntiCorruption  Compliance  Program  for  cases  with  a  higher  risk  of corruption. In any case, Business Integrity clauses are defined in the relevant contracts, including contractual remedies in the event of breaches of anti-corruption compliance obligations and audit rights by Eni for the highest-risk cases. In addition, the subcontractor is also subject to prior checks for ethical and reputational reliability and must only operate based on a written contract that contains compliance commitments equivalent to those of the main supplier. Eni has defined and implemented a structured process of Compliance risk assessment and monitoring aimed respectively at: (i) identifying,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  activities  at  risk  identified by Eni through Compliance risk assessment due to its operational and organisational context include, for example: (i) contracts with third  parties  at  risk  of  corruption  and  money  laundering  (such as,  business  associates,  intermediaries,  joint  venture  partners, brokers,  counterparties  in  real  estate  management  operations, commercial network operators, suppliers, credit buyers/assignees, etc.); (ii) transactions for the purchase and sale of company shares, companies and company branches, mining rights and securities, etc. and joint venture contracts; (iii) non-profit initiatives, social projects and sponsorships; (iv) the sale of goods and services (e.g. contracts with customers in the commercial process), trading and/or shipping operations; (v) the selection, recruitment and management of human resources;  (vi)  gifts  and  hospitality;  (vii)  relations  with  Relevant Subjects. Compliance risk assessment activities and anti-corruption Compliance Monitoring interventions are planned annually according to a risk-based approach. In 2023, the first covered the anti-corruption area as a whole and the risk activities 'Sale of goods and services', extending some of the assessments carried out to certain cases of purchases of goods by Eni, 'Non-profit initiatives, social projects and sponsorships', as well as the reassessment of the methodology for identifying suppliers at greater risk of corruption and money laundering. The latter focused on the risk activities 'Joint Ventures',  'Non-profit  Initiatives',  'Sponsorships',  and  'Customers and Sales'. Both activities'  outcomes confirmed the expected risk level and the adequacy of the mitigation measures put in place and the effectiveness of the compliance model adopted.\n\nEni implements an anti-corruption training programme aimed at all its employees through e-learning and in-classroom events, divided into general workshops and job-specific training. Eni's population was segmented according to the corruption risk associated with certain parameters such as country, qualification and professional area to correctly identify the personnel to be trained. A risk assessment methodology, based on specific elements of each Eni subsidiaries was defined with the task to schedule and implement the periodical training  programmes.  In  2023,  the  new  online  course  'Code  of Ethics, Anti-Corruption and Corporate Administrative Liability' was\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\ndelivered to the whole of Eni, in Italy and abroad, and the e-learning on the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program for medium- and highrisk personnel was started. It should be noted that, in 2023, anticorruption activities were also carried out as part of: (i) the training course  dedicated  to  Eni  Managing  Directors  in  Italy  and  abroad and  managers  of  the  Natural  Resources  General  Management with prospects for assuming international management positions through role-playing and discussion of complex cases; (ii) webinars addressed to contract managers for high-risk suppliers and Eni's procurement units; (iii) the 'Managing relations with the Authorities' seminar addressed to HSE managers in Italy and other supporting roles  who  interface  with  public  authorities,  specifically  addressing anti-corruption  requirements  concerning  relations  with  Relevant Persons.  In  2023,  Eni:  (i)  continued  its  anti-corruption  training activities dedicated to its third parties through the recording and delivery of an anti-corruption webinar aimed at high-risk suppliers with  contracts  in  place  with  Eni 53 ; (ii) continued  its  periodic information  and  updating  activities  on  anti-corruption  issues  by elaborating  the  contents  of  'Compliance  flashes' 54 which  were periodically  sent  to  the  company's  top  management.  Finally,  an agile training programme on anti-corruption issues was introduced, consisting of: (i) compliance tips, short videos with examples of behaviours to be adopted in uncomfortable situations; (ii) gameplay in  which  a  working  day  is  simulated,  and  sixteen  dilemmas  are faced in risky activities. The relevant activities in the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program and the planning of such activities for the subsequent periods are the subject of an annual report that is an integral part of the Integrated Compliance Report to the Eni SpA management and supervisory bodies. In 2023, Board induction, the Internal Control and Risk Management System (SCIGR) was brought to the Board's attention. It includes the set of tools, organisational structures, standards and corporate rules to enable Eni's business to be conducted in a healthy, correct and consistent manner with corporate objectives. Eni's experience grows through participation in international conventions, events and working groups, including the World Economic Forum's Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) and the O&G ABC Compliance Attorney Group (a discussion group on anti-corruption issues in the Oil & Gas sector). Eni actively participated in the activities of the International Chamber's working group of Commerce (ICC) to update the ICC Rules on Combating Corruption , published in December 2023. As part of the audit plan approved  annually  by  the  BoD,  Eni  carries  out  specific  checks  to verify the fulfilment of the Compliance Program's provisions through",

Moreover, since 2006, Eni has issued an internal regulation, updated over time and most recently in March 2024, aligned with national and international best practices and with the EU Directive 2019/1937 that regulates the process of receiving, analysing and processing whistleblowing reports received by Eni SpA and its subsidiaries. This regulation allows employees and third parties to report alleged conducts referable to Eni's people or to all those who operate or have operated in Italy and abroad in the name of or on behalf of or in the interest of Eni, which has occurred or may occur, in violation of laws and regulations, provisions of the Authorities, Code of Ethics, Models 231 or Compliance Models for foreign subsidiaries and internal regulations (such as the AntiCorruption  MSG).  Concerning  that  point,  dedicated  information channels have been set up; they are available on the eni.com website, including  a  special  software  platform,  which  whistleblowers  are invited to prefer, as it is suitable for guaranteeing the confidentiality of the data received.\n\nEni's tax strategy , which has been approved by the Board of Directors and  is  available  on  the  Company's 55 website,  is  based  on  the principles of transparency, honesty, fairness and good faith set forth in its Code of Ethics and in the 'OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises' 56 and has as its primary objective the payment of taxes in the various Countries in which it operates, in the knowledge that it  can  contribute  significantly  to  tax  revenues  in  those  Countries, supporting  local  economic  and  social  development.  Eni  has designed and implemented a Tax Control Framework for which Eni's CFO is responsible, structured in a three-step business process: (i) assessment  of  tax  risk  (Risk  Assessment);  (ii)  identification  and establishment of  controls  to  monitor  risks;  (iii)  verification  of  the effectiveness of controls and related information flows (Reporting). As part of its activities for management of tax risk and litigation, Eni adopts prior consultation with tax authorities and it maintains relations based  on  transparency,  dialogue  and  cooperation, participating, where appropriate, in enhanced cooperation projects (Cooperative  Compliance)  such  as  the  cooperative  compliance regime in Italy. The commitment to better governance and greater transparency  in  the  extraction  sector,  which  is  crucial  to  foster responsible use of resources and prevent corruption is demostrated by  Eni  participation  in  the  Extractive  Industries  Transparency Initiative (EITI) since 2005. In this context, in 2023, Eni was appointed\n\n- (56) See: https://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne.\n\nextractives-companies-champion-tax-transparency).\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nas Alternate Member of the EITI Board, the initiative's main decisionmaking body. The Board decides on priorities for the organisation and evaluates the countries' progress in meeting the EITI standard. The EITI initiative envisages the fulfilment of precise expectations by the companies participating in the initiative, which, as of 2021, have also become a framework for evaluating these companies to identify good practices and opportunities for improvement. In 2023, the assessment carried out by EITI showed that Eni fully met seven expectations and partially met two more out of a total of nine. At a local level, Eni also actively participates in initiatives that EITI promotes, directly through the Multi-Stakeholder Groups set up in EITI member countries and indirectly through industry associations. Per Italian Law No. 208/2015, Eni prepares the 'Country-by-Country Report' required by Action 13 of the 'Base erosion and profit shifting - BEPS' project, promoted by the OECD with the sponsorship of the  G-20,  whose  objective  is  to  have  the  profits  of  multinational companies  declared  in  the  jurisdictions  where  the  economic activities that generate them are carried out, in proportion to the value  generated.  With  a  view  to  fostering  fiscal  transparency  for the  benefit  of  all  interested  stakeholders,  this  report  is  published voluntarily by Eni, although there are no regulatory obligations in this regard 57 . The publication of this report has been recognised as best practice by the EITI 58 . Also, in line with its support for the EITI, Eni has published a position on contractual transparency in which governments are encouraged to comply with the new requirement on contracts publication and it is expressed the support to the mechanisms  and  initiatives  that  will  be  launched  by  Countries to promote transparency in this area. Anticipating the reporting requirements on transparency of payments to States in the exercise of extraction activities introduced by the EU Directive 2013/34 EU (Accounting Directive) by two years, in 2015, Eni voluntarily began to provide disclosure regarding a series of summary data on financial flows paid to States where it conducts hydrocarbon exploration and production activities.\n\n## Performance metrics and comments\n\nIn  2023  the  anti-corruption  checks,  based  on  the  Anti-Corruption Compliance Program's provisions, have been performed in 30 audits, carried out in 16 Countries, moreover 13 supervisory activities were carried  out  on  the  231/Compliance  Models  of  the  Italian/foreign subsidiaries.  As  in  2022,  this  year,  the  number  of  ascertained 59 corruption cases relating to Eni SpA amounted to 0. Consequently, there",

Throughout 2023, the delivery of the new e-learning course on the Anti-Corruption Compliance Programme for medium- and high-risk personnel started in Italian, which involved 6,742 participants and will continue in 2024, also in English and French. The 'Code of Ethics, Anti-Corruption and Corporate Administrative Liability' course continued to be held and was aimed at the entire Eni workforce in Italy and abroad. In addition, in 2023, the anti-corruption training continued through general workshops and specific job training according to the risk-based methodology started in 2019. Regarding the commitment to EITI, Eni follows the activities conducted at the international level and contributes to the preparation of the Reports in member Countries; additionally, as a member, Eni takes part in the activities of the MultiStakeholder  Group  in  Congo,  Ghana,  Timor  Leste  and  the  United\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nKingdom. In Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Mexico, Mozambique and Nigeria, Eni's subsidiaries participate in local EITI Multi Stakeholder Groups through the industry associations present in the Countries.\n\nIn 2023, Eni generated an economic value of \u20ac96 billion, of which \u20ac90  billion  was  distributedwith  the  following  drilldown:  82%  as operating costs, 7% as payments to the Public Administration, 7.5% as payments to providers of capital, and 3.5% to employees as wages and benefits. In 2023, Eni received approximately \u20ac286 million as financial assistance from the Public Administration. This amount includes tax credits recognised in Italy for energy and gas-consuming companies to meet the higher expenses incurred for purchasing natural gas and electricity (around \u20ac140 million) and European public contribution Eni's subsidiary Plenitude for the  development of the electric supply network (around \u20ac30 million). In 2023, investments net of depreciation amounted  to  \u20ac7,413  million  shareholders  remuneration,  including share buy-backs and dividend payments amounted to \u20ac4,885 million, and taxes cashed out were \u20ac6,283 million.\n\n| KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS                                         | 2023     | 2023   | 2023                                   | 2022   | 2022   | 2021   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|                                                                    |          | Total  | of which fully  consolidated  entities |        | Total  |        | Total  |\n| Audits covering the anti-corruption checks                         | (number) | 30     |                                        | 30     |        | 25     | 20     |\n| General Workshops                                                  |          | 1,574  |                                        | 1,524  |        | 1,346  | 1,284  |\n| Job specific training                                              |          | 687    |                                        | 635    |        | 523    | 702    |\n| Countries where Eni supports EITI's local Multi Stakeholder Groups |          | 9      |                                        | 9      |        | 9      | 9      |\n\n| ECONOMIC VALUE                                  | 2023        |        | 2022    | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|---------|--------|\n|                                                 |             | Total  | Total   | Total  |\n| Economic value generated                        | (\u20ac million) | 95,594 | 134,232 | 78,092 |\n| Economic value distributed (a)                  |             | 89,878 | 120,451 | 66,138 |\n| of which: operating costs                       |             | 73,836 | 102,529 | 55,549 |\n| of which: employees wages and salaries          |             | 3,136  | 3,015   | 2,888  |\n| of which: payments to providers of capital      |             | 6,623  | 6,419   | 3,975  |\n| of which: payments to the Public Administration |             | 6,283  | 8,488   | 3,726  |\n| Economic value retained                         |             | 5,716  | 13,781  | 11,954 |\n\n- (a) For the Economic value distributed item relating to Community Investment, please refer to the section Key performance indicators in the chapter Alliances for development on pp. 183-185.",

This approach is part of the Company's decarbonization strategy. It encompasses crucial topics like: 'Just Transition', which increasingly considers the impact of energy transformation on people and respect for human  rights  through  a  responsible  management  model  for the primary consolidated company processes. The approach is integrated throughout the business cycle by analysing the human rights situation and socio-economic context, as well as impact and mitigation measures, assessing local content, and promoting local development and stakeholder engagement. Specifically, local development programmes promote a broad portfolio of communitybased initiatives in line with national development plans and the Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  including  supporting the creation of job opportunities and the transfer of know-how and skills to local partners. An essential element to achieving the common  objectives  are  Alliances  for  sustainable  Development with all the players involved - from private individuals, to the public sector, international organisations, civil society associations and research  institutes  -  which  make  it  possible  to  pool  resources and human capital to promote inclusive growth. Starting from the analysis of the local socio-economic context, also realised based on the Multidimensional Poverty Index 60 (MPI), which accompanies the  various  business  project  phases  to  ensure  greater  efficiency and a systemic approach in decision-making, Eni adopts tools and methodologies consistent with the main international standards to meet the needs of local populations. These instruments allow, on the one hand, to promote local development and, on the other hand, to reduce possible negative impacts (direct and indirect) of new business development activities. To this end, Eni always produces an Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessment (ESHIA) that goes beyond the mandatory requirements for environmental authorisations in the countries where it is present. This guarantees the adherence of activities to the recognised international standards and provides for actions to avoid or minimise the socio-economic impact of activities to a level deemed acceptable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImpact  studies  are  shared  with  local  communities 61 ;  moreover, thanks to a mapping of local stakeholders affected by the activities, Eni informs civil society and minority interest organisations about the possibility of contributing to impact assessments. Through models  such  as  the  Eni  Local  Content  Evaluation  (ELCE) 62 ,  Eni can  quantify  the  direct,  indirect  and  induced  benefits  generated in business operations. In addition, analyses are carried out to measure the percentage of spending on local suppliers by some relevant foreign subsidiaries. In 2023, the rate amounted to about 31% of total expenditures. This is also linked to new contracts to develop large, high-tech projects managed on the market by large international companies. In addition to these activities are the  definitions  of  the  specific  Local  Development  Programmes (LDPs) in line with the United Nations 2030 Agenda, the National Development Plans, the National Development Plans for the Health sector,  the  United  Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and Human  Rights  (UNGPs)  and  the  commitments  under  the  Paris Agreement  (Nationally  Determined  Contributions  -  NDCs),  that call for five lines of action: (i) contribution to the socio-economic development of local communities, in accordance with national legislation and development plans, also based on the knowledge acquired. These initiatives aim to improve access to off-grid energy and  clean  cooking,  economic  diversification  (e.g.  agricultural projects, micro-credit, and infrastructure interventions); protection of land, education and vocational training; access to drinking water and sanitation, proper nutrition and support of health services and systems; as well as improving the health of vulnerable groups. Relevant projects are developed using Logical Framework Approach (LFA) international methods and are monitored using the Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) management tool; (ii) Local Content: generation  of  added  value  by  transferring  skills  and  know-how, initiating labour along the local supply chain and implementing development projects; (iii) Land management: starting from the assessment of the impacts deriving from the acquisition of land or restrictions on the use of public resources (including marine areas) on  which  Eni's  activities  are  carried  out  to  define  alternatives  or mitigate potential negative effects, to pursue the well-being of local communities;  (iv)  Stakeholder  engagement:  the  ability  to  relate\n\n- (60) The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index, developed in 2010 by OPHI, UNDP's Human Development Report Office, is an international measure of acute poverty, covering more than 100 developing countries and integrating traditional monetary poverty measures with three other key dimensions: health, education and living standards.

In support of Eni's Local Development Programmes are also the partnerships signed with international organisations and, more generally, with organisations promoting cooperation for development. Examples are Eni's collaborations with UN agencies such as: United Nations Industrial Development Organisation  (UNIDO)  to  start  up  the  Oyo  Renewable  Energy Research Centre in Congo; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in Mexico to collaborate on a Water Security Plan for the Mezcalapa-Samaria Subbasin to reduce the risk of natural disasters and to promote sustainable tourism in the La Venta Park-Museum in Villahermosa as an opportunity for economic diversification  International  Organisation  for  Migration (IOM) to promote youth employment in southern Libya through vocational training activities; Ethical Fashion Initiative, a programme of the International Trade Centre (ITC) - a joint agency of the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) - for the creation of a quality textile production centre with the involvement of local artisans in Ivory Coast; civil society organisations such as ADPP, AVSI, Banco Alimentare and Oikos for local development projects. Concerning health-related initiatives, agreements were signed with several Ministries of Health and local health authorities, e.g. Italy and Mexico. Cooperation agreements were also signed with IRCCS Policlinico San Donato for the construction of the medical training centre in Port Said in Egypt, with International Rescue Committee and Doctors with Africa Cuamm in Ivory Coast to strengthen primary health care services, and with Operation Smile in Vietnam to treat cleft lips and palates in children. Collaborations with the private sector  launched  in  2023  include  the  three-party  collaboration between ENI, Ong IRC, and the IVECO Group in Ivory Coast for vocational training programs for young people in the energy and automotive sectors. The collaboration started in 2022 with CNH Industrial and IVECO Group continued for economic diversification, education and vocational training starting in the Basilicata region. Employing  an  'internal  procedure',  Eni  has  defined  and  applied the guiding principles for managing the 'Grievance Mechanism', the  responsibility  for  which  rests  on  all  the  subsidiaries  and Districts, on the operational level, to analyse and agree upon the solution with claimants, whether individuals or communities. As of 2023, Eni is extending the 'Grievance Mechanism' application to  new  businesses  (e.g.  Agri-feedstock).  Knowledge  of  the context, including the cultural context, makes it possible to have processes with appropriate channels of access consistent with the context and to apply the most pertinent modes of dialogue and management for potential conflict. In particular, subsidiaries\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nmay  conduct  dedicated  consultations  with  local  communities, especially  indigenous  peoples  and  vulnerable  groups,  in  cases where the context and/or past projects suggest a high number of grievances, or where the projects or activities involve economic or physical relocation of communities. Grievances can be submitted through online channels, including a dedicated email address and an institutional website of local companies, or physically at the administrative/operational site or through collection boxes located in areas involved in the local development project. All the grievances are received, analysed and managed by the subsidiaries and are tracked  in  the  company's  'Stakeholder  Management  System' (SMS)  application.  The  application  is  a  management  tool  for mapping stakeholder relations and monitoring the project progress of projects and results. Grievances are monitored at subsidiary and central levels from receipt to termination of them and enables to  classified  them  by  theme  and  relevance,  and  it  allows  the percentage of resolved ones out of the total received in a given period. The system allows monitoring any relevant stakeholders' critical issues over time and adjusting the engagement strategy accordingly. Other areas of investigation concern the timeliness of management of grievances, the trend analysis of associated issues (to  understand  whether  they  are  reiterated)  and  their  possible evolution towards a dispute. Feedback can be requested from the claimants on their level of satisfaction with the operation of the process, asking them to point out any areas for improvement. This leads to a strengthening of the grievance management process, based from 2022 on a classification of grievances structured on three levels of relevance, which leads to different, relevant corporate streams of solution definition and approval. Eni also requires its suppliers,  contractors  and  subcontractors  to  make  their  own Grievance Mechanism available to the workers and communities they interact with on behalf of Eni.\n\n## Performance metrics and comments\n\nIn 2023, investments for local development amounted to around \u20ac95 million (Eni share), about 96% of which were in Upstream activities. In Africa, a total of \u20ac51.6 million was spent, of which \u20ac48.1 million in the Sub-Saharan area, about \u20ac26.5 million in Asia mainly invested for  economic  diversification,  especially  for  the  development  and maintenance of infrastructure (particularly school buildings) and for vocational training, and in \u20ac10.7 million in Italy. Approximately \u20ac32.6 million  was  invested  in  infrastructure  development  activities,  of which \u20ac17.7 million in Asia, \u20ac12.6 million in Africa, and \u20ac1.3 million in  Italy  and  \u20ac1.0  million  in  Central  America.  The  main  projects implemented in 2023 included initiatives to promote: (i) access to energy in Ivory Coast and Mozambique through the distribution of  improved  cooking  systems  and  related  awareness-raising campaigns; (ii) economic diversification in the agricultural sector in Egypt, Nigeria and Mozambique; local and youth entrepreneurship in Ivory Coast, Ghana and Mexico; and socio-economic development",

In terms of health development projects, in 2023, Eni has carried out initiatives in 15 countries with a total expenditure of \u20ac10.7 million to improve the health status of the populations of partner Countries as an essential prerequisite for\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nsocio-economic  development  through  the  strengthening  of  the skills of health personnel (for example in Angola, Libya, and Ivory Coast), the construction and rehabilitation of healthcare facilities and their equipment (for example in Iraq, Ivory Coast, Mozambique and  Congo),  information,  education  and  awareness  on  health issues  among  the  populations  involved  (for  example  in  Egypt, Ghana  and  Mexico).  Moreover,  in  continuity  with  the  approach adopted  to  support  healthcare  institutions  and  facilities  for  the COVID-19 emergency, in 2023, Eni carried out interventions for the redevelopment of  the health system in Italy, intending to contribute to strengthen and to improve the resilience of local facilities, such as the completion of the intensive therapy department of Vittorio Emanuele Hospital in Gela, the creation of the Infectious Emergency Room at Ospedale Luigi Sacco di Milano Hospital (expected to be completed in 2024) and the design of the high bio-containment department with integrated analysis laboratory at the S. Matteo in Pavia Hospital. In 2023, to assess the project's potential impacts on  the  communities  health,  Eni  completed  11  Health  Impact Assessments (HIAs), of which six were integrated ESHIA studies. During 2023, 139 grievances 63 were received, 67 (equal to 48%) of which were resolved. Complaints mainly related to: community relations management (the most recurrent category), environmental aspect management, employment development, land management, educational development, and economic diversification.\n\n| KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS   | 2023        | 2023   | 2022                                   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------|-------------|--------|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                              |             | Total  | of which fully  consolidated  entities | Total  | Total  |\n| Local development investment | (\u20ac million) | 95.0   | 84.1                                   | 76.4   | 105.3  |\n| of which: infrastructure     |             | 32.6   | 32.3                                   | 31.3   | 39.8   |",

Technical screening criteria ('TSC') are established for each economic activity, which are the performance conditions that the operator of an economic activity must assess to verify the substantial contribution to an objective and respect of the 'do no significant harm' principle.\n\nIn the initial stage of the Taxonomy roll-out, which was applied to financial reports for 2021 and 2022, the Commission has regulated just the economic activities eligible to make a substantial contribution to  the  climate  objectives:  climate  change  mitigation  and  climate change adaptation by means of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 (the 'Climate Delegated Act') as complemented by the nuclear and gas-related activities listed in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 (the 'Complementary Climate Delegated Act').\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nIn 2023, the Commission has issued the Environmental Delegated Regulation  (EU)  2023/2486  whereby  it  has  defined  the  economic activities  eligible  to  make  a  substantial  contribution  to  the  four environmental  objectives,  and  the  relevant  TSC.  Furthermore,  the Climate Delegated Act has been updated by modifying the TSC applied to  certain  economic  activities  and  by  introducing  new  economic activities eligible to substantially contribute to the climate objectives (e.g. construction of aircrafts and airline passenger transport).\n\nAn activity is 'taxonomy-eligible' if it is described in a delegated act adopted under the Taxonomy Regulation, irrespective of whether it complies with the technical screening criteria. Such an activity could potentially make a substantial contribution to a given environmental objective.\n\nThe Delegated Regulation on the reporting obligations in connection with the Taxonomy (see below) has been amended by providing that non-financial undertakings will only report the share of eligible revenues, capital expenditures and operating expenditures associated with the eligible activities defined in the Environmental Delegated Act, pairing the  same  reporting  approach  utilized  with  the  climate  objectives, consisting of not applying the TSC for the first reporting year (this also applies to the new activities of the Climate Delegated Act).\n\nAn activity is 'taxonomy-aligned' if it contributes substantially to one or more environmental objectives, does no significant harm 'DNSH' to any of the other objectives, is carried out in compliance with minimum human and labor rights safeguards, and complies with the relevant technical screening criteria.\n\nEni has assessed the economic activities performed by the Group against the economic activities qualifying for the taxonomy's climate mitigation  and  climate  adaptation  objectives,  which  have  been identified  by  Delegated  Regulation  EU  2021/2139  (the  'Climate Delegated Act') and the nuclear and gas-related activities listed in Delegated Regulation EU 2022/1214 (the 'Complementary Climate Delegated Act').\n\nThis assessment has comprised a two-step process: first, the Group economic activities have been screened to score those eligible in accordance with the above-mentioned delegated acts.\n\nThen,  the  technical  screening  criteria  have  been  applied  to  verify alignment of each of the Group's eligible economic activities with the relevant TSC to verify the substantial contribution criteria and respect of the DNSH criteria. The assessment of compliance with the minimum safeguards provided by Art. 3 'c' of the Regulation has been performed at Group level.\n\nNo  significant  changes  to  Eni's  existing  reporting  boundaries  have been  made  in  connection  with  the  eligible  economic  activities identified  pursuant  to  the  Environmental  Delegated  Act,  considering the Taxonomy constrain about the non-eligibility of activities that could lead to a lock-in of assets that undermine long-term environmental goals (for example the production of alternative water resources for",

This is explained by evidence that amounts recognized or allocated by the managerial accounting system are reconciled with the accounting system and the general ledger. Common costs are apportioned to different reporting objectives and economic activities based on disaggregation criteria that reflect how common inputs are absorbed.\n\nOperating  costs  of  Eni  Group  companies  to  define  the  proportion of the opex of aligned and eligible activities to the Group total were determined on the basis of the managerial accounting system and Eni's control model of fixed costs which, starting from accounting data relating to purchases of goods and materials, services, labour costs and other charges, excludes raw materials costs, industrial plant variable costs and costs of products for resale and aggregates the remaining cost items in relation to the different measurement and control stages in the manufacturing/sale process:\n\n- \u00b7  fixed industrial costs which include the labor costs for personnel involved in the maintenance, operation and servicing of industrial plants,  third-party  services  (mainly  maintenance  contracted  to third parties), general plant costs, consumables (spare parts) and include energy efficiency actions at buildings and other properties, as well as the purchase of outputs from aligned activities to achieve CO 2 emission reductions;\n- \u00b7  non-capitalised research & development costs;\n- \u00b7  commercial & marketing fixed costs;\n- \u00b7  general and administrative costs.\n\nFor the purposes of reporting obligations, management has identified industrial fixed costs and non-capitalised R&D costs as the aggregate 'opex'  operating  expenses  corresponding  to  the  definition  of  the denominator adopted by the Delegated Regulation on reporting. In line with the provisions, the opex incurred to purchase enabling products or in relation to enabling manufacturing processes have been claimed by the economic activities carried out by Eni in compliance with Art. 16 of the Taxonomy Regulation so that do not lead to a lock-in of assets that undermine long-term environmental goals, considering their economic lives. In this context, the opex incurred by the E&P sector to increase energy efficiency/reduce CO 2 emissions at oil & gas plants were excluded. This principle has also been applied to capex.\n\n## 1.2.2.

However, the Group does not engage in economic activities that manufacture productions and solutions for climate change adaptation. Therefore, the objective of climate change adaptation has been assessed as far as necessary to verify that each of Eni's eligible economic activities does not significantly harm any of the objectives of the Taxonomy, in compliance with Art. 3 of Regulation (UE) 2020/852.\n\nRegarding the environmental objectives regulated in 2023, Eni has identified as eligible activities for purpose of assessing in the next year their substantial contribution to the objective of the circular economy: (i) 1.1 manufacturing of plastic packaging; (ii) 2.5 recovery of organic waste through anaerobic digestion or composting. Both activities were assessed in 2023 for the purpose of a substantial contribution to the objective of climate change mitigation (reference activities 3.17 and 5.7/5.8).\n\n## The  Company  has  excluded  from  its  eligible  activities  the following activities:\n\n3.10\n\nmanufacture of hydrogen;\n\n- 6.10 sea  and  coastal  freight  water  transport,  vessels  for port  operations  and  auxiliary  activities,  which  support hydrocarbons.\n\nThe reason is their non-compliance with the lock-in clause stated at Art. 16 of the Taxonomy.\n\nEni  has  assessed  whether  its  eligible  economic  activities  are environmentally  sustainable  in  compliance  with  the  provisions  of Art. 3 of Regulation (UE) 2020/852 complemented by Commission Delegated Regulation (UE) 2021/2139 adopted pursuant to Articles 10-11 par. 3 of the above mentioned regulation, which establishes the technical screening criteria which set the performance conditions whereby an economic activity can be claimed to contribute substantially to  the  objective  of  climate  change mitigation, does not significantly harm any of the environmental objectives of the Taxonomy and is carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards laid down in Article 18 of Regulation (UE) 2020/852. Based on those evaluations, the Group concluded that the following activities are environmentally sustainable as per Regulation (UE) 2020/852.\n\n## 3.17. Manufacture of plastics in primary form\n\nThe economic activity includes: (i) production of resins, especially biodegradable  and  compostable  polyesters  and  copolyesters,\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nderived  in  whole  or  in  part  from  renewable  raw  materials;  (ii) production of biodegradable and compostable plastics, i.e., blends of resins derived in whole or in part from renewable raw materials. These production lines belong to Novamont, whose control was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe economic activity 'Manufacture of plastics in primary form ' is a transitional activity as of Article 10, paragraph 2, of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 if it meets the technical screening criteria described at the point 3.17 of Regulation (EU) 2021/2139.\n\nSubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation\n\nFor the assessment of substantial contribution to climate change mitigation,  criterion  c)  related  to  activity  3.17  as  stated  in  EU Regulation 2021/2139 was applied, as follows:\n\n- c)  derived  in  whole  or  in  part  from  renewable  raw  materials, and  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  over  their  life  cycle  are lower than the greenhouse gas emissions in the life cycle of equivalent primary form plastics manufactured from fossil fuels. Greenhouse  gas  emissions  over  the  life  cycle  are  calculated using  Recommendation  2013/179/EU  or,  alternatively,  ISO 14067:2018  or  ISO  14064-1:2018.  Greenhouse  gas  emissions quantified over the life cycle are verified by an independent third party. Agricultural biomass used for manufacturing of plastics in  primary  form  meets  the  criteria  of  Article  29,  paragraphs 2 to 5, of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Forest biomass used for manufacturing of plastics in primary form meets the criteria of Article 29, paragraphs 6 to 7, of the same directive.\n\nIn this context, chemicals derived from hydrocarbons were identified as equivalent to resins and plastics derived in whole or in part from renewable raw materials. These equivalent chemicals were identified considering chemical equivalence in terms of composition and equivalence in the chemical family. For both product lines, the hydrocarbon-derived equivalent is PBAT. Subsequently, emissions from  Novamont's  activity  and  the  hydrocarbon  equivalent  were calculated based on the Life Cycle Thinking methodology, which includes all stages of their respective supply chains (procurement, processing, transportation, and disposal). This analysis confirmed compliance with the stated criterion 'c' of the Taxonomy.\n\n## Do No Significant Harm ('DNSH')\n\nClimate change adaptation\n\nThe Group has conducted a risk assessment of the exposure of Novamont's production plants to acute and chronic weather events as anticipated by Appendix 'A' to the Climate Delegated Regulation. The main physical risk is of hydrogeological nature. The plants are located in a basin regulated by a hydrogeological plan coordinated by a basin authority. The plan identifies various risk scenarios related to  landslides  and  floods  and  outlines  the  prevention  measures and safety protocols adopted by the activity to mitigate potential",

The purpose of this risk assessment is to define and execute mitigation plans designated to adapt the Group assets\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nto current or expected risks, considering the already existing barriers at each Company's asset. This assessment considers various timing horizons based on assets' useful lives (about thirty years for solar installation, wind mills and biorefineries, whereas recharging points for EV have seven years of useful live).\n\nEni's  assessment  methodology  of  assets'  exposure  to  natural hazards features the following steps:\n\n- \u00b7  it  utilizes  input  data  furnished  by  an  external  provider,  leader in  the  sector,  which  has  elaborated  detailed  geographic  maps of prospective climate-related risks ensuring a full coverage of onshore and offshore areas where Eni's assets are located. The sources of such climate maps combine the most updated climate forecast models, also incorporating historical weather patterns, to provide expected quantitative trends in the evolution of climaterelated events ( with reference to quantitative parameters expected number  of  days  with  temperatures  above  or  below  historical averages, wind strength, rain intensity, etc.);\n- \u00b7 it develops a stress test of the current asset portfolio, without limiting to assets' residual useful lives, to evaluate the potential, perspective exposure to climate-related risks till 2050;\n- \u00b7 it is performed yearly, and it will undergo continuous improvement based on the experience that will be accumulated over time, as well as the evolution in the framework on how to identify and measure climate-related risks;\n- \u00b7 it utilizes the IPCC SSP5 - 8.5 scenario to project the expected future geographical maps of climate-related hazards;\n- \u00b7 it utilizes the geographic coordinates of each Company's asset (longitude and latitude) to locate it in a given quadrant (each with an area of one square kilometer) as defined by the external provider to recognize the climate-related risks, which each asset is potentially exposed to over a thirty-year horizon based on the adopted climate scenario;\n- \u00b7  it considers  in  the  risk-evaluating  process  also  third-party assets and assets of the supply chain, where relevant to a full understanding of the risks which each Eni's asset is exposed to.\n\nOnce climate-related hazards have been identified and classified, the management evaluates each asset's existing barriers or factors both physical ones (structural characteristics of an asset design, materials  used  in  its  construction,  distance  from  the  sources of  possible  hazards,  containment  walls,  etc.)  and  systems  and procedures (early warning systems, procedures to put in safety plants  and  equipment,  existence  of  monitoring  and  verification plans, etc.).\n\nThe outcome of that review informs the management of the residual riskand:\n\n- \u00b7 in case of chronic climate-related hazards, monitoring activities are  designed,  planned,  and  carried  out  leading  to  the  possible implementation and follow-up of remediation measures;",

The activity is performed at the biorefineries of Gela (Sicily) and Venice.\n\n## Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation\n\nEach batch of HVO manufactured in 2023 has been reviewed to assess the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. Volumes  of  HVO  manufactured  using  food  and  feed  crops  as feedstock  have  been  excluded  from  the  KPI,  as  well  as  those produced using agricultural biomass that does not comply with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 2 to 5, of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.\n\nThe  greenhouse  gas  emission  savings  from  the  HVO  volumes manufactured from sustainable feedstock have been measured by applying the GHG saving methodology and the relative fossil fuel comparator set out in Annex V to Directive (EU) 2018/2001.\n\nThe saving has been calculated for each kind of biomass used as feedstock. Based on the outcome of this review, 95% of the marketed to third parties volumes at the Gela biorefinery have been assessed to contribute substantially to climate change mitigation.\n\nThe  activity  turnover,  OpEx,  and  Capex  have  apportioned  to  the relevant KPIs in proportion to the percentage of environmentally sustainable manufactured volumes of HVO.",

Contextual information about the OpEx KPI\n\nThe numerator of the OpEx KPI comprises \u20ac190 million of expenses that  mainly  related  to  maintenance  and  repair,  and  other  direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment by the Eni or third party to whom activities are outsourced that were necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets. The breakdown related to the main activities is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  \u20ac86 million incurred in the production of electricity from photovoltaic plants, related to maintenance and other daily operating expenses (inspections, cleaning, and others);\n- \u00b7  \u20ac25  million  incurred  in  the  production  of  electricity  from  wind plants, related to maintenance and other daily operating expenses (inspections, cleaning, and others);\n- \u00b7  \u20ac64  million  incurred  in  the  production  of  biofuels,  related  to maintenance  and  other  daily  operating  expenses  (inspections, cleaning, and others).\n\n## Compliance with the Minimum Safeguards (Ms) - Article 3 'c' of the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nThe  criteria  for  the  eco-sustainability  of  economic  activities outlined  in  Article  3  of  the  Taxonomy  Regulation  call  for respecting  minimum  safeguards  when  conducting  business (referred to in paragraph 'c'). The rule under Article 18 identifies the  MS  with  the  procedures  implemented  by  a  company  to ensure that business conduct complies with the OECD Guidelines for  Multinational  Enterprises  and  the  United  Nations  Guiding\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights. Compliance with the MS includes the principles and rights set out in the eight core conventions identified in the International Labour Organisation's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and in the International Bill of Human Rights.\n\nWhen  companies  implement  these  procedures,  they  must  also comply with the 'do no significant harm' principle outlined in Article 2,  paragraph  17  of  Regulation  (EU)  2019/2088,  the  Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). The SFDR requires financial market participants to assess the ESG risk of the investments within the financial products they intend to offer investors, measuring the ESG performance of the investee companies against a predefined set of key impact indicators in critical 'principal adverse impact' areas. Five of these indicators have a social nature: (i) violations of the UN Global Compact principles and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational  Enterprises;  (ii)  lack  of  processes  and  compliance mechanisms  to  monitor  compliance  with  the  previous  point's principles;  (iii)  unadjusted  gender  pay  gap;  (iv)  Board  gender diversity; and (v) exposure to controversial weapons. The definition of sustainable investment in Article 2 (17) of the SFDR states that an  investment  is  sustainable  if  it  contributes  to  broadly  defined environmental or social objectives, provided that it does not harm any of these objectives. Thus, Eni assumes that in complying with the  SFDR  principle  'do  no  significant  harm',  it  is  understood  to refer  to  the  five  social  impact  indicators  described  above,  four  of which are included in Eni's human rights due diligence processes. Regarding the fifth, Eni confirms that it does not have any exposure to controversial weapons.\n\nThe OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises are principles for responsible business conduct related to eight business areas:\n\n- \u00b7  three relate to the issues of human rights (human rights, consumer protection, employment and industrial relations);\n- \u00b7 Anti-Corruption;\n- \u00b7  fair competition;\n- \u00b7 taxation.\n\nFinally,  environmental  protection  is  treated  by  the  sustainability performance criteria set Article 3 of the Taxonomy Regulation, while science/technology are out of the scope.\n\nThe ILO's eight labor conventions are comprised in the wider issue of respect for human rights.\n\nObservance  of  the  fundamental  principles  of  human  rights contained  in  the  International  Bill  of  Human  Rights  (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights) is ensured by Eni's compliance with the Italian Constitution and rules intended to implement it, which embody human rights principles. As a company incorporated in Italy, Eni is obliged to observe them.",

Within  the  context  of  the  Company's zero  tolerance  for  corruption,  Eni  has  adopted  a  controlled environment  that  includes  processes  and  controls  designed to minimize the risk of behavior or transactions that could lead to willful or negligent acts of corruption. This aims to ensure constant and strict compliance of Eni's employees, contractors and other individuals working or acting on behalf of Eni with the anti-corruption laws in force in the Countries where the Company operates.  This  system  also  applies  to  money  laundering.  The control environment is based on values the organization shares, starting with top management. It includes establishing a code of  ethics  inspired  by  the  principles  of  transparency,  honesty, fairness, and good faith in conducting business, adherence to the UN Ten Principles of Corporate Responsibility, participation in the Global Compact and personnel training on ethical issues. The processes and controls are designed to ensure accurate and transparent recording of corporate transactions, assessment of economic counterparties in significant transactions (acquisitions/ divestment  of  subsidiaries,  shareholdings  and  assets,  mining rights, business combinations, etc.), involvement of certain types of counterparties (business associates, joint venture partners, brokers) or in areas (trading, non-profit initiatives, sponsorships) exposed to corruption risks, as well as compliance of business conduct  with  internal  rules  under  all  circumstances  where  a breach of the code of ethics might be possible, to prevent any form of corruption in managing the business. An integral part of Eni's DD on Anti-Corruption is establishing and maintaining\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\na  whistleblowing  mechanism  even  for  managing  anonymous reports  received  by  the  Company  through  a  well-identified  and recognizable  channel  of  alleged  violations  of  anti-corruption and money laundering regulations (this mechanism also applies to  the  DD  on  Human  Rights).  In  2023,  neither  the  Company nor  members  of  senior  management  were  party  to  criminal proceedings for violating anti-corruption regulations that resulted in  a  final  verdict  of  conviction.  Please  refer  to  the  notes  to  the consolidated  financial  statements  for  more  information  on  the status of the Group's legal proceedings.\n\n- \u00b7 TAXATION . Eni  has  adopted  a  due  diligence  system  for managing relations with the tax authorities of the Countries in which it operates. The aim is to minimize the risk that business operations violate applicable tax regulations. The Company's tax guidelines provide for the payment of taxes in the countries where operations take place according to the merit as well as the letter of local rules and rejects aggressive tax policy choices, including delocalization  of  economic  activities  to  so-called  tax  havens. The Company has a Tax Control Framework, i.e. a specific tax risk  control  system.  Management  is  responsible  for  verifying consistency between tax management choices and the Boardapproved  strategy.  The  control  environment  and  processes/ procedures are designed to mitigate the risk of violations which could trigger significant financial or reputational impact (tax risk). In 2023, no Group company was party to any tax dispute for violations of tax rules or tax fraud resulting in a final verdict of conviction. For more information on the status of the Group's tax litigation, please refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. These disputes relate to the technical interpretation of local tax regulations, which are often very complex. They are managed with a view to reconciliation.\n- \u00b7 FAIR COMPETITION . Eni has set up a controlled environment and a set of procedures and controls to minimize the risk that business  and  corporate  activities  violate  the  rules  protecting competition in the various countries where it operates. Among the  fundamental  values  of  the  Company  are  the  principles of  fair  competition  -  understood  as  a  market  environment that  encourages  companies  to  excel  in  the  quality  and  cost effectiveness of the products and/or services sold/supplied and compliance with antitrust legislation. Eni's control system has  three  phases:  prevention,  risk  monitoring/mitigation  and counteracting unlawful conduct. It is designed to minimize the risk that Eni's business units and subsidiaries engage in anticompetitive conduct, adopt practices that restrict the free market or collude with competing companies. Corporate transactions to  increase  market  share  (mergers/acquisitions)  are  executed after the antitrust authorities of the jurisdictions concerned have been  informed.  Appropriate  remediation  plans  are  formulated",

In 2023, no Group company or senior management member was party to disputes for antitrust legislation violations that resulted in a final verdict of conviction. On the reporting date, there was no significant pending antitrust disputes.\n\n- \u00b7 HUMAN  RIGHTS . Human  rights  are  at  the  heart  of  Eni's vision as a responsible company and a core component of the organization's values, culture, and management systems. Eni is committed to respecting human rights in all business activities and places similar expectations on business partners operating on behalf of Eni or who are contracted over the course of Eni's industrial activities. Eni has adopted a human rights due diligence process that complies with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, including OECD guidelines on Human Rights DD, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP).\n\nEni is committed to carrying out Human Rights Due Diligence in its activities and has adopted a model that identifies and assesses risks relating to the potential violation of human rights from a dual perspective:\n\n- -the risk of causing (or contributing to causing) actual or potential adverse impacts on human rights, with reference to the UNGPs and the OECD Guidelines;\n- -the  risk  of  incurring  sanctions,  significant  financial  losses,  or reputational damage.\n\nEni assesses the human rights potential and actual impacts of its activities  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  identifies  specifically  tailored strategies and solutions, in the context of an ongoing effort to improve prevention and mitigation of such impacts.\n\nIn line with OECD/UNGP guidelines, Eni's DD on human rights is structured along six steps:\n\n- i) adoption of a commitment statement, by the top management, upholding  respect  for  human  rights  and  the  integration  of human rights into company management systems, processes and policies;\n- ii)  recognition of value chain stages and business relationships where Eni is most exposed to risks of human rights violation leading to identification of Salient Human Rights Issues for Eni, that are defined based on the business activities, the contexts in which Eni operates and the sharing with relevant local and international stakeholders, through the adoption of a risk-based approach;\n- iii) a risk assessment aiming to identify and evaluate the adverse impacts of the company's activities on human rights, which foresees the involvement of stakeholders;\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\n- iv) the design and implementation of measures to prevent, cease or mitigate any adverse impact;\n- v)  the verification of the effectiveness of the measures taken;\n- vi) reporting  on  outcomes  and  impacts  relating  to  actions undertaken  by  the  company  to  prevent,  cease  or  mitigate the  adverse  impact  and  the  measures  taken,  which  targets interested stakeholders and provides useful inputs to improve planning of future company's activities.\n\nIn line with OECD guidelines, Eni has established a mechanism for collecting and evaluating complaints and concerns brought to the Company's attention through appropriate channels for listening and for the receipt of communications by individuals, communities, or associations of individuals, aimed at ensuring that any possible violations  of  human  rights  are  promptly  detected,  scrutinized, managed and - where ascertained - remedied.\n\nIn the event of alleged human rights violation the company provides two schemes of access to the Company:\n\n- -a 'Grievance Mechanism', which includes a set of procedures that Eni makes available for the receipt and treatment of alleged violations, which include the options to lodge, in written or verbal form, complaints or grievances on part of affected stakeholders in relation to the Eni's business activities and on their management and resolution. Human rights grievances qualified as 'significant' entail a specific procedure for their scrutiny and response;\n- -'Reporting', which includes the channels available to employees or  third  parties  to  report,  even  confidentially  or  anonymously, issues  concerning  the  Internal  Control  System  or  alleged violations of the principles stated in Eni's Code of Ethics, such as business ethics, bullying, harassment, discrimination, and respect for Human Rights.\n\nEni also cooperates with other non-judicial redress mechanisms, such as the one provided and regulated by the OECD Guidelines and set up at OECD National Contact Points.\n\nEni is actively committed to reviewing complaints and providing or cooperating to provide remedies for adverse human rights impacts that it may have caused or contributed to, and to make every effort to promote the achievement of the same objective in cases where the  impact  is  directly  related  to  its  operations.  Eni  cooperates actively and in good faith with other access facilities to reach a judicial or non-judicial resolution to open issues. In no case does Eni prohibit potential claimants access to remediation measures. The company is committed to preventing reprisals against workers and other stakeholders for raising human rights concerns. It does not  tolerate  or  contribute  to  threats,  intimidation,  reprisals  or attacks against human rights defenders and stakeholders involved\n\nwith its operations.\n\nAn  integral  part  of  due  diligence  is  the  communication  of  the obtained results.

The material topics are  instrumental  for  defining  the  Strategic  Plan  -  the  origin of  the  formulation  of  the  sustainability  Managerial  Objectives (MBO  -  Management  by  Objectives)  for  all  managers  -  and directing  reporting.  The  materiality  analysis,  updated  in  2023, led  to  identifying  relevant  topics  from  the  impact  relevance perspective, as required by the GRI Standards. This perspective considers material topics related to the most significant impacts (positive and negative, actual and potential) of the organisation on the economy, environment and people, including impacts on human rights.

The  Consolidated Disclosure of Non-Financial Information was prepared in accordance with  Legislative  Decree  254/2016,  which  transposes  the  European Directive on Non-Financial Information, and the 'Sustainability Reporting Standards' published by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards). As  at  31  December  2023,  it  was  subject  to  limited  audit  by  the independent auditors of the consolidated financial statements. All GRI indicators in the Content Index refer to the version of the GRI Standards published in 2016, except those of: (i) 'Standard 403: Occupational Health  and  Safety',  (ii)  'Standard  303:  Water  and  Effluents'  -  which refer to the 2018 edition - (iii) 'Standard 207: Taxes' from 2019 and (iv) 'Standard 306: Waste' in 2020. In addition, consideration was given to the GRI Sector Standard on Oil & Gas, published in 2021 and mandatory since last year. In addition, the WEF 'core' metrics defined in the White Paper 'Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism - Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation' were taken into account, and the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) recommendations on non-financial reporting both within the NFI and in the Management Report were implemented. The Declaration includes the  information  required  by  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EU)  2020/852 of June, 18 2020 (the 'Taxonomy Regulation') and the associated Delegated  Regulations  (EU)  2021/2178  and  (EU)  2021/2139.  The limited audit carried out by the independent auditors (PwC SpA) on the NFI does not extend to the information provided under the Taxonomy Regulation contained in the dedicated section (pp. 186-209).\n\nPerformance indicators . (KPIs) are selected based on the topics identified as most significant downstream of the materiality analysis. They are collected annually according to the consolidation boundary of the reference year and refer to the 2021-2023 period. In general, trends in data and performance indicators are also calculated using decimal places not shown in the document. The data for the year 2023 are the best possible estimate with the data available at the time of preparation of this report. The data are also subject to review and approval by the relevant bodies and the Board of Directors. In addition, some data published in previous years may be subject to  restatement  in  this  edition  for  one  of  the  following  reasons: refinement/change in estimation or calculation methods, significant changes  in  the  consolidation  boundary,  significant  updated information  becoming  available,  or  any  calculation  or  boundary errors. If a restatement is made, the reasons for it are appropriately disclosed in the text. Most of the KPIs present are collected and aggregated  automatically  through  the  use  of  specific  company software based on the topic area. This data is sent to a platform dedicated to tracking and logging all the data published by Eni in the NFI. This system also allows tracking the control and approval of each piece of data by its relative process owners.\n\nBoundary .

Differently from Scope 3 end-use emissions, which Eni reports based on upstream production, the Net GHG  Lifecycle Emissions indicator considers a much wider perimeter, including Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 emissions referred  to the whole value chain of energy products sold by Eni, thus including Scope 3 end-use emissions associated to gas  purchased by third parties and petroleum products sold by Eni.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| emissions               | The indicator is calculated per international and industry standards (GHG Protocol and IPIECA) and includes all group  Scope 1+2 emissions and Scope 3 emissions from the use of products sold (cat. 11) calculated as an equity share of  upstream production. This indicator differs from Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions, which, instead, considers all Scope 1+2+3  emissions of energy products sold by Eni according to a lifecycle approach and is applied to an extended boundary that  also includes products generated by third parties (e.g. natural gas produced by third parties and sold by Eni).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Net Carbon  Intensity   | The indicator is calculated as the ratio of Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions to the energy content of energy products sold  by Eni, accounted for on an equity basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT",

Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements: those employees whose employment relationship is  governed by collective contracts or agreements, whether national, category, company or site. This is the only KPI  dedicated to people considering role-based employees (a company with which the employee enters the employment  contract). All others, including indicators on training, are calculated according to the utilisation method (company  where the work is actually done). It should be noted that, using this second method, the two aspects (role companies  and service) may coincide. |\n| Remuneration                          | Gender  Pay  Ratio :  the  Gender  Pay  Ratio  is  calculated  as  the  ratio  of  the  female  population's  average  remuneration to the male population's average remuneration for the individual professional category and the  overall population.

Risk can be caused by the processing performed or by the environment in which the processing takes place. The risk may be caused by the processing carried out, or by the environment in which the processing takes place. The main risk agents whose prolonged exposure may lead to an occupational disease are: (i) chemical agents (example of disease: neoplasms, respiratory system diseases, blood diseases); (ii) biological agents (example of disease: malaria); (iii) physical agents (example of disease: hearing loss).\n\nNumber of sites overlapping with protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) : operational sites in Italy and abroad, which are located within (or partially within) the boundaries of one or more protected areas or KBAs (December of each reference year).\n\nNumber of sites adjacent to protected areas or Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) : operational sites in Italy and abroad which, although outside the boundaries of protected areas or KBA, are less than 1 km away (December of each reference year).\n\nNumber  of  upstream  concessions  overlapping  protected  areas  and  Key  Biodiversity  Areas  (KBAs)  with activities in the overlapping area : active national and international concessions, operated, under development or in production, present in the Company's databases in June of each reference year that overlap one or more protected areas or KBAs, where development/production operations (wells, sealines, pipelines and onshore and offshore installations as documented in the Company's GIS geodatabase) are located within the intersection area. Number of upstream concessions overlapping protected areas or Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), without activities in the overlapping area: active national and international concessions, operated, under development or in production, present in the Company's databases in June of each reference year that overlap one or more protected areas or KBAs, where development/production operations (wells, sealines, pipelines and onshore and offshore installations as documented in the Company's GIS geodatabase) are located outside the intersection area.\n\nThe sources used for the census of protected areas and KBAs are the 'World Database on Protected Areas' and the 'World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas' respectively; the data was made available to Eni in the framework of its membership in the UNEP-WCMC Proteus Partnership (UN Environment Programme - World Conservation Monitoring Center). There are some limitations to consider when interpreting the results of this analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 it is globally recognized that there is an overlap between the different databases of protected areas and KBAs, which may have led to a certain degree of duplication in the analysis (some protected areas/KBAs could be counted several times);\n- \u00b7 the databases of protected or key biodiversity areas used for the analysis, while representing the most up-to date information available at global level, may not be complete for each Country.\n\nSignificant impact of activities, products and services on biodiversity : potential impact may vary depending on the complexity of each project, the value of the natural environment and the social context of the activities. Among the most significant impacts for all types of Eni assets are those related to land (or sea) use change due to the physical presence of plants and infrastructure, which may result in the removal, degradation or fragmentation of habitats with consequences for species. Possible impact of activities in the upstream, refining and petrochemical sectors include the degradation of habitats and loss of biodiversity due to: pressure on fresh water availability; degradation of water, air and soil quality; contamination and pollution due to accidental events (e.g. spills and leakage); climatealtering emissions that contribute to climate change with direct and indirect effects on nature (e.g. anticipation of plant flowering and changes to the reproductive period of some animal species, migration of biomes at different latitudes and altitudes, and coral bleaching). For activities related to renewables, in addition to impact due to the occupation of land and sea, potential impact on birds and bats due to the presence of turbines and distribution lines are mentioned. Wind turbines pose a potential risk to particularly vulnerable species groups such as birds of prey.\n\nSpecies listed on the IUCN Red List and national lists that find their habitat in the organisation's areas of  operation : the data source is the IUCN Red List Spatial Data database, which contains global assessments of species by taxonomic groups. The spatial data of species distribution are downloaded in ESRI shapefile format in their latest update from the database and uploaded to Eni's ArcGIS systems. The total number of species with habitats inside the organisation's areas of operation is verified. The species are classified according to their level of extinction risk: critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, near threatened, or least concern. 'Data Deficient' species lack data for which it is impossible to assign a risk category.\n\nIn interpreting the data, it is essential to note that the analysis is subject to the inherent limitations associated with global species mapping and is sensitive to periodic database updates, as more species are mapped yearly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT",

TAF (groundwater treatment plant) water represents the amount of polluted groundwater treated and reused in the production cycle.\n\nWater discharge : the internal procedures relating to the operational management of water discharges regulate the control of the minimum quality standards and the authorization limits prescribed for each operational site, ensuring that they are respected and promptly terminated if they are exceeded.\n\nSea water : water with a total dissolved solids content (TDS) greater than or equal to 30,000 mg.\n\nBrackish water : water with a total dissolved solids content (TDS) between 2,000 mg/l and 30,000 mg/l.\n\nFreshwater : water with a maximum total dissolved solids (TDS) content of 2,000 mg/l. Per the IPIECA/API/ IOGP 2020 guide, this limit for freshwater is more conservative than the GRI reference standard (equal to 1,000 mg/l).\n\nSpills from primary or secondary containment into the environment of oil or petroleum derivative from refining or oil waste occurring during operation or as a result of sabotage, theft or vandalism. For sabotage oil spills, the timing of the closure of some investigations and the subsequent recording of the data may be extended due to the duration of the investigation.\n\nWaste from production : waste from production activities, including waste from drilling activities and construction sites.\n\nWaste from remediation activities : this includes waste from soil securing and remediation activities, demolition and groundwater classified as waste.\n\nThe waste disposal method is communicated to Eni by the third party authorised for disposal.\n\nPossible negative impacts related to waste : loss of resources, possible contamination of environmental matrices due to possible unapproved management, impacts related to transport and treatment at the destination plants, land consumption related to plants for waste, and legal and reputational consequences related to any objections. The treatment of waste at off-site third-party facilities results from the unavailability of suitable facilities at the site and/or the legal requirements to carry it out; by way of example, within the EU, the waste treatment operations are subject to possessing suitable permits. The weight of generated and delivered waste can be measured or estimated, as the case may be. The difference between waste generated and waste sent for recovery/disposal may arise from both a variation in the quantities in storage and from the fact that the weight of waste generated is often estimated, whereas the weight of waste delivered is more frequently measured at the site's exit or the destination facility.\n\nRecycled/recovered waste is understood to be waste diverted from disposal.\n\nNO x : total direct emissions of nitrogen oxides from combustion processes with air. It includes NO x emissions from flaring activities, sulphur recovery processes, FCC regeneration, etc., including NO and NO 2 emissions, and excluding N 2 O.\n\nSO x : total direct emissions of sulphur oxides, including SO 2 and SO 3\n\n.\n\nNMVOC : total direct emissions of hydrocarbons, hydrocarbon substitutes and oxygenated hydrocarbons that evaporate at ambient temperature.

Those relating to the exploration and business development phase are described below:\n\nNegative impacts related to exploration activities include : socio-economic displacement, negative impacts on fishing, agriculture and tourism, potential damage to buildings and historical heritage, potential violations of subcontractor labour standards, inadequate compensation for the impact, and impact on the human rights of affected populations.\n\nNegative  impacts  related  to  business  development  activities  include : socio-economic  displacement, resettlement, negative impacts on fishing, agriculture and tourism, increased cost of living and services in the areas around the plant, delayed implementation of development projects, distortion of the local market due to remuneration and a general increase in the cost of living, social effects of environmental impacts such as noise, related traffic and landscape modification, impact on the customs and traditions of local populations, lack of involvement of minorities and indigenous people in the approval process, impact on the human rights of affected populations, induction of migration flows caused by business activities, impact on community health, changes in community lifestyles, potential increase in crime, increased pressure on services to the population, changes in the local social-productive structure and potential impact on some essential services or the production of basic goods, and changes to the traditional real estate system. Reduced access to natural resources by communities.\n\nThe indicator refers to Eni's share of spending in local development initiatives carried out by Eni in favour of local communities. The indicator refers to the 2023 share of expenses to local suppliers. 'Spending to local suppliers' has been defined according to the following alternative methods based on the specific characteristics of the Countries analysed in terms of local regulations and local approaches used in the management of local content: (i) 'Equity Method' (Ghana): the share of expenditure towards local suppliers is determined based on the per cent ownership of the corporate structure (e.g. for a joint venture with a 60% local component, 60% of the total expenditure towards the joint venture is considered as expenditure towards the local supplier); (ii) 'Local Currency Method' (Kazakhstan, Marocco and Albania): the share paid in local currency is identified as expenditure towards local suppliers; (iii) 'Method of registration in the Country + local currency' (Algeria, Belgium, Cyprus, Ivory Coast, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Libya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Oman, Spain, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, UK, Hungary, the USA, Venezuela, and Vietnam): expenditure towards registered in the Country and not belonging to international groups/mega suppliers (e.g. suppliers of auxiliary drilling services) is identified as local.\n\n(iv) 'Method of registration in the Country + local currency' (Congo, Mexico and Australia): expenditure towards suppliers registered in the Country and not belonging to international groups/mega suppliers (e.g. suppliers of drilling services) is identified as local. For the latter, spending in local currency is considered to be local. The Countries selected are those most representative for Eni business from a strategic point of view and in which a relevant procurement plan for the four-year period 2022-2025 has been recorded compared to the total spent by the Eni Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT",

Below is a selection of the most frequently used terms.\n\n2nd  and  3rd  generation  feedstock Are  feedstocks  not  in competition with the food supply chain as the first generation feedstock  (vegetable  oils).  Second  generation  are  mostly agricultural nonfood and agro/urban waste (such as animal fats, used cooking oils and agricultural waste) and the third generation feedstocks  are  non-agricultural  high  innovation  feedstocks (deriving from algae or waste).\n\nAverage reserve life index Ratio between the amount of reserves at the end of the year and total production for the year.\n\nBarrel/bbl Volume unit corresponding to 159 liters. A barrel of oil corresponds to about 0.137 metric tonnes.\n\nBoe (Barrel of Oil Equivalent) Is used as a standard unit measure for oil and natural gas. Effective January 1 st , 2023, Eni has updated the conversion rate of gas produced to 5,232 cubic feet of gas equals 1 barrel of oil.\n\nCompounding Activity  specialized  in  production  of  semi-finished products in granular form resulting from the combination of two or more chemical products.\n\nConversion Refinery process allowing the transformation of heavy fractions into lighter fractions. Conversion processes are cracking, visbreaking,  coking,  the  gasification  of  refinery  residues,  etc.  The ration  of  overall  treatment  capacity  of  these  plants  and  that  of primary crude fractioning plants is the conversion rate of a refinery. Flexible refineries have higher rates and higher profitability.\n\nElastomers (or Rubber) Polymers, either natural or synthetic, which, unlike plastic, when stress is applied, return, to a certain degree, to their original shape, once the stress ceases to be applied. The main synthetic  elastomers  are  polybutadiene  (BR),  styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), ethylenepropylene rubber (EPR), thermoplastic rubber (TPR) and nitrylic rubber (NBR).\n\nEmissions  of  NO x (Nitrogen  Oxides) Total  direct  emissions  of nitrogen  oxides  deriving  from  combustion  processes  in  air.  The include  NO x emissions  from  flaring  activities,  sulphur  recovery processes,  FCC  regeneration,  etc.  They  include  NO  and  NO 2 emissions and exclude N 2 O emissions.\n\nEmissions  of  SO x (Sulphur  Oxides) Total  direct  emissions  of sulfur oxides including SO 2 and SO 3 emissions. Main sources are combustion plants, diesel engines (including maritime engines), gas flaring  (if  the  gas  contains  H 2 S), sulphur recovery processes, FCC regeneration, etc.\n\nEnhanced recovery Techniques used to increase or stretch over time the production of wells.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nANNEX\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nEni  carbon  efficiency  index Ratio  between  GHG  emissions (Scope  1  and  Scope  2  in  tonnes  CO 2 eq.)  of  the  main  industrial activities  operated  by  Eni  divided  by  the  productions  (converted by homogeneity into barrels of oil equivalent using Eni's average conversion factors) of the single businesses of reference.\n\nGreenhouse Gases (GHG) Gases in the atmosphere, transparent to solar radiation, that trap infrared radiation emitted by the earth's surface. The greenhouse gases relevant within Eni's activities are carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). GHG emissions  are  commonly  reported  in  CO2  equivalent  (CO 2 eq.) according to Global Warming Potential values in line with IPCC AR4, 4th Assessment Report.\n\nInfilling wells Infilling  wells  are  wells drilled in a producing area in order to improve the recovery of hydrocarbons from the field and to maintain and/or increase production levels.\n\nLNG Liquefied Natural Gas obtained through the cooling of natural gas to minus 160\u00b0C at normal pressure. The gas is liquefied to allow transportation from the place of extraction to the sites at which it is transformed and consumed. One ton of LNG corresponds to 1,400 cubic meters of gas.\n\nLPG Liquefied  Petroleum  Gas,  a  mix  of  light  petroleum  fractions, gaseous at normal pressure and easily liquefied at room temperature through limited compression.\n\nMineral Potential (potentially recoverable hydrocarbon volumes) Estimated  recoverable  volumes  which  cannot  be  defined  as reserves due to a number of reasons, such as the temporary lack of  viable  markets,  a  possible  commercial  recovery  dependent on the development of new technologies, or for their location in accumulations yet to be developed or where evaluation of known accumulations is still at an early stage.\n\nMoulding Activity of moulding of expanded polyolefins for production of ultra-light products.\n\nNatural gas liquids Liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons recovered from natural gas through separation equipment or natural gas treatment plants.  Propane,  normal-butane  and  isobutane,  isopentane  and pentane plus, that used to be defined natural gasoline, are natural gas liquids.\n\nNet Carbon Footprint Overall Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions associated with Eni's operations, accounted for on an equity basis, net of carbon offsets mainly from Natural Climate Solutions.\n\nNet Carbon Intensity Ratio between the Net GHG lifecycle emissions and the energy products sold, accounted for on an equity basis.\n\nNet  GHG  Lifecycle  Emissions GHG  Scope  1+2+3  emissions associated with the value chain of the energy products sold by Eni, including both those deriving from own productions and those\n\n227",

Amounts different from the agreed ones determine temporary over/ underlifting situations.\n\nPlasmix The collective name for the different plastics that currently have no use in the market of recycling and can be used as a feedstock in the new circular economy businesses of Eni.\n\nProduction Sharing Agreement (PSA) Contract in use in African, Middle Eastern, Far Eastern and Latin American Countries, among others, regulating relationships between states and oil companies with  regard  to  the  exploration  and  production  of  hydrocarbons. The mineral right is awarded to the national oil company jointly with the foreign oil company that has an exclusive right to perform exploration, development and production activities and can enter into agreements with other local or international entities. In this type of contract, the national oil company assigns to the international contractor the task of performing exploration and production with the contractor's equipment and financial resources. Exploration risks are borne by the contractor and production is divided into two portions: 'cost oil' is used to recover costs borne by the contractor and 'profit oil' is divided between the contractor and the national company according  to  variable  schemes  and  represents  the  profit  deriving from exploration and production. Further terms and conditions of these contracts may vary from Country to Country.\n\nProved reserves Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.\n\nRenewable  Installed  Capacity Is  measured  as  the  maximun generating capacity of Eni's share of power plants that use renewable\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nenergy sources (wind, solar and wave, and any other non-fossil fuel source  of  generation  deriving  from  natural  resources,  excluding, from the avoidance of doubt, nuclear energy) to produce electricity. The capacity is considered 'installed' once the power plants are in operation or the mechanical completion phase has been reached. The mechanical completion represents the final construction stage excluding the grid connection.\n\nReserves Quantities  of  oil  and  gas  and  related  substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application  of  development  projects  to  known  accumulations. In  addition,  there  must  exist,  or  there  must  be  a  reasonable expectation that will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or  related  substances  to  market,  and  all  permits  and  financing required to implement the project. Reserves can be: (i) developed reserves  quantities  of  oil  and  gas  anticipated  to  be  through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate; (ii) undeveloped reserves: oil and gas expected to be recovered from new wells, facilities and operating methods.\n\nScope  1  GHG  Emissions Direct greenhouse gas emissions from company's operations, produced from sources that are owned or controlled by the company.\n\nScope 2 GHG Emissions Indirect greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the generation of electricity, steam and heat purchased from third parties.\n\nScope 3 GHG Emissions Indirect GHG emissions associated with the value chain of Eni's products.\n\nShip-or-pay Clause included in natural gas transportation contracts according to which the customer for which the transportation is carried out is bound to pay for the transportation of the gas also in case the gas is not transported.\n\nTake-or-pay Clause  included  in  natural  gas  purchase  contracts according to which the purchaser is bound to pay the contractual price or a fraction of such price for a minimum quantity of the gas set in the contract also in case it is not collected by the customer. The customer has the option of collecting the gas paid and not delivered at a price equal to the residual fraction of the price set in the contract in subsequent contract years.\n\nUN SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. Adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, they address the global challenges the world is facing, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice.

The  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  have  been prepared under the historical cost convention, taking into account, where appropriate, value adjustments, except for certain items that under IFRSs must be measured at fair value as described in the accounting policies that follow. The principles of consolidation and the significant accounting policies that follow have been consistently\n\napplied to all years presented, except where otherwise indicated. The 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements, approved by the Eni's Board of Directors on March 13, 2024, were audited by the external auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers SpA; with reference to the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the external auditor of Eni SpA, as the main external auditor, is wholly in charge of the auditing activities of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nConsolidated  companies'  financial  statements,  as  well  as  their reporting packages prepared for use by the Group in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, are audited by external auditors; when  there  are  other  external  auditors,  PricewaterhouseCoopers SpA takes the responsibility of their work.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euro and all values are rounded to the nearest million euro (\u20ac million), except where otherwise indicated.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  recognised  in  the financial  statements,  as  well  as  amounts  included  in  the  notes thereto, including disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities.  Estimates  made  are  based  on  complex  judgments and  past  experience  of  other  assumptions  deemed  reasonable in  consideration  of  the  information  available  at  the  time.  The accounting  policies  and  areas  that  require  the  most  significant\n\njudgments  and  estimates  to  be  used  in  the  preparation  of  the Consolidated Financial Statements are in relation to the accounting for oil and natural gas activities, specifically in the determination of  reserves,  impairment  of  financial  and  non-financial  assets, leases, decommissioning and restoration liabilities, environmental liabilities,  business  combinations,  employee  benefits,  revenue from  contracts  with  customers,  fair  value  measurements  and income  taxes.  Although  the  Company  uses  its  best  estimates and  judgments,  actual  results  could  differ  from  the  estimates and assumptions used. The accounting estimates and judgments relevant for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statement are illustrated in the description of the respective accounting policy.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS MADE IN ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS\n\nSignificant  accounting  estimates  and  judgments  made  by management  for  the  preparation  of  the  2023  Consolidated Financial Statements are affected by the effects of actions to address climate change and by the potential impact of the energy transition. In particular, the global pressure towards a low carbon economy, increasingly restrictive regulatory requirements for Oil & Gas activities and hydrocarbons consumption, carbon pricing schemes,  the  technological  evolution  of  alternative  energy sources  for  transportation,  as  well  as  changes  in  consumer preferences could imply a structural decline of the demand for hydrocarbons in the medium/long-term, an increase in operating costs and a higher risk of stranded assets for Eni.\n\nThe  Eni  strategy  towards  Carbon  Neutrality,  in  line  with  the provisions of the scenarios compatible with maintaining global warming within the 1.5\u00b0C threshold; is composed of a series of  actions  and  initiatives  aimed  to  achieve  carbon  neutrality by  2050,  through  the  Net  Zero  emissions  for  all  Scope  1,  2, and 3 GHG emissions associated with Eni's product portfolio. Scenarios adopted by management take into account policies, regulatory requirements and current and expected developments in  technology  and  set  out  a  development  path  of  the  future energy system, on the basis of an economic and demographic framework,  analysis  of  existing  and  announced  policies  and technologies,  identifying  those  which  can  reasonably  reach maturity within the considered time horizon. Price variables reflect the best estimate by management of the fundamentals of several",

Such  scenarios  represent  the  basis  for  significant  estimates and judgments relating to: (i) the assessment of the intention to  continue  exploration  projects;  (ii)  the  assessment  of  the recoverability of non-current assets and credit exposures towards National  Oil  Companies;  (iii)  the  definition  of  useful  lives  and residual values of fixed assets; (iv) impacts on provisions (e.g. the anticipation of the expected timing of decommissioning and restoration costs).\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements  of  the  parent  Company  Eni  SpA  and  those  of  its subsidiaries, being those entities over which the Company has control, either directly or indirectly, through exposure or rights to their variable returns and the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investees.\n\nSubsidiaries  are  consolidated,  on  the  basis  of  consistent accounting policies, from the date on which control is obtained until the date that control ceases.\n\nAssets, liabilities, income  and  expenses  of  consolidated subsidiaries  are  fully  recognised  with  those  of  the  parent  in the Consolidated Financial Statements, taking into account the appropriate  eliminations  of  intragroup  transactions  (see  the accounting  policy  for  'Intragroup  transactions');  the  parent's investment  in  each  subsidiary  is  eliminated  against  the corresponding parent's portion of equity of each subsidiary.\n\nNon-controlling interests are presented separately on the balance sheet within equity; the profit or loss and comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling interests are presented in specific line items, respectively, in the profit and loss account and in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nTaking  into  account  the  lack  of  any  material 3 impact  on  the representation  of  the  financial  position  and  performance  of the Group 4 , the Consolidated Financial Statements do not fully consolidate:  (i)  some  subsidiaries  that  are  immaterial,  both individually and in the aggregate, and (ii) subsidiaries acting as sole-operator in the management of oil and gas contracts on behalf of companies participating in a joint project. In the latter case, the activities are financed proportionally based on a budget approved  by  the  participating  companies  upon  presentation of  periodical  reports  of  proceeds  and  expenses.  Costs  and\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nrevenue and other operating data (production, reserves, etc.) of the project, as well as the related obligations arising from the project, are recognised directly in the financial statements of the companies involved based on their own share.\n\nWhen the proportion of the equity held by non-controlling interests changes, any difference between the consideration paid/received and the amount by which the related non-controlling interests are adjusted is attributed to Eni owners' equity (within the line item 'Retained earnings').\n\nConversely,  the  sale  of  equity  interests  with  loss  of  control determines the recognition in the profit and loss account of: (i) any gain or loss calculated as the difference between the consideration received and the corresponding transferred net assets; (ii) any gain or loss recognised as a result of the remeasurement of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value; (iii) the  estimate  of  fair  value  of  any  contingent  consideration,  to be settled in cash if specified future events occur or conditions are met; and (iv) any amount related to the former subsidiary previously recognised in other comprehensive income which may be reclassified subsequently to the profit and loss account 5 . Any investment retained in the former subsidiary is recognised at its fair value at the date when control is lost and shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable measurement criteria.\n\n## Interests in joint arrangements\n\nJoint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method as described in the accounting policy for 'The equity method of accounting'. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have enforceable rights to the assets, and enforceable obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement; in the Consolidated Financial Statements, Eni recognises its share of the assets/liabilities and revenues/expenses of joint operations on the basis of its rights and obligations relating to the arrangements. After  the  initial  recognition,  the  assets/liabilitIes  and  revenues/ expenses of the joint operations are measured in accordance with the applicable measurement criteria. Immaterial joint operations structured through a separate vehicle are accounted for using the equity method or, if this does not result in a misrepresentation of the  Company's  financial  position  and  performance,  at  cost  less any impairment losses. Investments in joint ventures previously\n\n(3) According to IFRSs, information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general-purpose\n\nfinancial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.\n\n(4) Unconsolidated subsidiaries are accounted for as described in the accounting policy for 'The equity method of accounting'; for further information, see the annex 'List of companies\n\nowned by Eni SpA as of December 31, 2023'.\n\n(5) Conversely, any amount related to the former subsidiary previously recognised in other comprehensive income, which may not be reclassified subsequently to the profit and loss\n\naccount, are reclassified in another item of equity.",

This annex includes also the changes in the scope of consolidation.\n\n## The equity method of accounting\n\nInvestments in joint ventures, associates and immaterial unconsolidated  subsidiaries,  are  accounted  for  using  the  equity method 6 .\n\nUnder the equity method, investments are initially recognised at cost 7 , allocating it, similarly to business combinations procedures, to the investee's identifiable assets/liabilities; any excess of the cost of the investment over the share of the net fair value of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted for as goodwill, not separately recognised but included in the carrying amount of the investment. If this allocation is provisionally recognised at initial recognition, it can be retrospectively adjusted within one year from the  acquisition  date,  to  reflect  new  information  obtained  about facts  and  circumstances  that  existed  at  the  acquisition  date. Subsequently, with the aim of reflecting the Group's share of the investee's net assets and the related changes, the carrying amount is adjusted to reflect: (i) the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortization and any impairment losses of the equityaccounted entity's assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition; and (ii) the investor's share of the investee's other comprehensive  income.  Distributions  received  from  an  equityaccounted investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn  applying  the  equity  method,  consolidation  adjustments  are considered  (see  also  the  accounting  policy  for  'Subsidiaries'). Losses arising from the application of the equity method in excess of the carrying amount of the investment, recognised in the profit and  loss  account  within  'Income  (Expense)  from  investments', reduce  the  carrying  amount,  net  of  the  related  expected  credit losses  (see  below),  of  any  financing  receivables  towards  the investee for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future (the so-called long-term interests), which are, in substance, an extension of the investment in the investee. The investor's share of any losses of an equity-accounted investee that exceeds the carrying amount of the investment and any longterm interests (the so-called net investment), is recognised in a specific provision only to the extent that the investor has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.\n\nWhenever there is objective evidence of impairment (e.g. relevant breaches of contracts, significant financial difficulty, probable default of the counterparty, etc.), the carrying amount of the net investment, resulting from the application of the abovementioned measurement criteria, is tested for impairment by comparing it with the related recoverable amount, determined by adopting the criteria indicated in the accounting policy for 'Impairment of non-financial assets'. When an impairment loss no longer exists or has decreased, any reversal of the impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account within  'Income  (Expense)  from  investments'.  The  impairment reversal  of  the  net  investment  shall  not  exceed  the  previously recognised impairment losses.\n\nThe sale of equity interests with loss of joint control or significant influence over the investee determines the recognition in the profit and loss account of: (i) any gain or loss calculated as the difference between  the  consideration  received  and  the  corresponding transferred share; (ii) any gain or loss recognised as a result of the remeasurement of any investment retained in the former joint venture/associate at its fair value 8 ; and (iii) any amount related to the former joint venture/associate previously recognised in other comprehensive  income  which  may  be  reclassified  subsequently to  the  profit  and  loss  account 9 . Any investment retained in the former joint venture/associate is recognised at its fair value at the date when joint control or significant influence is lost and shall be accounted  for  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  measurement criteria.\n\n- (9) Conversely, any amount related to the former joint venture/associate previously recognised in other comprehensive income, which may not be reclassified subsequently to the profit and loss account, are reclassified in another item of equity.",

The consideration transferred in a business combination is the sum of the acquisition-date fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer. The consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any assets or liabilities resulting from contingent considerations, contractually agreed and dependent upon the occurrence of specified future events. Acquisition related costs are accounted for as expenses.\n\nThe  acquirer  shall  measure  the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and liabilities assumed  at  their  acquisition-date  fair  values 10 , unless another measurement basis is required by IFRSs. The excess of the consideration transferred over the Group's share of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised, on the balance sheet, as goodwill; conversely, a gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nAny non-controlling interests are measured as the proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets at the acquisition date excluding the portion of goodwill attributable to them (partial goodwill method). In a business combination achieved in stages, the purchase price is determined by summing the acquisitiondate fair value of previously held equity interests in the acquiree and the consideration transferred for obtaining control; the previously held equity interests are remeasured at their acquisition-date fair value and the  resulting  gain  or  loss,  if  any,  is  recognized  in  the  profit  and  loss account. Furthermore, on obtaining control, any amount recognised in other comprehensive income related to the previously held equity interests is reclassified to the profit and loss account, or in another item of equity when such amount may not be reclassified to the profit and loss account.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the provisional amounts recognised at the acquisition date shall be retrospectively adjusted within one year from the acquisition date, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.\n\nThe  acquisition  of  interests  in  a  joint  operation  whose  activity constitutes a business is accounted for applying the principles on business combinations accounting. In this regard, if the entity obtains control over a business that was a joint operation, the previously held interest in the joint operation is remeasured at the acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account 11 .\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS: INVESTMENTS AND BUSINESS\n\nThe assessment of the existence of control, joint control, significant influence  over  an  investee,  as  well  as  for  joint  operations,  the assessment of the existence of enforceable rights to the investee's assets and enforceable obligations for the investee's liabilities imply that management makes complex judgments on the basis of the characteristics  of  the  investee's  structure,  arrangements  between parties  and  other  relevant  facts  and  circumstances.  Significant accounting estimates by management are required also for measuring the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination at their acquisition-date fair values. For such measurement, to be performed also for the application of the equity method, Eni adopts the valuation techniques generally used by market participants taking into account the available information; for the most significant acquisitions, Eni engages external independent evaluators.\n\n## Intragroup transactions\n\nAll balances and transactions between consolidated companies, and not yet realised with third parties, including unrealised profits arising from such transactions, have been eliminated 12 .\n\nUnrealised  profits  arising  from  transactions  between  the  Group and its equity-accounted entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the equity-accounted entity; such accounting treatment  is  applied  also  for  transfer  of  businesses  to  equityaccounted  entities  (the  so-called  downstream  transactions).  In both cases, unrealised losses are not eliminated as the transaction provides evidence of an impairment loss of the asset transferred.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe financial statements of foreign operations having a functional currency other than the euro, that represents the parent's functional currency as well as the presentation currency of the Consolidated Financial  Statements,  are  translated  into  euros  using  the  spot exchange rates on the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities, historical exchange rates for equity and average exchange rates for the profit and loss account and the statement of cash flows.\n\nThe cumulative resulting exchange differences are presented in the separate  component  of  Eni  owners'  equity  'Cumulative  currency translation differences' 13 . Cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to a foreign operation are reclassified to the profit and loss account when the entity disposes the entire interest in that foreign operation or when the partial disposal involves the loss of control,\n\n- (10) Fair value measurement principles are described in the accounting policy for 'Fair value measurements'.",

Unproved exploration rights are not amortised but reviewed to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. This review is based on the confirmation of the commitment of the Company to continue the exploration activities and on the analysis of facts and  circumstances  that  indicate  the  absence  of  uncertainties related to the recoverability of the carrying amount. If no future activity is planned, the carrying amount of the related exploration rights is recognised in the profit and loss account as write-off. Lower value exploration rights are pooled and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of exploration. In the event of a discovery of proved reserves (i.e. upon recognition of proved reserves and internal approval for development), the carrying  amount  of  the  related  unproved  exploration  rights  is reclassified  to  'proved  exploration  rights',  within  the  line  item\n\n'Intangible  assets'.  Upon  reclassification,  as  well  as  whether there  is  any  indication  of  impairment,  the  carrying  amount  of exploration rights to reclassify as proved is tested for impairment considering the higher of their value in use and their fair value less costs of disposal. From the commencement of production, proved  exploration  rights  are  amortised  according  to  the  unit of  production  method  (the  so-called  UOP  method,  described in  the  accounting  policy  for  'UOP  depreciation,  depletion  and amortisation').\n\n## Acquisition of mineral interests\n\nCosts  incurred  for  the  acquisition  of  mineral  interests  are capitalised  in  connection  with  the  assets  acquired  (such  as exploration potential, possible and probable reserves and proved reserves). When the acquisition is related to a set of exploration potential  and  reserves,  the  cost  is  allocated  to  the  different assets acquired based on their expected discounted cash flows. Acquired exploration potential is measured in accordance with the criteria illustrated in the accounting policy for 'Acquisition of exploration rights'. Costs associated with proved reserves are amortised  according  to  the  UOP  method  (see  the  accounting policy  for  'UOP  depreciation,  depletion  and  amortisation'). Expenditure  associated  with  possible  and  probable  reserves (unproved mineral interests) is not amortised until classified as proved reserves; in case of a negative result of the subsequent appraisal activities, it is written off.\n\n## Exploration and appraisal expenditure\n\nGeological and geophysical exploration costs are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs directly associated with an exploration well are initially recognised within tangible assets in progress, as",

If, at the end of this period, it is ascertained that the result is negative (no  hydrocarbon  found)  or  that  the  discovery  is  not  sufficiently significant to justify the development, the wells are declared dry/ unsuccessful  and  the  related  costs  are  written-off.  Conversely, these costs continue to be capitalised if and until: (i) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well, and (ii) the entity is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project; on the contrary, the capitalised costs are recognised in the profit and loss account as write-off. Analogous recognition criteria are adopted for the costs related to the appraisal activity. When proved reserves of oil and/or natural gas are determined, the  relevant  expenditure  recognised  as  unproved  is  reclassified to proved exploration and appraisal costs within tangible assets in progress. Upon reclassification, or when there is any indication of impairment, the carrying amount of the costs to reclassify as proved is tested for impairment considering the higher of their value  in  use  and  their  fair  value  less  costs  of  disposal.  From the  commencement  of  production,  proved  exploration  and appraisal  costs  are  depreciated  according  to  the  UOP  method (see the accounting policy for 'UOP depreciation, depletion and amortisation').\n\n## Development costs\n\nDevelopment costs, including the costs related to unsuccessful and  damaged  development  wells,  are  capitalised  as  'Tangible asset in progress - proved'. Development costs are incurred to obtain  access  to  proved  reserves  and  to  provide  facilities  for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and gas. They are amortised, from the commencement of production, generally on a UOP basis. When development projects are unfeasible/not carried on, the related costs are written off when it is decided to abandon the project. Development costs are tested for impairment in accordance with the criteria described in the accounting policy for 'Property, plant and equipment'.\n\n## UOP depreciation, depletion and amortisation\n\nProved oil and gas assets are depreciated generally under the UOP method, as their useful life is closely related to the availability of proved oil and gas reserves, by applying to the depreciable amounts  at  the  end  of  each  quarter  a  rate  representing  the ratio  between  the  volumes  extracted  during  the  quarter  and the reserves existing at the end of the quarter, increased by the volumes  extracted  during  the  quarter.  This  method  is  applied with reference to the smallest aggregate representing a direct\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\ncorrelation between expenditures to be depreciated and oil and gas reserves. Proved exploration rights and acquired proved mineral interests are amortised over proved reserves; proved exploration and  appraisal  costs  and  development  costs  are  depreciated over  proved  developed  reserves,  while  common  facilities  are depreciated  over  total  proved  reserves.  Proved  reserves  are determined according to US SEC rules that require the use of the yearly average oil and gas prices for assessing the economic producibility; material changes in reference prices could result in depreciation charges not reflecting the pattern in which the assets' future economic benefits are expected to be consumed to the extent that, for example, certain non-current assets would be fully depreciated within a short-term. In these cases, the reserves considered in determining the UOP rate are estimated on the basis of economic viability parameters, reasonable and consistent with management's expectations of production, in order to recognise depreciation charges that more appropriately reflect the expected utilization of the assets concerned.\n\n## Production costs\n\nProduction costs are those costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and field equipment and are recognised as an expense as incurred.\n\n## Production sharing agreements and service contracts\n\nOil and gas reserves related to Production Sharing Agreements are determined on the basis of contractual terms related to the recovery  of  the  contractor's  costs  to  undertake  and  finance exploration, development and production activities at its own risk (Cost Oil) and the Company's stipulated share of the production remaining after such cost recovery (Profit Oil). Revenues from the sale of the lifted production, against both Cost Oil and Profit Oil, are accounted for on an accrual basis, whilst exploration, development and production costs are accounted for according to the above-mentioned accounting policies. A similar scheme applies to service contracts where the Group is entitled to a share of the production as consideration for the rendered service.\n\nThe  Company's  share  of  production  volumes  and  reserves includes the share of hydrocarbons that corresponds to the taxes to be paid, according to the contractual agreement, by the national government on behalf of the Company. As a consequence, the Company has to recognise at the same time an increase in the taxable  profit,  through  the  increase  of  the  revenue,  and  a  tax expense.\n\n## Plugging and abandonment of wells\n\nCosts expected to be incurred with respect to the plugging and abandonment of a well, dismantlement and removal of production facilities, as well as site restoration, are capitalised, consistent",

Proved reserves are the estimated volumes of crude oil, natural gas and gas condensates, liquids and associated substances which geological and engineering data demonstrate that can be economically producible with reasonable certainty from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions and operating methods. Although there are authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering and geological criteria that must be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be categorised as 'proved', the accuracy of reserve estimates depends on a number of factors, assumptions and variables, including: (i) the quality of available geological, technical and economic data and their interpretation and judgment; (ii) projections regarding future rates of production and operating costs and development costs; (iii) changes in the prevailing tax rules, other government regulations and contractual conditions; (iv) results of drilling, testing and the actual  production  performance  of  Company's  reservoirs  after the date of the estimates which may drive substantial upward or downward revisions; and (v) changes in oil and natural gas commodity  prices  which  could  affect  expected  future  cash flows  and  the  quantities  of  Company's  proved  reserves  since the estimates of reserves are based on prices and costs existing as of the date when these estimates are made. Lower oil prices or the projections of higher operating and development costs may impair the ability of the Company to economically produce reserves leading to downward reserve revisions.\n\nMany  of  the  factors,  assumptions  and  variables  involved  in estimating proved reserves are subject to change over time and therefore affect the estimates of oil and natural gas reserves. Similar uncertainties concern unproved reserves.\n\nThe  determination  of  whether  potentially  economic  oil  and natural  gas  reserves  have  been  discovered  by  an  exploration well is made within a year after well completion. The evaluation process  of  a  discovery,  which  requires  performing  additional appraisal activities on the potential oil and natural gas field and establishing the optimum development plans, can take longer, in most cases, depending on the complexity of the project and on the size of capital expenditures required. During this period, the costs related to these exploration wells remain suspended on the balance sheet. In any case, all such capitalised costs are\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nreviewed, at least, on an annual basis to confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise to extract value from the discovery. Field reserves will be categorised as proved only when all the criteria for attribution of proved status have been met. Proved reserves can be classified as developed or undeveloped. Volumes are classified into proved developed reserves as a consequence of development activity. Generally, reserves are booked as proved developed at the start of production. Major development projects typically take one to four years from the time of initial booking to the start of production.\n\nEstimated proved reserves are used in determining depreciation, amortisation and depletion charges (see the accounting policy for 'UOP depreciation, depletion and amortisation'). Assuming all other variables are held constant, an increase in estimated proved developed reserves for each field decreases depreciation, amortisation  and  depletion  charge  under  the  UOP  method. Conversely, a decrease in estimated proved developed reserves increases depreciation, amortisation and depletion charge.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, including investment properties, are recognized using the cost model and initially stated at their purchase price or construction cost including any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary  for  it  to  be  capable  of  operating  in  the  manner intended  by  management 14 . For  assets  that  necessarily  take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, the purchase price or construction cost comprises the borrowing costs incurred in the period to get the asset ready for use that would have been avoided if the expenditure had not been made. In the case of a present obligation for dismantling and removal of assets and restoration of sites, the initial carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment includes the estimated (discounted) costs to be incurred when the removal event occurs; a corresponding amount is recognised as part of a specific provision (see the accounting policy for 'Decommissioning and restoration liabilities'). Analogous approach is adopted for present obligations to realise social projects in oil and gas development areas.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  not  revalued  for  financial reporting purposes.\n\nExpenditures  on  upgrading,  revamping  and  reconversion  are recognised as items of property, plant and equipment when it is probable that they will increase the expected future economic benefits of the asset. Assets acquired for safety or environmental reasons,  although  not  directly  increasing  the  future  economic\n\n(14) In some cases, the acquisition of an item of property, plant and equipment provides for an initial payment plus additional payments that are contingent on future events or outcomes (the so-called contingent consideration). In such cases, on the acquisition date an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised at an amount of consideration paid. Therefore, the variable payments contingent on future events are not included in the acquisition cost. The liability for contingent consideration is recognised, as a contra to the related asset, when it becomes due, i.e. when the uncertainty to which it relates is resolved.",

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a systematic basis over their useful life. The useful life is the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use by the Company. When tangible assets are composed of more than one significant part with different useful lives, each part is depreciated separately. The depreciable amount is the asset's carrying amount less its residual value at the end of its useful life, if it is significant and can be reasonably determined. Land  is  not  depreciated,  even  when  acquired  together  with  a building. Tangible assets held for sale are not depreciated (see the accounting policy for 'Assets held for sale and discontinued operations').  Changes  in  the  asset's  useful  life,  in  its  residual value or in the pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for prospectively. Assets to be handed over for no consideration are depreciated over the shorter term between the duration of the concession or\n\nthe asset's useful life.\n\nReplacement costs of identifiable parts in complex assets are capitalised  and  depreciated  over  their  useful  life;  the  residual carrying amount of the part that has been substituted is charged to the  profit  and  loss  account.  Non-removable  leasehold improvements  are  depreciated  over  the  earlier  of  the  useful life of the improvements and the lease term. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs, other than replacements of identifiable components, which reintegrate, and do not increase the performance of the assets, are recognised as an expense as incurred. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal; the arising gain or loss is recognized in the profit and loss account.\n\n## Leasing 15\n\nA contract is, or contains, a lease, if the contract conveys the right  to  control  the  use  of  an  identified  asset  for  a  period  of time in exchange for consideration 16 ; such right exists whether, throughout the period of use, the customer has both the right to\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nobtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset.\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date on which the underlying asset is available for use), a lessee recognises on the balance sheet an asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset (hereinafter also referred as right-of-use asset) and a liability representing its obligation to make lease payments  during  the  lease  term  (hereinafter  also  referred  as lease liability 17 ). The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a contract, together with, if reasonably certain, periods covered by  extension  options  or  by  the  non-exercise  of  termination options. In particular, the lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the following lease payments 18 that are not paid at the commencement date: (i) fixed payments (including insubstance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; (ii) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate 19 ; (iii) amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; (iv) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and (v) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. The latter is determined considering the term of the lease, the frequency and currency of the contractual lease payments, as well as the features of the lessee's economic environment (reflected in the country risk premium assigned to each country where Eni operates).\n\nAfter  the  initial  recognition,  the  lease  liability  is  measured  on an  amortised  cost  basis  and  is  remeasured,  normally,  as  an adjustment  to  the  carrying  amount  of  the  related  right-of-use asset, to reflect changes to the lease payments due, essentially, to: (i) modifications in the lease contract not accounted as a separate lease; (ii) changes in indexes or rates (used to determine the variable lease payments); or (iii) changes in the assessment of contractual options (e.g. options to purchase the underlying asset, extension or termination options).\n\nThe  right-of-use  asset  is  initially  measured  at  cost,  which comprises:  (i)  the  amount  of  the  initial  measurement  of  the lease liability; (ii) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee 20 ; (iii) any lease payments made at or before the commencement\n\n- (15) As expressly provided for in IFRS 16, this accounting policy does not apply to leases to explore for and extract resources such as those for oil and gas rights, leases of land and any rights of way related to oil and gas activities.\n\n- (17) Eni applies the recognition exemptions allowed for short-term leases (for certain classes of underlying assets) and low-value leases, by recognising the lease payments associated with those leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n- (18) Eni, in accordance with the practical expedient allowed by the accounting standard, does not separate non-lease components from lease components except for main contracts related to upstream activities (drilling rigs), which provide for single payments relating to both lease and non-lease components.\n- (19) Conversely, the other kinds of variable lease payments (e.g. payments that depend on the use of an underlying leased asset) are not included in the carrying amount of the lease liability, but are recognised in the profit and loss account as operating expenses over the lease term.\n- (20) Initial direct costs are incremental costs of obtaining a lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained.",

After the initial recognition, the right-of-use asset is adjusted for any accumulated depreciation 21 , any accumulated impairment losses (see the accounting policy for 'Impairment of non-financial assets') and any remeasurement of the lease liability.\n\nThe  depreciation  charges  of  the  right-of-use  asset  and  the interest expenses on the lease liability directly attributable to the construction of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset and subsequently recognised in the profit and loss account through depreciation/impairments or write-off, mainly in the case of exploration assets.\n\nIn the oil and gas activities, the operator of an unincorporated joint operation which enters into a lease contract as the sole signatory recognises on the balance sheet: (i) the entire lease liability  if,  based  on  the  contractual  provisions  and  any  other relevant facts and circumstances, it has primary responsibility for  the  liability  towards  the  third-party  supplier;  and  (ii)  the entire right-of-use asset, unless, on the basis of the terms and conditions of the contract, there is a sublease with the followers. The  followers'  share  of  the  right-of-use  asset,  recognised  by the operator, will be recovered according to the joint operation's contractual arrangements by billing the project costs attributable to  the  followers  and  collecting  the  related  cash  calls.  Costs recovered from the followers are recognised as 'Other income and revenues' in the profit and loss account and as net cash provided by operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Differently, if a lease contract is signed by all the partners, Eni recognises its share of the right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet based on its working interest.\n\nIf Eni does not have primary responsibility for the lease liability and, on the basis of the terms and conditions of the contract, there is not a sublease, it does not recognise any right-of-use asset and lease liability related to the lease contract.\n\nWhen  lease  contracts  are  entered  into  by  companies  other than subsidiaries that act as operators on behalf of the other participating  companies  (the  so-called  operating  companies), consistent  with  the  provision  to  recover  from  the  followers the costs related to the oil and gas activities, the participating companies recognise their share of the right-of-use assets and the lease liabilities based on their working interest, defined according to the expected use, to the extent that it is reliably determinable, of the underlying assets.\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS: LEASE TRANSACTIONS\n\nWith reference to lease contracts, management makes significant estimates and judgments related to: (i) determining the lease term, considering all facts and circumstances that generate an economic incentive,  or  not,  to  exercise  any  extension  and/or  termination options; (ii) determining the lessee's incremental borrowing rate; (iii) identifying  and,  where  appropriate,  separating  non-lease components from lease components, where an observable standalone price is not readily available, taking into account also the analysis performed with external experts; (iv) recognising lease contracts, for which the underlying assets are used in oil and gas activities (mainly drilling rigs and FPSOs), entered into as operator within an unincorporated joint operation, considering if the operator has primary responsibility for the liability towards the third-party supplier and the relationships with the followers; (v) identifying the variable lease payments and the related characteristics in order to include them in the measurement of the lease liability.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets without physical  substance,  controlled  by  the  Company  and  able  to produce  future  economic  benefits,  and  goodwill.  An  asset  is classified as intangible when management is able to distinguish it clearly from goodwill.\n\nIntangible assets are initially recognized at cost as determined by the criteria described in the accounting policy for 'Property, plant and equipment' and they are never revalued for financial reporting purposes.\n\nIntangible  assets  with  finite  useful  lives  are  amortised  on  a systematic basis over their useful life; the amortisation is carried out in accordance with the criteria described in the accounting policy for 'Property, plant and equipment'.\n\nGoodwill  and  intangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives  are not amortised. For the recoverability of the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets see the accounting policy for 'Impairment of non-financial assets'.\n\nCosts of obtaining a contract with a customer are recognised on the balance sheet if the Company expects to recover those costs. The  carrying  value  of  the  intangible  asset  arising  from  those costs is amortised on a systematic basis, that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates and is tested for impairment.\n\nCosts of technological development activities, including development  costs  related  to  CCS  Projects  (Carbon,  Capture\n\n(21) Depreciation charges are recognised on a systematic basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. Nevertheless, if the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term, or if the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the lessee will exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset.",

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is any indication of impairment, at the lowest level within the entity at which it  is  monitored  for  internal  management  purposes.  Right-of-use assets, which generally do not generate cash inflows independently of other assets or groups of assets, are allocated to the CGU to which they belong; the right-of-use assets which cannot be fully attributed to a CGU are considered as corporate assets. The recoverability of the carrying amount of common facilities within the E&P operating segment is assessed by considering the set of recoverable amounts of the CGUs benefiting from the common facility.\n\nThe recoverability of a CGU is assessed by comparing its carrying amount with the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the CGU's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from continuing use of the CGU and, if significant and reliably measurable, the cash flows expected to be obtained from its disposal at the end of its useful life, after deducting the costs of disposal. The expected cash flows are determined on the basis of reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's best estimate of the range of economic conditions that will exist over the\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nremaining useful life of the CGU, giving greater weight to external evidence. The value in use of CGUs which include material rightof-use assets is calculated, normally, by ignoring lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liabilities.\n\nWith  reference  to  commodity  prices,  management  uses  the  price scenario  adopted  for  economic  and  financial  projections  and  for  the evaluation of investments over their entire life. In particular, for the cash flows associated with oil, natural gas and petroleum products prices (and prices derived from them), the price scenario is approved by the Board of Directors (see 'Significant accounting estimates and judgments used to take into account the impacts of climate-related risks').\n\nFor impairment test purposes, cash outflows expected to be incurred to guarantee compliance with laws and regulations regarding CO 2 emissions (e.g. Emission Trading Scheme) or on a voluntary basis (e.g.  cash  outflows  related  to  forestry  certificates  acquired  or produced consistent with the Company's decarbonization strategy - hereinafter also forestry) are taken into account.\n\nIn particular, in estimating value in use, the cash outflows for forestry projects 22 are included, consistent with the targets of the decarbonization strategy, within the expected operating cash outflows; in this regard, considering that the forestry projects can be developed in countries where Eni does not carry out operating activities and given the difficulty to allocate such cash outflows, on a reasonable and consistent basis, to CGUs of the relevant operating  segment,  the  related  discounted  cash  outflows  are treated as a reduction of the headroom of the E&P operating segment.\n\nFor the determination of value in use, the estimated future cash flows  are  discounted  using  a  rate  that  reflects  a  current  market assessment of the time value of money and of the risks specific to the asset that are not reflected in the estimated future cash flows. In particular, the discount rate used is the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) adjusted for the specific country risk of the CGU. These adjustments are measured considering information from external parties. WACC differs considering the risk associated with each operating segment/business where the asset operates. In particular, for the assets belonging to the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio (GGP)  operating  segment,  the  Chemical  business,  the  Power business, E-Mobility, Retail Domestic and Renewable businesses, Fuel Sales, Biomethane and Green Refinery businesses, the AgriFeedstock  Business  and  Eni  Rewind  business,  the  riskiness  is determined on the basis of a sample of comparable companies. For  the  E&P  operating  segment  and  REVT  (Refining  Evolution and Transformation) business, the riskiness is determined, on a residual basis, as the difference between the risk of Eni as a whole and the risk of other operating segments/businesses. Value in use is calculated net of the tax effect as this method results in values similar to those resulting from discounting pre-tax cash flows at a",

The impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill; any remaining excess is allocated to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU, up to the related recoverable amount.\n\nWhen  an  impairment  loss  no  longer  exists  or  has  decreased,  a reversal of the impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.  The  impairment  reversal  shall  not  exceed  the  carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period 23 .\n\n## Grants related to assets\n\nGovernment grants related to assets are recognized by deducting them in calculating the carrying amount of the related assets when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the grants will be received.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, including compulsory stock, are measured at the lower of purchase or production cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less  the  estimated  costs  of  completion  and  the  estimated  costs necessary to make the sale, or, with reference to inventories of crude oil and petroleum products already included in binding sale contracts, the contractual selling price. Inventories which are principally acquired with the purpose of selling in the near future and generating a profit from fluctuations in price are measured at fair value less costs to sell and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in the profit and loss account. Materials and other supplies held for use in production are not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost.\n\nThe cost of inventories of hydrocarbons (crude oil, condensates and natural gas) and petroleum products is determined by applying the weighted average cost method on a three-month basis, or on a different  time  period  (e.g.  monthly),  when  it  is  justified  by  the  use and the turnover of inventories of crude oil and petroleum products; the cost of inventories of the Chemical business is determined by applying the weighted average cost on an annual basis.\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nWhen take-or-pay clauses are included in long-term gas purchase contracts,  pre-paid  gas  volumes  that  are  not  withdrawn  to  fulfill minimum annual take obligations are measured using the pricing formulas  contractually  defined.  They  are  recognised  within  'Other assets' as 'Deferred costs', as a contra to 'Trade and other payables' or, after settlement, to 'Cash and cash equivalents'. The allocated deferred costs are charged to the profit and loss account: (i) when natural gas is actually withdrawn - the related cost is included in the determination of the weighted average cost of inventories; and (ii) for the portion which is not recoverable, when it is not possible to withdraw the previously pre-paid gas within the contractually defined deadlines. Furthermore, the allocated deferred costs are tested for economic recoverability by comparing the related carrying amount and their net realisable value, determined adopting the same criteria described for inventories.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS: IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nThe  recoverability  of  non-financial  assets  is  assessed  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. Such impairment indicators include, for example, changes in the Group's business plans, changes in commodity prices leading to unprofitable performance, a reduced capacity utilisation of plants and, for oil and gas properties, significant downward  revisions  of  estimated  reserve  quantities  or  significant increase  of  the  estimated  development  and  production  costs. Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain and complex matters such as future commodity prices, future discount rates, future development costs and production costs, the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses, production profiles and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions also with reference to the decarbonization process and the effects of changes in regulatory requirements. The definition of CGUs and  the  identification  of  their  appropriate  grouping  for  the  purpose of testing for impairment the carrying amount of goodwill, corporate assets  as  well  as  common  facilities  within  the  E&P  operating segment,  require  judgment  by  management.  In  particular,  CGUs are identified considering, inter alia, how management monitors the entity's operations (such as by business lines) or how management makes decisions about continuing or disposing of the entity's assets and operations. Similar remarks are valid for assessing the physical recoverability of assets recognised on the balance sheet (deferred costs - see also the accounting policy for 'Inventories') related to natural gas volumes not withdrawn under long-term supply contracts with take-or-pay clauses.\n\n(23) Impairment losses recognised for goodwill in an interim period are not reversed also when, considering conditions existing in a subsequent interim period, they would have been recognised in a smaller amount or would not have been recognized.",

In particular, taking into  consideration  the  current  and  expected  decarbonisation trends,  the  estimate  of  expected  future  cash  flows,  which considers  Eni's  scenarios  for  commodities  price  is  performed taking into account: (i) the evolution of the future energy system; (ii)  the  fundamentals  of  the  various  energy  markets;  as  well as  (iii)  the  constant  benchmarking  with  the  views  of  market analysts and other specialised institutions. Such cash flows are discounted using a rate which considers the risks specific to the asset. For oil and natural gas properties, the expected future cash flows  are  estimated  based  on  proved  and  probable  reserves, including, among other elements, production taxes and the costs to be incurred for the reserves yet to be developed. In limited cases (e.g. for mineral interests acquired from third parties as part of a business combination) the expected cash flows may take  into  account  also  the  risk-adjusted  possible  reserves,  if they are considered to determine the consideration transferred. The  estimate  of  the  future  rates  of  production  is  based  on assumptions related to future commodity prices, operating costs, lifting and development costs, field decline rates, market demand and other factors.\n\nMore details on the main assumptions underlying the determination of the recoverable amount of tangible, intangible and  right-of-use  assets  are  set  out  in  note  15  -  Reversals (Impairments) of tangible and intangible assets and right-of-use assets. Sensitivity of outcomes to decarbonisation scenarios.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are classified, on the basis of both contractual cash  flow  characteristics  and  the  entity's  business  model  for managing them, in the following categories: (i) financial assets measured at amortised cost; (ii) financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (hereinafter also OCI); (iii) financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (hereinafter also FVTPL).\n\nAt initial recognition, a financial asset is measured at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVTPL, transaction costs  that  are  directly  attributable;  at  initial  recognition,  trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component are measured at their transaction price.\n\nAfter initial recognition, financial assets whose contractual terms\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\ngive rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows (the so-called hold to collect business model). For financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost,  interest  income determined  using  the  effective  interest  rate,  foreign  exchange differences  and  any  impairment  losses 24 (see  the  accounting policy for 'Impairment of financial assets') are recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nConversely,  financial  assets  that  are  debt  instruments  are measured  at  fair  value  through  OCI  (hereinafter  also  FVTOCI) if  they  are  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (the so-called hold to collect and sell business model).  In  these  cases:  (i)  interest  income  determined  using the effective interest rate, foreign exchange differences and any impairment losses (see the accounting policy for 'Impairment of financial assets') are recognised in the profit and loss account; (ii) changes in fair value of the instruments are recognised in equity,  within  other  comprehensive  income.  The  accumulated changes in fair value, recognised in the equity reserve related to other comprehensive income, is reclassified to the profit and loss account when the financial asset is derecognised. Currently the Group does not have any financial assets measured at fair value through OCI.\n\nA financial asset represented by a debt instrument that is neither measured  at  amortised  cost  nor  at  FVTOCI,  is  measured  at FVTPL; financial assets held for trading, as well as the portfolios of  financial  assets  managed  and  evaluated  on  a  fair  value basis, fall into this category. Interest income on such financial assets contributes to the related fair value measurement and is recognised in 'Finance income (expense)', within 'Net finance income  (expense)  from  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through profit or loss'.\n\nWhen the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose  terms  require  delivery  of  the  asset  within  the  time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned, the transaction is accounted for on the settlement date.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  include  cash  on  hand,  demand deposits, as well as financial assets originally due, generally, up to three months, readily convertible to known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.",

Counterparties  are  considered undergoing  litigation  when  judicial/legal  proceedings  aimed  to recover a receivable have been activated or are going to be activated. Impairment losses of trade and other receivables are recognised in the profit and loss account, net of any impairment reversal, within the line item of the profit and loss account 'Net (impairment losses) reversals of trade and other receivables'.\n\nThe  financing  receivables  held  for  operating  purposes,  granted  to associates and joint ventures, for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which in substance form part of the entity's net investment in these investees, are tested for impairment, first, on the basis of the expected credit loss model and, then, together with the carrying amount of the investment in the associate/joint venture, in accordance with the criteria indicated\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nin the accounting policy for 'The equity method of accounting'. In applying the expected credit loss model, any adjustments to the carrying amount of long-term interest that arise from applying the accounting policy for 'The equity method of accounting' are not taken into account.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS: IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nMeasuring impairment losses of financial assets requires management evaluation of complex and highly uncertain elements such as, for example, Probabilities of Default of counterparties, the assessment  of  any  collateral  or  other  credit  enhancements,  the expected exposure that will not be recovered in case of default, as well as the definition of customers' clusters to be adopted. Further details on the main assumptions underlying the measurement of expected credit losses of financial assets are provided in note 8 Trade and other receivables.\n\n## Investments in equity instruments\n\nInvestments in equity instruments that are not held for trading are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, without subsequent transfer of fair value changes to profit or loss on derecognition of these investments; conversely, dividends from these investments are recognised in the profit and loss account, within  the  line  item  'Income  (Expense)  from  investments', unless they clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.  In  limited  circumstances,  an  investment  in  equity instruments  can  be  measured  at  cost  if  it  is  an  appropriate estimate of fair value.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nAt initial recognition, financial liabilities, other than derivative financial instruments,  are  measured  at  their  fair  value,  minus  transaction costs that are directly attributable, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe  sustainability-linked  bonds,  i.e.  financial  liabilities  where  the interest  rate  is  periodically  adjusted  to  reflect  changes  in  the borrower's performance relative to certain sustainability targets (the so-called ESG metrics), are measured at amortised cost.\n\nGenerally, changes in the interest rate result in an update of the effective interest rate to be used for the recognition of interest expense.\n\nThe issue of a convertible bond into ordinary shares of the issuer (without substantial cash settlement option) determines the separate recognition of the components of the instrument represented by the debt component, measured at amortised cost, and by the conversion\n\n(25) The expected credit loss model is also adopted: (i) for issued financial guarantee contracts not measured at FVTPL; as well as (ii) for issued performance guarantees contracts Expected credit losses recognised on issued guarantees are not material.

Any eventually transaction costs are allocated proportionally between the financial liability and the equity instrument.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS: FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nThe Group's companies can negotiate supplier finance arrangements  (supply  chain  finance,  payable  finance,  reverse factoring  and  similar  agreements)  with  suppliers  to  obtain extended payment terms, without the necessary and automatic involvement of a financial institution. In such cases, management judges whether or not payables towards suppliers have to be reclassified  as  financial  liabilities  from  trade/investing  activity payables. In order to make such judgment, management considers if the payment terms differ from the ones that are customary in the industry, any additional security is provided as part of the arrangement  as  well  as  any  other  facts  and  circumstances. The  classification  as  a  financial  liability  determines:  (i)  upon reclassification/initial recognition of the liability, a non-monetary change in financial liabilities, with no impacts on the statement of cash flows; (ii) upon the settlement of the liability, the classification of the payment within net cash used in financing activities. With reference to sustainability-linked bonds, management assesses whether the non-compliance with an ESG metric could adversely impact  operations  and,  therefore,  revenue  generation  and creditworthiness of the Company.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nDerivative financial instruments, including embedded derivatives (see below) that are separated from the host contract, are assets and liabilities measured at their fair value.\n\nWith  reference  to  the  defined  risk  management  objectives  and strategy, the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting requires: (i) the existence of an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument in order to offset the related value changes and the effects of counterparty credit risk do not dominate the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;  and  (ii)  the  definition  of  the  relationship  between the quantity of the hedged item and the quantity of the hedging instrument (the so-called hedge ratio) consistent with the entity's risk  management  objectives,  under  a  defined  risk  management strategy; the hedge ratio is adjusted, where appropriate, after taking into account any adequate rebalancing. A hedging relationship is discontinued prospectively, in its entirety or a part of it, when it no longer meets the risk management objectives on the basis of which it qualified for hedge accounting, it ceases to meet the other qualifying criteria or after rebalancing it.\n\nWhen derivatives hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged items (fair value hedge, e.g. hedging of the variability\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nin  the  fair  value  of  fixed  interest  rate  assets/liabilities),  the derivatives are measured at fair value through profit and loss. Consistently, the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect, in the profit and loss account, the changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk; this applies even if the hedged item should be otherwise measured.\n\nWhen  derivatives  hedge  the  exposure  to  variability  in  cash flows of the hedged items (cash flow hedge, e.g. hedging the variability in the cash flows of assets/liabilities as a result of the  fluctuations  of  exchange  rate),  the  effective  changes  in the fair value of the derivatives are initially recognised in the equity reserve related to other comprehensive income and then reclassified to the profit and loss account in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects the profit and loss account.\n\nIf  a  hedged  forecast  transaction  subsequently  results  in  the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the accumulated changes in fair value of hedging derivatives, recognised in equity, are included directly in the carrying amount of the hedged non-financial asset/liability (commonly referred to as a 'basis adjustment').\n\nThe changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as  hedging  instruments,  including  any  ineffective  portion  of changes  in  fair  value  of  hedging  derivatives,  are  recognised in  the  profit  and  loss  account.  In  particular,  the  changes  in the fair value of non-hedging derivatives on interest rates and exchange rates are recognised in the profit and loss account line item 'Finance income (expense)'; conversely, the changes in  the  fair  value  of  non-hedging  derivatives  on  commodities are recognised in the profit and loss account line item 'Other operating (expense) income'. Derivatives embedded in financial assets are not accounted for separately; in such circumstances, the  entire  hybrid  instrument  is  classified  depending  on  the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial instrument and the business model for managing it (see the accounting policy for 'Financial assets'). Derivatives embedded in financial liabilities and/or non-financial assets are separated if: (i) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract; (ii) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and (iii) the entire hybrid contract is not measured at FVTPL.\n\nEni  assesses  the  existence  of  embedded  derivatives  to  be separated when it becomes party to the contract and, afterwards, when a change in the terms of the contract that modifies its cash flows occurs.\n\nContracts to buy or sell commodities entered into and continued to be held for the purpose of their receipt or delivery in accordance with the Group's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements",

Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished, or when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nA provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount on the balance sheet date. Provisions are recognised when: (i) there is a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event; (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and (iii)  the  amount  of  the  obligation  can  be  reliably  estimated. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation or to transfer it to third parties on the balance sheet date. The amount recognised  for  onerous  contracts  is  the  lower  of  the  cost necessary to fulfill the obligations, net of expected economic benefits deriving from the contracts, and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfill these obligations. Where the effect of the time value is material, and the payment date of the obligations can be reasonably estimated, provisions to be accrued are the present value of the expected cash outflows determined taking into account the time value of money and the risks associated with the obligation. The change in provisions due to the passage of time is recognised within 'Finance income (expense)' in the profit and loss account.\n\nA provision for restructuring costs is recognised only when the Company has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in the affected parties that it will carry out the restructuring.\n\nProvisions  are  periodically  reviewed  and  adjusted  to  reflect changes in the estimates of costs, timing and discount rates. Changes in provisions are recognised in the same profit and loss account line item where the original provision was charged. Contingent liabilities are: (i) possible obligations arising from\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\npast  events,  whose  existence  will  be  confirmed  only  by  the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events  not  wholly  within  the  control  of  the  Company;  or  (ii) present  obligations  arising  from  past  events,  whose  amount cannot be reliably measured or whose settlement will probably not  result  in  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic benefits. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed.\n\nContingent assets, that are possible assets arising from past events  and  whose  existence  will  be  confirmed  only  by  the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company, are not recognised  in  financial  statements  unless  the  realisation  of economic  benefits  is  virtually  certain.  Contingent  assets  are disclosed  when  an  inflow  of  economic  benefits  is  probable. Contingent  assets  are  assessed  periodically  to  ensure  that developments  are  appropriately  reflected  in  the  financial statements.\n\n## Decommissioning and restoration liabilities\n\nLiabilities  for  decommissioning  and  restoration  costs  are recognized, together with a corresponding amount as part of the related property, plant and equipment, when the conditions indicated  in  the  accounting  policy  'Provisions,  Contingent Liabilities And Contingent Assets' are met.\n\nConsidering the long-time span between the recognition of the obligation  and  its  settlement,  the  amount  recognised  is  the present value of the future expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. Any change due to the unwinding of discount  on  provisions  is  recognised  within  'Finance  income (expense)'.\n\nSuch  liabilities  are  reviewed  regularly  to  take  into  account the changes in the expected costs to be incurred, contractual obligations, regulatory requirements and practices in force in the countries where the tangible assets are located.\n\nThe effects of any changes in the estimate of the liability are recognised generally as an adjustment to the carrying amount of  the  related  property,  plant  and  equipment;  however,  if  the resulting decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the related asset, the excess is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nAnalogous approach is adopted for present obligations to realise social projects related to operating activities carried out by the Company.\n\n## Environmental liabilities\n\nEnvironmental  liabilities  are  recognised  when  the  Group has  a  present  obligation,  legal  or  constructive,  relating  to environmental clean-up and remediation of soil and groundwater",

Estimating obligations to  dismantle,  remove  and  restore  items  of  property,  plant  and equipment is complex. It requires management to make estimates and judgments with respect to removal obligations that will come to term many years into the future and contracts and regulations are often unclear as to what constitutes removal. In addition, the ultimate financial impact of environmental laws and regulations is not always clearly known as asset removal technologies and costs constantly evolve in the countries where Eni operates, as do political, environmental, safety and public expectations.\n\nThe estimates about the timing and amount of future cash outflows, any related update as well as the related discounting are based on complex managerial judgments.\n\nDecommissioning  and  restoration  provisions,  recognised  in  the financial  statements,  include,  essentially,  the  present  value  of  the expected costs for decommissioning oil and natural gas facilities at the end of the economic lives of fields, well-plugging, abandonment and  site  restoration  of  the  Exploration  &  Production  operating segment. Any decommissioning and restoration provisions associated with the other operating segments' assets, given their indeterminate  settlement  dates,  also  considering  the  strategy to reconvert plants in order to produce low carbon products, are recognised when it is possible to make a reliable estimate of the discounted abandonment costs. In this regard, Eni performs periodic reviews for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a decommissioning and restoration provision. Eni  is  subject  to  numerous  EU,  national,  regional  and  local environmental  laws  and  regulations  concerning  its  oil  and  gas operations, production and other activities. They include legislations that implement international conventions or protocols. Environmental liabilities are recognised when it becomes probable that an outflow of  resources  will  be  required  to  settle  the  obligation  and  such obligation can be reliably estimated. On this regard, with reference to groundwater treatment plants, the enhancement of the know-how\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\ngained on water contamination trends, as well as the positions of the competent authorities, allows the definition of a predictive model for estimating the time horizon within which the operations of those plants will be terminated and, therefore, for estimating the cost of managing and monitoring them.\n\nThe reliable determinability is verified on the basis of the available information  such  as,  for  example,  the  approval  or  filing  of  the environmental  projects  to  the  relevant  administrative  authorities or  the  making  of  a  commitment  to  the  relevant  administrative authorities, where supported by adequate estimates.\n\nManagement,  considering  the  actions  already  taken,  insurance policies obtained to cover environmental risks and provisions already recognised, does not expect any material adverse effect on Eni's consolidated results of operations and financial position as a result of such laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse impact on Eni's consolidated results of operations and financial position due to: (i) the possibility of an unknown contamination; (ii) the results of the ongoing surveys and  other  possible  effects  of  statements  required  by  applicable laws; (iii) the possible effects of future environmental legislations and rules; (iv) the effects of possible technological changes relating to future remediation; and (v) the possibility of litigation and the difficulty of determining Eni's liability, if any, against other potentially responsible parties with respect to such litigations and the possible reimbursements.\n\nIn addition to environmental and decommissioning and restoration liabilities, Eni recognises provisions primarily related to legal and trade  proceedings.  These  provisions  are  estimated  on  the  basis of complex managerial judgments related to the amounts to be recognised and the timing of future cash outflows. After the initial recognition,  provisions  are  periodically  reviewed  and  adjusted  to reflect the current best estimate.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nEmployee  benefits  are  considerations  given  by  the  Group  in exchange for service rendered by employees or for the termination of employment.\n\nPost-employment benefit plans, including informal arrangements, are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans depending on the economic substance of the plan as derived from its principal terms and conditions. Under defined contribution plans, the Company's obligation, which consists in making payments to the State or to a trust or a fund, is determined on the basis of contributions due. The liabilities related to defined benefit plans, net of any plan assets, are determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and charged on an accrual basis during the employment period required to obtain the benefits.\n\nNet  interest  includes  the  interest  cost  on  liabilities  and  interest income on plan assets. Net interest is measured by applying to the",

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability,  recognised  within  other  comprehensive  income,  are  not reclassified subsequently to the profit and loss account. Obligations for  long-term  benefits  are  determined  by  adopting  actuarial assumptions. The effects of remeasurements are taken to profit and loss account in their entirety.\n\nThe liabilities for termination benefits are recognised at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the entity can no longer withdraw the  offer  of  those  benefits;  and  (b)  when  the  entity  recognises costs for a restructuring that involves the payment of termination benefits.  Such  liabilities  are  measured  in  accordance  with  the nature  of  the  employee  benefit.  In  particular,  if  the  termination benefits  are  an  enhancement  to  post-employment  benefits,  the related liability is measured in accordance with the requirements for post-employment benefits. Otherwise, liabilities for termination benefits  are  determined  applying  the  requirements:  (i)  for  shortterm employee benefits, if the termination benefits are expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the termination benefits are recognised; or  (ii)  for  long-term  benefits  if  the  termination  benefits  are  not expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe line item 'Payroll and related costs' includes the cost of the share-based incentive plan, consistent with its actual remunerative nature. The cost of the share-based incentive plan is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted and the estimate of the number of shares that eventually vest; the cost is recognised on an accrual basis pro rata temporis over the vesting period, that is the period between the grant date and the settlement date. The fair value of the shares underlying the incentive plan is measured at the grant date, taking into account the estimate of achievement of market conditions (e.g. Total Shareholder Return), and is not adjusted in subsequent periods; when the achievement is  linked  also  to  nonmarket  conditions,  the  number  of  shares expected to vest is adjusted during the vesting period to reflect the updated estimate of these conditions. If, at the end of the vesting period, the incentive plan does not vest because of failure to satisfy the performance conditions, the portion of cost related to market conditions is not reversed to the profit and loss account.\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND SHAREBASED PAYMENTS\n\nDefined  benefit  plans  are  evaluated  with  reference  to  uncertain events  and  based  upon  actuarial  assumptions.  The  significant assumptions  used  to  account  for  defined  benefit  plans  are determined as follows: (i) discount and inflation rates are based on the market yields on high quality corporate bonds (or, in the absence of a deep market of these bonds, on the market yields on  government  bonds)  and  on  the  expected  inflation  rates  in the  reference  currency  area;  (ii)  the  future  salary  levels  of  the individual  employees  are  determined  including  an  estimate  of future changes attributed to general price levels (consistent with inflation rate assumptions), productivity, seniority and promotion; (iii)  healthcare cost trend assumptions reflect an estimate of the actual future changes in the cost of the healthcare related benefits provided to the plan participants and are based on past and current healthcare cost trends, including healthcare inflation, changes in healthcare utilisation, changes in health status of the participants and the contributions paid to health funds; and (iv) demographic assumptions such as mortality, disability and turnover reflect the best  estimate  of  these  future  events  for  individual  employees involved.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  (asset)  changes according  to  the  remeasurements,  comprising,  among  others, changes in the current actuarial assumptions, differences in the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred and differences in the return on plan assets, excluding amounts included  in  net  interest,  usually  occur.  Similar  to  the  approach followed for the fair value measurement of financial instruments, the  fair  value  of  the  shares  underlying  the  incentive  plans  is measured by using complex valuation techniques and identifying, through structured judgments, the assumptions to be adopted. Further details on the share-based incentives plans for managers are provided in note 30 - Costs.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury  shares,  including  shares  held  to  meet  the  future requirements of the share-based incentive plans, are recognised as deductions from equity at cost. Any gain or loss resulting from subsequent sales is recognised in equity.\n\n## Hybrid bonds\n\nThe  perpetual  subordinated  hybrid  bonds  are  classified  in  the financial  statements  as  equity  instruments  considering  that  the issuer has the unconditional right to defer, until the date of its own liquidation, the repayment of the principal amount and the payment",

Therefore, the issuer recognises the cash received from the bondholders, net of costs incurred in issuing the hybrid bonds, as an increase in Eni owners' equity; differently, the repayments of the principal amount and the payments of accrued interest  (upon  the  arising  of  the  related  contractual  payment obligation) are accounted for as a decrease in Eni owners' equity.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue  from  contracts  with  customers  is  recognised  on  the basis  of  the  following  five  steps:  (i)  identifying  the  contract  with the  customer;  (ii)  identifying  the  performance  obligations,  that are promises in a contract to transfer goods and/or services to a customer; (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices of each good or service; and (v) recognising revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, that is when a promised good or service is transferred to a customer. A promised good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of it. Control can be transferred over time or at a point in time. With reference to the most important products sold by Eni, revenue is generally recognised for:\n\n- \u00b7  crude oil, upon shipment;\n- \u00b7  natural gas and electricity, upon delivery to the customer;\n- \u00b7  petroleum  products  sold  to  retail  distribution  networks,  upon delivery to the service stations, whereas all other sales of petroleum products are recognised upon shipment;\n- \u00b7  chemical products and other products, upon shipment.\n\nRevenue from crude oil and natural gas production from properties in which Eni has an interest together with other producers is recognised on the basis of the quantities actually lifted and sold (sales method);\n\ncosts are recognised on the basis of the quantities actually sold. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods and/or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. In determining the transaction price, the promised amount of consideration is adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract provides the customer or the entity with  a  significant  benefit  of  financing  the  transfer  of  goods  or services to the customer. The promised amount of consideration is not adjusted for the effect of the significant financing component if, at contract inception, it is expected that the period between the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount,\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nthe Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods and/or services to a customer; in particular, the amount of consideration can vary because of discounts, refunds, incentives, price concessions, performance bonuses, penalties or if the price is contingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events.\n\nIf,  in  a  contract,  the  Company  grants  a  customer  the  option  to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount (e.g. sales  incentives,  customer  award  points,  etc.),  this  option  gives rise to a separate performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that it would not receive without entering into that contract. When goods or services are exchanged for goods or services which are of a similar nature and value, the exchange is not regarded as a transaction which generates  revenue.  The  payment  of  accrued  interest  is  required upon the occurrence of events under the issuer's control such as, for example, a distribution of dividends to shareholders.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS: REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\n\nRevenue  from  sales  of  electricity  and  gas  to  retail  customers includes  the  amount  accrued  for  electricity  and  gas  supplied between  the  date  of  the  last  invoiced  meter  reading  (actual  or estimated) of volumes consumed and the end of the year. These estimates  consider  information  provided  by  the  grid  managers about the volumes allocated among the customers of the secondary distribution  network,  about  the  actual  and  estimated  volumes consumed  by  customers,  as  well  as  internal  estimates  about volumes consumed by customers. Therefore, revenue is accrued as a result of a complex estimate based on the volumes distributed and allocated, communicated by third parties, likely to be adjusted, according to applicable regulations, within the fifth year following the one in which they are accrued, as well as on estimates about volumes consumed by customers. Considering the contractual obligations on the supply delivery points, revenue from sales of electricity and gas to retail customers includes costs for transportation and dispatching and in these cases the gross amount of consideration to which the Company is entitled is recognised.\n\n## Costs\n\nCosts  are  recognised  when  the  related  goods  and  services are sold or consumed during the year, when they are allocated on a systematic basis or when their future economic benefits cannot  be  identified.  Costs  associated  with  emission  quotas, incurred  to  meet  the  compliance  requirements  (e.g.  Emission",

Costs  related  to  the purchase of the emission rights that exceed the amount necessary to  meet  regulatory  obligations  are  recognised  as  intangible assets. Revenue related to emission quotas is recognised when they are sold. Emission rights held for trading are recognised within inventories. The costs incurred on a voluntary basis for the acquisition or production of forestry certificates, also taking into account the absence of an active market, are recognised in the profit and loss account when incurred.\n\nThe costs for the acquisition of new knowledge or discoveries, the study of products or alternative processes, new techniques or models, the planning and construction of prototypes or, in any case,  costs  incurred  for  other  scientific  research  activities  or technological development, which cannot be capitalised (see also the accounting policy for 'Intangible assets'), are included in the profit and loss account when they are incurred.\n\n## Exchange differences\n\nRevenues  and  costs  associated  with  transactions  in  foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency by applying the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date and any resulting exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account within 'Finance income (expense)'  or,  if  designated  as  hedging  instruments  for  the foreign currency risk, in the same line item in which the economic effects of the hedged item are recognised. Non-monetary assets and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  measured  at cost, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition. Nonmonetary items measured at fair value, recoverable amount or net realisable value are retranslated using the exchange rate at the date when the value is determined.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends are recognised when the right to receive payment of the dividend is established.\n\nDividends and interim dividends to owners are shown as changes in equity when the dividends are declared by, respectively, the shareholders' meeting and the Board of Directors.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nCurrent income taxes are determined on the basis of estimated taxable  profit.  Current  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are measured at the amount expected to be paid to (recovered from)\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nthe taxation authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities and their tax bases, based on tax rates and tax laws that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets are recognised when their recoverability is considered probable, i.e. when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in the same year as the reversal of the deductible temporary difference. Similarly, deferred tax assets for the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that their recoverability is probable. The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed, at least, on an annual basis.\n\nIf there is uncertainty over income tax treatments, if the company concludes it is probable that the taxation authority will accept an  uncertain  tax  treatment,  it  determines  the  (current  and/ or  deferred)  income  taxes  to  be  recognised  in  the  financial statements consistent with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax filings. Conversely, if the company concludes it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the company reflects the effect of uncertainty in determining the (current and/or deferred) income taxes to be recognised in the financial statements.\n\nRelating  to  the  taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with investments  in  subsidiaries  and  associates,  and  interests  in joint  arrangements,  the  related  deferred  tax  liabilities  are  not recognised if the investor is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  presented  within  noncurrent  assets  and  liabilities  and  are  offset  at  a  single  entity level if related to offsettable taxes. The balance of the offset, if positive, is recognised in the line item 'Deferred tax assets' and, if negative, in the line item 'Deferred tax liabilities'. When the results of transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, the related current and deferred taxes are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS: INCOME TAXES\n\nThe  computation  of  income  taxes  involves  the  interpretation of  applicable  tax  laws  and  regulations  in  many  jurisdictions throughout the world. Although Eni aims to maintain a relationship with  the  taxation  authorities  characterised  by  transparency, dialogue  and  cooperation  (e.g.  by  not  using  aggressive  tax planning  and  by  using,  if  available,  procedures  intended  to",

The resolution of tax disputes, through negotiations with relevant taxation authorities or through litigation, could take several years to complete. The estimate of liabilities related to uncertain tax treatments requires complex judgments by management. After the initial recognition, these liabilities are periodically reviewed for any changes in facts and circumstances.\n\nManagement  makes  complex  judgments  regarding  mainly  the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, related both to deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses, which requires estimates and evaluations about the amount and the timing of future taxable profits.\n\n## Assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current assets and current and non-current assets included within disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather  than  through  continuing  use.  This  condition  is  regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. When there is a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale, regardless of whether a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary will be retained after the sale.\n\nNon-current assets held for sale, current and non-current assets included  within  disposal  groups  that  have  been  classified  as held for sale and the liabilities directly associated with them are recognised on the balance sheet separately from other assets and liabilities.\n\nImmediately before the initial classification of a noncurrent asset and/or a disposal group as held for sale, the non-current asset and/or the assets and liabilities in the disposal group are measured in accordance with applicable IFRSs. Subsequently, non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated or amortised and they are measured at the lower of the fair value less costs to sell and their carrying amount. If an equity-accounted investment, or a portion of that investment meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, it is no longer accounted for using the equity method and it is measured at the lower of its carrying amount at the date the equity method is discontinued, and its fair value less costs to sell. Any retained portion of the equity-accounted investment that has not been classified as held for sale is accounted for using the equity method until disposal of the portion that is classified as held for sale takes place.\n\nAny difference between the carrying amount of the noncurrent assets and the fair value less costs to sell is taken to the profit\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nand loss account as an impairment loss; any subsequent reversal is recognised up to the cumulative impairment losses, including those recognised prior to qualification of the asset as held for sale. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and disposal groups are considered a discontinued operation if they, alternatively: (i) represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; (ii) are part of a disposal program of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or (iii) are a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations, as well as any gain or loss recognised on the disposal, are indicated in a separate line item of the profit and loss account, net of the related tax effects; the economic figures of discontinued operations are indicated also for prior periods presented in the financial statements.\n\nIf events or circumstances occur that no longer allow to classify a non-current asset or a disposal group as held for sale, the noncurrent asset or the disposal group is reclassified into the original line items of the balance sheet and measured at the lower of: (i) its carrying amount at the date of classification as held for sale adjusted for any depreciation, amortisation, impairment losses and reversals that would have been recognised had the asset or disposal group not been classified as held for sale, and (ii) its recoverable amount at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.\n\n## Fair value measurements\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants (not in a forced liquidation or a distress sale) at the measurement date (exit price). Fair value measurement is based on the market conditions existing at the measurement date and on the assumptions of market participants (market-based measurement). A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market to which the entity has access, independently from the entity's intention to sell the asset or transfer the liability to be measured. A fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. Highest and best use is determined from the perspective of market participants, even if the entity intends a different use; an entity's current use of a nonfinancial asset is presumed to be its highest and best use, unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset.\n\nThe fair value of a liability, both financial and non-financial, or of the Company's own equity instrument, in the absence of a quoted price, is measured from the perspective of a market participant that holds",

The fair value of financial instruments takes into account the counterparty's credit risk for a financial asset (Credit Valuation Adjustment, CVA) and  the  Company's  own  credit  risk  for  a  financial  liability  (Debit Valuation  Adjustment,  DVA).  In  the  absence  of  available  market quotation, fair value is measured by using valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances, maximising the use of relevant\n\nobservable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. Assets  and  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  are  categorized into the fair value hierarchy which is defined on the basis of the significance of the inputs used to measure fair value. In particular, on the basis of the features of the inputs used in the measurement, the  fair  value  hierarchy  provides  for  the  following  levels: a)  level  1:  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active  markets  for identical assets or liabilities;\n\n## 2   Primary financial statements\n\nThe balance sheet and the profit and loss account are the same of the ones used in the previous reporting period.\n\nThe statement of comprehensive income (loss) shows net profit integrated with income and expenses that are not recognised directly in the profit and loss account according to IFRSs.

The decrease in the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio and Plenitude & Power reflected the decline in the  prices  of  energy  commodities,  which  decreased  the  nominal value of the receivables.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Eni factored without recourse receivables due in 2024 with a nominal value of \u20ac1,745 million (\u20ac2,212 million at December 31, 2022 due in 2023). Derecognized receivables in 2023 related to the segments Enilive, Refining and Chemicals for \u20ac1,291 million, Global Gas & LNG Portfolio for \u20ac297 million and Plenitude & Power segment for \u20ac157 million.\n\nAt the balance sheet date Eni owned \u20ac1,156 million of net trade receivables, part of which past due, towards Egyptian state oil companies in relation to supplies of equity hydrocarbons, mainly natural gas. The accumulation in trade receivables has accelerated in the second half of the year because of the rapid deterioration of  the  Country's  economic  and  financial  situation,  worsened  by the crisis in the Middle East, which led to a contraction in foreign exchange  reserves  leading  to  a  slowdown  in  the  payments  of receivables owed to oil companies operating in the Country. On the basis of the commitments of the Country's authorities to normalize the outstanding exposure towards Eni, an expected credit loss was\n\nestimated taking into account the expected timing of collection. At December 31, 2023, a past due trade receivable for the supply of natural gas to the customer Acciaierie d'Italia (former ILVA) was outstanding for an amount of \u20ac75 million (\u20ac373 million at December 31, 2022). A parent company guarantee has been issued by the shareholders of the debtor, which cover the entire amount of the receivable.\n\nReceivables owed to Eni by joint operators in Nigeria have been reclassified  to  assets  held  for  sale  because  of  the  ongoing divestment of the Nigerian subsidiary NAOC, whose assets included past due net receivables amounting to \u20ac236 million at December 31, 2023, which are owed to Eni by the counterparty of the possible transaction (see note 25 - Assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale). Those receivables were in respect to the share of development costs of the joint operators\n\nin  oil  projects  operated  by  Eni.  The  assets  of  the  held-for-sale subsidiary also included overdue receivables owed to Eni by the Nigerian state oil company NNPC for \u20ac472 million (\u20ac475 million at December 31, 2022). About 85% of such amount related to net receivables accrued for unpaid cash calls, for which an expected credit loss has been estimated by considering the average timing of repayment in the case of state-owned companies. The remaining part related to past overdue receivables, the collection of which has been almost entirely finalized thanks to a repayment plan which awarded Eni the share of profit  oil  of  the  state-owned  company in low-risk 'rig-less' development initiatives with total collection expected by end of 2024. The residual amount outstanding at the end of the year has been discounted by using the Country WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital).\n\nReceivables from other counterparties comprised several miscellaneous  items.  The  two  largest  amounts  were:  (i)  the recoverable amount of \u20ac600 million (\u20ac566 million at December 31, 2022) of overdue trade receivables owed to Eni by the state-owned oil  company  of  Venezuela,  PDVSA,  in  relation  to  equity  volumes of natural gas supplied to PDVSA by the joint venture Card\u00f3n IV, equally participated by Eni and Repsol. Those trade receivables were divested by the joint venture to the two shareholders. The receivables were stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, calculated with an expected credit loss rate deemed suitable to discount the sovereign risk and assuming a structural delay in collecting natural gas invoices. During the year, under the approval of US authorities within the context of the sanctions framework against Venezuela, receivables were collected under a barter scheme, which provided Eni with the right to lift crude oil volumes part of PDVSA entitlements for 5.6 million barrels, thus limiting the increase in overdue amounts; (ii) prepayments for services of \u20ac358 million (\u20ac278 million at December 31, 2022); (iii) \u20ac231 million (\u20ac239 million at December 31, 2022) of the amounts to be received from customers following the triggering of the take-or-pay clause of long-term natural gas supply contracts; (iv) receivables owed to Eni by Italian local distributors of natural gas and electricity of \u20ac309 million as of December 31, 2022 were entirely collected as certain measures expired, which were enacted by the Italian State in 2022 to reduce the cost of the energy bill to households and businesses; (v) \u20ac6 million (\u20ac193 million at December 31, 2022) of receivables from factoring companies.\n\nTrade and other receivables stated in euro and US dollar amounted to \u20ac9,915 million and \u20ac6,041 million, respectively.",

The property book value included \u20ac888 million corresponding to the price paid in 2011 to the Nigerian Government to acquire a 50% interest in the asset, plus the subsequent capitalized exploration costs and pre-development costs bringing the total net book value to \u20ac1,208 million. A lenghty and complex criminal proceeding before the Court of Milan was definitively resolved during 2022 in favor of Eni, which related to alleged crimes of international corruption regarding the acquisition of the license, whereas in 2023 the Federal Republic of Nigeria renounced to continue a claim to obtain compensation for the alleged damages (see note 28 - Guarantees, Commitments and Risks - Legal proceedings). The request for conversion of the license into an Oil Mining Lease (OML) before the relevant Nigerian authorities to start the development of the reserves is still pending. Given the inaction of the Nigerian authorities, a few years ago Eni started an arbitration proceeding before an ICSID tribunal, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, to preserve the value of the investment. Regardless of the outcome of the ongoing arbitration, the estimate of the asset value in the perspective of its economic utilization\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nconfirmed the recoverability of the asset's book value by discounting the expected cash flows at the Country WACC (8%).\n\nAccumulated provisions for impairments amounted to \u20ac22,650 million (\u20ac21,715 million at December 31, 2022).\n\nProperty, plant and equipment includes assets subject to operating leases for \u20ac347 million, essentially relating to service stations of the Enilive and Refining business line.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Eni pledged property, plant and equipment for \u20ac24 million to guarantee payments of excise duties (same amount as of December 31, 2022).\n\nGovernment grants recorded as a decrease of property, plant and equipment amounted to \u20ac91 million (\u20ac115 million at December 31, 2022).\n\nContractual commitments related to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are disclosed in note 28 -

To  test  its recoverability, the activities were grouped by homogeneous CGUs, corresponding  to  geographical  areas,  with  regard  to  technical, economic  and  contractual  matters.  The  recoverability  of  the goodwill was assessed with reference to the entire CGU. The cash flows include those obtainable from assets under operations and the repowering of existing plants and facilities. The recoverability test of the book values of renewable assets including the allocated goodwill was performed based on the discounted cash flows which comprised the financial projections of the four-year industrial plan approved  by  the  management  and  the  subsequent  cash  flows associated with the useful lives of the plants by using normalized cash  flows.  Cash  flows  have  been  discounted  at  sector  and Country-specific WACCs, which were comprised in a range of 5.5% - 6.1%. This test has confirmed the recoverability of the book values of the complex of plants generating renewable electricity, including the allocated goodwill.

The recoverability of the allocated goodwill was tested based on the discounted cash flows  of  the  activity,  which  comprised  the  financial  projections of  the  four-year  industrial  plan  approved  by  management  and subsequently the perpetuity of the final year of the plan assuming a growth rate of 4.6% that reflects trend forecasts in sales of electric vehicles, discounted at a WACC of 10.8%. This test confirmed the recoverability of the allocated goodwill and showed a headroom of about \u20ac400 million which would go to zero under no reasonable assumption.",

Sensitivity of outcomes to decarbonisation scenarios\n\nThe  recoverability  test  of  carrying  amounts  of  oil  &  gas  cash generating  units  (CGUs)  is  the  most  important  of  the  critical accounting  estimates  in  the  preparation  of  Eni's  consolidated financial statements. This owes to the relative weight of the invested capital in the sector on total consolidated assets.\n\nFuture  expected  cash  flows  associated  with  the  use  of  oil  &  gas assets  are  based  on  management's  judgment  and  subjective evaluation about highly uncertain matters like future hydrocarbons prices, assets' useful lives, projections of future operating and capital expenditures, including CO 2 emission costs relating to geographies where legal obligations are present, the volumes of reserves that will ultimately be recovered and costs of decommissioning oil & gas assets at the end of their useful lives. The hydrocarbon prices are\n\nforecasted as part of Eni's scenario, which considers macroeconomic and  industry  projections,  policies,  regulations,  and  technologies (in  place  or  foreseeable)  and  providing  a  holistic  and  consistent framework for the economic and energy variables of interest. These forecasts incorporate management's best estimate of the various energy market fundamentals while considering the changing market environment and challenges related to the energy transition. Eni's scenario  is  constantly  benchmarked  against  the  market  view  of investment banks and energy consultants.\n\nBelow are the main price assumptions for assessing the recoverability of oil & gas assets, expressed in 2022 real terms for comparability with the IEA scenario:\n\n|                               |   2024 |   2027 |   2030 |   2040 |   2050 |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brent $/bbl                   |   73   |   68   |   68   |   58   |   48   |\n| TTF natural gas price $/mmBtu |    8.7 |    9.9 |    6.8 |    6.8 |    6.2 |\n\nThis scenario does not differ significantly from the one adopted in the previous reporting year, with the exception of forecasts of lower natural gas prices in the short term. Actual hydrocarbons prices utilized in the calculation of future revenues of oil&gas assets in the impairment review are derived from the main market benchmarks by applying appropriate price differentials, which were estimated by the management to consider factors like crude qualities, different indexation mechanisms and regional price trends.\n\nThe  discount  rate  of  the  future  cash  flows  of  the  CGUs  was estimated as the weighted average cost of equity (Ke) and net borrowings, based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model methodology. Specifically, the cost of equity considers both a premium for the nondiversifiable market risk measured on the basis of the long-term returns of the S&P500, and an additional premium that considers exposure to operational risks of the countries of activity and the risks of the energy transition. For 2023, a Group cost of capital ('WAAC') of approximately 7% was estimated and was substantially unchanged compared to 2022 due to a lower cost of equity as a consequence of the reduction in the company's financial risk, which offset the increased yields on risk-free assets. The Group WACC is  adjusted  to  account  for  the  specific  operational  risks  of  each geography against the average portfolio, where oil&gas activities are conducted, by adding a corrective factor (WACC adjusted on a Country-by-Country basis).\n\nThe impairment test was performed at all of the Group's oil&gas CGUs based on the price scenario of management and the Country WACCs described above, which substantially confirmed the carrying amounts of the properties, with the exception of some assets which were marked to their lower recoverable values due to downward reserves\n\nrevisions and expected reductions in natural gas prices, recognizing approximately \u20ac1 billion of net impairment losses. The geographical areas  involved  were  mainly  Alaska,  Gulf  of  Mexico,  Turkmenistan and Australia in relation to reserves revisions and gas assets in Italy in relation to gas prices. The post-tax discount rates were comprised in a range 6.0% - 7.5%; the pre-tax discount rates for the main net impairment losses were set to 5.1% in Italy and 20.3% in Alaska.\n\nThe value in use (VIU) of the oil&gas CGUs under the management's scenario assumptions displayed a headroom (difference between VIU and book values) of approximately 80% of the assets' carrying amounts, discounting the expected expenses associated with the purchase of carbon credits as part of the Company's strategy to decarbonize  its  oil  &  gas  operations  also  through  nature-based solutions of carbon offsets. Those sensitivity analyses included assets of all consolidated entities, joint ventures and associates, excluding  V\u00e5r  Energi  ASA  and  Azule  Energy  Holdings  Ltd. Considering the judgemental nature of the assumptions underlying the estimate of the VIU, management has stress-tested its base case by applying the following sensitivity analyses to the assumptions underlying the oil & gas CGUs values-in-use of the base case: (i) a -10% haircut to hydrocarbon prices to all the years of the cash flow projections; (ii) a one-percentage point increase in the risk-adjusted WACCs applied to each Country of operations; (iii) the projections of hydrocarbon prices and CO 2 costs of the decarbo nization scenario Net Zero Emission 2050 (NZE 2050) elaborated by IEA. The valuesin-use of oil&gas assets calculated under the different stress-test scenarios exhibit in their entirety a headroom over the assets book values; however it is possible the incurrence of impairment losses as shown in the table below.",

The fair value of non-current financing receivables held for operating purposes of \u20ac2,285 million has been estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at rates ranging from 1.9% to 5.2% (1.8% and 5.1% at December 31, 2022).\n\nThe  recoverability  of  other  long-term  financial  assets  was assessed by considering the expected probability of default in the next twelve months only, as the creditworthiness suffered no significant deterioration in the reporting period.\n\nFinancing receivables held for non-operating purposes of \u20ac712 million (\u20ac1,266 million at December 31, 2022) related to restricted deposits  in  escrow  to  guarantee  transactions  on  derivative contracts mainly in the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio segment.\n\nFinancing receivables were denominated in euro and US dollar for \u20ac630 million and \u20ac2,503 million, respectively.\n\nSecurities for \u20ac19 million (\u20ac20 million at December 31, 2022) were pledged as guarantee of the deposit for gas cylinders as provided for by the Italian law.\n\nThe following table analyses securities per issuing entity:\n\n|                              | Amortized cost   | Nominal value   | Fair value   | Nominal rate of return (%)   | Maturity date     | Rating - Moody's                  | Rating - S&P   |\n|------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|\n| Sovereign states             |                  |                 |              |                              |                   |                                   |                |\n| Fixed rate bonds             |                  |                 |              |                              |                   |                                   |                |\n| Italy                        | 19               | 19              | 17           | from 0 to 2.65               | from 2024 to 2031 | Baa3                              | BBB            |\n| Others (a)                   | 25               | 25              | 25           | from 0.1 to 5.0              | from 2024 to 2027 | from Aa1 to Baa2 from AA+ to BBB- |                |\n| Floating rate bonds          |                  |                 |              |                              |                   |                                   |                |\n| Italy                        | 12               | 12              | 12           | from 4.62 to 5.07            | from 2024 to 2026 | Baa3                              | BBB            |\n| Total sovereign states       | 56               | 56              | 54           |                              |                   |                                   |                |\n| Other financial institutions |                  |                 |              |                              |                   |                                   |                |\n| European Bank of Investments | 5                | 5               | 5            | 3.98                         | from 2023 to 2024 | Aaa                               | AAA            |\n| Total                        | 61               | 61              | 59           |                              |                   |                                   |                |\n\n(a) Amounts included herein are lower than \u20ac10 million.\n\nSecurities having maturity within five years amounted to \u20ac55 million.\n\nThe fair value of securities was derived from quoted market prices.\n\nReceivables with related parties are described in note 36 - Transactions with related parties.",

This decrease was partially offset by the increase in the Enilive, Refining and Chemicals segment for \u20ac493 million.\n\nOther  payables  included:  (i)  payables  to  factoring  companies  in relation to the derecognition of Eni's tax credits for \u20ac728 million (\u20ac246 million at December 31, 2022); (ii) payroll payables for \u20ac287 million (\u20ac255 million at December 31, 2022); (iii) the amounts still due to the\n\ntriggering of the take-or-pay clause of the long-term supply contracts for \u20ac187 million (\u20ac284 million at December 31, 2022); (iv) payables for social security contributions for \u20ac110 million (\u20ac100 million at December 31, 2022).\n\nTrade and other payables were denominated in euro for \u20ac10,200 million and in US dollar for \u20ac10,421 million.\n\nBecause of the short-term maturity and conditions of remuneration of trade payables, the fair values approximated the carrying amounts.

These borrowing facilities are subject to the\n\nretention of a minimum level of credit rating. According to the agreements,  should  the  Company  lose  the  minimum  credit rating, new guarantees could be required to be agreed upon with the  European  Investment  Bank.  At  December  31,  2023,  debts subjected  to  restrictive  covenants  amounted  to  \u20ac732  million (\u20ac862 million at December 31, 2022).

In 2023, the main changes in the decommissioning provision related to: (i) revision of cost estimates relating to Oil & Gas assets completely writtendown or no more producing for \u20ac185 million; (ii) a \u20ac92 million cost  estimate  for  dismantling  and  removing  production  lines and auxiliary refining logistics structures for which management assessed  the  absence  of  economic  prospects  in  the  current scenario  of  refined  products,  as  well  as  lack  of  any  economic options of reconversion or reuse in a decarbonisation processes; (iii) for \u20ac33 million the decommissioning of a petrochemical plant and the consequent restoration of the site.\n\nInitial  recognition  and  changes  in  estimates  were  primarily recognized at assets in UK, Italy, USA and Libya. The provision also increased due to a reduction in discounting rates in relation to the downward movement of the Euro yield curve. The unwinding of discount recognized through profit and loss was determined based on discount rates ranging from 2.2% to 5.4% (from -0.3% to 6.1% at December 31, 2022). Changes in the scope of consolidation mainly referred to Exploration & Production segment for \u20ac87 million. Main expenditures  associated  with  decommissioning  operations  are expected to be incurred over a fifty-year period, with utilizations essentially starting after 12 months.\n\nProvisions  for  environmental  risks  included  the  estimated costs  for  environmental  clean-up  and  remediation  of  soil  and groundwater in areas owned or under concession where the Group performed in the past industrial operations that were progressively divested, shut down, dismantled or restructured. The provision was accrued because at the balance sheet date there is a legal or constructive obligation for Eni to carry out environmental clean-up and remediation and the expected costs can be estimated reliably. The  provision  included  the  expected  charges  associated  with strict liability related to obligations of cleaning up and remediating polluted areas that met the parameters set by law at the time when the pollution occurred but presently are no more in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations, or because Eni assumed the liability borne by other operators when the Company\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nacquired or otherwise took over site operations. The prerequisite for the recognition of these environmental costs is the evaluation of the probability of their being incurred and the possibility of estimating them reliably. Provisions related: (i) for \u20ac283 million to remediation activities at brownfield sites in Italy and costs related to groundwater treatments; (ii) for about \u20ac200 million to refining plants, depots, fuel distribution systems and oil pipelines; (iii) for \u20ac58 million to remediation activities at petrochemical plants. At December 31, 2023, environmental provision primarily related to Eni Rewind SpA for \u20ac2,391 million and to the Enilive and Refining business line for \u20ac739 million.\n\nLitigation  provisions  comprised  expected  liabilities  associated with legal proceedings and other matters arising from contractual claims, including arbitrations, fines and penalties due to antitrust proceedings  and  administrative  matters.  The  provision  was allocated on the basis of the best estimate of the existing liability at  the  balance  sheet  date  and  referred  to  the  Exploration  & Production segment for \u20ac290 million.\n\nProvisions for uncertain tax matters related to the estimated losses that the Company expects to incur to settle tax litigations and tax claims pending with tax authorities in relation to uncertainties in applying rules in force and referred to the Exploration & Production segment for \u20ac154 million. In particular, charges mainly relate to the dispute regarding the taxation of Italian local administrations on Eni offshore platforms located in common territorial waters.\n\nLoss  adjustments  and  actuarial  provisions  of  Eni's  insurance company Eni Insurance DAC represented the estimated liabilities accrued on the basis for third party claims. Against such liability were  recorded  receivables  for  \u20ac38  million  towards  insurance companies for reinsurance contracts.\n\nProvisions for losses on investments included provisions relating to investments whose loss exceeds equity and primarily related to Industria Siciliana Acido Fosforico - ISAF - SpA (in liquidation) for \u20ac168 million.\n\nProvisions for the Everen insurance coverage included insurance premiums which will be charged to Eni in the next five years by the mutual insurance company in which Eni participates together with other oil companies.\n\nBased on the outlay forecasts in relation to the progress of the restoration  and  decommissioning  activities  of  depleted  oil assets, the short-term portion of the risk provisions amounts to approximately \u20ac1.3 billion.",

Carry-forward tax losses were \u20ac12,063 million at Italian subsidiaries and \u20ac9,833 million  at  foreign  subsidiaries.  Deferred  tax  assets  gross  of accumulated write-downs recognized on these losses amounted to \u20ac2,895 million and \u20ac2,782 million, respectively.\n\nThe Italian tax law allows the carry-forward of tax losses indefinitely. Foreign tax laws generally allow the carry-forward of tax losses over a period longer than five years, and in many cases, indefinitely.\n\nA tax rate of 24% was applied to tax losses of Italian subsidiaries to  determine  the  portion  of  the  carry-forwards  tax  losses.  The corresponding average rate for foreign subsidiaries was 28.3%.\n\nAccumulated write-downs of deferred tax assets related to Italian companies for \u20ac3,975 million and non-Italian companies for \u20ac1,693 million.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  of  Italian  companies  of  \u20ac538  million  were restored in relation to an expected higher taxable income.\n\nTaxes are also described in note 33 - Income taxes.",

Eni  enters  into  financial  and  commodities  derivatives  traded  on organized  markets  (like  MTF  and  OTF)  and  into  commodities derivatives  traded  over  the  counter  (swaps,  forward,  contracts for differences and options on commodities) to reduce this risk in relation to the underlying commodities, currencies or interest rates and, to a limited extent in compliance with internal authorization thresholds,  with  speculative  purposes  to  profit  from  expected market trends.\n\nDerivatives fair values were estimated based on market quotations provided  by  primary  info-provider  or,  alternatively,  appropriate valuation techniques generally adopted in the marketplace.\n\nFair  values  of  non-hedging  derivatives  essentially  comprised forward sale contracts of natural gas for physical delivery which were not entitled to the own use exemption, as well as derivatives for proprietary trading activities.\n\nFair  value  of  cash  flow  hedge  derivatives  essentially  related  to commodity hedges were entered into by the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio segment. These derivatives were entered into to hedge variability in future cash flows associated with highly probable future trade transactions of gas or electricity or on already contracted trades  due  to  different  indexation  mechanisms  of  supply  costs versus selling prices. A similar scheme applies to exchange rate hedging derivatives. The existence of a relationship between the hedged item and the hedging derivative is checked at inception to verify eligibility for hedge accounting by observing the offset in\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nchanges of the fair values at both the underlying commodity and the derivative. The hedging relationship is also stress-tested against the level of credit risk of the counterparty in the derivative transaction. The  hedge  ratio  is  defined  consistently  with  the  Company's  risk management objectives, under a defined risk management strategy. The hedging relationship is discontinued when it ceases to meet the qualifying criteria and the risk management objectives on the basis of which hedge accounting has initially been applied.\n\nThe effects  of  the  measurement  at  fair  value  of  cash  flow  hedge derivatives are given in note 26 - Equity.

At December 31, 2023, the underlying commitment issued on behalf of joint ventures and associates covered by these guarantees was \u20ac6,077 million (\u20ac6,859 million at December 31, 2022).\n\nAs provided by the contract that regulates the petroleum activities in Area 4 offshore Mozambique, Eni SpA in its capacity as parent company of the operator has provided concurrently with the approval of the development plan of the reserves which are located exclusively within the concession area, an irrevocable and unconditional parent company  guarantee  in  respect  of  any  possible  claims  or  any contractual breaches in connection with the petroleum activities to be carried out in the contractual area, including those activities in charge of the special purpose entities like Coral FLNG SA, to the benefit  of  the  Government  of  Mozambique  and  third  parties.  The obligation of the guarantor towards the Government of Mozambique is unlimited (non-quantifiable commitments), whereas they provide a  maximum  liability  of  \u20ac1,357  million  in  respect  of  third-parties claims. This guarantee will be effective until the completion of any decommissioning activity related to both the development plan of Coral as well as any development plan to be executed within Area 4 (particularly the Mamba project). This parent company guarantee issued by Eni covering 100% of the aforementioned obligations was taken over by the other concessionaires (Kogas, Galp and ENH) and by ExxonMobil and CNPC shareholders of the joint venture Mozambique Rovuma Venture SpA, in proportion to their respective participating interest in Area 4.\n\nGuarantees  issued  on  behalf  of  third  parties  consisted  of:  (i)  a guarantee issued in favor of Gulf LNG Energy and Gulf LNG Pipeline on behalf of Angola LNG Supply Service Llc to cover contractual commitments of paying re-gasification fees for \u20ac184 million (\u20ac190 million  at  December  31,  2022);  (ii)  the  share  of  the  guarantee attributable to the State oil Company of Mozambique ENH, which was  assumed  by  Eni  in  favor  of  the  consortium  financing  the construction  of  the  Coral  project  FLNG  vessel  for  \u20ac161  million (\u20ac167 million at December 31, 2022).

The parent company guarantee still outstanding has been issued  to  guarantee  the  obligations  set  out  in  the  Shareholders Agreements and will remain in force as long as the investment is maintained; (iii) commitments in the Exploration & Production segment for the purchase of Neptune Energy Group Limited ('Neptune') for about \u20ac2 billion; (iv) commitments in the Plenitude business line for the purchase of renewable energy projects in Spain, United States and Italy for \u20ac107 million (\u20ac210 million at December 31, 2022).\n\nRisks  relate  to  potential  risks  associated  with:  (i)  contractual assurances given to acquirers of certain investments and businesses of Eni for \u20ac250 million (\u20ac262 million at December 31, 2022); (ii) assets of third parties under the custody of Eni for \u20ac879 million (\u20ac957 million at December 31, 2022).\n\n## OTHER COMMITMENTS AND RISKS\n\nA parent company guarantee was issued on behalf of Card\u00f3n IV SA (Eni's interest 50%), a joint venture operating the Perla gas field located in Venezuela, for the supply to PDVSA GAS of the volumes of gas produced by the field until the end of the concession agreement (2036). In case of failure on part of the operator to deliver the contractual gas volumes out of production, the claim under the guarantee will be determined by applying the local legislation. Eni's share (50%) of the contractual volumes of gas to be delivered to PDVSA GAS amounted to a total of around \u20ac11.4 billion. Notwithstanding this amount does not properly represent the guarantee exposure, nonetheless such amount represents the maximum financial exposure at risk for Eni. A similar guarantee was issued by PDVSA on behalf of Eni for the fulfillment of\n\nthe purchase commitments of the gas volumes by PDVSA GAS. Other commitments include the agreements entered into for forestry initiatives, implemented within the low carbon strategy defined by the Company, concerning the commitments for the purchase, until 2038,\n\nof  carbon  credits  produced  and  certified  according  to  international standards by subjects specialized in forest conservation programs. On February 5, 2021, EniServizi SpA (EniServizi) signed on behalf of Eni SpA (Eni) an addendum to the lease contract of a property to be built signed in July 2017 between Eni and the management company of the real estate investment fund owner of the new complex construction in San Donato Milanese (the Property), including the postponement of the delivery date of the property from July 28, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Subsequently, on June 16, 2023, the parties agreed to start the delivery procedures despite the absence of completion (scheduled for April 2024) of one of the car parks adjacent to the real estate complex. The inspections and preparatory controls to the delivery involved a series of activities to remedy defects and substantial discrepancies on the part of the Property to be carried out before delivery and still being completed, with consequent failure to complete the same by December 31, 2023. Eni has therefore applied to the Property the penalties for late delivery provided for in the Contract, supported by first demand sureties for the amount of \u20ac16.86 million, equal to approximately \u20ac30 million. In  addition,  Eni  is  is  exposed  to  non-quantifiable  risks  related  to contractual  guarantees  issued  in  case  of  certain  Eni  transactions, including loss of control of subsidiaries and divestment of businesses and investments, against certain contingent liabilities deriving from tax, social security contributions, environmental issues and other matters applicable to periods during which such assets were operated by Eni or as result of Eni's loss of control of formerly consolidated subsidiaries. Eni believes such matters will not have a material adverse effect on Eni's\n\nresults of operations and cash flow.\n\nEni has in place long-term natural gas supply contracts with the Russian  company  Gazprom.  During  2023  supplies  to  Eni,  which has regularly recognized the minimum contractual quantities, were effectively reduced to zero as part of various trade disputes between the parties. Eni, having fulfilled its contractual commitments, expects this situation to continue in 2024 also considering that the external context has not undergone any changes.\n\n## RISK FACTORS\n\nThe  following  is  the  description  of  financial  risks  and  their management and control. With reference to the issues related to credit risk, the parameters adopted for the determination of expected losses and the estimates of the probability of default and the loss given default have been updated to take into account the current",

The  'Guidelines'  define  for  each financial risk the key components of the management and control process, such as the target of the risk management, the valuation methodology, the structure of limits, the relationship model and the hedging and mitigation instruments.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the possibility that changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates or commodity prices will adversely affect the value of the Group's financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The Company actively manages market risk in accordance with a set of policies and guidelines that provide a centralized model of handling finance,  treasury  and  risk  management  transactions  based  on  the Company's departments of operational finance: the parent company's (Eni SpA) finance department, Eni Finance International SA - merged into Eni SpA in December 2023 - and Banque Eni SA, which is subject to certain bank regulatory restrictions preventing the Group's exposure to concentrations of credit risk, and Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA that are in charge to execute certain activities relating to commodity derivatives. In particular, Eni Corporate finance department (and Eni Finance International SA until the date of the merge) manages subsidiaries' financing requirements, respectively, covering  funding  requirements  and  using  available  surpluses  and all the transactions concerning currencies and derivative contracts on interest rates and currencies different from commodities of Eni, while Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA execute the negotiation of commodity derivatives over the market. Eni SpA, Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA (also through the subsidiary Eni Trading & Shipping Inc) perform trading  activities  in  financial  derivatives  on  external  trading  venues, such as European and non-European regulated markets, Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF), Organized Trading Facility (OTF), or similar and brokerage platforms (i.e. SEF), and over the counter on a bilateral basis with external counterparties. Other legal entities belonging to Eni that require financial derivatives enter into these transactions through Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA, Eni Global Energy Markets SpA and Eni SpA based on the relevant asset class expertise. Eni uses derivative financial  instruments  (derivatives)  in  order  to  minimize  exposure  to market risks related to fluctuations in exchange rates relating to those transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\ncurrency (the euro) and interest rates, as well as to optimize exposure to  commodity  prices  fluctuations  taking  into  account  the  currency in  which  commodities  are  quoted.  Eni  monitors  every  activity  in derivatives classified as risk-reducing directly or indirectly related to covered industrial assets, so as to effectively optimize the risk profile to which Eni is exposed or could be exposed. If the result of the monitoring shows those derivatives should not be considered as risk reducing, these derivatives are reclassified in proprietary trading. As proprietary trading is considered separately from the other activities in specific portfolios of Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets  SpA,  their  exposure  is  subject  to  specific  controls,  both  in terms of Value at Risk (VaR) and stop loss and in terms of nominal gross value. For Eni, the gross nominal value of proprietary trading activities is compared with the limits set by the relevant international standards.  The  framework  defined  by  Eni's  policies  and  guidelines provides that the valuation and control of market risk is performed on the basis of maximum tolerable levels of risk exposure defined in terms of limits of stop loss, which expresses the maximum tolerable amount  of  losses  associated  with  a  certain  portfolio  of  assets over  a  pre-defined  time  horizon;  limits  of  revision  strategy,  which consist in the triggering of a revision process of the strategy in the event of exceeding the level of profit and loss given and VaR, which measures the maximum potential loss of the portfolio, given a certain confidence  level  and  holding  period,  assuming  adverse  changes  in market variables and taking into account the correlation among the different  positions  held  in  the  portfolio.  Eni's  finance  department defines the maximum tolerable levels of risk exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in terms of VaR, pooling Group companies' risk positions maximizing, when possible, the  benefits  of  the  netting  activity.  Eni's  calculation  and  valuation techniques for interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks are in accordance with banking standards, as established by the Basel Committee for bank activities surveillance. Tolerable levels of risk are based on a conservative approach, considering the industrial nature of the Company. Eni's guidelines prescribe that Eni Group companies minimize such kinds of market risks by transferring risk exposure to the parent company finance department. Eni's guidelines define rules to manage the commodity risk aiming at optimizing core activities and pursuing preset targets of stabilizing industrial and commercial margins. The maximum tolerable level of risk exposure is defined in terms of VaR, limits of revision strategy, stop loss and volumes in connection with exposure deriving from commercial activities, as well as exposure deriving from proprietary trading, exclusively managed by Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA. Internal mandates to manage the commodity risk provide for a mechanism of allocation of the Group maximum tolerable risk level to each business unit. In this framework, Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets  SpA,  in  addition  to  managing  risk  exposure  associated with their own commercial activity and proprietary trading, pool the requests for negotiating commodity derivatives and execute them in the marketplace.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAccording  to  the  targets  of  financial  structure  included  in  the financial  plan  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  Eni  decided  to retain a cash reserve to face any extraordinary requirement. Eni's finance department, with the aim of optimizing the efficiency and ensuring maximum protection of capital, manages such reserve and its immediate liquidity within the limits assigned. The management of  strategic  cash  is  part  of  the  asset  management  pursued through  transactions  on  own  risk  in  view  of  optimizing  financial returns, while respecting authorized risk levels, safeguarding the Company's assets and retaining quick access to liquidity. The four different market risks, whose management and control have been summarized above, are described below.\n\n## Market risk - Exchange rate\n\nExchange  rate  risk  derives  from  the  fact  that  Eni's  operations are  conducted  in  currencies  other  than  euro  (mainly  US  dollar). Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be significantly affected by exchange rate fluctuations due to conversion differences on single transactions arising from the time lag existing between  execution  and  definition  of  relevant  contractual  terms (economic risk) and conversion of foreign currency-denominated trade  and  financing  payables  and  receivables  (transactional  risk). Exchange rate fluctuations affect the Group's reported results and net  equity  as  financial  statements  of  subsidiaries  denominated in currencies other than euro are translated from their functional currency into euro. Generally, an appreciation of US dollar versus euro has a positive impact on Eni's results of operations, and vice versa. Eni's foreign exchange risk management policy is to minimize transactional exposures arising from foreign currency movements and to optimize exposures arising from commodity risk. Eni does not undertake any hedging activity for risks deriving from the translation of foreign currency denominated profits or assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, which prepare financial statements in a currency other than euro, except for single transactions to be evaluated on a caseby-case basis.\n\nEffective management of exchange rate risk is performed within Eni's finance departments, which pool Group companies' positions, hedging the Group net exposure by using certain derivatives, such as currency swaps, forwards and options. Such derivatives are evaluated at fair value based on market prices provided by specialized infoproviders. The VaR techniques are based on variance/covariance simulation models and are used to monitor the risk exposure arising from possible future changes in market values over a 24-hour period within a 99% confidence level and a 20-day holding period.\n\n## Market risk - Interest rate\n\nChanges in interest rates affect the market value of financial assets and liabilities of the Company and the level of net finance charges. Eni's interest rate risk management policy is to minimize risk with the aim to achieve financial structure objectives defined and approved in management's 'Finance plan'. The Group's central departments\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\npool borrowing requirements of the Group companies in order to manage net positions and fund portfolio developments consistent with management plan, thereby maintaining a level of risk exposure within  prescribed  limits.  Eni  enters  into  interest  rate  derivative transactions, in particular interest rate swaps, to effectively manage the balance between fixed and floating rate debt. Such derivatives are evaluated at fair value based on market prices provided from specialized  sources.  VaR  deriving  from  interest  rate  exposure  is measured daily based on a variance/covariance model, with a 99% confidence level and a 20-day holding period.\n\n## Market risk - Commodity\n\nPrice  risk  of  commodities  is  identified  as  the  possibility  that fluctuations  in  the  price  of  materials  and  basic  products  produce significant  changes  in  Eni's  operating  margins,  determining  an impact on the economic result such as to compromise the targets defined  in  the  four-year  plan  and  in  the  budget.  The  commodity price  risk  arises  in  connection  with  the  following  exposures:  (i) strategic  exposure:  exposures  directly  identified  by  the  Board  of Directors as a result of strategic investment decisions or outside the planning horizon of risk management. These exposures include, for  example,  exposures  associated  with  the  program  for  the production of Oil & Gas reserves, long-term gas supply contracts for the portion not balanced by sales contracts (already stipulated or expected), the margin deriving from the chemical transformation process,  the  refining  margin  and  long-term  storage  functional  to the logistic-industrial activities; (ii) commercial exposure: concerns the exposures related to components underlying the contractual arrangements of industrial and commercial (contracted exposure) activities  normally  related  to  the  time  horizon  of  the  four-year plan and budget, components not yet under contract but which will be with reasonable certainty (commitment exposure) and the relevant activities of risk management. Commercial exposures are characterized by a systematic risk management activity conducted based on risk/return assumptions by implementing one or more strategies and subjected to specific risk limits (VaR, revision strategy limits and stop loss). In particular, the commercial exposures include exposures subjected to asset-backed hedging activities, arising from the flexibility/optionality of assets; (iii) proprietary trading exposure: transactions carried out autonomously for speculative purposes in the short term and normally not aimed at delivery with the intention of exploiting favorable price movements, spreads and/or volatility implemented  autonomously  and  carried  out  regardless  of  the exposures of the commercial portfolio or physical and contractual assets. They are usually carried out in the short term, not necessarily aimed at the delivery and carried out by using financial or similar instruments  in  accordance  with  specific  limits  of  authorized  risk (VaR, stop loss). Strategic risk is not subject to systematic activity of management/coverage that is eventually carried out only in case of specific market or business conditions. Because of the extraordinary nature, hedging activities related to strategic risks are delegated to",

With prior authorization from the Board of Directors, the exposures related  to  strategic  risk  can  be  used  in  combination  with  other commercial exposures in order to exploit opportunities for natural compensation between the risks (natural hedge) and consequently reduce the use of financial derivatives (by activating logics of internal market). With regard to exposures of a commercial nature, Eni's risk management target is to optimize the 'core' activities and preserve the  economic/financial  results.  Eni  manages  the  commodity  risk through the trading units (Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA) and the exposure to commodity prices through the Group's finance departments by using financial derivatives traded on the regulated markets, MTF, OTF and financial derivatives traded over  the  counter  (swaps,  forward,  contracts  for  differences  and options on commodities) with the underlying commodities being crude oil, gas, refined products, power or emission certificates. Such financial derivatives are valued at fair value based on market prices provided from specialized sources or, absent market prices, based on estimates provided by brokers or suitable valuation techniques. VaR deriving from commodity exposure is measured daily based on a historical simulation technique, with a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period.\n\n## Market risk - Strategic liquidity\n\nMarket risk deriving from liquidity management is identified as the possibility that changes in prices of financial instruments (bonds, money market instruments and mutual funds) affect the value of\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nthese instruments in case of sale or when they are valued at fair value in the financial statements. The setting up and maintenance of the liquidity reserve are mainly aimed to guarantee a proper financial flexibility.  Liquidity  should  allow  Eni  to  fund  any  extraordinary need  (such  as  difficulty  in  access  to  credit,  exogenous  shock, macroeconomic environment, as well as merger and acquisitions) and must be dimensioned to provide a coverage of short-term debts  and  of  medium  and  long-term  finance  debts  due  within  a time horizon of 24 months. In order to manage the investment activity of the strategic liquidity, Eni defined a specific investment policy with aims and constraints in terms of financial activities and operational boundaries, as well as governance guidelines regulating management and control systems. In particular, strategic liquidity management is regulated in terms of VaR (measured based on a parametrical methodology with a one-day holding period and a  99%  confidence  level),  stop  loss  and  other  operating  limits  in terms of concentration, issuing entity, business segment, country of emission, duration, ratings and type of investing instruments in portfolio, aimed to minimize market and liquidity risks. Financial leverage or short selling is not allowed. As of 31 December 2023, the rating of the Strategic liquidity investment portfolio was A/A-, in line compared to the end of 2022.\n\nThe following tables show amounts in terms of VaR, recorded in 2023 (compared with 2022), relating to interest rate and exchange rate risks in the first section and commodity risk (aggregated by type of exposure). Regarding the management of strategic liquidity, the table reports the sensitivity to changes in interest rate.",

Eni  defined credit risk management policies consistent with the nature and characteristics of the counterparties of commercial and financial transactions regarding the centralized finance model.\n\nThe Company adopted a model to quantify and control the credit risk based on the evaluation of the expected credit loss which represents the probability of default and the capacity to recover credits in default that is estimated through the so-called Loss Given Default.\n\nIn the credit risk management and control model, credit exposures are  distinguished  by  commercial  nature,  in  relation  to  sales contracts  on  commodities  related  to  Eni's  businesses,  and  by financial nature, in relation to the financial instruments used by Eni, such as deposits, derivatives and securities.\n\n## Credit risk for commercial exposures\n\nCredit risk arising from commercial counterparties is managed by  the  business  units  and  by  the  specialized  corporate  finance and  dedicated  administration  departments  and  is  operated based on formal procedures for the assessment of commercial counterparties, the monitoring of credit exposures, credit recovery activities and disputes. At a corporate level, the general guidelines and methodologies for quantifying and controlling customer risk are defined, in particular the riskiness of commercial counterparties is  assessed  through  an  internal  rating  model  that  combines different default factors deriving from economic variables, financial indicators, payment experiences and information from specialized primary info providers. The probability of default related to State Entities  or  their  closely  related  counterparties  (e.g.  National Oil Company), essentially represented by the probability of late payments,  is  determined  by  using  the  country  risk  premiums adopted for the purposes of the determination of the WACCs for the impairment of non-financial assets. Finally, for retail positions without  specific  ratings,  risk  is  determined  by  distinguishing customers in homogeneous risk clusters based on historical series of data relating to payments, periodically updated.\n\n## Credit risk for financial exposures\n\nWith  regard  to  credit  risk  arising  from  financial  counterparties deriving  from  current  and  strategic  use  of  liquidity,  derivative contracts  and  transactions  with  underlying  financial  assets valued at fair value, Eni has established internal policies providing exposure control and concentration through maximum credit risk limits corresponding to different classes of financial counterparties defined by the Company's Board of Directors and based on ratings provided for by primary credit rating agencies. Credit risk arising from  financial  counterparties  is  managed  by  the  Eni's  operating finance  departments,  Eni  Global  Energy  Markets  SpA,  Eni  Trade &  Biofuels  SpA  and  Eni  Trading  &  Shipping  Inc  specifically  for commodity derivatives transactions, as well as by companies and\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nbusiness  areas  limitedly  to  physical  transactions  with  financial counterparties,  consistently  with  the  Group  centralized  finance model.  Eligible  financial  counterparties  are  closely  monitored  by each counterpart and by group of belonging to check exposures against  the  limits  assigned  daily  and  the  expected  credit  loss analysis and the concentration periodically.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the Group may not be available, or the Group is unable to sell its assets in the marketplace in order to meet short-term finance requirements and to settle obligations. Such a situation would negatively affect Group results, as it would result in the Company incurring higher borrowing expenses to meet its obligations or under the worst of conditions the inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.\n\nEni's  risk  management  targets  include  the  maintaining  of  an adequate level of financial resources readily available to deal with external shocks (drastic changes in the scenario, restrictions on access to capital markets, etc.) or to ensure an adequate level of operational flexibility for the development projects of the Company. The strategic liquidity reserve is employed in short-term marketable financial assets, favoring investments with a very low risk profile. At present, the Group believes to have access to more than sufficient funding to meet the current foreseeable borrowing requirements due to available cash on hand financial assets and lines of credit and the access to a wide range of funding opportunities which can be activated through the credit system and capital markets.\n\nDue to the continuing volatility of commodity markets and the related financial commitment linked to the margin of commodity derivatives,  Eni  has  consolidated  its  higher  financial  flexibility achieved in the last year through the activation of liquidity swaps in addition to new financing lines acquired.\n\nEni has in place a program for the issuance of Euro Medium Term Notes up to \u20ac20 billion, of which \u20ac16.8 billion were drawn as of December 31, 2023. The Group has credit ratings of A- outlook Stable and A-2, respectively, for long and short-term debt, assigned by Standard & Poor's; Baa1 outlook Stable and P-2, respectively, for long and short-term debt, assigned by Moody's; A- outlook Stable and F1, respectively for long and short-term debt, assigned by Fitch. Eni's credit rating is linked, in addition to the Company's industrial fundamentals and trends in the trading environment, to the sovereign credit rating of Italy. Based on the methodologies used by the credit rating agencies, a downgrade of Italy's credit rating may trigger a potential knock-on effect on the credit rating of Italian issuers such as Eni. During 2023, Moody's revised Eni's outlook from Negative to Stable, due to the improvement in the Italian outlook.\n\nDuring  2023  Eni  renegotiated  and  expanded  its  portfolio  of committed credit lines through the stipulation of a sustainabilitylinked bond facility agreed with a pool of banks for \u20ac3.0 billion. At December 31, 2023 available committed borrowing facilities amounted to \u20ac9.1 billion.",

These obligations will require cash  settlements  in  future  reporting  periods.  These  liabilities are  valued  based  on  the  net  cost  for  the  Company  to  fulfill  the contract, which consists of the lowest amount between the costs for the fulfillment of the contractual obligation and the contractual compensation/penalty in the event of non-performance.\n\nThe Company's main contractual obligations at the balance sheet date comprise take-or-pay clauses contained in the Company's gas supply contracts or shipping arrangements, whereby the Company obligations consist of off-taking minimum quantities of product or service or, in\n\ncase of failure, paying the corresponding cash amount that entitles the Company the right to collect the product or the service in future years. The amounts due were calculated on the basis of the assumptions for gas prices and services included in the four-year industrial plan approved by the Company's management and for subsequent years on the basis of management's long-term assumptions.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  the  Group  principal  contractual obligations for the main existing contractual obligations as of the balance  sheet  date,  shown  on  an  undiscounted  basis.  Amounts expected to be paid in 2024 for decommissioning oil & gas assets and  for  environmental  clean-up  and  remediation  are  based  on management's estimates and do not represent financial obligations at the closing date.\n\n|                                     | Maturity year   | Maturity year   | Maturity year   | Maturity year   | Maturity year   | Maturity year        | Maturity year   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| (\u20ac million)                         | 2024            | 2025            | 2026            | 2027            | 2028            | 2028 and  thereafter | Total           |\n| Decommissioning liabilities (a)     | 679             | 497             | 468             | 482             | 968             | 10,912               | 14,006          |\n| Environmental liabilities           | 646             | 495             | 399             | 368             | 305             | 1,406                | 3,619           |\n| Purchase obligations (b)            | 21,032          | 18,024          | 17,887          | 14,800          | 12,519          | 66,415               | 150,677         |\n| - Gas                               |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |                      |                 |\n| Take-or-pay contracts               | 17,904          | 17,286          | 17,358          | 14,463          | 12,330          | 65,919               | 145,260         |\n| Ship-or-pay contracts               | 750             | 540             | 475             | 327             | 186             | 469                  | 2,747           |\n| - Other purchase obligations        | 2,378           | 198             | 54              | 10              | 3               | 27                   | 2,670           |\n| Other obligations                   | 4               | 14              | 2               |                 |                 |                      | 20              |\n| - Memorandum of intent - Val d'Agri | 4               | 14              | 2               |                 |                 |                      | 20              |\n| Total (c)                           | 22,361          | 19,030          | 18,756          | 15,650          | 13,792          | 78,733               | 168,322         |\n\n- (a) Represents the estimated future costs for the decommissioning of oil and natural gas production facilities at the end of the producing lives of fields, well-plugging, abandonment and site restoration.\n- (b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms.

Based  on  information  available  to  date,  taking  into account the existing risk provisions disclosed in note 21 - Provisions and that in some instances it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of contingency losses, Eni believes that the foregoing will likely not have a material adverse effect on the Group Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn addition to proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business referred to above, Eni is party to other proceedings, and a description of the most significant proceedings currently pending is provided in the following paragraphs. Generally, and unless otherwise indicated, these  legal  proceedings  have  not  been  provisioned  because  Eni believes a negative outcome to be unlikely or because the amount of the provision cannot be estimated reliably.\n\n## 1. Environment, health and safety\n\n## 1.1 Criminal  proceedings  in  the  matters  of  environment, health and safety\n\n- i)  Eni Rewind SpA - Crotone omitted clean-up.  In April 2017, the Public Prosecutor of Crotone initiated a criminal case relating to reclamation activities at the Crotone site. Meanwhile, the new clean-up project presented by the Company POB phase 2 was approved by the Italian Ministry for the Environment. By  a  court  order  of  January  10,  2022,  the  judge  of  the preliminary hearing of Crotone ordered the performing of an independent technical assessment on the environmental status of the site which ascertained that Eni Rewind had carried out the environmental activities in its own areas in compliance with the granted authorizations. A decision of the Public Prosecutor is awaiting following the filing of this supplementary consultancy.\n\n## ii)\n\n- Eni  Rewind  SpA  -  Illegal  landfill  in  Minciaredda  area,  Porto  Torres  site. In  2015,  the  Public  Prosecutor  of  Sassari  had initiated a criminal case for alleged crimes of unauthorized landfill  management  and  environmental  disaster  concerning the landfill area, near the western border of the Porto Torres site (Minciaredda area), managed by Eni Rewind which was charged of being liable pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. This decree states the responsibility of legal entities for the crimes committed by their employees acting on behalf of them. The remediation and clean-up plan of the site filed by Eni Rewind was granted the necessary administrative authorization in July 2018. Upon conclusion of the investigations, the judge of the preliminary hearing resolved that the natural persons allegedly liable of the environmental crimes and the legal entity would\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nstand trial. The court also resolved that Eni Rewind would be sued for civil liability. The region of Sardegna and other territorial administrations and NGOs were admitted in the proceeding as civil plaintiffs. Subsequently, Eni Rewind was acquitted due to the inability to proceed with the action against it pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01 and definitively excluded from the criminal trial.\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  criminal  proceedings  against  the managers of Eni Rewind, however, on November 13, 2022, the Court of Sassari pronounced an acquittal sentence for the non-existence of the crime of illegal waste and for not having committed the crime of environmental disaster.\n\nDue to the effects of the acquittal, the damage compensation claimed by the civil parties against the defendants and Eni Rewind were rejected. Since the public prosecutor and the civil  parties  have  filed  an  appeal  against  the  first  instance sentence, the judgement is still pending against the Second Instance Court.\n\n## iii)  Raffineria  di  Gela  SpA  and  Eni  Mediterranea  Idrocarburi\n\n- SpA - Alleged environmental disaster. A criminal proceeding is pending  in  relation  to  crimes  allegedly  committed by  the  managers  of  the  Raffineria  di  Gela  SpA  and  Eni Mediterranea  Idrocarburi  SpA  relating  to  environmental disaster,  unauthorized  waste  disposal  and  unauthorized spill  of  industrial  wastewater.  The  Gela  Refinery  has  been prosecuted for administrative offence pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. This criminal proceeding initially regarded soil pollution allegedly caused by spills from 14 tanks of the refinery  storage,  which  had  not  been  provided  with  double bottoms, and pollution of the sea water near the coastal area adjacent to the site due to the failure of the barrier system implemented as part of the clean-up activities conducted at the site. At the closing of the preliminary investigation, the Public Prosecutor of Gela merged into this proceeding the other investigations related to the pollution that occurred at the other sites of the Gela refinery as well as hydrocarbon spills at facilities of Eni Mediterranea Idrocarburi SpA. The proceeding is still ongoing.\n- iv)  Val d'Agri.  In March 2016, the Public Prosecutors of Potenza started a criminal investigation into alleged illegal handling of waste material produced at the Viggiano oil center (COVA), part of the Eni operated Val d'Agri oil complex. The Prosecutors ordered the house arrest of 5 Eni employees and the seizure of certain plants functional to the production activity of the Val d'Agri complex which, consequently, was shut down. From the commencement of the investigation, Eni has carried out several technical and environmental surveys, with the support of independent experts of international standing, who found a  full  compliance  of  the  plant  and  the  industrial  process",

The  Company  implemented  certain  corrective  measures  to upgrade plants which were intended to address the claims made by the Public Prosecutor about an alleged operation of blending which would have occurred during normal plant functioning. Those  corrective  measures  were  favorably reviewed by the Public Prosecutor. The Company restarted the plant in August 2016. In relation to the criminal proceeding, the Public Prosecutor's Office requested the indictment of all the defendants for alleged illegal trafficking of waste, violation of the prohibition of mixing waste, unauthorized management of waste and other violations, and the Company for administrative offenses pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. The trial started in November 2017. At the conclusion of the preliminary hearings, the Court of Potenza, on March 10, 2021, acquitted all the defendants in relation to the allegation of false statements in  an  administrative  deed,  while  in  relation  to  the  alleged administrative offenses, the Court found that there was no need to proceed due to the statute of limitations. Finally, in relation to the alleged crime of illegal trafficking of waste, the Court acquitted two former employees of the Southern District for  not  having  committed  the  crime,  convicted  six  former officials of the same District with suspension of the sentence and sentenced Eni pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01 to pay a fine of \u20ac700,000, with the contextual confiscation of a  sum of \u20ac44,248,071 deemed to constitute the unfair profit obtained from the crime, from which Eni will deduct the amount incurred for the plant upgrade carried out in 2016. Following the filing of the merits of the sentence by the Court, an appeal was promptly filed against all the condemnations. The appeal proceedings are underway.\n\n- v)  Proceeding  Val  d'Agri  -  Tank  spill.  In  February  2017, following the detection of an oil leak from one of the tanks of the COVA, a criminal proceeding for alleged environmental disaster  was  commenced  against  some  former  COVA officers, the Operation Managers in charge since 2011 and the HSE Manager in charge at the time of the accident. Eni was investigated too, in relation to the same alleged crimes pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  No.  231/01.  In  the  same year, the Company promptly equipped all COVA tanks with double bottoms, complied with all regulatory requirements, carried out all necessary remediation and safety measures to ensure continuity of oil activities, after a brief shutdown, and provided compensation for damages to all the landlords of areas close to the COVA, which were affected by a spillover. The Public Prosecutor, at the conclusion of the preliminary investigations,  required  the  indictment  for  the  employees and for Eni pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. At\n\nthe outcome of the preliminary hearing, the judge issued a\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nsentence not to prosecute the Company for the events up to 2015 because the fact was not envisaged by the law as a crime to claim a legal entity liable for. With reference to the  events  subsequent  to  2015,  the  judge  acknowledged the nullity of the request for indictment, thus returning the documents to the Public Prosecutor.\n\nFinally, the judge of the preliminary hearing approved to put on trial two Eni employees before the Court of Potenza, with the allegation of unnamed disaster, rejecting the request of the Public Prosecutor for qualifying the alleged crime as a new type of legal offence (environmental disaster). In the context of  this  proceeding,  several  parties  filed  an  application  to bring a civil action and, pending assessment of the requests for exclusion presented by the defense with respect to the latter, the Court issued a summons decree from Eni, as civilly liable and Eni duly reconstituted itself. The two proceedings against  natural  persons  -  i.e.,  the  ordinary  trial  and  the immediate trial - were then combined by the Court into a single trial, currently pending in the initial phase. As regards, the Company as an entity pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01, considering that another request for summons to the proceedings brought by the Public Prosecutor was once again rejected, the defense has filed a request for the dismissal of the dispute.\n\nAs regards, the Company as an entity pursuant to Legislative Decree  No.  231/01,  considering  that  another  request  for summons to the proceedings brought by the Public Prosecutor was once again rejected, the defense has filed a request for the dismissal of the dispute. The Public Prosecutor, however, issued a new request for indictment and a preliminary hearing has been set for next May 2024.\n\n## vi)\n\n## Raffineria  di  Gela  SpA  and  Eni  Mediterranea  Idrocarburi\n\n- SpA - Waste management of the landfill Camastra.  In June 2018, the Public Prosecutor of Palermo (Sicily) notified Eni's subsidiaries  Raffineria  di  Gela  SpA  and  Eni  Mediterranea Idrocarburi  SpA  of  a  criminal  proceeding  relating  to allegations of unlawful disposal of industrial waste resulting from the reclaiming activities of soil, which were discharged at a landfill owned by a third party. The Prosecutor charged the then chief executive officers of the two subsidiaries, and the legal entities have been charged with the liability pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. The alleged wrongdoing related to the willful falsification of the waste certification for purpose of discharging at the landfill. The charges against the CEO of the Refinery of Gela SpA and the Company itself were dismissed, while a request to put on trial the CEO of Eni  Mediterranea  Idrocarburi  SpA  and  the  Company  was approved. The proceeding is in progress before the Court of Agrigento, to which the proceeding has been transferred due to territorial jurisdiction.",

In February 2019, the Court of Syracuse at the request of the Public Prosecutor of Siracusa ordered the seizure of the Priolo/Gargallo plant as part of an ongoing investigation concerning the offenses of dangerous disposal of materials and environmental pollution, by the former plant manager of Priolo, as well as of Versalis, pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. The Public Prosecutor's thesis, according to the consultants, is that the seized plants had points of emissions that do not comply with the Best Available Techniques (BAT), therefore resulting in violation of the applicable legislation, which determined the annulment of the seizure of the plants in March 2019, evaluating the plant improvements made by Versalis even before the seizure. In March 2021, a notice of  conclusion  of  the  preliminary  investigations  was  thus notified, with the formulation by the Public Prosecutor of the allegations already previously stated.\n\n- viii)   Versalis SpA. Seizure of the treatment plant managed by IAS SpA - Priolo Gargallo. By the end of February 2022, the Public Prosecutor of Syracuse commenced a proceeding relating to alleged crimes of environmental disaster and violation of the legislation on discharges in relation to the industrial waste discharge system of the Versalis plant at the  Priolo  treatment  plant  managed  by  IAS  SpA  against two former directors of the Versalis plant in Priolo, as well as an employee of Versalis, having then a managerial role in Priolo Servizi. Similar allegations were charged against other  employees  of  the  companies  co-located  at  the industrial hub of Priolo Gargallo as well as of IAS SpA, while the legal entities Versalis, Priolo Servizi and the other colocated companies were under investigation pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01. On June 15, 2022, the Judge for  Preliminary  Investigations  ordered  the  seizure  of  the reclamation plant and the shareholding of IAS SpA, with the appointment of a judicial administrator of the assets subject to seizure. Subsequently, the investigations were enlarged to the current manager of the Versalis Plant and to the CEO of Priolo Servizi, who was an employee of Versalis SpA. Versalis SpA challenged the 'Integrated Environmental Authorization'  ('AIA')  issued  to  IAS  before  the  Regional Administrative Court of Catania only for the part in which the provision is interpreted as imposing new and different limits on discharge, compared to those contained in the authorizations originally granted to the Eni's subsidiary. In the meantime, the AIA issued for the management of the reclamation plant by IAS has been suspended by the Region of Sicily. Versalis therefore challenged before the TAR the provision to initiate a review of its AIA and, with a separate appeal, the provision of suspension of the AIA of IAS by the Region of Sicily. At the same time, the Public Prosecutor\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nof Syracuse raised the question before the Constitutional Court  about  the  legitimacy  of  a  governmental  decree that granted ISAB, one of the companies operating at the Priolo vertically integrated petrochemical complex, certain measures  intended  to  preserve  the  continuity  of  the production activity. Versalis therefore appeared before the Constitutional Court, which set the relevant hearing for May 2024. In the meantime, the proceeding remains pending under investigation.\n\n## ix)  Eni  SpA  -  Fatal  accident  Ancona  offshore  platform.  On\n\n- March 5, 2019, a fatal accident occurred at the Barbara F platform offshore of Ancona that resulted in the death of an Eni employee and the injury of two contractors. Two contract workers and the family of the Eni employee were all fully compensated. As part of the technical assessment of the incident, the Public Prosecutor of Ancona resolved to put under investigation two Eni employees. Also, the Company has been put under investigation as entity liable pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01, and two employees of the contractor company engaged in the work. At the outcome of the preliminary hearing, the Judge ordered the indictment for all the defendants and Eni. The proceeding is currently pending in the preliminary hearing phase.\n\n## x)  Raffineria di Gela SpA and Eni Rewind SpA - Groundwater  pollution survey and reclamation process of the Gela site.\n\nFollowing complaints made by former contractors, the Public Prosecutor of Gela commenced a proceeding for allegations of  environmental  pollution,  omitted  clean-up,  negligent personal injury and illegal waste management in the area of the Gela refinery, as part of the execution of clean-up of soil and groundwater as well as decommissioning activities in the area currently managed by Eni Rewind SpA, also on behalf of the companies Raffineria di Gela SpA, ISAF SpA (in liquidation)  and  Versalis  SpA  with  respect  to  the  efficiency and  efficacy  of  the  barrier  system.  The  Public  Prosecutor carried  out  various  checks  and  investigations,  and  then proceeded with a preventive seizure, with reference to the plants used for the remediation of the site's underground water currently managed by Eni Rewind as well as the plant areas intended for the implementation of the groundwater remediation project. A judicial administrator was appointed to manage those facilities.\n\nThe judicial  administrator  filed  an  initial  technical  report  in which he confirmed that the clean-up activities were being executed  in  compliance  with  the  legislation  and  with  a series  of  implementation  improvements  by  the  Company in  agreement  with  other  parties  in  charge.  The  Public Prosecutor's Office also issued the summons decree, and the proceeding is now pending in the hearing phase.",

With regard to the Mantua site where the  Company  is  executing  duly  authorized  environmental activities, in August and September 2020, the Public Prosecutor notified the conclusion of a preliminary investigation relating to several criminal proceedings. Several employees of the Eni's  subsidiaries  Versalis  SpA  and  Eni  Rewind  SpA  as well  as  of  a  third-party  company  Edison  SpA  were  notified of being  under  investigation.  Furthermore,  the  abovementioned  legal  entities  were  being  investigated  pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. The Public Prosecutor is alleging,  with  respect  to  some  specific  areas  related  to  the Mantua  industrial  hub,  the  crimes  of  unauthorized  waste management, environmental damage and pollution, omitted communication of environmental contamination and omitted clean-up. Following the filing of defense briefs addressed to the investigating authority, the case has been dismissed against some individuals and archived. The Public Prosecutor's Office then requested the indictment of the remaining defendants. During  the  Preliminary  Hearing,  the  MITE,  the  Province  of Mantua, the Municipality of Mantua and Mincio Regional Park were allowed in the trial as plaintiffs, while the companies Eni Rewind, Versalis and Edison were instead sued as civil parties and therefore they appeared in court. The Preliminary Hearing Phase ended with the provision of GUP, which ordered the indictment of all the defendants and of the abovementioned companies,  with  the  exception  of  a  former  employee  of Versalis and of two Edison employees. The proceeding is pending on the trial phase.\n- Eni SpA R&M Depot of Civitavecchia - Criminal proceedings  for groundwater pollution. In the period in which Eni was in charge of the Civitavecchia storage hub (2008-2018), pending the approval of a characterization plan of the environmental status of the site, the Company, in coordination with public authorities, adopted measures to preserve the safety of the groundwaters and to pursue the clean-up process of the site until its disposal.\n\nThe  Public  Prosecutor  of  Civitavecchia  contested,  among others, the former manager of the Eni fuel storage hub of Civitavecchia, the alleged crime of environmental pollution. Eni is under investigation pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. The first instance proceeding is underway.\n\n- xiii)  Eni SpA R&M Refinery of Livorno - Criminal proceedings for  incidents at work. On October 20, 2020, a notice was served at the Livorno refinery for Eni as entity subjected to preliminary investigations in the context of a criminal proceeding pending before the Public Prosecutor's Office of Livorno, in relation to an accident at work occurred in summer of 2019 at an electrical substation of the Refinery and as consequence two employees\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nwere injured. The Company provided compensation to the employee who suffered the consequences of the accident. The allegation is of aggravated personal injury while the Company is accused of being the entity liable pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01.\n\nIn  September  2021,  the  Public  Prosecutor's  Office  issued a  notice  of  conclusion  of  the  preliminary  investigations. Subsequently, the summons order was notified.\n\nFollowing  the  outcome  of  the  first  level  of  judgement,  on March 12, 2024, the Court issued a sentence of acquittal of the accused natural persons and of Eni SpA pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. Eni is awaiting the filing of the reasons for the sentence.\n\n- xiv)  Eni SpA R&M Genoa Pegli storage hub - Criminal proceeding  for crude oil spill - September 2022.  Following a crude oil spill that occurred at the Genoa Pegli depot on September 27, 2022, the Public Prosecutor's Office of Genoa instituted criminal  proceedings  for  the  alleged  crime  of  culpable environmental disaster, charged against four Eni employees, while the Company is charged with an administrative offense pursuant Legislative Decree No. 231/01. The proceeding is pending in the preliminary investigation phase.\n- xv)  Sannazzaro  Refinery  -  Proceeding  in  relation  to  alleged  criminal  environmental  pollution  and  discharge  -  Public Prosecutor's Office of Pavia.  A criminal proceeding is pending for  alleged  crimes  of  environmental  pollution  and  lack  of remediation  against  some  pro-tempore  managers  of  the refinery  located  at  Sannazzaro  de'  Burgondi  who  are  under investigation, as well as Eni SpA pursuant to the Legislative Decree  No.  231/2001,  in  relation  to  the  alleged  crime  of environmental pollution on site, with a seizure of the sewage treatment plant (TAE), and possible expansion of the area affected  by  possible  pollution  beyond  the  site's  hydraulic barriers.\n\nOn  November  28,  2023,  the  TAE  plant  was  released  from seizure.  The  proceeding  is  currently  pending  preliminary investigations, with three unrepeatable technical investigations underway.\n\n- xvi)  Eni  SpA  -  Pomezia  depot  -  Involuntary  environmental  pollution. A criminal proceeding is ongoing concerning an alleged  crime  of  pollution  of  the  groundwater  underlying the  fuel  depot  in  Pomezia  attributable,  according  to  the indictment, to product leaks from the tanks.\n\nThe Public Prosecutor's Office has appointed its consultants to carry out a technical review of the site to verify the state of environmental contaminations at the tanks. As a result of these assessments, two Eni employees as well as Eni SpA  pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  No.  231/01  were",

The proceeding is pending at the preliminary hearing stage.\n\n## 1.2  Civil and administrative proceedings in the matters of environment, health and safety\n\n- i) Kazakhstan disputes. Eni along with its co-venturers is currently party  to  several  disputes  with  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan, involving environmental matters, in relation to a sulfur permitting inspection  outcome,  cost  recovery  claims  under  applicable production sharing contracts and other issues. In March 2023, the Republic of Kazakhstan appointed its arbitrator in each of the disputes, formally starting the arbitration process. At the beginning of April 2024, the Republic has filed its statements of claims. Eni is in the process of assessing the merits of the Republic's claims and accordingly, at this time, it is not possible to reliably estimate the outcomes.\n- ii)  Eni Rewind SpA - Versalis SpA - Eni SpA (R&M) - Augusta  Harbor. The complex administrative dispute relating to the environmental status of the Augusta harbor commenced in September 2017 with a formal notice issued by the Ministry of the Environment against the companies operating at the Priolo  petrochemical  hub,  including  Eni  Rewind,  Polimeri Europa (now Versalis) and Eni (R&M), to carry out emergency safety  activities  with  the  removal  of  sediments  from  the harbor on the basis of an alleged assessment of responsibility as per a ruling of the Regional Administrative Court of Catania in 2012. The Ministry on various occasions reiterated its own assessment  about  the  environmental  responsibility  of  the companies co-located at the Priolo hub with respect to the pollution of the harbor and warned them against carrying out  unauthorized  remediation  activities.  Following  various meetings  held  with  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment,  Eni Rewind offered to define and to plan for certain environmental remediation activities basing on updated environmental data. The Eni's subsidiary also commenced activities to identify the persons responsible of the pollution of the harbor and their respective shares of liability.\n\nIn September 2020 Eni Rewind took part in the Investigation Services  Conference  convened  by  the  Ministry  of  the Environment and the competent bodies and presented a review of the environmental status of the Rada which stated that the pollution was attributable to industrial activities of prior periods and that it would not spread into the surrounding environment. Between the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024, the Catania  Regional  Administrative  Court  issued  a  ruling  on all the appeals presented by the operators, deeming them\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nas inadmissible, because the injunction does not constitute an act suitable for having legal efficacy with respect to the appellants. The Court did not take a position on the existence of the pollution or otherwise did not make any conclusion about  responsibility  regarding  the  pollution  of  the  harbor, limiting  itself  to  highlighting  the  fact  that  the  proceeding administration believes that the pollution is matter of fact.\n\n- iii)  Eni  SpA  -  Eni  Rewind  SpA  -  Priolo  -  Malformation  civil  lawsuits. In February 2022 Eni Rewind was sued before the Court of Syracuse for compensation for damages (\u20ac800,000 for each of the plaintiffs) by two citizens of Augusta (SR), who claimed to have been born with serious malformations due to spills of mercury from the chlor-soda plant in Priolo. Eni  Rewind  filed  an  appearance  in  court  filing  a  claim  and indemnification  against  Edison,  taking  into  account  that the chlor-soda plant was received by Eni group as part of the  Enimont  transaction,  therefore  in  a  period  following the alleged exposure to the mercury by the actors, which necessarily occurred between the years of birth 1972 and 1975.  Following  the  incorporation  of  Edison  SpA  and  the celebration of the respective hearings, the two proceedings are currently in the preliminary investigation phase.\n- iv)  Eni SpA - Eni Rewind SpA - Raffineria di Gela SpA - Claim for  preventive  technical  inquiry  and  judgments  on  the  merits.  In February 2012, Eni's subsidiaries Raffineria di Gela SpA and Eni Rewind SpA and the parent company Eni SpA (involved in this matter through the operations of the Refining & Marketing Division)  were  notified  of  a  claim  issued  by  the  parents  of children with birth defects in the Municipality of Gela between 1992  and  2007.  The  claim  called  for  an  inquiry  aimed  at determining any causality between the birth defects suffered by these children and any environmental pollution caused by the Gela site, quantifying the alleged damages suffered and eventually identifying the terms and conditions to settle the claim. The same issue was the subject of previous criminal proceedings, of which one closed without determining any illegal behavior on the part of Eni or its subsidiaries, while a further criminal proceeding is still pending. In December 2015, the three companies involved were sued in relation to a total of 30 cases of compensation for damages in civil proceedings. In May 2018, the Court issued a first instance judgment concerning one case. The  Judge  rejected  the  claim  for  damages,  acknowledging the arguments of the defendant companies in relation to the absence of evidence concerning the existence of a causal link between the birth defects and the alleged industrial pollution. The judgment has been appealed by the claimants.\n\nIn  June  2021  the  Civil  Court  of  Gela  issued  a  second judgment rejecting the claim for compensation, recognizing the validity of the arguments of the defendant companies",

The counterparties filed an appeal.\n\nIn  relation  to  the  first  appeal  promoted  against  the  first ruling  of  the  Court  of  Gela,  the  First  Instance  Court  of Caltanissetta  rejected  the  appeal  proposed  and  accepted the one proposed incidentally by the Eni companies involved, concerning the regulation of litigation costs relating to the first instance proceedings and the reported incorrectness of the compensation made therein since the legal requirements were not met. The counterparty appealed to the Third Instance Court.\n\n- v)  Val d'Agri - Eni / Vibac.  In September 2019 a claim was brought in the Court of Potenza against Eni. The plaintiffs are 80 people, living in different municipalities of the Val d'Agri area, who are complaining of economic, non-economic, biological and moral damages, all deriving from the presence of Eni's oil facilities in the territory. The Judge has been asked to ascertain Eni's responsibility for causing emissions of polluting substances into the atmosphere. The plaintiffs have also requested that Eni be ordered to interrupt any polluting activity and be allowed to resume industrial activities on condition that all the necessary remediation measures be implemented to eliminate all of the alleged dangerous situations. Finally, they are asking Eni for compensation for damages. At the end of the trial phase, the Judge submitted to the parties the proposal for an extra-judicial settlement,  fixing  a  deadline  to  present  further  proposals  on the matter.\n\nThe parties did not adhere to the conciliatory proposal. The proceeding is underway.\n\n- vi)  Eni SpA Eni Oil&Gas Inc - Climate change.  Between 2017 and 2018, seven lawsuits were brought in the California state court  by  local  government  authorities  and  a  fishermen's association  against  Eni  SpA,  a  subsidiary  (Eni  Oil  &  Gas Inc.)  and  several  other  companies,  aimed  at  obtaining compensation  for  damages  attributable  to  the  increase in sea level and temperature as well as to hydrogeological instability.\n\nThese proceedings, initially brought before the state court, were subsequently transferred to the federal court at the request of the defendants, who filed a specific request noting the lack of jurisdiction of the State Courts In 2019, the Federal court sent the cases back to the state court.\n\nThe defendants then appealed to the Ninth Circuit, challenging the  referral  order.  All  proceedings  have  been  suspended pending the appeal hearing before the Ninth Circuit.\n\nFollowing a complex and long procedural process, during the summer of 2023, the proceedings were definitively assigned to the state court of California. In June 2023 Eni SpA and Eni Oil & Gas Inc. presented together with the other defendant companies\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nwithout registered office in California a joint motion to suppress to  contest  the  jurisdiction  of  California,  on  the  assumption of  never  having  had  relevant  contacts  with  that  State  and therefore there is a shortage of so-called personal jurisdiction. In  November  2023,  the  plaintiffs  presented  a  petition  for coordination aimed at bringing together the preliminary phases of the proceedings before a single state court.\n\nOn  December  14,  2023,  the  fishermen's  association  that had promoted one of the disputes voluntarily renounced the case. On January 25, 2024, the competent judge accepted the  petition  for  coordination  and  recommended  that  of San  Francisco  as  the  deciding  state  court.  A  first  Case Management Conference will be held on April 4, 2024.\n\n- Eni Rewind SpA / Province of Vicenza - Clean-up process  for Trissino site. On May 7, 2019, the Province of Vicenza issued  a  warning,  imposing  on  certain  individuals  and companies  as  MITENI  SpA  in  bankruptcy,  Mitsubishi  and ICI the obligation to clean-up the Trissino site where MITENI carried out its industrial activity. Based on the analysis carried out  by  administrative  parties,  significant  concentrations  of substances considered highly toxic and carcinogenic were allegedly discovered in groundwater and in surface water at this site. The analysis carried out by the Province of Vicenza with the direct involvement of the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 reported  the  presence  of  these  substances  in  the  blood of about 53,000 people in the area. The Province warned some individuals, including a former employee who served between 1988 and 1996 as CEO of EniChem, a company that was subsequently acquired by Eni Rewind.\n\nEni Rewind was summoned as the 'successor' of EniChem in several appeals before the Regional Administrative Court as the majority shareholder of MITENI, as well as liable for the potential contamination of Trissino plant (together with other subjects). The Province extended the proceeding also to Eni Rewind,  which  filed  a  counterclaim  for  having  its  position taken out of the procedure.\n\nEni Rewind appealed to a Regional Administrative Court against the Province claims and orders. Eni Rewind is carrying out the environmental interventions and has made itself available to carry out - as part of the project approved by the territorial administrations in charge - further anti-pollution interventions on a voluntary basis and without giving any acquiescence with respect to the liability charges for the pollution by chemical agents. The proceeding is underway.\n\n- viii)  Eni SpA - Greenpeace Onlus, ReCommon APS and others  - Climate dispute. On May 9, 2023, the NGOs Greenpeace Onlus and ReCommon APS, together with 12 private citizens, summoned Eni, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and an Italian agency, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), before\n\n## vii)",

The  plaintiffs  claimed  economic losses and other damages and requested that Eni revise its decarbonisation strategy (for example by reducing by 45% its emissions by 2030 compared to 2020 levels, or other appropriate measures to comply with the Paris Agreement) as well as the cessation of any harmful conducts.\n\nOn September 21, 2023, Eni promptly filed its statement of  appearance  and  response  in  Court,  accompanied by  a  technical  report,  objecting  to  the  inadmissibility, untenability  and  total  unfoundedness  of  the  plaintiffs' claims. In the subsequent proceedings of January 5, 26 and February 6, 2024, the Parties filed further briefs and documents, taking a position on the opposing defenses. The first hearing of the case (with formal proceedings as requested by the Judge) was held on January 16, 2024. The judge reserved his rights on the requests proposed by the Parties. The decision is pending.\n\n- ix)  Eni SpA - NAOC / Egbema Voice of Freedom Association  -  Request  for  compensation  for  damages.  On November 30, 2023, Eni SpA was notified of a summons relating to a claim advanced by Pastor Nicholas Evaristus Ukaonu, by the Advocates for Community Alternatives association and by the Egbema Voice of Freedom association, for alleged damages deriving from constructions created by NAOC in Nigeria in the territory of the communities represented by the associations. The Pastor and the associations ask for joint compensation from Eni and NAOC for approximately \u20ac48 million in addition to the execution of works which, according to the plaintiff, would be necessary to avoid and contain flooding caused by constructions created by NAOC. The application submitted reiterates complaints made in past years, including in 2017 before the National Contact Point envisaged by the OECD Guidelines addressed to Multinational enterprises, where an ad hoc conciliation procedure was initiated which ended with an agreement between the parties.\n\n## 2. Proceedings concerning criminal/administrative corporate responsibility\n\n- i)  OPL 245 Nigeria.  In relation to the stipulation between Eni, the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 'FGN' and  another  international  oil  company  of  the  Resolution Agreement of April 29, 2011 relating to the 'Oil Prospecting Licence' of the offshore field identified in block 245, several investigations had been opened by the judicial authorities of Italy, UK and Nigeria concerning alleged crimes in the assignment of the block, including the crime of international corruption. The investigations involved some top managers of\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nEni and of the Company itself pursuant to Legislative Decree No.  231/01.  Eni  basing  also  on  the  findings  of  an  internal review of the case performed by an independent US legal consultant appointed by the Company's board of statutory auditors and by the Watch body considered the accusations groundless. The US Department of Justice carried out its own inquiry basing on the US FCPA and dismissed the case without any liability in 2019. The UK prosecutors dismissed the case due to lack of jurisdiction.\n\nThe proceeding in Italy established by the Public Prosecutor of  Milan,  which  had  requested  the  indictment  of  the  Eni managers involved and of the Company, was resolved in a manner totally favorable to Eni with a sentence of acquittal for all the defendants because the fact did not exist. The appeal proceedings, promoted by the First Instance public prosecutors, and by the FGN as civil party, concluded during 2022, reaffirming the first instance acquittal sentence which therefore became final.\n\nFinally, FGN, which in 2023 had promoted an appeal to the Third Instance Court against the ruling of the Court of Milan, requesting  its  annulment  with  referral  to  the  competent civil judge for the sole purpose of civil rulings and damage compensation, withdrew the appeal to the Third Instance Court, as it was inferred from a letter signed by the Attorney General transmitted after two hearings of the ICSID arbitration held in London. This arbitration was promoted by Eni after the acquittal sentence to protect the investment, requesting the forced conversion of the exploration license (OPL 245) into an extractive license (OML) as well as $700 million in damages for the mere delay (in addition to a reserve for possible damages). On January 20, 2020, Eni's subsidiary in  Nigeria  ('NAE')  was  notified  of  the  beginning  of  a  new criminal case before the Federal High Court of Abuja.\n\nThe proceeding, mainly focused on the accusations against Nigerian individuals (including the Minister of Justice in office in 2011, at the time of the disputed facts), has involved NAE and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited ('SNEPCO')  as  co-holders  of  the  OPL  245  license.  These Nigerian individuals were accused in 2011 of illicit corruption, which NAE and SNEPCO allegedly unlawfully facilitated. The beginning of the trial, originally scheduled for the end of March 2020, was postponed as a result of the closure of judicial offices in Nigeria due to the COVID-19 emergency and resumed at the beginning of 2021. During the proceedings, several witnesses were heard, mainly summoned at the request of the 'Economic and  Financial  Crimes  Commission'  ('EFCC').  Considering the  weakness  of  the  evidence  produced  by  the  EFCC,  the defendants presented a request for a declaration of no need to proceed, which the EFCC did not oppose, at least for the part relating to the accusations made against NAE, SNEPCO and the Minister of Justice. The proceeding is underway.",

The proceeding relates to the alleged lack of tax assessment of an energy product moved, under excise duty suspension, from a tank of the Taranto refinery.\n\nAt the end of the preliminary investigation phase, the former manager of the refinery and three other employees resulted under investigation for an alleged continued hypothesis of subtraction from the assessment of excise duties, due to multiple movements that took place in the period from June 30 to September 9, 2021, from the tank under investigation, the meter of which has been seized since October 13, 2021. The proceeding is underway.\n\n- ii)  EniMed  SpA  -  Criminal  proceedings  for  alleged  evasion  of  payment of the excise duty on flux products.  The criminal case originates from an investigation by the financial police of Ragusa which led to the verification in May 2020 of a series of incidents of theft of flux - an energy product used in suspension of excise duty - stolen directly from Enimed pipelines by arrested third parties flagrantly. Following these facts, the same police started a  verification  on  the  accounting  methods  for  the  flux  by  the Company in the period 2018-2020. As a result, the Company was accused of irregularities in the management of the diesel flux  with  alleged  subtractions  of  indirect  taxes  (excise  duties and VAT) equal to approximately \u20ac50 million. The competent Public  Prosecutor's  Office  (Gela)  for  its  part  has  promoted proceedings against the former CEO of Enimed (for the years 2018-2020) for the crime evading the payment of excise duties on energy products. The criminal proceedings were extended to two other Enimed employees for the same crime. As part of the same proceeding, third parties are being prosecuted for theft of flux,  a  hypothesis which instead sees Enimed identified as plaintiff. The proceeding is underway.\n\n## 4. Tax proceedings\n\n- i) Dispute for omitted payment of a property tax for some oil offshore platforms located in territorial waters. Tax disputes are  pending  with  some  Italian  local  authorities  regarding whether  oil  and  gas  offshore  platforms  located  within territorial boundaries should be subject to a property tax in the period 2016-2019.\n\nIn 2016 the tax regulatory framework changed due to enactment of  Law  No.  208/2015,  which  excluded  from  the  scope  of the  property  tax  the  value  of  plants  instrumental  to  specific production processes. In addition, the Finance Department recognized that offshore platforms met the requirements for\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nclassification  as  instrumental  plants  and  consequently  are excluded from the scope of the property tax (resolution no. 3 of June 1, 2016). Based on this interpretation, Eni did not pay any property tax for the years 2016-2019. However, the ruling of the Department of Finance is not binding for local authorities with taxing powers as recognized by the Third Instance Court and some of these have issued assessment notices for 20162019.  The  Company  filed  an  appeal  against  these  notices. Although Eni believes that oil platforms located in the territorial sea should be excluded from the tax base of the property tax on the base of the interpretation of the law in the light of the resolution of the Department of Finance, having assessed the risks of losing in pending disputes, the Company accrued a risk provision, the amount of which excludes fines since Eni's conduct was based on the administrative resolution, as well as taking into account the reduction of the tax base excluding the 'plant component' as provided by the law. The proceeding is still ongoing.\n\nLaw Decree 124/19 (enacted with Law 157/19) has established, starting from 2020, that marine platforms are subject to a new property tax that will replace and supersede any other ordinary local property tax eventually levied on these plants up to 2019. This rule has therefore sanctioned, starting from 2020, the existence of the tax requirement for these plants.\n\n## 5. Settled proceedings\n\n- i)  Eni  Rewind  SpA  (company  incorporating  EniChem  Agricoltura SpA - Agricoltura SpA in liquidation - EniChem  Augusta Industriale Srl - Fosfotec Srl) - Proceeding about the industrial site of Crotone. In 2010 a criminal proceeding started before the Public Prosecutor of Crotone relating to allegations of environmental disaster, poisoning of substances used in the food chain and omitted clean-up due to the activity at a landfill site which was taken over by Eni in 1991.\n\nThe  defendants  were  certain  managers  of  Eni  Group companies, who have managed the landfill since 1991. At the preliminary hearing of July 1, 2020, the Court acquitted all the defendants, some for not having committed the alleged crime and others for expiration of the statute of limitations. The Company has decided to appeal the decision to obtain an acquittal on the merits. Since the appeal has not been counterclaimed  by  the  Public  Prosecutor,  the  expected sentence by the Court can only be reformed in a way that is more favorable to the claimants.\n\n## ii)\n\n- Environmental claim relating to the Municipality of Cengio. \n\nIn  2008  the  Italian  Ministry  for  the  Environment  and  the Delegated  Commissioner  for  Environmental  Emergency in  the  territory  of  the  Municipality  of  Cengio  summoned",

In  February  2018,  the  Prosecutor  of  Milan commenced a criminal proceeding in relation to allegations of  associative  crimes  for  slandering  and  reporting  false information to a Public Prosecutor, with the aim to interfere with  the  judicial  activity  in  certain  criminal  proceedings involving, among others, Eni and some of its directors and managers. Among the natural persons under investigation, there was a former external lawyer and a former Eni manager, at the time of the facts holding a strategic position within the Company. The prosecutors seized relevant documentation and evidence at Eni's offices on several occasions, and the Company's control bodies performed independent internal audits of the matter with the support of external consultants. In May and June 2019, as part of the same proceeding, the Public  Prosecutor's  Office  of  Milan  notified  Eni  and  three subsidiaries (ETS SpA, Versalis SpA, Ecofuel SpA) of several requests  for  documentation.  At  the  same  time,  in  May 2019, Eni was notified of being investigated with reference to  the  crime  25  decies  of  Legislative  Decree  No.  231/01 for the crime referred to in the art. 377 bis of the criminal code (inducement to not make statements or to make false statements to the judicial authority).\n\nDuring 2020, a search decree was notified, with simultaneous notice of investigation, to the Eni Chief Services & Stakeholder Relations  Officer,  the  Senior  Vice  President  for  Security and  a  manager  of  the  legal  department.  Subsequently, the  Company was informed of the notification to  its  Chief Executive  Officer  of  a  notice  of  unrepeatable  technical investigations, with contextual notice of investigation aimed at allowing participation, through its technical consultant, in the scheduled technical operations of analysis of the contents of a phone device seized from a former Eni employee.\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the complex investigation phase, Eni SpA itself, the Chief Executive Officer, the Human Capital Director & Procurement Coordination and the Senior Vice President for Security and, were judged to be uninvolved in the matter.\n\nThe positions of Eni SpA itself, the CEO, the Director Human Capital & Procurement Coordination and the Head of Security of Eni Spa were therefore dismissed from the case. The Judge of the preliminary hearing also requested the dismissal of the charges for corruption between private individuals relating to Eni representatives and some external lawyers.\n\nThe  dismissal  decree  of  Eni  SpA  defined  that  the  alleged inducement to make false statements by Vincenzo Armanna in  the  context  of  the  criminal  proceeding  'OPL  245'  was based  solely  on  personal  statements  (Mr.  Amara,  Mr. Armanna  and  Mr.  Calafiore)  who  lacked  independence and whose statements had been proved to be groundless. Therefore, their statements were found to be false, leading to the indictment of the aforementioned natural persons due to the statements made against the Chief Executive Officer and the Human Capital Director & Procurement Coordination of the Company.\n\nFollowing the preliminary hearing, Eni Trading & Shipping in liquidation has finalized the agreement with the Prosecutor's Office on the application of the administrative sanction (socalled  plea  bargaining)  for  the  offense  referred  to  in  the articles  5,  paragraph  1),  letter  a)  25  octies  of  Legislative Decree No. 231/2001.\n\nThe  criminal  proceeding  is  currently  in  the  first  instance hearing phase. Eni, the CEO, the Director Human Capital & Procurement Coordination and two other Eni managers are offended persons for the slander crimes committed against them. Eni is also civilly liable for two charges.\n\n## iv)  Eni SpA (R&M) - Criminal proceedings on fuel excise tax.\n\nA criminal proceeding was definitely settled, which had been established by the Public Prosecutor of Rome in relation to alleged evasion of excise taxes in the context of retail sales in the fuel market in 2014. This proceeding, where Eni was an offended party, derived from unitization of three distinct investigations:  (i)  a  first  proceeding,  opened  by  the  Public Prosecutor's  Office  of  Frosinone  involved  a  third  company (Turrizziani Petroli) purchaser of Eni's fuel. This investigation was subsequently extended to Eni; (ii) a second proceeding concerning  an  investigation  by  the  Public  Prosecutor's Office of Prato, commenced in regard to the storage hub of Calenzano and related to theft of fuel through manipulation of the fuel dispensers, subsequently extended also to the Refinery of Stagno (Livorno); (iii) a third proceeding, opened by the Public Prosecutor's Office of Rome, concerned alleged missing payment of excise tax on the surplus of the unloading",

The Public Prosecutor of Rome claimed the existence of an alleged  criminal  conspiracy  aimed  at  recurring  theft  of  oil products at all of the 22 storage sites which were operated by Eni in Italy. A complex investigation activity was conducted by  the  Public  Prosecutor,  leading  to  the  seizure  of  some equipment used to measure volumes supplied to the markets. Eni was fully cooperating with the Prosecutor and thanks to its commitments obtained the revocation of the seizure measure\n\nso as to avoid shutting down production facilities.\n\nIn September 2018, Eni received, as an injured party, the notification of the schedule of hearing issued by the Court of Rome, in relation to criminal association and other minor claims, against several natural persons under investigation - including over forty Eni's former and current employees subject of a separate proceeding. After several procedural steps, finally during a preliminary hearing held in December 2019,  a  sentence  to  dismiss  the  case  in  relation  to  the association crime was issued for all the defendants.\n\nDuring  2019,  in  relation  to  tax  amounts  claimed  by  fiscal authorities,  a  settlement  was  reached,  and  Eni  made  the payments for the higher excise duties and other taxes for which it  was  not  possible  to  find  the  relevant  records  and book entries.\n\nFinally, at the hearing of January 31, 2023, the Monocratic Court of Rome issued an acquittal sentence for all defendants, former and current Eni's employees, for lack of evidence or acknowledging the statute of limitations in relation to the alleged tax evasion crimes.\n\n## v)  Eni SpA - Health investigation related to the COVA center.\n\nBeside  the  criminal  proceeding  for  illegal  trafficking  of waste,  the  Public  Prosecutor  of  Potenza  started  another investigation in relation to alleged health violations concerning the preparation of a Risk Assessment Document of the working conditions at the Val d'Agri Oil Center (COVA). The Public Prosecutor requested the formal opening of an investigation with respect to nine people in relation to the alleged violations.\n\nThe technical assessments conducted on behalf of Eni by international experts have ascertained the absence of any risk deriving from the COVA activity for the local population and  for  its  employees.  The  proceeding  was  ultimately dismissed  by  the  judge  for  preliminary  investigations,  in accordance with the request presented by the prosecuting Public Prosecutor.\n\n## vi)  Eni  Rewind SpA - The Phosphate deposit at Porto Torres\n\nsite. In 2015, the Public Prosecutor of Sassari commenced a  criminal  proceeding  in  relation  to  alleged  crimes  of\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nenvironmental disaster, unauthorized disposal of hazardous wastes  and  other  environmental  crimes  in  relation  to activities  performed  at  the  area  of  'Palte  Fosfatiche' (phosphates  deposit)  located  in  the  Porto  Torres  hub managed by Eni's subsidiary Eni Rewind SpA, Eni Rewind SpA was investigated pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01 stating the liability of legal entities. Then, Eni Rewind having been duly authorized performed certain works to improve the environmental status of the area under judgement.\n\nThe proceedings concluded on July 7, 2023, with a sentence of acquittal of the three managers of Eni Rewind in relation to the crime of environmental disaster, while the Company was discharged of any liability due to the expiry of the statute of limitations. The acquittal sentence has become final.\n\n## vii)  Eni  Rewind  SpA  and  Versalis  SpA  -  Porto  Torres  dock.\n\nIn 2012, the Public Prosecutor of Sassari initiated a criminal case  for  alleged  environmental  disaster  relating  to  the malfunctioning of the hydraulic barrier of Porto Torres site (ran  by  Eni  Rewind  SpA).  Eni  Rewind  and  Versalis  were notified  that  its  chief  executive  officers  and  certain  other managers were being investigated. The Public Prosecutor of the Municipality of Sassari requested that these individuals stand trial. The plaintiffs, the Ministry for Environment and the Sardinia Region claimed environmental damage in an amount of \u20ac1.5 billion. Other parties referred to the judge's equitable assessment. At a hearing in July 2016, the court acquitted all defendants of Eni Rewind and Versalis with respect to the crimes of environmental disaster. Three Eni Rewind managers were found guilty of environmental disaster relating to the period limited to August 2010 - January 2011 and sentenced to one-year prison, with a suspended sentence. Eni Rewind filed an appeal against this decision. The subsequent stages of judgment were concluded with the hearing on March 16, 2023, in which the Third Instance Court rejected the appeals and  confirmed  the  first-instance  sentence  of  one  year  in prison - with the benefit of conditional suspension - against a former manager and two former employees of Eni Rewind in  relation to the alleged crimes. The Court also confirmed the general sentence of the three defendants to compensate for the damage suffered by the plaintiffs, to be paid in a separate civil judgment, awarding the claimants just a small provisional amount.\n\n## Assets under concession arrangements\n\nEni operates under concession arrangements mainly in the Exploration & Production segment and the Enilive and Refining business line. In the Exploration & Production segment, contractual clauses governing mineral concessions, licenses and exploration permits regulate the access of Eni to hydrocarbon reserves. Such clauses can differ in each country. In particular, mineral concessions, licenses and permits",

Pursuant to the assignment of mineral concessions, Eni sustains all the operational risks and costs related to the exploration and development activities and it is entitled to the productions realized. In  respect  of  the  mining  concessions  received,  Eni  pays  royalties in accordance with the tax legislation in force in the country and is required to pay the income taxes deriving from the exploitation of the concession. In production sharing agreement and service contracts, realized productions are defined based on contractual agreements with State oil companies, which hold the concessions. Such contractual agreements regulate the recovery of costs incurred for the exploration, development and operating activities (Cost Oil) and give entitlement to the own portion of the realized productions (Profit Oil). In the Enilive and Refining business line, several service stations and other auxiliary assets of the distribution service are located in the motorway areas and they are granted by the motorway concession operators following a public tender for the sub-concession of the supplying of oil products distribution service and other auxiliary services. In exchange for the granting of the services described above, Eni provides to the motorway companies fixed and variable royalties based on quantities sold. At the end of the concession period, all non-removable assets are transferred to the grantor of the concession for no consideration.\n\n## Environmental regulations\n\nIn  the  future,  Eni  will  sustain  significant  expenses  in  relation to  compliance  with  environmental,  health  and  safety  laws  and regulations and for reclaiming, safety and remediation works of areas  previously  used  for  industrial  production  and  dismantled sites. In particular, regarding the environmental risk, management does  not  currently  expect  any  material  adverse  effect  upon Eni's Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  taking  account  of ongoing remediation actions, existing insurance policies and the\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nenvironmental risk provision accrued in the Consolidated Financial Statements.  However,  management  believes  that  it  is  possible that Eni may incur material losses and liabilities in future years in connection with environmental matters due to: (i) the possibility of as yet unknown contamination; (ii) the results of ongoing surveys and other possible effects of statements required by Legislative Decree  152/2006;  (iii)  new  developments  in  environmental regulation (i.e. Law No. 68/2015 on crimes against the environment and European Directive No. 2015/2193 on medium combustion plants); (iv) the effect of possible technological changes relating to future remediation; and (v) the possibility of litigation and the difficulty  of  determining  Eni's  liability,  if  any,  as  against  other potentially responsible parties with respect to such litigation and the possible insurance recoveries.\n\n## Emission trading\n\nFrom 2021, the fourth phase of the European Union Emissions Trading  Scheme  (EU-ETS)  came  in  force.  The  award  of  free emission allowances is performed based on emission benchmarks defined  at  European  level  specific  to  each  industrial  segment, except for the electric power generation sector that is not eligible for allocations for no consideration. This regulatory scheme implies for Eni's plants subject to emission trading a lower assignment of emission permits compared to the emissions recorded in the relevant  year  and,  consequently,  the  necessity  of  covering  the amounts in excess by purchasing the relevant emission allowances on the open market. In 2023, the emissions of carbon dioxide from Eni's plants were higher than the free allowances assigned to Eni. Against emissions of carbon dioxide amounting to approximately 16.03 million tonnes, Eni was awarded free emission allowances of 4.48 million tonnes, determining a deficit of 11.50 million tonnes. This deficit was entirely covered through the purchase of emission allowances in the open market.",

Considering that these incentives fall within the category of employee compensation, in accordance with IFRS, the cost of the plans is determined based on the fair value of the financial instruments awarded to the beneficiaries and the number of shares that are granted at the end of the vesting period; the cost is accruing along the vesting period.\n\nWith reference to the 2020-2022 Plan, the number of shares that will be granted at the end of the vesting period will depend: (i) for 25% on a market relative objective related to the three-year Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measured by the difference, over the three-year period, between the TSR of the Eni stock and the TSR of the FTSE Mib index (the Italian Stock Exchange), adjusted for the Eni's correlation index and compared with the same return recorded by each company of a group of Eni's competitors ('Peer Group' ); (ii) for 20% on an industrial relative objective measured in terms of annual unit value ($/boe) of the Net Present Value of proved reserves (NPV), compared with the same values recorded by  the  Peer  Group  companies,  with  a  final  result  equal  to  the average of the annual results over the three-year period; (iii) for 20%  on  an  economic-financial  absolute  objective  measured  by the organic Free Cash Flow (FCF) cumulated over the three-year period, compared to the equivalent cumulative value expected in the first three years of the Strategic Plan approved by the Board of Administration in the year of award and assumed unchanged over the performance period. The final calculation of the FCF is carried out net of the effects of exogenous variables, in application of a variance analysis methodology predetermined and approved by the Remuneration Committee, with the aim of enhancing the effective company  performance  deriving  from  management  action;  (iv) for  the  remaining  part  (35%)  by  an  objective  of  environmental sustainability  and  energy  transition  divided  into  three  absolute objectives over the three-year period, namely: (a) for 15% from a  decarbonisation  objective  measured  by  the  final  value  of  the intensity of upstream GHG emissions at the end of the three-year period (tCO 2 eq./kboe), compared to the equivalent value expected in the third year of the Strategic Plan approved by the Board of Directors  in  the  year  of  attribution  assumed  unchanged  in  the performance period; (b) 10% from an energy transition objective measured at the end of the three-year period in terms of Megawatts of installed electricity generation capacity from renewable sources compared to the equivalent value expected in the third year of the Strategic Plan approved by the Board of Directors in the year of attribution  assumed  unchanged  in  the  performance  period;  (c) for 10% on a circular economy objective measured in terms of the progress at the end of the three-year period of three relevant projects compared to the progress expected in the third year of the Strategic Plan approved by the Board of Directors in the year of attribution assumed unchanged during the performance period. With reference to the 2023-2025 Plan, the number of shares that will be granted at the end of the vesting period will depend: (i) for\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n25% on a market relative objective related to the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measured by the difference, over the three-year period, between the TSR of the Eni stock and the TSR of the FTSE Mib index (the Italian Stock Exchange), adjusted for the Eni's correlation index  and  compared  with  the  same  return  recorded  by  each company of the Peer Group; (ii) for 40% on an economic-financial absolute objective measured by the organic Free Cash Flow (FCF) cumulated over the three-year period, compared to the equivalent cumulative value expected in the first three years of the Strategic Plan approved by the Board of Administration in the year of award and assumed unchanged over the performance period; (iii) for the remaining part (35%) by an objective of environmental sustainability and energy transition divided into three absolute objectives over the three-year period, namely: (a) for 10% from a decarbonisation objective measured by the final value of the intensity of Scope 1 and Scope 2 upstream GHG emissions at the end of the three-year period (tCO 2 eq./kboe), compared to the equivalent value expected in the third year of the Strategic Plan approved by the Board of Directors  in  the  year  of  attribution  assumed  unchanged  in  the performance period; (b) 15% from an energy transition objective measured at the end of the three-year period in terms of Megawatts of installed electricity generation capacity from renewable sources and biojet fuel production capacity in terms of kton, both compared to the equivalent value expected in the third year of the Strategic Plan approved by the Board of Directors in the year of attribution assumed unchanged in the performance period; (c) for 10% from a circular economy objective measured in terms of percentage value of vertical integration of Agribusiness for the production of biofuels at  the  end  of  the  three-year  period  compared  to  the  progress expected in the third year of the Strategic Plan approved by the Board of Directors in the year of attribution assumed unchanged during the performance period.\n\nDepending on the performance of the parameters mentioned above, the number of shares that will vest free of charge after three years may range between 0% and 180% of the initial award. A 50% of the shares that will effectively be granted to each beneficiary in service will be subject to a lock-up clause of one year after the vesting date for the 2020-2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan and two years after the vesting date for the 2023-2025 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\n\nThe number of shares awarded at the grant date was: (i) 1,909,849 shares in 2023; with a weighted average fair value of \u20ac10.82 per share; (ii) 2,069,685 shares in 2022; with a weighted average fair value of \u20ac9.20 per share; (iii) 2,365,581 shares in 2021, with a weighted average fair value of \u20ac8.15 per share.\n\nThe  estimation  of  the  fair  value  was  calculated  by  adopting specific valuation techniques regarding the different performance parameters provided by the plan (stochastic method for both LongTerm Monetary Incentive plan), taking into account the fair value of the Eni share at the grant date (between \u20ac15.482 and \u20ac15.068 depending on the grant date for the 2023 award; between \u20ac12.918 and \u20ac14.324 depending on the grant date for the 2022 award;",

Furthermore, the Department focuses its actions on the development of carbon capture/transportation/storage/reuse and CO 2 compensation projects, as well as the Agri business line focused on developing renewable  feedstock  supply  chains  for  Eni's  biorefining.  The Department  incorporates  the  Company's  Oil  &  Gas  exploration, development  and  production  activities,  natural  gas  wholesale via pipeline and LNG, the above mentioned CCUS (and transport) projects, CO 2 offset projects (forests conservation (REDD+)) and agribusiness.\n- \u00b7 Energy Evolution, focused on the evolution of the businesses of power  generation,  transformation  and  marketing  of  products from fossil to bio and blue. The responsibility of this Department includes the growth of power generation from renewable energy and biomethane, the coordination of the bio and circular evolution of the Company's traditional and bio refining system and chemical business, and the development of Eni's retail portfolio, providing increasingly more decarbonized products for mobility, household consumption and small enterprises. The Department incorporates the activities of power generation from natural gas and renewables, the  Refining  and  Chemicals  businesses,  Retail  Gas  &  Power  and mobility Marketing. The companies Versalis (chemical products), Enilive (biorefining and  sustainable  mobility),  Eni  Plenitude, EniPower and Eni Rewind are consolidated in this Department.\n\nIn  relation  to  financial  reporting  purposes,  consistently  with  the provisions  of  the  applicable  accounting  principles,  management evaluated that the components of the Company whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CEO to make decisions about the allocation of resources and to assess performances would continue being the single business units which are comprised in the two General Departments,  rather  than  the  two  groups  themselves.  Therefore, in order to comply with the provisions of the international reporting standard that regulates the segment reporting (IFRS 8), the reportable segments of Eni as of December 31, 2023, are identified as follows:\n\nExploration  &  Production : research, development and production of crude oil, condensates and natural gas.\n\nGlobal Gas & LNG Portfolio (GGP) : supply and sale of wholesale natural gas via pipeline, international transport and purchase and marketing of LNG. It includes gas trading activities finalized to hedging and stabilizing the trade margins, as well as optimising the gas asset portfolio.\n\nEnilive,  Refining  and  Chemicals : supply and processing of crude oil to manufacture refined products (fuels, bitumens, lubricants etcetera) performed by the  Refining  operating  segment.  Enilive  is  the  Eni  new subsidiary of sustainable mobility and biorefining, which is operational as  of  January  1,  2023  following  the  in-kind  contibution  of  certain Group activities, engages in the manufacturing of biofules and the retail marketing of traditional and bio fuels, including the distribution of several energy carriers for mobility, including fossil and biological fuels and electric charging at service stations, as well as the offer of services connected to mobility such as the Enjoy car sharing, catering and in general the services at outlets. It also engages in the wholesale supplies of fules, bitumen and lubricants. The operating segment Refining and Enilive have been aggregated because the Chief Operating Decision Maker assesses the  integrated  margins  on  the  refining  and  sales  of fuels. Furthermore, the results of the Chemicals business line were aggregated in the segment because this operating segment presents similar economic returns and similarities in the industrial processes of  traditional  refining  activities.  Finally,  this  reportable  segment  also comprises  activities  of  trading  oil  and  products  aimed  to  execute transactions on the market in order to balance supply and stabilize and cover commercial margins.\n\nPlenitude & Power : retail sales of gas, electricity and related services, production  and  wholesale  sales  of  electricity  from  thermoelectric and renewable plants, services for E-mobility (installation of charging stations). It includes trading activities of CO 2 emission  certificates and forward sale of electricity with a view to hedging/optimising the margins of the electricity.\n\nCorporate and Other activities : includes the main business support functions, in particular holding, central treasury, IT, human resources, real  estate  services,  captive  insurance  activities,  research  and development,  new  technologies,  business  digitalization  and  the environmental remediation activity developed by the subsidiary Eni Rewind.  The  segment  also  includes  CCUS  projects,  agribusiness and  forestry  conservation  (REDD+),  under  development,  which were previously reported in the Exploration & Production segment. This  resegmentation:  (i)  reflects  the  circumstance  that  the  2023 economics of the businesses involved (CCUS, agribusiness and forest conservation) are currently not significant, without, among all, revenues generation; (ii) is functional to allow greater comparability of the E&P segment data with those of peers and take into account the presence of risk factors and returns as well as different production processes between the Exploration & Production activities and those associated with CCUS, Agri and forest conservation. The comparative periods have been restated in line with this reclassification.\n\nSegment  information  presented  to  the  CEO  (the  Chief  Operating Decision  Maker,  ex  IFRS  8)  includes:  revenues,  operating  profit  and directly attributable assets and liabilities.",

The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.\n\nExisting economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. In 2023, the average price for the marker Brent crude oil was $83 per barrel. Net proved reserves exclude interests and royalties owned by others.\n\nProved  reserves  are  classified  as  either  developed  or  undeveloped. Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nEni  has  its  proved  reserves  evaluated  on  a  rotational  basis  by independent  oil  engineering  companies 35 . The  description  of qualifications  of  the  person  primarily  responsible  of  the  reserves audit is included in the third-party audit report 36 . In the preparation of their reports, independent evaluators rely, without independent verification,  upon  data  furnished  by  Eni  with  respect  to  property interest, production, current costs of operation and development, sale agreements, prices and other factual information and data that\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nwere accepted as represented by the independent evaluators. Eni's net equity share after cost recovery. These data, equally used by Eni in its internal process, include logs, directional surveys, core and PVT (Pressure Volume Temperature) analysis, maps, oil/gas/water production/injection data of wells, reservoir studies and technical analysis relevant to field performance, long-term development plans, future capital and operating costs. In order to calculate the economic value of Eni equity reserves, actual prices applicable to hydrocarbon sales, price adjustments  required  by  applicable  contractual arrangements, and other pertinent information are provided.\n\nThe volumes and monetary values of the reserves of certain joint venture and affiliated companies are certified on their behalf in a similar manner by independent petroleum engineering companies and provided to Eni 37 .\n\nIn 2023, an independent evaluation of about 34% 38 of Eni's total proved  reserves  as  of  December  31,  2023,  confirming,  as  in previous years, the reasonableness of Eni's internal evaluations.\n\nIn the three-year period from 2021 to 2023, 77% of Eni's total proved reserves were subject to independent evaluation.\n\nEni  operates  under  production  sharing  agreements  in  several  of the foreign jurisdictions where it has oil and gas exploration and production activities. Reserves of oil and natural gas to which Eni is entitled under PSA arrangements are shown in accordance with Eni's economic interest in the volumes of oil and natural gas estimated to be recoverable in future years. Such reserves include estimated quantities allocated to Eni for recovery of costs, income taxes owed by Eni but settled by its joint venture partners (which are state-owned entities) out of Eni's share of production and Eni's net equity share after cost recovery. Proved oil and gas reserves associated with PSAs represented 55%, 54% and 58% of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 respectively, on an oil-equivalent basis. Similar effects as PSAs apply to service contracts; proved reserves associated with such contracts represented 2%, 2%, and 3% of total proved reserves on an oil-equivalent basis as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nOil and gas reserves quantities include: (i) oil and natural gas quantities in excess of cost recovery which the company has an obligation to purchase under certain PSAs with governments or authorities, whereby the  company  serves  as  producer  of  reserves.  Reserves  volumes associated with oil and gas deriving from such obligation represent 2%, 3% and 4% of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on an oil equivalent basis; (ii) volumes of proved\n\n- (35) For the past three years we have availed of the independent certification service of DeGolyer and Mac Naughton, Ryder Scott, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance and Sproule.\n- (36) The reports of independent engineers are available on Eni website eni.com section Publications/Annual Report 2023.\n- (37) In 2023 and 2022 Azule and V\u00e5r Energi.\n- (38) Includes Eni's share of proved reserves of equity accounted entities.",

In addition, changes in oil and natural gas prices have an effect on the quantities of  Eni's proved reserves since estimates of reserves are based on prices and costs relevant to the date when such estimates are made. Consequently, the evaluation of reserves could also significantly differ from actual oil and natural gas volumes that will be produced.\n\nveloped reserves of consolidated subsidiaries amounted to 1,662 mmboe (of which 740 mmboe of liquids and 992 mmboe of natural gas). Changes in proved undeveloped reserves were as follows:\n\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2022   | 2,423   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Transfer to proved developed reserves                 | (187)   |\n| Extensions and discoveries                            | 104     |\n| Revisions of previous estimates                       | 121     |\n| Improved recovery                                     | 0       |\n| Portfolio                                             | (42)    |\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2023   | 2,419   |\n\nIn 2023, total proved undeveloped reserves decreased by 4 mmboe (proved  undeveloped  reserves  of  consolidated  companies  increased by 31 mmboe, while those of joint ventures and associates decreased by 35 mmboe).\n\nMain changes derived from:\n\n- i) proved undeveloped reserves matured to proved developed reserves amounted to -187 mmboe, and were driven by progress in development activities, production start-ups and project revisions. The main reclassifications to proved developed reserves related to: V\u00e5r Energi (-63 mmboe) mainly in the fields of Breidablikk, Fenja, Tommeliten Alpha, Bauge and Frosk; Ivory Coast (-26 mmboe) in the Baleine field; Egypt (-24 mmboe) mainly in the fields of Zohr and Meleiha; Messico (-14 mmboe) in the Amoca and Mizton fields;\n- ii) new discoveries and extensions of +104 mmboe: (i) an increase of 50 mmboe of liquids,  mainly related to the investment decision for the Hail and Ghasha projects in United Arab Emirates; (ii)\n\nand from an increase of +54 mmboe of gas, mainly related to the investment decision for the Hail and Ghasha projects in United Arab Emirates (+42 mmboe) and Merakes East in Indonesia (+11 mmboe);\n\n- iii)  revisions of previous estimates (+121 mmboe) (including the effect of updating the gas conversion factor by +8 mmboe), of which 107 mmbbl of oil and 33 BCF of natural gas. Positive revisions mainly related to the advancement of development activities in Libya (+104 mmboe) mainly in Area D and Bouri, in Italy (+39 mmboe) especially in the Val d'Agri, and in V\u00e5r Energi (38 mmboe). Negative revisions mainly refer to a reduction in Egypt (-86 million boe) mainly on the Belayim field and for the reconfiguration of the Zohr phase 2 project;\n- iv) portfolio operations (-42 million boe), mainly relate to the sale of Alliance assets in the United States and from a reduction of share in the Ghasha concession in the United Arab Emirates.",

Future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements. Estimated future development and production costs are determined by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves at the end of the year. Neither the effects of price and cost escalations nor expected\n\nCONSOLIDATED\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfuture changes in technology and operating practices have been considered. The standardized measure is calculated as the excess of  future  cash  inflows  from  proved  reserves  less  future  costs  of producing and developing the reserves, future income taxes and a yearly 10% discount factor. Future production costs include the estimated expenditures related to the production of proved reserves plus any production taxes without consideration of future inflation. Future development costs include the estimated costs of drilling development  wells  and  installation  of  production  facilities,  plus the net costs associated with dismantlement and abandonment of wells and facilities, under the assumption that year-end costs continue without considering future inflation. Future income taxes were calculated in accordance with the tax laws of the countries in which Eni operates. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of FASB Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas (Topic 932). The standardized measure does not purport to reflect realizable values or fair market value of Eni's proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, hydrocarbon resources other than proved reserves, anticipated changes in future prices and costs and a discount factor representative of the risks inherent in the oil and gas exploration and production activity.\n\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows by geographical area consists of the following:",

Legislative Decree of November 29, 2018, No. 241, enforcing the EU Directive rules in the matter of tax avoidance practices, modified the definition of a State or territory with a privileged tax regime pursuant to art. 47-bis of the D.P.R. December 22, 1986, No. 917. Following the aforementioned amendments and the amendments to art. 167 of the D.P.R. December 22, 1986, No. 917, the provisions regarding foreign subsidiaries, CFC, are applied if the non-resident controlled entities jointly present the following conditions: a) they are subject to an effective taxation of less than half to which they would have been subject if they were resident in Italy; b) more than one third of the\n\nproceeds fall into one or more of the following categories: interests, royalties, dividends, financial leasing income, income from insurance and banking activities, income and sale from intra-group services with low or zero added economic value. As of December 31, 2023, Eni controls 5 companies that benefit from a privileged tax regime.\n\nThese 5 companies are subject to taxation in Italy because they are included in Eni's tax return.\n\nNo subsidiary that benefits from a privileged tax regime has issued financial instruments. All the financial statements for 2023 are subject to external audit.\n\nANNEX",

In the reporting period, our audit firm adopted International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italia 1) and, accordingly, maintained an overall quality control system which includes processes and procedures for compliance with ethical and professional principles and with applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nWe are responsible for expressing a conclusion, on the basis of the work performed, regarding the compliance of the NFS with the Decree and the GRI Standards. We conducted our work in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) - Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ('ISAE 3000 Revised'), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for limited assurance engagements. The standard requires that we plan and apply procedures in order to obtain limited assurance that the NFS is free of material misstatement. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in scope than those performed in a reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised, and, therefore, do not provide us with a sufficient level of assurance that we have become aware of all significant facts and circumstances that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\nThe procedures performed on the NFS were based on our professional judgement and consisted in interviews, primarily of company personnel responsible for the preparation of the information presented in the NFS, analyses of documents, recalculations and other procedures designed to obtain evidence considered useful.\n\nIn detail, we performed the following procedures :\n\n- 1 analysis of the relevant matters reported in the NFS relating to the activities and characteristics of the Group, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process used, in accordance with article 3 of the Decree and with the reporting standard adopted;\n- 2 analysis and assessment of the criteria used to identify the consolidation area, in order to assess their compliance with the Decree;\n- 3 comparison of the financial information reported in the NFS with the information reported in the Eni Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023;\n- 4 understanding of the following matters:\n- a) business and organizational model of the Group with reference to the management of the matters specified in article 3 of the Decree;\n- b) policies adopted by the Group with reference to the matters specified in article 3 of the Decree, actual results and related key performance indicators;\n- c) key risks generated or faced by the Group with reference to the matters specified in article 3 of the Decree.\n\nWith reference to those matters, we compared the information obtained with the information presented in the NFS and carried out the procedures described under point 5 a) below;\n\nANNEX",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of our audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercised professional judgement and maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore:\n\n- \u25cf We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; we designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks; we obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
