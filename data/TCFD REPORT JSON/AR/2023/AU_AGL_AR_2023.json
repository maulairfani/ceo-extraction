The required elements of the Directors' Report, including the Operating and Financial Review (OFR) as required by ASIC Regulatory Guide 247, are covered on pages 6-94. Commentary on AGL's financial performance specifically is contained on pages 6- 54 and references information reported in the Financial Report (pages 95-182). The Financial Report includes AGL Energy Limited (the Company or Parent Entity) and the entities it controlled at the end of, or during, the year ended 30 June 2023. Throughout the report, the consolidated entity is referred to as AGL or the Group.\n\nThe Directors' Declaration forms part of the Financial Report under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act).\n\n## Voluntary reporting frameworks\n\nThis report has been prepared with reference to the International Integrated Reporting Council's (IIRC) International Integrated Reporting Framework. This framework provides a useful basis for disclosing how sustainable value is created for our shareholders and other stakeholders over time. We have used the framework to demonstrate how consideration of risks and opportunities (both those arising from our business and those that exist in a broader operational context), our purpose and our values drive our strategy. We have also considered how the execution of our strategy creates value, applying a lens that is broader than financial performance alone.\n\nAGL follows the guidance provided by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures voluntary disclosure framework (TCFD Framework). Our FY23 TCFD Report details how we consider governance, risk management, strategy, and metrics and targets in relation to climate change. A summary of the TCFD disclosures is also included on page 29.\n\nThe disclosures in this report and the ESG Data Centre are aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards for 'Electrical Utilities and Power Generators' and 'Gas Utilities'. A SASB index is included in the ESG Data Centre which identifies the extent to which each SASB disclosure requirement has been applied.\n\n## Assurance\n\nThe Remuneration Report (pages 66- 92) and the Financial Report (pages 95-182) have been audited by Deloitte. Deloitte was also engaged to undertake limited assurance of selected key performance indicators included in the Business Value Driver scorecards (page 19 -33) in accordance with the Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements ASAE 3000 Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The key performance indicators are to be read in conjunction with the definitions in the Glossary (page 186). Full details of the assurance scope, process and outcomes are included in the assurance statement on page 179.",

As well as financial value, we consider value through six additional lenses as outlined in our ESG framework below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| CUSTOMERS                                                      | ASSETS                                                                           | PEOPLE                                                                                       | RELATIONSHIPS                                                 | ENVIRONMENT                                                              | BUSINESS  INTELLIGENCE                                |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Connecting our  customers to a  sustainable future             | Responsible  management of  and investment in  the assets of today  and tomorrow | Investing in and  protecting our  people, delivering  optimal outcomes by  living our values | Supporting  communities and  maintaining strong  partnerships | Minimising impact,  preserving nature  and ensuring  resource efficiency | Unlocking growth  through technology  and insights    |\n| Solutions to meet  customer needs                              | Transitioning our  energy portfolio                                              | Safe and healthy  workforce                                                                  | Engaged and  supported  communities                           | Future low-carbon  world                                                 | Enhancing customer  experience                        |\n| Energy affordability  and support  for customers  experiencing | Reliable and efficient  plant operations                                         | Performance  culture                                                                         | Collaboration for  Australia's energy  future                 | Environmental  stewardship                                               | Trading, operation  and risk management  capabilities |\n| Decarbonised  energy supply                                    | Repurposed  infrastructure  (energy hubs)                                        | Workforce  transition                                                                        | Strong business  relationships                                | Responsible  rehabilitation                                              | Secure assets  and data                               |\n\nUnderpinned by effective governance and ethical behaviour\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDriving financial value\n\n## Forward looking statements\n\nThis report includes information about AGL's performance for the period 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023. Any forward-looking statements are based on AGL's current expectations, best estimates and assumptions as at the date of preparation, many of which are beyond AGL's control. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees or predictions of future performance, and involve known and unknown risks, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the report.\n\n## Sustainable Development Goals & UN Global Compact\n\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 interconnected goals that form a global benchmark for achieving a sustainable future for all. While many of the SDGs intersect with our operations, the three SDGs that were most material to the strategy and operations of AGL over FY23 comprised SDG 13 - Climate Action; SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy; and SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It's been a year of significant transformation in which we reset market and stakeholder confidence and progressed our strategy to connect our customers to a sustainable future and transition our energy portfolio.\n\nDespite challenging market conditions and heightened volatility, our improved FY23 results reflect the strength of the underlying business: our low-cost generation portfolio, large and loyal customer base and effective risk management processes.\n\nWe're acutely aware of the broad cost of living pressures affecting our customers, including higher energy prices. In June, AGL committed to increasing customer support funding to at least $70 million over the next two years to support our customers to manage cost of living pressures.\n\nThis year we've made good progress with delivering on our strategy and Climate Transition Action Plan, which was endorsed by shareholders at our Annual General Meeting in November 2022.\n\nOur strategy includes transitioning our energy portfolio by exiting coal up to 10 years earlier than previously planned and an ambition to add ~12 GW of new renewable generation and firming capacity by the end of 2035.\n\nFollowing the closure of our coal-fired generation assets, AGL will be net zero for operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions with an ambition to be net zero for all emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. This plan represents a major step forward in Australia's decarbonisation journey and supports the transition to a lower carbon world aligned with the Paris Agreement goals.\n\n## Letter from the Chair and CEO\n\nTogether as AGL's Chair and MD & CEO, we're pleased to present AGL Energy's Annual Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 (FY23).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAGL's strategy is backed by our refreshed purpose, 'Powering Australian Life', and three new values: Bring on tomorrow; Can do. Will do; and Be Safe. Be Supportive.\n\nOur purpose reflects the critical role we play in enabling the everyday lives of our customers and millions of Australians. Our values, which our people helped create, will guide the decisions we need to make as we transition our business to a lower carbon future.\n\nWe've achieved several important milestones this year, most significantly the safe and respectful closure of the Liddell Power Station after almost 52 years of operation. This is expected to result in a reduction of eight million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually from FY24, compared to when the power station was operating. Importantly, we maintained our commitment to no forced redundancies and transferred around one hundred Liddell employees to our Bayswater Power Station.\n\nWe're focused on achieving our near term ~5 GW target of new renewables and firming capacity by 2030 and we've increased our pipeline by 60 percent from 3.2 GW to 5.3 GW. Our pipeline includes renewables such as solar and wind, as well as firming assets including batteries and pumped hydro.\n\nCommissioning has commenced on the 250 MW Torrens Island Battery and later this year, the 50 MW Broken Hill Battery is also expected to start operating. We've also signed a 15-year agreement with Tilt Renewables for the offtake of 45 percent of the energy from the Rye Park Wind Farm in New South Wales, the equivalent of 178 MW.",

        "page_content": "## Letter from the Chair and MD & CEO\n\nCentral to the delivery of our strategy is connecting our customers to a sustainable future through products and services that make it easy for them to decarbonise the way they live, move and work. Our new partnership with bp pulse will let customers charge their electric vehicle at an affordable rate when they are at home or on the road. We've also launched a new pilot program, Electrify Now, where customers can access the information and tools they need to make informed decisions about electrifying their homes.\n\nIn the Commercial and Industrial space, we're a leader in helping our customers achieve their sustainability goals and lower their energy costs through innovative solutions, such as solar systems, batteries and microgrids.\n\n## Business performance\n\nAfter a challenging first half due to a combination of volatile energy market conditions and outages, including the prolonged outage of Loy Yang Unit 2, we saw a strong improvement in the availability of our generation assets in the second half which lifted overall performance and earnings. The investment to improve flexibility at Bayswater Power Station and AGL Loy Yang has also led to improvements in the efficiency of the operation of these assets.\n\nOn the customer side, we've seen continued organic growth in customer services across both energy and telecommunications during a period of heightened market competition. We finished the year with an increase of 56,000 customer services from FY22, with a total of 4.3 million customer services. We've also maintained strong customer advocacy throughout the year with a positive strategic Net Promoter Score of +5.\n\nThe significant improvement in the performance of our generation assets in the second half, combined with the strong performance of our gas portfolio and customer business, has contributed to an increase in earnings compared with FY22.\n\nThis is reflected in our improved FY23 result with Underlying EBITDA of $1,361 million, up on FY22 by 12% and an Underlying Profit after tax of $281 million, up on FY22 by 25%. This result was in accordance with our FY23 earnings guidance, which was updated in June 2023.\n\nThe final FY23 dividend is 23 cents per share (unfranked) and the total dividend for FY23 is 31 cents per share (unfranked).\n\nWe've updated our dividend policy, which will target a payout ratio of 50 to 75 percent of Underlying Profit after tax (previous ratio was 75 percent of Underlying Profit after tax). This will be effective from the FY24 interim dividend.\n\nOur revised dividend policy enables us to strengthen the core business and execute our strategy, while providing strong returns to shareholders.\n\nIn June, we announced an expected positive financial outlook for the year ahead with an increase in FY24 earnings guidance reflecting sustained periods of higher wholesale electricity pricing and improved performance of the generation portfolio. Importantly, this strong business performance will support us to invest in the transformation of our generation portfolio.\n\n## Safety and People\n\nAs always, the safety of our people and the safe and reliable operation of our assets is our number one priority. This year, there were no serious injuries to employees or contractors, however our Total Injury Frequency Rate (TIFR) increased to 2.8 per million hours worked for employees and contractors, up 0.7 from 2.1 in FY22. This was driven by an increase in low-impact injuries. In response, we're increasing the focus on preventing common injuries before they occur and continuing to encourage employees and contractors to report all events that have the potential to cause an injury or fatality.\n\n## An engaged workforce with high levels of employee satisfaction and a strong sense of belonging is critical to the company's overall success and delivery of our strategy.\n\nPleasingly, after a period of uncertainty, we had a 10-percentage point improvement in our employee engagement score from 57% in FY22 to 67% in FY23. There is still more work to be done but the momentum is positive.\n\n## Board and Management renewal\n\nThe significant renewal of the Board and Management team in FY23 has brought a diverse range of skills and experience to the business.\n\nIn September 2022, we welcomed Miles George as a Non-Executive Director. Following the AGM in November 2022, we also welcomed Christine Holman, John Pollaers, Dr Kerry Schott and Mark Twidell as Non-Executive Directors.\n\nIt was an enormous honour and privilege for us to be appointed into our respective roles as Chair and Managing Director & CEO, and to have the opportunity to lead AGL at this pivotal time, supported by an expanded Board and renewed Management team.\n\nTogether, AGL's Board and Management team have navigated volatile and challenging energy market conditions as well as a complex energy transition to set AGL's future direction, which is aimed at enhancing long-term shareholder value while meeting community expectations.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nAGL will be a very different company over the next decade and will continue to transform as it has always done during its 185-year history.\n\nWith our strategy, purpose, values and highly experienced Board and Management teams in place, we're well positioned to play a leading role in Australia's energy transition. The challenge is significant, but the opportunities are enormous, and the positive momentum we have now means that it's an exciting time for the Board, the leadership, and our people.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\n|",

Strategy\n\nDuring FY23, AGL announced significant updates to our strategic direction and targets in September 2022 and June 2023.\n\nAGL will play our role in Australia's decarbonisation journey by connecting our customers to a sustainable future and transitioning our energy portfolio.\n\nAGL is taking action to accelerate Australia's transition to a lower carbon future. We are targeting an exit from coal-fired generation by the end of FY35, and have an ambition to supply ~12 GW of new renewable and firming capacity before 2036, with an interim target of ~5 GW by 2030. Our commitment to responsibly reshape our future energy portfolio represents one of the most significant decarbonisation initiatives in Australia.\n\nWe are progressing our plans to curate a demand-driven generation and firming portfolio to meet projected growth in electricity demand in the most cost effective and low risk manner. We also have an unwavering focus on continuing to ensure the availability, reliability and flexibility of our thermal asset fleet for the remainder of their operational lives. We are advancing our plans to repurpose our thermal generation sites into low-carbon energy hubs in the Hunter, Latrobe Valley and Torrens Island, connecting industrial partners into a circular economy at the sites.   Further information on our asset transition plans, development pipeline, and energy hub progress, is available in the Assets scorecard.\n\nWe are also committed to helping our customers decarbonise the way they live, move and work. Our Customer Markets strategy focuses on three areas: strengthening our core business while supporting our customers; capturing growth in new value pools particularly those arising from decarbonisation and electrification; and leveraging technology and digital to unlock efficiency and growth through retail transformation. Through execution of this strategy we intend to be well positioned to capture the projected increase in electricity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndemand through electrification, as well as future population growth in major capital cities as we shift the focus of our business model from being a commodity supplier to scaling 'Energy as a Service,' which includes asset orchestration, hardware provision, e-mobility solutions such as leasing and charging, decentralised energy, and asset monitoring and management. Further information is available in the Customer scorecard.\n\nOur people are critical to our success, and we are committed to building the capabilities and culture required to deliver our strategy. We also recognise the important role of technology in unlocking growth, enhancing customer experience and strengthening our trading operations and risk management capabilities.\n\nWe are also focused on ensuring that ESG considerations are part of our decision making. During FY23, AGL's climate strategy was released through our inaugural Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP). As well as key decarbonisation targets across a 12-year roadmap, the CTAP includes our commitment to continue to advocate for a responsible transition that balances energy reliability and affordability with the need to decarbonise, and our commitment to work with and support our people and communities through a responsible and orderly transition. The CTAP was endorsed by shareholders at the 2022 Annual General Meeting.  A summary of the progress made against our CTAP commitments over FY23 is set out in our FY23 TCFD Report, available on our website .\n\nWe are also committed to embracing other aspects of AGL's ESG framework, and our ESG performance over FY23 is available in our Business Value Driver scorecards from page 19 and in our ESG Data Centre .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

From FY24.\n\n## 2.2 Management of strategic risks\n\nAGL is committed to ensuring that risk management practices are embedded into all business processes and operations in order to drive consistent, effective and accountable action, decision-making and management practices. The Board has adopted a Risk Management Policy that sets out AGL's objectives for risk management and clearly articulates the responsibilities of all AGL's people in relation to the management of risks.\n\nAGL's enterprise-wide risk management program, which is aligned with the principles and requirements of the international standard for risk management (ISO 31000), is detailed in our 2023 Corporate Governance Statement at agl.com.au/corporategovernance . Through this program, we identify factors that are critical to the successful delivery of our strategy and our ability to continue creating value into the future.\n\nAGL's Statement of Risk Appetite, which was last approved by the Board in June 2023, supports our commitment to optimising risk management practices in pursuit of AGL's strategic priorities.\n\nAGL undertakes a comprehensive process throughout the year to identify, monitor, assess and report on the key risks to achieving our strategic priorities over the medium term to long term. We define these as Tier 1 Strategic Risks. Risk mitigation strategies are in place for each of these risks, and the risks have been overseen throughout FY23 by AGL's Audit & Risk Management Committee.\n\n## 2.2.1 FY23 Tier 1 Strategic Risks\n\nAGL is subject to a broad range of risks reflecting our ownership and operation of critical infrastructure, as well as being one of Australia's largest providers of essential services. Various aspects of the Australian energy system, and subsequently of AGL's business operations, have material strategic and operational risks, with the energy industry continuing to face significant challenges on numerous fronts over the past 12 months.\n\nDelivery of our accelerated decarbonisation and transition strategy (as outlined above) creates new risks for AGL, and for AGL to be successful, will require new capabilities, access to sufficient capital, strong social licence, and support from various stakeholders. AGL's ability to achieve our strategic objectives may also be affected by factors outside of our direct control, including timely access to required licences, permits, and transmission network connections, constraints on key capabilities across the labour market and market demand for limited global skillsets, as well as supply chain constraints associated with required equipment and materials.\n\nWhile progressing our strategy, we continue to operate within a complex operating environment. The global and Australian economies continue to be impacted by inflationary pressures which are increasing the costs of doing business and creating affordability challenges for our customers. While wholesale energy prices have moderated from the very high prices experienced in late 2022, they remain higher than historical averages, and across FY23 have been highly volatile. Our ability to effectively manage changing and volatile energy pricing is key to delivering on our strategic objectives and earnings outlook.",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\nIn addition to contributing to the current inflationary outlook, geopolitical events are also exacerbating an already heightened threat landscape relating to cyber security. While AGL has systems in place to protect, detect, contain and respond to cyber-attacks and information security threats, the nature and sophistication of cyber threats continue to evolve.\n\nTechnology is also evolving at a rapid rate, creating both opportunities and threats for AGL. To deliver on our strategy to lead the energy transition, we need to continue to invest in enhancing and protecting our core business, while harnessing new and emerging generation technologies and electrification-related value pools.\n\nAs a key contributor to AGL's earnings, the safe and reliable operation of our key generation plants will continue to be critical, both for AGL's ongoing financial performance and to fund our decarbonisation strategy; and for the NEM more broadly in supporting reliable and affordable energy during Australia's energy transition. AGL continues to focus on thermal asset safety, reliability and flexibility.\n\nAs a result of the complex environment AGL is currently operating within, the majority of AGL's strategic risks remain elevated. The key changes identified in AGL's strategic risk profile over FY23 are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The Organisational Culture and Capability risk has reduced, reflecting the increased clarity of AGL's strategic direction, new purpose and values, and finalisation of key Board and management appointments.\n- \u00b7 The Investment Planning and Execution risk has increased recognising that delivering on our strategy to be a leader in the energy transition and execute our decarbonisation pathway is a significant and complex task.\n\nThe Tier 1 Strategic Risks for FY23 are summarised in the following table.\n\n|",

Key Operating Metrics and Business Value Drivers\n\nThe following sections summarise the performance of AGL's business during FY23. Performance is considered through two dimensions:\n\n- \u00b7 Key Operating Metrics - These performance measures have a direct influence on AGL's FY23 financial performance. The six key operating metrics comprise:\n- -Customer numbers and churn;\n- -Customer energy demand;\n- -Wholesale electricity prices;\n- -Generation volumes;\n- -Fuel costs; and\n- -Operating costs and capital expenditure.\n- \u00b7 Business Value Drivers - These performance measures are critical to long-term value creation, however may have a less direct relationship to annual performance, and/or may influence financial performance over the longer term. The performance measures are divided into scorecards for each of AGL's identified Business Value Drivers.\n\n## 3.1 Key Operating Metrics performance\n\n## 3.1.1 Customer numbers and churn\n\nTotal services to customers increased 1.3% to 4.271 million, from 4.215 million as at 30 June 2022. This increase of 56,000 was driven by strong growth in telecommunication and gas services, with a slight decrease in electricity services due to increased competition and churn in the second half of the year.\n\nConsumer Electricity services decreased by 4,000 in a challenging market with New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland decreasing by 25,000, partly offset by growth of 21,000 services in Victoria. Consumer Gas services increased by 14,000 services, with growth of 10,000 services in Victoria and 13,000 services in Western Australia, whilst New South Wales decreased by 12,000 services and the remaining states were relatively flat to FY22.\n\nTotal Telecommunication services increased 18.7% to 292,000 due to continued growth in mobile and internet plans.\n\n| Services to customers                | FY23 ('000)   | FY22 ('000)   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Consumer Electricity                 | 2,439         | 2,443         |\n| New South Wales                      | 890           | 908           |\n| Victoria                             | 758           | 737           |\n| South Australia                      | 356           | 361           |\n| Queensland                           | 435           | 437           |\n| Consumer Gas                         | 1,524         | 1,510         |\n| New South Wales                      | 606           | 618           |\n| Victoria                             | 592           | 582           |\n| South Australia                      | 139           | 136           |\n| Queensland                           | 88            | 88            |\n| Western Australia                    | 99            | 86            |\n| Total Consumer energy services       | 3,963         | 3,953         |\n| Dual fuel services                   | 2,314         | 2,304         |\n| Average consumer energy services     | 3,979         | 3,963         |\n| Total Large Business energy services | 16            | 16            |\n| Total energy services                | 3,979         | 3,969         |\n| Total Telecommunication services     | 292           | 246           |\n| Total services to customers 1        | 4,271         | 4,215         |\n\nMarket churn rose sharply in the first quarter due to the impact of higher wholesale prices, price changes and Retailer of Last Resort (RoLR) events with churn stabilising across the remainder of the year. AGL churn remains lower than Rest of Market due to strong customer retention in the second half of the year and improved customer experience. AGL churn was 14.2% (an improvement of 1.4 ppts from 15.6% at 30 June 2022), and Rest of Market churn was 18.7% (an improvement of 0.9 ppts from 19.6% at 30 June 2022). The gap between AGL and Rest of Market was 4.5 ppts, an improvement from 4.0 ppts at 30 June 2022.\n\n|",

Wholesale electricity prices were also impacted by the market suspension declared in June 2022, when AEMO intervened in the NEM spot market in response to sustained high prices, initially triggering administered pricing followed by market suspension in response to challenges in market operation.\n\nTowards the end of calendar year 2022 spot prices decreased driven by increased renewable generation, with rooftop and commercial solar increasing generation capacity, as well as the Federal Government price cap intervention in domestic coal and gas markets, setting a price of $12/GJ on gas and $125/tonne on coal announced in December 2022. Electricity forward curves have reduced since the introduction of these caps, especially in New South Wales and Queensland.\n\nAGL's generation assets are exposed to the changes in electricity spot prices. This exposure is hedged with customer load and financial derivatives. Customer contracted prices in FY23 were higher than FY22 in all states except Victoria. AGL's practice of resetting prices to consumer customers annually on a rolling forward curve and re-contracting Large Business customer contracts and derivatives on a two to three year forward time frame, means the current higher prices will translate into higher contracted prices in the future.",

The reduction in generation was also impacted by the Unit 2 and other outages at AGL Loy Yang. Bayswater Power Station was operated more flexibly during periods of lower demand and to support more stable Liddell Power Station running as the units approached closure. Lower Gas generation was mainly due to market conditions in South Australia whilst higher Renewable generation at the Victorian hydroelectric power stations was driven by significant rainfall in the region, partly offset by lower wind generation due to outages at Macarthur Wind Farm located in Victoria.\n\nFY23\n\nFY22\n\n| Pool generation volumes                 | GWh    | GWh    |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| AGL Macquarie (Bayswater Power Station) | 12,916 | 13,574 |\n| AGL Loy Yang Power Station              | 12,418 | 13,417 |\n| AGL Macquarie (Liddell Power Station)   | 5,020  | 7,336  |\n| Gas generation                          | 1,217  | 1,457  |\n| Renewable generation                    | 5,366  | 4,971  |\n| Total pool generation volumes           | 36,937 | 40,755 |\n\n## 3.1.5 Fuel costs\n\nTotal fuel costs for the electricity generation portfolio were $(861) million, up 4.6%.\n\n- \u00b7 Coal costs were $(693) million, up 7.1%. On a per MWh basis, costs increased by $4.0 per MWh or 21.3%, due to increased purchase of coal at higher spot market prices, and contracted supplier and Enterprise Agreement wage escalation at the Loy Yang Mine. This was partly offset by higher coal volumes procured from lower cost legacy supply contracts compared to the prior year.\n- \u00b7 Gas fuel costs were $(168) million, down 4.5%. On a per MWh basis, costs increased by $17.2 per MWh or 14.2%, due to higher gas costs particularly in Victoria, as gas generation increased in response to higher pool prices in the first quarter of the year and managing AGL's position as part of the major outage of Unit 2 at AGL Loy Yang resulting in higher market prices.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## 3.2 Business Value Driver performance\n\nA summary of our performance in relation to each of AGL's Business Value Drivers is provided in the following sections. Time series data for the Business Value Driver key performance indicators as well as performance data for an extended range of non-financial metrics is available in the ESG Data Centre. The key performance indicators included in each scorecard should be read in conjunction with the Glossary to the Business Value Drivers on page 186.\n\nKey performance indicators that are linked to the FY23 remuneration outcomes for the CEO and key management personnel are also identified as outlined in the legend below.\n\n## Legend\n\nKPI linked to FY23 remuneration outcomes for CEO and key management personnel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are focused on strengthening our customer relationships through a range of innovative initiatives which deliver value for our business and improvements for our customers. AGL supports around 4.3 million customer services across energy and telecommunications translating to approximately 30% of households in the national electricity market. The fundamental strengths of our business continue to be our large quality customer base, leading brand, strong operating discipline and deep energy expertise.\n\nAs we navigate the multi-decade journey of the energy transition, we are actively balancing the need to support our customers facing cost of living pressures, including rising energy price rises, and the investment required to support our customers to transition to a net zero future.\n\n## Solutions to meet customer needs\n\nA critical way to enhance our relationship with our customers and grow trust is through the development of products and services that meet and respond to their changing needs. AGL has maintained a positive level of customer advocacy for the fifth consecutive year, with our Net Promoter Score at +5 for FY23, despite rising energy prices and a highly competitive market. Our strong and loyal customer relationships are further demonstrated by our energy consumer churn which is 4.5 percentage points lower than the rest of market.\n\nIn FY23 we increased our investment in retail transformation to simplify and streamline our business processes and the way we engage with our customers. AGL has the highest rated mobile application among our peers in Australia on the App store and this year added self service capabilities, including digital disconnection and direct debit, to simplify service access and improve the time taken to resolve customer queries.  We also offer a wide range of products and solutions to help customers lower costs and decarbonise their lifestyle, as set out in the following section.\n\nWe have placed a strong emphasis on ensuring that customer issues are addressed promptly and effectively. AGL has the least consumer electricity customer complaints of any Tier 1 retailer 1 . In FY23, Ombudsman complaints increased by 3% against FY22, which is the first time we have seen an annual increase since FY15. However, AGL continues to have lower overall Ombudsman complaints compared to our Tier 1 peers. The volume of Ombudsman complaints remained flat throughout the majority of the year, supported by continued focus on overall service improvement. We have begun to see the impacts of cost of living pressures through increased Ombudsman volume which we expect to continue into FY24.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                    | Target    | FY23   | FY22   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Strategic Net Promoter Score (NPS) | FY27: +20 | +5     | +6     |\n| Ombudsman complaints               | -         | 5,012  | 4,873  |\n\n## Energy affordability and support for customers experiencing vulnerability\n\nEnergy affordability continues to be a major concern for Australians, particularly in the context of broader cost of living pressures. Increases in wholesale prices have been driven by major global energy challenges, including significant market volatility, increases in global fuel prices, geopolitical factors and supply disruptions. In response to this, AGL, along with other energy retailers, increased prices for customers on standing offers and variable market offers.  We are acutely aware that these price increases are challenging for many customers. Our decision to increase prices for our market contract customers is based on a detailed consideration of a range of factors including wholesale prices, network charges, retail operating costs, customer affordability and the value we offer to our customers.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\nTo mitigate the impact of energy prices and to support customers experiencing vulnerability, AGL increased customer support funding over the next two years to at least $70 million. This will form part of a package of measures providing direct and indirect support to assist customers. The funding includes the provision of direct financial support to our Staying Connected customers through debt relief and bill credits of up to $400. Additionally, this funding will also help AGL improve energy literacy and accessibility, using advanced analytics to proactively identify and contact customers showing early signs of hardship, and building situational awareness for AGL's front line staff.\n\nMore broadly, AGL continues to provide a wide range of mechanisms to support customers who may be experiencing financial hardship or other vulnerability. These programs include:\n\n- \u00b7 Payment support options such as payment plans, payment deferrals, monthly billing, and bill smoothing arrangements;\n- \u00b7 Access to AGL's dedicated hardship programs which offer tailored assistance to customers experiencing financial distress and vulnerable circumstances, including protection from disconnection for non-payment;\n- \u00b7 Dedicated family and domestic violence support to provide safe access to energy;\n- \u00b7 Facilitating access to government support such as state energy concessions schemes, utility grants and rebate information;\n- \u00b7 Energy efficiency advice and tools including AGL's Energy Coach, which provides helpful advice on reducing energy consumption to lower energy bills; and\n- \u00b7 Additional protections for customers registered as requiring life support equipment at their premises.\n\nThe number of customers on the Staying Connected program increased by 18% in FY23. Customers are entering the hardship program earlier when compared to previous years. In FY23, AGL has continued to support Staying Connected customers with the delivery of $18 million of debt relief for customers participating in the program. This support allows customers to focus on paying towards their ongoing energy costs rather than the arrears, which has resulted in the average debt per Staying Connected customer reducing by 13% in FY23 to $2,578. The increase in total average debt across the mass market customer portfolio can be attributed to energy price increases and broader cost of living expenses.\n\n|                                                          | FY23   | FY22   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Number of customers on Staying Connected                 | 18,889 | 15,964 |\n| Average level of debt of customers on Staying Connected  | $2,578 | $2,973 |\n| Total average debt across mass market customer portfolio | $386   | $241   |\n\n## Decarbonised energy supply\n\nWe are committed to helping our customers decarbonise the way they live, move and work. During FY23, we have established and are scaling a range of initiatives to extend decarbonisation efforts for our residential customers:\n\n- \u00b7 Electrify Now: During FY23 we launched Electrify Now, a first of its kind pilot for Australian energy retailers that provides personalised recommendations for customers on ways to electrify their home and meet their decarbonisation goals. Electrify Now is underpinned by advanced analytics utilising customers' own smart meter data to tailor recommendations based on their individual household energy needs and usage patterns. Since the pilot was launched in March 2023, we have presented over 6,500 customers with tailored decarbonisation recommendations for their homes.\n- \u00b7 Electric vehicles: AGL's electric vehicle subscription program is now the largest of its kind in the country, growing in revenue by 38% since FY22. During FY23 we completed an ARENA-funded smart charging trial to test customer engagement, orchestration of residential electric vehicle charging and the impact on the grid.  In June 2023 we also announced a new eMobility partnership with bp pulse. This partnership will launch in New South Wales where customers on AGL's EV home energy plan will be able to access a discounted rate for charging at bp pulse's public charging sites. Further propositions are planned to be rolled out across the future period.\n- \u00b7 Carbon Neutral: AGL now provides 444,969 carbon neutral services across a suite of certified Climate Active products (up from 391,558 in FY22), including more than 150,000 carbon neutral gas and electricity services.\n- \u00b7 Demand response and orchestration: We are currently operating 316 MW of Decentralised Assets Under Orchestration, excluding smelters, and 1,139 MW including smelters. This includes our Peak Energy Rewards program, which is one of the largest flexible demand response programs in the country and has been expanded to over 120,000 customers. During FY23 we also commenced hot water orchestration trials that are generating interest from our customers and have the potential to provide significant flexible capacity.\n\nAGL continues to be an industry leader in relation to providing products and services to our commercial and industrial customers and are progressing on scaling our Energy as a Service (EaaS) solutions, providing integrated offerings across energy solutions, asset management, orchestration and asset financing. We continue to be the largest solar provider in the country, delivering three times more commercial solar capacity than the nearest competitor over FY23.",

Our operated assets exported 38.2 GWh to the grid 2 , equivalent to around 20% of electricity generated in the NEM. We have a defined strategy which aims to deliver a responsible and accelerated exit from coal-fired generation and transition to a lower carbon future.\n\nOur first key milestone was achieved in late April 2023 with the safe and respectful closure of Liddell Power Station after more than 50 years of operation. Bayswater Power Station will close between 2030-2033 (no later than 2033), and Loy Yang A Power Station is targeted to close by the end of FY35.\n\nWe are committed to transitioning our portfolio to support a lower carbon world, and will seek to supply our customers' energy demand by building and accessing ~12 GWof new renewable generation and firming capacity before 2036, with an interim target to have ~5 GW in place by 2030.  We also recognise that the flexibility, availability and reliability of our current generation fleet will be crucial as we look to leverage strong operating cash flows from our low-cost generation position, to help fund the transition of our business.\n\n## Transitioning our energy portfolio\n\nAs we transition our energy portfolio, AGL plans to seek the most efficient way of sourcing the required energy and firming to supply our customer energy demand. As outlined to the market in June 2023, we will aim to meet this through a combination of self-development and external project options via partnerships and third-party offtakes.\n\nDuring FY23 we continued our strong track record of developing renewable generation and energy storage projects:\n\n- \u00b7 Projects under construction: The Torrens Island Battery (250 MW) and the Broken Hill Battery (50 MW) are in the final stages of construction and commissioning, with both projects expected to be complete in H1FY24. In July 2022, we commenced a $40 million investment in modernising and upgrading the Clover hydro power station to increase the output capacity of the Kiewa Hydro Scheme by 14 MW. This is expected to be completed in FY26.\n- \u00b7 Onshore development pipeline: We have advanced our onshore development pipeline to 5.3 GW. Since February 2023 we have added 500 MW of wind, 100 MW of solar and 400 MW of battery storage in New South Wales, as well as 500 MW of battery storage in Queensland to our development pipeline, complementing existing development projects including the Liddell and Loy Yang batteries. We plan to continue to build up this development pipeline to enable options to be exercised as needed depending on the policy environment, economic environment, and portfolio and customer needs.\n- \u00b7 Offshore wind: In May 2023, AGL announced that a consortium of Australian and global companies (comprising Mainstream Renewable Power, Reventus Power, AGL and DIRECT Infrastructure) had submitted a feasibility licence application for a 2.5 GW offshore wind development in Bass Strait, off the coast of Gippsland, Victoria.\n\nThe following map summarises our development pipeline, including both fully owned and joint venture projects.\n\n|",

This is an improvement on FY22's performance of 74.5%, but lower than planned, primarily driven by lower performance in the first quarter of FY23 resulting from the continuation of the Loy Yang A Unit 2 generator failure (which began in the last quarter of FY22). Despite the Unit 2 outage, the other Loy Yang A units achieved above planned performance with very strong performance in the first quarter of FY23. Bayswater Power Station's FY23 performance was an improvement on FY22 performance due to fewer plant forced outages than occurred in FY22. Until its retirement in April 2023, the Liddell Power Station achieved an availability performance that was higher than in FY22.",

Thermal digital twins are being integrated with the energy efficiency plans for these sites to support further carbon intensity reduction objectives. These plans seek to address, among other goals, optimum performance of these plants when operating at lower loads due to fluctuating market conditions and optimisation of fuel consumption.\n\n|                                                                         | Target    | FY23   | FY22         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------------|\n| Equivalent Availability Factor (EAF) - all fleet                        |           | 76.8%  | 74.5%        |\n| Equivalent Availability Factor (EAF) - thermal and gas generation fleet | FY27: 88% | 74.6%  | Not reported |\n\n## Repurposed infrastructure (energy hubs)\n\nAGL is committed to repurposing its thermal generation sites into energy hubs. The Hunter Valley, Torrens Island and Latrobe Valley hubs seek to bring together energy production and energy-intensive industries around a shared infrastructure backbone, with a focus on circular economy principles, including innovative re-use of valuable infrastructure, recycling and co-location of complementary industries. The transition of these generation sites is underway through which we aim to support the economic diversification of these regions, providing new job and skills development opportunities for the communities where we operate.\n\nIn April 2023, the final operating unit of the Liddell Power Station was safely shut down and the neighbouring Bayswater Power Station is targeted to be closed by 2033. Development activities are underway across the Hunter Hub, and include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Planning approval for a 500 MW battery and ARENA funding secured (final investment decision expected to be made in FY24);\n- \u00b7 Feasibility assessment with Fortescue Future Industries for a large scale renewable hydrogen facility;\n- \u00b7 Pre-feasibility assessments for solar thermal energy and emerging battery technologies;\n- \u00b7 Pre-feasibility assessment with NuRock Building Products for a building products manufacturing facility utilising recycled waste ash;\n- \u00b7 Feasibility assessment with joint venture partner Idemitsu for a 250-400 MW pumped hydro project, supported by funding from the New South Wales Government; and\n- \u00b7 Approval of a First Nations agriculture project for the development of a Manuka Tree Plantation, which will provide the opportunity for medicinal Manuka honey production. AGL is working closely with the First Nations group to support engineering and construction activities, with seedlings expected to be planted in FY24.\n\nDecommissioning and rehabilitation activities following the closure of the Liddell Power Station are progressing alongside our Hub planning activities (refer to the Environment scorecard for further information).\n\nAs announced in November 2022, the final operating unit of Torrens Island Power Station is planned to close on 30 June 2026. Transition of the Torrens Island Hub is well progressed, with construction and commissioning of the 250 MW Torrens Island Battery underway during FY23 which is expected to be completed in August 2023. Pre-feasibility assessments for a renewable hydrogen facility and a range of other energy projects are underway, including:\n\n- \u00b7 A study into opportunities for hydrogen blending at the Barker Inlet Power Station, where AGL also has planning approval for a new 210 MW gas peaking plant; and\n- \u00b7 A thermal energy storage project, supported by ARENA, involving the assessment of technologies which aim to capture and convert excess low-cost energy to heat for steam generation, with the potential to provide co-firming or replacement of gas fuel usage at the Torrens Island B Power Station.\n\nWith Loy Yang A Power Station's targeted closure by the end of FY35, redevelopment activities for the Latrobe Valley Hub are ramping up. In addition to progressing plans for a 200 MW battery, a hydrogen supply chain project led by a consortium of Japanese partners has progressed to a second stage. In June 2023, AGL announced a Memorandum of Understanding with Solar Recovery Corporation to investigate the feasibility of a solar panel materials recovery facility that could support a re-manufacturing supply chain.\n\nAGL is working with Federal and State governments to support the redevelopment of these sites . Further information in relation to workforce transition is available in the People scorecard.\n\n|                                                             | Targets     | FY23   | FY22   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|--------|\n| Major industrial clients located on or connected to a hub 1 | FY27: 6 - 8 | NR     | NR     |\n\n|",

At AGL, we recognise the importance of attracting, developing and retaining the right people to enable us to deliver value to our customers and stakeholders. We will seek to achieve this by building a safe, performance driven and values led culture that is reflective of the communities in which we operate. As we progress through the energy transition, our approach is to treat people fairly and with respect, and to work constructively and openly with our people to keep them informed and engaged.\n\n## Safe and healthy workforce\n\nConsistent with the value of Be Safe. Be Supportive, AGL aims to identify and control risks in the workplace so our employees and contractors go home unharmed, both physically and mentally. The energy transition is raising many new safety challenges, including working with ageing plants, undertaking major demolition and rehabilitation projects, and incorporating new types of assets and operations into our portfolio.\n\nAGL has a comprehensive HSE Management System. The health and safety management systems used within the Customer Markets business successfully retained accreditation to ISO 45001 (2018), demonstrating the thoroughness of these systems.\n\nAGL invests significantly in understanding and minimising risk. In FY23, a periodic program of updating risk-assessments at all sites commenced. Additionally, a project to review and update all regulatory compliance requirements is underway.\n\nWe continue to prioritise the protection of our people's mental health. Awareness and training programs to employees were held during FY23, and additional specific reporting and measurement of mental health incidents was put in place to drive learning and improvement. Work-group risk-assessments on psycho-social hazards and controls commenced in March 2023, consistent with guidelines from Worksafe NSW.\n\nAGL seeks to engage, share and learn from other stakeholders in the sectors where we operate. Targeted health and safety forums with our major contractors have been strengthened. A major initiative in which AGL collaborated with our peers resulted in SafeWork Australia commencing the development of a national guide for safer solar installations.\n\nNo health and safety Significant Incident and Fatality (SIF) events occurred in FY23; the last Significant Incident event occurred in December 2020. During FY23 the SIF prevention program concentrated on working at heights, falling and dropped objects, and contact with electricity.\n\nTotal Injury Frequency Rate performance (TIFR) continued the long-term improvement trend in the first eight months. However, the last quarter of the year saw an increase in low-impact injuries. There was no discernible consistent cause for this, and a broad program and communication to maintain risk-awareness in all activities has been made.\n\n|                                      | FY23   | FY22   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| TIFR employees                       | 2.4    | 1.5    |\n| TIFR (employees + contractors)       | 2.8    | 2.1    |\n| Fatalities (employees + contractors) |        | 0 0    |\n\n## Performance culture\n\nBuilding a performance culture where AGL's employees are empowered as the driving force of a future-focused and purpose driven business is a critical enabler of AGL's strategy.  Our focus includes improving employee engagement, building a gender-balanced and diverse workforce and ensuring employees feel connected to AGL's purpose and values and enabled to deliver their role in the strategy.\n\nThe FY23 employee engagement score increased 10 percentage points from FY22 to 67%. The increase in engagement is reflective of the Board and management renewal, AGL's future-focused strategy, and the coordinated actions put in place in FY23 to improve communication and increase investment in employee growth and development. During FY23 over 300 employees participated in formal face-to-face leadership development programs which focused on building the future-ready skills and mindsets that are required to lead through the energy transition.\n\nWe continue to strengthen our focus on diversity and inclusion, and are committed to ensuring that our workforce represents the communities in which we operate. In FY23 we were recognised as one of Australia's top 10 companies in the Australian Network on Disabilities Access and Inclusion Index, awarded Family Inclusive Workplace status for the third consecutive year, and achieved Platinum status from Pride in Diversity, the highest obtainable recognition within the Australian Workplace Equality Index. Since we launched our inaugural Reconciliation Action Plan in FY21 we have also been focused on building our cultural competency to ensure that our workplace is culturally safe for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees. We are also striving to lift our current representation from 1.3% 1 to 3%, reflecting the same proportion of Aboriginal",

During FY23 we introduced 'Sorry Business Leave' for our employees who identify as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander peoples to participate in cultural practices, and delivered additional cultural learning opportunities for all employees.\n\nTraction on gender equality has not met AGL's expectations and the proportion of females in the senior leadership pipeline declined from 35% to 33%. Improving gender diversity in the senior leadership pipeline is a priority in FY24 to ensure the decline is not further exacerbated from current levels. In FY23 AGL joined the Champions of Change Coalition as a founding member of a newly established Energy Group to support stronger action on gender equality. AGL continues to review gender pay equity twice-yearly and maintains a 0% gender pay gap in like-for-like roles. The roll out of 'Respect@AGL' training across the workforce remains a focus to provide employees with the skills and knowledge to build an inclusive and respectful culture.\n\nThe design and launch of new values in FY23 (refer to the About AGL section) has created alignment and focus internally on behaviours and actions that will determine AGL's success and are reinforced through recruitment, performance, reward, and recognition frameworks.\n\nThe results of AGL's focus on a performance culture are evident in reduced attrition (down from 22% in FY22 to 13% in FY23) and improved retention of key talent (up from 76% in F22 to 83% in FY23).\n\n|                                      | Targets    | FY23   | FY22   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|--------|--------|\n| Employee engagement                  |            | 67%    | 57%    |\n| Attrition (total workforce) 1        |            | 13%    | 20%    |\n| Key talent retention                 |            | 83%    | 76%    |\n| Gender mix in SLP (% female)         | FY24: 35%  | 33%    | 35%    |\n| Gender mix in SLP (% female)         | FY25: 40%  | 33%    | 35%    |\n| Material breaches of Code of Conduct | FY26: \u226540% | 0      | 0      |\n\n## Workforce transition\n\nThe energy transition will significantly change AGL's workforce over the coming decade, and we have made a commitment to a respectful and responsible workforce transition. In FY23 a comprehensive capability program commenced, and a roadmap is in place to build capabilities required to deliver AGL's assets development pipeline and low-carbon energy hubs (refer to the Assets scorecard). The capability program will continue in FY24 to ensure AGL is positioned to build, attract, and retain critical capability, as well as to identify opportunities to upskill and reskill employees to develop capabilities required for new and existing energy industries.\n\nIn April 2023, we closed the last three units of the Liddell Power Station after nearly 52 years of operation. Supporting our Liddell workforce and the local community was a central part of our closure plans, and we delivered on our commitment to have no forced redundancies. Around 100 people (comprising over half of our Liddell employees) transferred to AGL's Bayswater Power Station in continued employment, and all other employees were supported with individual transition plans, as they elected to retire or seek other opportunities. Also key to our closure strategy was the establishment of the Future U Hub in FY21, an on-site centre dedicated to supporting our people at Liddell to plan for their futures. This prioritised mental health support, with a focus on training that gave our people skills and tools to help manage their wellbeing and mental health during the closure process. Financial counselling, superannuation talks and information on retirement support was also provided, and as Liddell people transferred to Bayswater, leaders undertook training on how to successfully form new teams and integrate the two workforces. AGL was acknowledged by community and government stakeholders for the careful and respectful management of the closure and the expertise AGL gained has created a platform on which to build for future coal-fired generation asset closures.\n\n|",

A wide variety of people and groups are interested in, or affected by, the decisions that AGL makes, or have a role in influencing the frameworks through which AGL makes decisions, including local communities and Traditional Owners, government, regulators, the energy industry and industry associations, non-government organisations and advocacy groups, suppliers, project partners, and lenders and investors.\n\nAGL strives to make a net positive social, economic and environmental contribution to the communities in which we operate. We proactively engage with our stakeholders on relevant issues in ways that are most appropriate to each group, prioritising the establishment of positive, respectful and transparent relationships. It is important to AGL that we build trust in our stakeholders by engaging openly with them, and by having them recognise that we consider their views in our decision-making.\n\n## Engaged and supported communities\n\nWe invest in the communities in which we operate through a structured program of community investment. In FY23, we invested approximately $4.8 million. There was a 26% increase in the overall amount of our investment compared to the previous financial year which was the result of growing our existing corporate community partnerships and establishing new community partnerships at our energy hubs to support AGL's energy transition.\n\nIn FY23, we reviewed our community investment programs and partnerships to better align with our refreshed strategy, purpose and values and input from our stakeholders. Our community investment will focus on supporting programs and partnerships that contribute to building resilience in communities where we operate, support climate action and address energy affordability. We have consolidated some of our smaller contributions into more significant long-term partnerships to improve the impact of our investment and provide our community partners funding security over a longer timeframe rather than one-off donations. We will continue to review our community investment to ensure alignment with our strategic objectives.\n\nWe continue to engage proactively with the communities where we currently operate through well-established Community Consultative Committees and Community Dialogue Groups. As we embark on new projects to deliver the commitments of our Climate Transition Action Plan, we will develop comprehensive community engagement strategies for each project to meaningfully engage and consult with key stakeholders, local communities and Traditional Owners in the proposed project locations.\n\nFY23 saw the conclusion of AGL's inaugural Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). During FY22 and FY23 we implemented several foundational priorities including building cultural competency, enhancing our workplace cultural safety, developing our First Nations Procurement Strategy, strengthening our long-standing relationships with Traditional Owners, and building new partnerships with Clontarf Foundation, Stars Foundations and Redfern Youth Connect. We also lent our support to the constitutional recognition of First Nations people by signing the Uluru Statement from the Heart. We believe establishing a First Nations Voice to Parliament is an important step in Australia's reconciliation journey enabling First Nations people to have a say on policies that impact their lives and communities. While we have made progress through our inaugural RAP, we acknowledge the need for continued efforts to ensure better outcomes for Indigenous Australians. We received endorsement from Reconciliation Australia for our second Innovate RAP in June 2023, which will be implemented over FY24 and FY25. The commitments in our new RAP focus on creating pathways to sustainable futures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples by supporting direct and indirect employment and through our investment in AGL's energy transition.\n\nAGL conducts periodic community sentiment surveys to understand how the community and other stakeholders view AGL. We also undertake quarterly monitoring of our reputation via RepTrak. In FY23, AGL's RepTrak score was 65.6, remaining consistent with earlier performance, the slight decrease reflecting broader trends in the energy sector.\n\nWe are committed to meeting all our tax compliance obligations, and to providing our stakeholders with information about the taxes we pay. In this regard we have adopted the Board of Taxation's voluntary Tax Transparency Code. Our effective tax rate on Underlying Profit is broadly in line with the Australian corporate tax rate of 30% before prior year adjustments and the research and development concessions.\n\n|                               | FY23   | FY22   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Community contribution        | $4.8 m | $3.8 m |\n| RepTrak score                 | 65.6   | 65.8   |\n| Underlying effective tax rate | 26.7%  | 23.2%  |",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## Collaboration for Australia's energy future\n\nAs we navigate the decades-long energy transition in Australia, we recognise the value of positive and transparent relationships with governments, productive consultation with regulators, and respectful, collaborative relationships with industry and advocacy groups.\n\nAGL proactively engages with governments on a regular basis, providing policy and technical input for government regulatory settings and pathways to net zero.  Ensuring trusted relations with governments and the public service is an important form of risk mitigation and provides a two-way flow of information relating to policy settings.  In line with our long-standing Political Donations Policy, we have not made any political donations (monetary or in-kind) over FY23.\n\nDuring FY23, AGL invested significant time consulting with governments and a wide range of stakeholders following the release of our Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) and our plans to accelerate our exit from coal-fired generation.  It is important for governments and AGL to have a common understanding of how our commitments impact governments' renewable energy and net-zero goals, and the implications of policy settings on the energy transition.\n\nWe also held briefing sessions for civil society stakeholders including Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Beyond Zero Emission, Gippsland Climate Change Network, The Sunrise Project, Healthy Futures, Environment Victoria among several others to seek feedback following the release of our CTAP and better understand their views as we embark on the implementation of our CTAP. We will continue to proactively engage with key civil society stakeholders as we progress our energy transition plans.\n\nWe are also partnering with governments and industry as we transition our thermal generation sites to industrial energy hubs, recognising that collaboration is critical for their successful delivery. Further information is available in the Assets scorecard.\n\nAs the Australian economy faces rising cost of living challenges, AGL is acutely aware of how these challenges, together with the rising cost of energy, impact our customers. During FY23 we have engaged with governments to provide advice on how best to implement energy bill relief programs, as well as in relation to the customer support and advice programs that AGL has in place for customers. AGL has further developed the range of support programs to provide complementary assistance to vulnerable customers to minimise the impact of current cost of living pressures.\n\nAGL also engages on a regular basis with customer representatives through the AGL Customer Council, which has been operating since 1998. The Council meets on a quarterly basis to discuss a wide range of matters that affect our customers and the communities in which we operate. The continuing aim of the Council is to enable two-way communication between AGL and representatives of our residential and business customers, including older Australians and people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities.\n\nAGL regularly engages with state and federal energy regulators, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) in order to advocate for market designs that we believe best meet the needs of the power system and our customers, as well as meet the National Energy Objectives . We actively participate in consultation processes regarding proposed changes to energy market policies and procedures, providing data, analysis and technical industry expertise. Our submissions to these processes are publicly available on AGL's website.\n\nAGL is a member of several industry associations which provide a range of benefits including access to industry information and analysis, relationship building, and an additional avenue to prosecute unified industry views on energy, climate change and related policies. We contribute to the development of policy advocacy strategies for many of these organisations through participation in a number of industry working groups. Other associations, particularly those associated with AGL's generation facilities, provide a valuable link to local communities and a forum within which to work together with key stakeholders. We are also a member of several associations which focus on a specific technical area not specific to the energy sector, such as tax, health and safety, and diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn accordance with our Industry Association Membership Policy, we review memberships annually to ensure that the values and policy positions of these organisations are closely aligned with those of AGL. Where there is any misalignment, we actively take steps to address any disagreements or consider the merits of ongoing membership with the association where the misalignment is significant and unable to be resolved.\n\n## Strong business relationships\n\nA variety of other stakeholders can have significant influence on Australia's energy transition. AGL recognises the importance of building strong relationships with these stakeholders, including our suppliers, project partners, and providers of financial capital.\n\nWith over 4500 suppliers, our Supplier Code of Conduct governs our procurement practices with a key focus on engaging with suppliers that share similar values and commitments as AGL, while also supporting our suppliers to manage the ESG impact of the goods and services they supply to us. Throughout FY23 AGL has been developing improved processes with regards to our supplier selection and assessment criteria to ensure we continue to increase our rigour in relation to ESG impacts. These process improvements have focused on Modern Slavery, Cyber Security, Security of Critical Infrastructure reforms and other elements of our procurement procedures and processes.\n\nPayment of small suppliers has continued to be a strong focus in FY23. AGL has improved our performance in meeting the Australian Government's Small Business Payment Times Reporting Scheme targets. During FY23, we reduced the time taken to pay small business invoices by approximately 4.5%, helping to support small businesses manage their cash flow.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\nAGL exceeded our target to increase our procurement spend with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander suppliers to $3 million by FY23, procuring $3.9 million of goods and services and forming many strong relationships with First Nations owned businesses. Numerous suppliers to AGL have also engaged First Nations suppliers to further improve our impact in this area. Our Reconciliation Action Plan commitments for FY24/FY25 include actions to drive further improvement, and we have increased our target by 90% to $5.7 million by FY25.\n\nAs noted within AGL's Human Rights Policy, AGL believes protecting and upholding human rights within our operations and supply chains is vital to realising human rights for our people, the people we work with, our customers and the communities in which we operate. To deliver on this belief, AGL used risk indicators to identify and validate our modern slavery risk exposure in key areas of our operations and supply chains. AGL has identified key risk areas for modern slavery to be in offshore labour, the solar supply chain, and the sourcing of batteries and solar-related products.\n\nThroughout FY23 AGL has continued to take proactive steps to manage its modern slavery risk exposure, all of which have been aligned to our Risk Management Policy and standard risk management practices. These steps will be summarised in our fourth Modern Slavery Statement for the FY23 reporting period which will be available on our website in early 2024.\n\nDeveloping and maintaining strong relationships with lending banks and debt capital markets investors is a crucial element of securing the capital needed to invest in renewable energy projects and execute on AGL's strategy and decarbonisation targets. AGL has been focused on ensuring that lenders and investors that want to deploy capital to support the energy transition understand both AGL's strategy and the nuances of the Australian electricity market, particularly given that the carbon intensity of AGL's generation portfolio will remain much higher than the industry average while the Loy Yang A Power Station is required for the stable, efficient and cost effective operation of the NEM.\n\nDuring FY23, AGL established a Green Finance Framework which sets out the process by which we have issued debt on an ongoing basis to fund capital expenditure for new firming capacity and renewable energy assets. This will support the delivery of AGL's CTAP, driving more efficient access to capital for 'green' projects that meet the eligibility criteria specified in the Framework, which is guided by best practice principles and guidelines 1 .\n\nIn FY23 AGL undertook a successful $1.6 billion partial refinancing of the company which included the issuance of long-term debt in the US private placement market, along with the first time creation of a $500 million green capex loan issued under the Green Finance Framework. The strong lender and investor support for AGL reflects the market's high level of confidence in and support for AGL's strategy and decarbonisation plans.\n\nDuring FY23 AGL also refreshed our capital allocation framework, including our dividend policy (refer to Section 2) in order to both maximise future returns for our shareholders while enabling the transitioning of AGL's energy portfolio.",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAGL takes our environmental responsibilities very seriously, and recognises the high expectations of our stakeholders, both as we operate our power generation facilities and as we play our part in Australia's decarbonisation journey.  We recognise that our stakeholders expect AGL to have strong and responsible transition plans that will lead AGL towards a net zero future, accompanied by measurable targets and transparent reporting. As we contribute to Australia's decarbonisation through the responsible closure of our coal-fired power stations over time, we face significant rehabilitation obligations, which we undertake through various transition activities with careful monitoring and transparency.\n\n## Future low-carbon world\n\nAs Australia's largest corporate emitter of greenhouse gases, actions taken by AGL to reduce emissions will have a material impact on Australia's emission profile. Until the closure of the Liddell Power Station in April 2023, our operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions accounted for approximately 8% of Australia's total emissions. In FY23, over 95% of our operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions and an estimated 57% of our total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions arose from the combustion of black and brown coal in our power stations to generate electricity both for our customers and other customers in the NEM. The transition of AGL's energy portfolio from one dominated by base-load generation to a portfolio of renewable and firming generation comprises one of the largest contributions to the decarbonisation of the Australian economy.\n\nIn September 2022, AGL published our inaugural Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), furthering our track record of market-leading climate disclosures and our commitment to communicating transparently with our stakeholders. The CTAP documents AGL's climate commitments, targets and ambitions, and recognises the need to balance responsible transition and rapid decarbonisation to keep Australia's electricity supply secure, reliable, and affordable.\n\nAGL has set the following emission reduction targets through the CTAP for its operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 Achieve a reduction of at least 17% in annual Scope 1 and 2 emissions against a FY19 baseline 1 by FY24 2 , following the closure of the Liddell Power Station.\n- \u00b7 Achieve a reduction of at least 52% in annual Scope 1 and 2 emissions against a FY19 baseline 1 by FY35 3 , following the closure of the Bayswater Power Station.\n- \u00b7 Achieve net zero emissions following the closure of AGL's coal-fired power stations (Liddell, Bayswater and Loy Yang A power stations 4 ).\n\nThe targeted closure dates for AGL's thermal coal assets outlined in AGL's CTAP are consistent with a decarbonisation scenario where the NEM achieves a well below two degrees outcome, and with the climate ambition of the 'Step Change' scenario within AEMO's 2022 Integrated System Plan. Our plan recognises that to achieve a net zero energy system in an orderly and efficient way, individual generators and asset owners will decarbonise at different rates as the NEM efficiently decarbonises as a whole. Market settings in the NEM will result in less reliable and higher-cost assets exiting the market first, while more reliable, lower-emissions, and lower-cost assets will remain in the system to support reliability and affordability objectives as the system rapidly decarbonises in the most efficient way.\n\nWe received shareholder support for the CTAP through the 'Say on Climate' vote at our 2022 Annual General Meeting. As outlined in our CTAP, and in line with emerging best practice, we propose to put our decarbonisation plans to shareholder vote every three years.\n\nA summary of the progress made against our CTAP commitments over FY23 is available within our FY23 TCFD Report, available on our website . Our FY23 TCFD Report also provides further details on how we consider governance, risk management, strategy, and metrics and targets in relation to climate change.\n\nFurther information on how we are transitioning our energy portfolio, including our development pipeline of renewable and firming projects and our energy hubs developments is available in the Assets scorecard, while information about how we are working with our customers, our people and our communities as we decarbonise is available in our Customer scorecard, People scorecard and Relationships scorecard respectively.\n\nOur total operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY23 were 35.2 MtCO2e, down 12% compared to FY22, and down 18.5% against an FY19 baseline. The reduction in emissions is due to the extended Loy Yang A Unit 2 outage (which commenced in Q4 FY22), and the retirement of the Liddell Power Station at the end of April 2023.\n\n|",

We are committed to continuously improving our environmental management practices and performance.\n\nIn FY23 AGL demonstrated our commitment to the natural environment through improvement programs to reduce air emissions and cultural heritage practices:\n\n- \u00b7 Air emissions: Australian coal-fired power station operators are under increasing scrutiny from regulators, environmental groups and the community in relation to air pollution. During FY23, AGL continued to implement actions to reduce NOx, SO2 and particulate emissions from the Liddell, Bayswater and Loy Yang A power stations, to assist AGL in meeting its obligations and managing its liabilities associated with air emissions from its coal-fired power stations. Programs undertaken to improve the flexibility of our thermal assets (refer to the Assets scorecard) also help the plants optimise fuel consumption (and lower air emissions) when operating at lower loads.\n- \u00b7 Cultural heritage: AGL is committed to improving our approach to the management of indigenous cultural heritage at our sites in conjunction with Traditional Owner groups to meet community expectations in addition to legislative requirements. Actions completed in FY23 included: the establishment of a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) database as a central repository of all recorded cultural heritage locations in proximity to AGL assets; updating AGL's Cultural Heritage Standard, Cultural Heritage Standard Methodology, cultural heritage risk profile and, site-based Cultural Heritage management plans; improving site inductions to include details of cultural heritage sites and mitigation practices; and implementing training programs for employees to better understand legal requirements and AGL's expectations in relation to managing cultural heritage and engaging with Traditional Owner groups.\n\nDuring FY23, there were 30 Environmental Regulatory Reportable (ERR) incidents and four administrative non-compliance events as summarised below:\n\n- \u00b7 Nine events with negligible short-term local environmental impact: These events comprised administration non compliances (4), inability to complete monitoring due to equipment availability (1), and negligible risk unauthorised discharges to air/land/water (4).\n- \u00b7 15 events with small scale short-term local impact (inside AGL's operational area): These events comprised inability to complete monitoring due to equipment availability (1) and unauthorised discharges to air/land/water (14).\n- \u00b7 Eight events with moderate short- to medium-term impacts to environment (short-term clean-up required): All eight of these events were unauthorised discharges to air/land/water. More information on these events is included in the ESG Data Centre .\n- \u00b7 Two events with medium-term impacts to environment that may extend beyond AGL's operational area: Both these events comprised unauthorised clearing of native vegetation outside of the operational area at Broken Hill. More information on these events is included in the ESG Data Centre .\n\nPrograms are underway which seek to reduce the number of reportable events across our operational sites. For information on official cautions and Penalty Infringement Notices received during FY23 refer to the Environmental regulation section.\n\n|                                                 |   FY23 |   FY22 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Environmental Regulatory Reportable incidents 1 |     30 |     13 |",

The efficient closure of our ageing generation assets and the subsequent decommissioning, demolition and rehabilitation of these sites is a critical part of AGL's plans deliver its energy hubs (refer to the Assets scorecard).\n\nDuring FY23, AGL ceased operations at two of its oldest power stations: Torrens A Power Station in September 2022, and Liddell Power Station in April 2023. This was a significant milestone in AGL's transition journey for these sites, as we move from closure planning to delivery of decommissioning and demolition works. Decommissioning work at both Torrens A and Liddell has immediately commenced, to prepare the assets for demolition.\n\nFY23 transition activities focused on:\n\n- \u00b7 developing a 'Transition Centre of Excellence' to leverage capability and expertise of site closure and transition within AGL;\n- \u00b7 execution of the demolition and ash dam rehabilitation contract for Liddell Power Station;\n- \u00b7 conducting environmental, biodiversity and dam safety studies and progressing regulatory approvals to support closure projects;\n- \u00b7 significantly progressing the decommissioning and demolition planning for Torrens A Power Station;\n- \u00b7 rehabilitating 35.6 hectares of land at AGL Macquarie, including 23.5 hectares of the Liddell Ash Dam and 12.1 hectares of the Ravensworth Voids;\n- \u00b7 expediting dust mitigation activities for the Liddell Ash Dam, including the application of dust suppressants and commencement of the first stage of post-closure capping and rehabilitation which will cover 140 hectares over two years;\n- \u00b7 decommissioning and demolition planning for the Rosalind Park Gas Processing Facility; and\n- \u00b7 progressive 'plug and abandon' of gas wells at the Camden Gas Project with 17 wells completed in FY23 and a total of 112 wells rehabilitated of a total of 144 wells.\n\nDuring FY24, transition activities will focus on:\n\n- \u00b7 completion of decommissioning and commencement of demolition works at Liddell and Torrens A power stations;\n- \u00b7 progression of the Liddell Ash Dam capping and rehabilitation;\n- \u00b7 closure of the Camden Gas Project, and decommissioning and demolition of the Rosalind Park Gas Processing Facility;\n- \u00b7 ongoing 'plug and abandon' of gas wells at Camden Gas Project; and\n- \u00b7 decommissioning of the 2 MW Cairn Curran Hydro Power Station.\n\nAGL also undertakes progressive rehabilitation works at Loy Yang Mine, Silver Springs, Moranbah and Ravensworth facility in line with regulatory obligations and approvals. Progressive rehabilitation of ash dams and mines associated with AGL's coal generation assets, as well as decommissioning and rehabilitation of gas production wells undertaken in FY23, is outlined in the ESG Data Centre .\n\nA summary of the updated provisions for environmental rehabilitation as at 30 June 2023 is provided below. The discount rate used to derive the present value of the estimated cash flows was revised to reflect current interest rates and increased from 5.14% to 6.86%, consistent with standard accounting practice. The cash flow changes offset by the increased discount rate have resulted in an increase in the provision for environmental restoration of $246 million, which is reflected in AGL's financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2023. The increase in rehabilitation costs at AGL Loy Yang FY23 also reflect the accelerated closure timetables for this asset as communicated to the market in September 2022.\n\n| Asset                                 | Planned closure date   | Provision amount ($m)   | Rehabilitation costs Real FY23 ($m)   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| AGL Loy Yang                          | 2035                   | 742                     | 1,674                                 |\n| AGL Macquarie (Liddell and Bayswater) | 2023-2033              | 488                     | 672                                   |\n| AGL Torrens (A and B station)         | 2022-2026              | 68                      | 79                                    |\n| Upstream gas assets 1                 | 2023-2040              | 42                      | 44                                    |\n| Other                                 | Various                | 62                      | 95                                    |\n|                                       |                        | 1,402                   | 2,565                                 |\n\n|",

Asset and data security measures ensure we can safeguard customer information entrusted to us, enabling us to navigate an increasingly complex digital landscape. AGL's management of wholesale trading and risk management ensures prudent decision-making and effective mitigation of potential risks and volatility affecting our customers.\n\n## Enhancing customer experience\n\nAGL's continued focus on technology transformation over FY23 supports our overarching objective to deliver contemporary and resilient technology platforms and services that enable our business to meet the changing needs of our customers, to effectively compete in the market, and to grow and innovate. We understand that as technology advances, customers are no longer just comparing AGL to other energy retailers; they expect seamless digital experiences and instant access to personalised information.\n\nWe are seeing momentum building through our customers increasingly embracing digital interactions, and we have achieved improvements in our continual drive to be 'Digital First', with the proportion of our customers who have accessed AGL's digital channels materially increasing. During FY23 we have simplified our product portfolio by 52% against an FY20 baseline, and are continuing to leverage AI with over five million transactions now managed through this technology. Technology changes form a critical part of AGL's 'Retail Next' technology transformation program to dramatically simplify its technology architecture and deliver significant capability uplift.\n\nWe also continue to invest in further enhancing the digital experience for our business customers. We have expanded our commercial solar monitoring and management platform to support more than 210 MW of our business customers' solar assets, optimising asset performance to ensure customers are benefiting from maximum solar production, lowering costs and improving asset returns.

AGL's position as an integrated energy generator and retailer means we can effectively manage price volatility in the energy markets for our customers.\n\nWe do this by implementing considered energy trading and hedging strategies, and through the safe and efficient operation of our generation assets. AGL's risk management framework includes the Trading Risk Policy, which governs our energy hedging and related activities. The policy allows for the commercial optimisation of AGL's portfolio provided that all activities adhere to an overall risk limit that reflects AGL's risk appetite.\n\nAs a responsible market participant, we take our compliance, risk and regulatory obligations seriously. Our policies and procedures are updated periodically to reflect our obligations under market rules and relevant laws, and compliance obligation registers are maintained to ensure these obligations are owned and managed by the appropriate business units. Relevant staff are required to perform periodic online and face-to-face training and are encouraged to maintain professional accreditation.\n\nWith the investment of our Energy Trading & Risk Management (ETRM) Uplift in FY22, we have been able to improve our governance processes as well as the quality of our decision-making. The ETRM Uplift replaced AGL's ageing energy trading systems, automated manual processes, and strengthened internal controls, as well as addressing market changes such as 5-minute settlements. It also provided a foundation to support business growth via the introduction of an integrated data platform which has enhanced data governance and data quality. Our technology investment has also improved the sophistication of our decision-making, such as the algorithmic optimisation and automated bidding of our growing large-scale battery fleet and our Virtual Power Plant (VPP), which incorporates distributed assets like batteries and hot water units in our customers' homes.\n\nWith the projected shift to electrification expected to result in gradual decline of customer gas demand, AGL will continue to contract gas to support AGL and customer requirements. During FY23, AGL contracted 161 PJ of gas supplies for future periods to replace contracts that are expiring over time, including new supply agreements with Cooper Energy, Senex, Exxon and others.",

We also protect a significant amount of confidential information, including personal information and data records of our customers.\n\nAGL undertakes a comprehensive process to identify, assess and mitigate key cybersecurity risks, which leverages the Australian Energy Sector Cyber Security Framework as well as international cybersecurity frameworks, and is in line with regulatory requirements such as the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 and the Privacy Act 1988 .  Cybersecurity and resilience is a Tier 1 Strategic Risk overseen by the board as part of our enterprise-wide risk management program (refer to the FY23 Tier 1 Strategic Risks section).  The measures we take to protect our assets and data do not eliminate risk. There is always a risk that security breaches, unauthorised access, malicious software, external attacks or internal breaches could occur that adversely impact our operations and confidential information.\n\nContinual investment and uplift in a significant portfolio of security capabilities, processes and measures to manage the ever-changing cyber environment are in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of assets and data. We proactively manage cyber risk to limit the likelihood of inappropriate access to our systems and data, and to limit the impact of cyber security incidents through preparation and rapid response capabilities.  Security vulnerabilities are managed via a dedicated threat and vulnerability management team and automated scanning platforms, as well as specialist technical assurance, including penetration testing.\n\nWe have achieved a high level of stability throughout the year with a significant reduction of major incidents from 50 incidents in FY22 to 34 incidents in FY23, continuing the downward trend from prior years.  This trend is attributed to robust change management processes, heightened focus on remediation actions, improved proactive monitoring and detection, and a dedicated focus on handling lower priority incident management to prevent issues from escalating into major incidents.\n\nIn FY23 only one major IT incident was attributed to cyber security.  In this incident attackers tried to test and validate credentials they had gained from other known external breaches or via the Dark Web to see if they worked in the AGL MyAccount portal.  AGL implemented additional security controls to mitigate against similar incidents and further strengthen security over customer accounts.\n\nAcross FY23, AGL identified and reported three separate Notifiable Data Breaches to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. All three cases involved an external threat actor attempting to gain access to customer personal information through obtaining access to the customer's account details with AGL. In each case, AGL has conducted a detailed analysis of the root cause of the incident, and implemented additional targeted controls or strategies to reduce the likelihood of an incident occurring with the same or a similar attack pattern.\n\n|                              |   FY23 |   FY22 |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Major IT incidents           |     34 |     50 |\n| Reportable privacy incidents |      3 |      1 |\n\n|",

Group Financial Performance and Position\n\n## 4.1 Group results summary\n\nStatutory Loss after tax attributable to AGL shareholders was $(1,264) million, a decrease of $2,124 million compared to the Statutory Profit of $860 million in the prior year. The principal drivers of the decrease were a negative movement in the fair value of financial instruments, a higher value of asset impairments taken in FY23 compared to prior year predominantly due to the earlier targeted closure of Loy Yang A Power Station, and reduction in favourable onerous contract movements.\n\n## 4.1.1 Reconciliation of Statutory (Loss)/Profit to Underlying Profit\n\nAGL uses Underlying Profit as a key measure of financial performance. Underlying Profit is derived from Statutory Profit, as measured in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, and excluding significant items and movements in the fair value of financial instruments. The use of Underlying Profit enhances comparability of results by excluding non-recurring events and transactions that materially affect the financial results of AGL for the reporting period.\n\nUnderlying Profit after tax was $281 million, up 24.9% from the prior year. A description of the factors driving Underlying Profit is included in Section 4.1.5.\n\n|                                                                    | FY23 $m       | FY22 $m     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Statutory (Loss)/Profit after tax attributable to AGL shareholders | (1,264)       | 860         |\n| Adjust for:                                                        |               |             |\n| Significant items after tax 1                                      | 655           | (486)       |\n| Loss/(Profit) on fair value of financial instruments after tax 2   | 890           | (149)       |\n| Underlying Profit after tax                                        | 281           | 225         |\n| Earnings per share on Statutory (Loss)/Profit                      | (187.9) cents | 131.6 cents |\n| Earnings per share on Underlying Profit                            | 41.8 cents    | 34.4 cents  |\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) calculations have been based upon a weighted average number of ordinary shares of 672,747,233 (30 June 2022: 653,324,767).

The reduction in rehabilitation provision was driven by an increase in the discount rate following market changes in base rates.\n- \u00b7 Recognised $17 million ($15 million post-tax) revenue related to contingent milestones under the FY21 Wellington North Solar Farm sale being met in the current year.\n- \u00b7 Recognised $7 million ($7 million post-tax) revenue related to the sale of land as part of a NSW government compulsory acquisition.\n- \u00b7 Recognised a reduction in the onerous contract liability of $2 million ($1 million post-tax) related to various renewable asset power purchase agreements (PPAs).\n\n## FY22\n\nDuring the prior year AGL:\n\n- \u00b7 Recognised a pre-tax impairment of $246 million ($172 million post-tax) relating to Newcastle Gas Storage Facility, Newcastle Gas Peaker development rights and Collins Street lease right-of-use assets. This was partly offset by the reversal of a previously recognised impairment of AGL's investment in Tilt Renewables of $14 million ($10 million post tax).\n- \u00b7 Recognised $61 million pre-tax ($42 million post-tax) in costs related to redundancies and restructuring to deliver future cost reductions, and the integration of acquired businesses including completion of the SEGH Pty Limited and Epho Holdings Pty Limited integrations and Phase 2 of the integration of Southern Phone Company.\n- \u00b7 Recognised $125 million pre-tax ($89 million post-tax) in separation costs related to the proposed demerger of AGL.\n- \u00b7 Recognised $65 million pre-tax ($46 million post-tax) due to the reduction in the rehabilitation provision for certain assets that had previously been impaired. The reduction in rehabilitation provision was driven by an increase in the discount rate following market changes in base rates. In addition to this the estimated closure date of Camden was revised impacting the timing of cash flows.\n- \u00b7 Recorded a reduction in the valuation of onerous contracts of $1,019 million ($713 million post-tax) as a result of higher electricity and large-scale generation certificate forward prices along with higher discount rates.\n- \u00b7 Recognised $20 million in other revenue related to AGL's sale of the purchase option to re-power 50% of the Macarthur Wind Farm following the completion of the existing lease in 2038.\n\n## 4.1.3 Movement in fair value of financial instruments recognised in Profit or Loss\n\nMovement in the fair value of financial instruments recognised in profit or loss (excluded from Underlying Profit) was $(1,271) million ($(890) million post-tax), down from $212 million ($149 million post-tax). The net loss reflected a negative fair value movement in net buy electricity level 1 and level 2 derivatives mainly due to significant downward movements in short to medium term forward curves across FY23 and a negative fair value movement in oil and gas derivative contracts as a result of higher forward prices. The fair value loss on treasury derivatives of $(3) million recognised in profit or loss reflected hedge ineffectiveness.\n\n|                                                 | Pre-tax   | FY23 $m Post-tax   | Pre-tax   | FY22 $m Post-tax   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Energy derivatives contracts                    | (1,268)   | (888)              | 213       | 149                |\n| Cross currency and interest rate swap contracts | (3)       | (2)                | (1)       | -                  |\n| Fair value recognised in profit or loss         | (1,271)   | (890)              | 212       | 149                |\n\n## 4.1.4 Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)\n\n|                                                    | FY23 $m   | FY22 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Statutory EBIT                                     | (1,581)   | 1,399     |\n| Significant items                                  | 943       | (686)     |\n| Loss/(Gain) on fair value of financial instruments | 1,271     | (212)     |\n| Underlying EBIT                                    | 633       | 501       |\n| Customer Markets                                   | 248       | 181       |\n| Integrated Energy                                  | 753       | 643       |\n| Investments                                        | (8)       | 11        |\n| Centrally Managed Expenses                         | (360)     | (334)     |\n| Underlying EBIT                                    | 633       | 501       |\n\n|",

Total working capital movements were $(168) million, compared with $404 million in the prior year. Components of working capital movement were:\n\n- \u00b7 Receivables cash flow of $147 million reflected the reversal of an AEMO deposit which was a security requirement driven by the market volatility in June 2022 and roll-off of wholesale gas customers.  This was partly offset by higher consumer revenue compared with the prior year.\n- \u00b7 Payables cash flow of $(206) million reflected the payments made for energy as a result of AGL being a net purchaser of electricity during the unprecedented market intervention in June 2022, lower pool purchases, lower realised derivative positions, and lower generation volume at an overall lower electricity spot price.  This was partly offset by higher unbilled network costs resulting from higher customer consumption compared with prior year.\n- \u00b7 Inventory cash flow of $(8) million reflected higher gas storage volumes due to lower net gas withdrawals and increase in spot purchases of coal at higher prices. This was partly offset by lower coal volume purchases and a reduction in Sustainable Business Energy Solutions (SBES) solar inventory.\n- \u00b7 Net derivative premiums paid of $(20) million reflected the timing differences of derivative premiums amortised and derivative premiums paid.\n- \u00b7 Financial assets/liabilities (margin calls) cash flow of $(103) million reflected lower electricity market prices on a buy position, partly offset by a bank guarantee replacement for initial margin and changes in margin requirements. The prior year cash flow of $180 million reflected a reduction in variation margin with a favourable buy position at a lower strike price against a lifting market price between June 2021 to June 2022, partly offset by an increase in initial margin due to an increase in net volume traded.\n- \u00b7 Green assets/liabilities cash flow of $43 million reflected higher Large-Scale Renewable Energy Certificate (LREC) prices for forward purchases factored into compliance liability in FY23, partly offset by a short term cash flow management strategy to lower inventory holdings of green certificates.\n\n|",

The prior year included capital expenditure, the acquisition of Tilt Renewables, and the sale of investments in Energy Impact Partners' Fund, Activate Capital Partners, and Ecobee Inc.  For further details on capital expenditure, see Section 3.1.6.\n\nFinancing activities cash flows of $(159) million primarily reflected $(121) million dividend payments and $(39) million net repayment of borrowings.  The prior year included $(302) million net repayment of borrowings.\n\n## 4.3 Financial position\n\n## Summary Statement of Financial Position\n\nAt 30 June 2023 AGL's total assets were $15,238 million, a decrease from $19,270 million at 30 June 2022, primarily due to a $1,290 million decrease in current trade receivables reflecting significant energy price decreases reducing the value of closing balances, a $2,605 million decrease in energy derivatives and a $595 million decrease in property, plant and equipment primarily due to an impairment loss recognised in the current year, partly offset by an increase in rehabilitation assets reflecting the increases in estimated environmental rehabilitation costs. Other current assets includes $185 million of upstream gas assets classified as held for sale related to the Moranbah and North Queensland Energy joint operations (Moranbah Gas Project) and Surat Gas Project.\n\nTotal liabilities at 30 June 2023 were $10,119 million, a decrease from $12,753 million at 30 June 2022, primarily reflecting a $1,480 million movement in energy derivatives, $1,337 million decrease in trade and other payables reflecting significant energy price decreases reducing the value of closing balances and a decrease in onerous contracts provisions. This was partly offset by an increase in environmental rehabilitation provisions driven by the earlier targeted closure date of AGL thermal generation assets, additional ESG costs, and borrowings. Other liabilities includes $220 million of upstream gas liabilities classified as held for sale related to Moranbah Gas Project and Surat Gas Project.\n\nTotal equity at 30 June 2023 was $5,119 million, down from $6,517 million, reflecting the Statutory Loss for the year and dividends paid. AGL's return on equity of 4.9%, calculated on a rolling 12-month basis was 1.2pp up from 30 June 2022.\n\n|                               | FY23 $m   | FY22 $m   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Assets                        |           |           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents     | 148       | 127       |\n| Other current assets          | 4,427     | 8,504     |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 5,418     | 6,013     |\n| Intangible assets             | 3,182     | 3,252     |\n| Other non-current assets      | 2,063     | 1,374     |\n| Total assets                  | 15,238    | 19,270    |\n| Liabilities                   |           |           |\n| Borrowings                    | 2,883     | 2,878     |\n| Other liabilities             | 7,236     | 9,875     |\n| Total liabilities             | 10,119    | 12,753    |\n| Net assets/total equity 1     | 5,119     | 6,517     |\n\n## 4.3.1 Net Debt Reconciliation\n\nNet debt at 30 June 2023 was $2,711 million, up from $2,662 million at 30 June 2022. This was predominantly driven by the margin call obligations as a result of the significant downward movements in short to medium term electricity forward curves across FY23.",

AGL generates electricity or has contracted gas supply in excess of its customers' demand in some states. In other states, AGL has sources of supply less than its customers' demand.\n\nAGL uses certain financial instruments (derivatives) to manage these energy price risks and to manage its exposure to interest and foreign exchange rates arising in the normal course of business, provided the overall AGL risk appetite is not exceeded. The majority of these financial instruments exchange a fixed price for a floating market-based price of a given commodity, interest rate, currency or a quoted asset, with the net differential being settled with the counterparty. AGL is exposed to price volatility on the sale and purchase of energy-related commodities in the normal course of business, and therefore enters into contracts that minimise the price risk to AGL on both sold and purchased forecast exposures.\n\nAGL has in place a governance framework that establishes the policy guidelines under which energy hedging activities are conducted. Key components of that policy include segregation of duties, independent risk oversight, earnings-at-risk limits, compliance management and regular reporting to the Board. The risk policy represents the Board and Senior Management's commitment to an effective risk management function to ensure appropriate management and oversight of AGL's risks related to wholesale markets energy risk. The policy allows for commercial optimisation of the portfolio provided that AGL adheres to overall earnings-at-risk limits that reflect its risk appetite.\n\n## Energy price risk\n\nAGL's energy-related derivatives recognised in profit or loss include sell and buy positions, where AGL receives or pays a fixed price from or to a counterparty in exchange for a floating price paid or received.\n\nAGL is required to make margin payments in respect of futures contracts traded through the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Initial margin call payments are made at the time contracts are entered in order to manage intra-day credit exposure. The quantum of initial margin depends on the volume traded, the expected market volatility as well as forward electricity prices at the time. The initial margin call can move subsequently as forward prices move. AGL also receives or makes payments known as variation margin calls, which cover mark to market movements of AGL's open futures position. These typically reverse through future earnings as contract positions roll off.\n\n## Treasury related risk\n\nAGL's treasury related risk primarily relates to interest and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Contracts to minimise the exposure to market-based fluctuations are executed pursuant to AGL's treasury risk management policy. These contracts primarily result in fixed interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are designated in hedge relationships when they can be matched to forecast transactions with sufficient probability of the forecast transaction occurring.\n\nIn addition to the above, AGL is counterparty to cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements to convert its fixed interest rate US dollar private placement borrowing instruments to floating interest rate Australian dollar equivalent borrowing instruments. The cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements are designated as fair value and cash flow hedge relationships.\n\n## Movement in fair value\n\nThe initial fair value of a derivative is the consideration paid or received (the premium). Fair value movements in any given period are a function of changes to underlying indices, market prices or currencies and the roll-off of realised contractual volumes or amounts. A reconciliation of the movements in financial instruments carried at fair value for FY23 is presented in the following table.\n\n|",

Segmental Analysis\n\nAGL manages its business in three key operating segments: Customer Markets, Integrated Energy and Investments. Further detail on the activities of each operating segment is provided below.\n\nAGL manages and reports a number of expense items including Technology within Centrally Managed Expenses. These costs are not reallocated to AGL's operating segments because their management is the responsibility of various corporate functions.\n\nA reconciliation of segment results and Underlying Profit after tax is provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 Segment information.\n\n## 5.1 Customer Markets\n\nCustomer Markets comprises the Consumer and Large Business customer portfolios responsible for the retailing of electricity, gas, broadband/ mobile/voice, solar and energy efficiency products and services to residential, small and large business customers. Customer Markets sources its energy from Integrated Energy at transfer prices that reflect wholesale energy costs in each state, along with other energy costs such as those arising from environmental schemes. Customer Markets also includes sales, marketing, brand, and AGL's customer contact and call centre operations.\n\nFollowing the integration of Telecommunications, certain costs associated with Telecommunications Technology and Corporate functions were transferred from Customer Markets to Centrally Managed Expenses.\n\n## 5.1.1 Underlying EBIT\n\nCustomer Markets Underlying EBIT was $248 million, up 37.0% due to higher margin across Consumer, Telecommunications, Perth Energy and Sustainable Business Energy Solutions (SBES) portfolios, partly offset by higher operating costs due to an increase in net bad debt expense.\n\n|                                                           | FY23 $m   | FY22 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Consumer Electricity gross margin                         | 493       | 471       |\n| Consumer Gas gross margin                                 | 312       | 259       |\n| Large Business Electricity gross margin                   | 31        | 33        |\n| Large Business Gas gross margin                           | 13        | 8         |\n| Fees, charges and other gross margin                      | 9         | 12        |\n| Telecommunications gross margin                           | 20        | 11        |\n| Perth Energy gross margin                                 | 10        | 2         |\n| Sustainable Business Energy Solutions gross margin        | 19        | 15        |\n| Gross margin                                              | 907       | 811       |\n| Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) | (536)     | (491)     |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                         | 371       | 320       |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                             | (123)     | (139)     |\n| Underlying EBIT                                           | 248       | 181       |\n\n- \u00b7 Consumer Electricity gross margin was $493 million, up 4.7%, driven by higher revenue rates as a result of focused customer value management.\n- \u00b7 Consumer Gas gross margin was $312 million, up 20.5%, driven by higher revenue rates, and higher average demand due to colder weather and customer growth.\n- \u00b7 Large Business Electricity gross margin was $31 million, down 6.1%, driven by increased competition impacting volume and margin rate.\n- \u00b7 Large Business Gas gross margin was $13 million, up 62.5%, driven by improved margin rates due to an increase in customer contracted pricing and improved consumption mix.\n- \u00b7 Fees, charges and other gross margin was $9 million, down 25.0%, due to lower Distributed Energy Services margin rates and a reduction in third party call volumes.\n- \u00b7 Telecommunication gross margin was $20 million, up 81.8%, driven by growth in telecommunications services and improved margin rates aligned with service revenue growth across a fixed network cost.\n- \u00b7 Perth Energy gross margin was $10 million, up $8 million, driven by higher Kwinana Swift Power Station generation volumes due to higher availability compared to the prior year, as well as higher volumes and margins in the gas portfolio.

They also control the dispatch of AGL's owned and contracted generation assets and associated portfolio of energy hedging products.\n\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Electricity reflects the trading of key fuel inputs and hedging of AGL's wholesale electricity requirements, and also includes Eco Markets, which reflects the management of AGL's liabilities relating to both voluntary and mandatory renewable and energy efficiency.\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Gas reflects the sourcing and management of AGL's gas supply and transportation portfolio. Trading and Origination - Gas is also responsible for the management of the price exposures related to AGL's oil-linked wholesale gas contracts.\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Other reflects the Trading and Origination resourcing and support, in addition the Decentralised Energy Resources business is responsible for the management of other growth initiatives in AGL's orchestration pathway alongside Customer Markets.",

Liddell Power Station ceased generation on 28 April 2023 and the site will be rehabilitated and transitioned to an industrial renewable energy hub.\n- \u00b7 Gas Generation primarily comprises AGL Torrens, Barker Inlet Power Station, Kwinana Swift Power Station and Somerton Power Station. As announced in November 2022, AGL Torrens will close its three remaining units in operation on 30 June 2026 and will be transitioned into an industrial renewable energy hub.\n- \u00b7 Renewables primarily comprises hydroelectric power stations, the operation of solar power as well as wind power generation. Operational costs to maintain the wind farms are reported within Trading and Origination - Electricity to align with the gross margin of the related power purchase agreements.\n- \u00b7 Natural Gas includes the Surat Gas Project, the natural gas production assets at Camden in New South Wales, the Newcastle Gas Storage Facility and the Moranbah Gas Project. As of 30 June 2023, the Moranbah Gas Project and Surat Gas Project are held for sale. The Moranbah Gas Project divestment is expected to be completed by early 2024.\n- \u00b7 Other primarily consists of the Energy Hubs business focused on the development and construction of greenfield growth opportunities related to renewable and firming capacity, and technical and business support functions.\n\n## 5.2.1 Underlying EBIT\n\nIntegrated Energy Underlying EBIT was $753 million, up $110 million or 17.1%, largely due to higher gross margin from Trading and Origination - Gas. This was partly offset by lower gross margin from Trading and Origination - Electricity, an increase in Coal operating costs and an increase in depreciation and amortisation.\n\n|                                                           | FY23 $m   | FY22 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Gross margin                                              | 2,046     | 1,871     |\n| Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) | (762)     | (725)     |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                         | 1,284     | 1,146     |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                             | (531)     | (503)     |\n| Underlying EBIT                                           | 753       | 643       |\n\nGross margin was $2,046 million, up $175 million due to higher margin in the gas portfolio, as a result of high oil prices on a net long position, haulage optimisation, and the recovery of wholesale and consumer customer margin reflecting rising gas costs in recent years that were previously absorbed by AGL. In addition, the electricity portfolio benefited from higher contracted prices outside of Victoria, higher hydroelectric generation revenue, and lower volatility in May and June 2023. This was partly offset by exposure to high pool prices, mainly during the month of July 2022 when AGL was short electricity in the market, the major outage of Unit 2 at AGL Loy Yang and the retirement of three Units at Liddell Power Station in April 2023 resulting in lower generation, and higher coal generation costs.\n\nOperating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) were $(762) million, an increase of $37 million compared with the prior year due to higher labour costs driven by Enterprise Agreement wage escalations and increased costs to maintain plant availability across the thermal fleet. This was partly offset by labour efficiencies and the closure of Liddell Power Station in April 2023. For further details see Section 5.2.2.\n\n|",

In addition, in Eco Markets there was an increase in costs due to a lagged recovery of increasing LREC prices coupled with the timing of SREC compliance cost recovery from customers. Gross margin was also down due to higher input costs, primarily coal, gas and diesel costs as a result of recent international market events. This was partly offset by an increase in consumer and business customers contracted pricing, lower exposure to high pool prices during May and June 2023 compared to market events in 2022, and higher hydroelectric generation.\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Gas gross margin was $437 million, up 82.8%, driven by high oil prices on a net long position and haulage optimisation, the recovery of wholesale and consumer customer margin reflecting rising gas costs in recent years that were previously absorbed by AGL, and higher internal generation rates. This was partly offset by higher gas costs due to higher spot market purchases as a result of ROLR events in the first quarter of the year and higher oil-linked contract prices.\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Other Underlying EBITDA was $(31) million, up 22.5% mainly due to the realignment of the Decentralised Energy Resources business, higher orchestration revenue and labour efficiencies.\n- \u00b7 Coal Underlying EBITDA was $(440) million, down 8.4%, driven by higher costs to maintain plant availability, and increased labour costs due to Enterprise Agreement wage escalations. This was partly offset by the reduction in costs from the closure of Liddell Power Station, and labour efficiencies.\n- \u00b7 Gas Generation Underlying EBITDA was $(38) million, up 11.6%, predominantly driven by labour efficiencies.\n- \u00b7 Renewables Underlying EBITDA was $(26) million, down 44.4%, predominantly driven by increased labour costs due to Enterprise Agreement wage escalations, and higher maintenance costs, including an unplanned maintenance event at Clover Power Station.\n- \u00b7 Natural Gas Underlying EBITDA was $9 million, up $9 million, driven by higher gas sales at Camden and the Moranbah Gas Project, and lower field development costs for the Moranbah Gas Project. This was partly offset by increased costs of well workover activities in the Surat Basin.\n- \u00b7 Other Underlying EBITDA was $(56) million, down 36.6%, driven by the transfer of Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) function costs from Centrally Managed Expenses to Integrated Energy, and increased feasibility studies for the energy hub sites. This was partly offset by lower insurance premiums.",

These costs are not reallocated to AGL's operating segments because their management is the responsibility of various corporate functions.\n\nFollowing a structural review, certain costs associated with Telecommunications Technology and Corporate functions were transferred from Customer Markets to Centrally Managed Expenses, and the tranfer of the HSE function to Integrated Energy in the year.\n\nCentralised Managed Expenses Underlying EBIT was $(360) million, down 7.8%. This included the transfer of $(9) million of costs associated with the Telecommunication functions and $10 million of costs associated with the HSE function. Excluding the impact of transferred functions Underlying EBIT was down 8.0%, primarily due to the non-recurrence of benefits in the prior year, which included the movement in employee short term incentive provisions.

Portfolio Review Summary\n\nThe portfolio review for the Electricity (Section 6.2) and Gas (Section 6.3) businesses outlines the margin achieved for each of AGL's portfolios across operating segments, and demonstrates how value is generated within each business. The portfolio reviews in Section 6.2 and 6.3 start with volume information before summarising external customer revenue, customer network and other costs, fuel and gas costs net of hedging, and costs of managing and maintaining owned and contracted generation assets, to arrive at a portfolio's margin. A per unit rate ($/MWh for electricity and $/GJ for gas) is derived from each category of revenue and cost using the relevant associated volumes.\n\nThe tables in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 should be read in conjunction with Section 6.4 to reconcile the segmental revenue and costs allocated to each portfolio with Group Underlying EBIT.\n\n## 6.1 Portfolio Review Summary to Underlying Profit after Tax\n\nRestated\n\n|                                                              | FY23 $m   | FY22 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Electricity Portfolio                                        |           |           |\n| Total revenue                                                | 7,119     | 6,614     |\n| Customer network, green compliance, and other cost of sales  | (3,634)   | (3,447)   |\n| Fuel costs 1                                                 | (861)     | (823)     |\n| Generation running costs 1                                   | (804)     | (707)     |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                | (491)     | (471)     |\n| Net portfolio management                                     | (372)     | (146)     |\n| Electricity Portfolio Margin (a)                             | 957       | 1,020     |\n| Gas Portfolio                                                |           |           |\n| Total revenue                                                | 2,737     | 2,511     |\n| Customer network and other cost of sales                     | (587)     | (556)     |\n| Gas purchases                                                | (1,051)   | (1,104)   |\n| Haulage, storage and other                                   | (326)     | (342)     |\n| Gas Portfolio Margin                                         | 773       | 509       |\n| Natural Gas                                                  | 3         | (7)       |\n| Gas Portfolio Margin (including Natural Gas) (b)             | 776       | 502       |\n| Other AGL                                                    |           |           |\n| Other margin 2                                               | 62        | 64        |\n| Customer Markets operating costs                             | (536)     | (491)     |\n| Integrated Energy other operating costs                      | (89)      | (76)      |\n| Investments operating costs                                  | (20)      | (21)      |\n| Centrally Managed Expenses operating costs                   | (286)     | (259)     |\n| Other depreciation and amortisation                          | (231)     | (238)     |\n| Net finance costs                                            | (258)     | (217)     |\n| Income tax expense                                           | (100)     | (66)      |\n| Total Other AGL (c)                                          | (1,458)   | (1,304)   |\n| Underlying Profit after Tax (a + b + c)                      | 275       | 218       |\n| Non-controlling interests 3                                  | 6         | 7         |\n| Underlying Profit after tax attributable to AGL shareholders | 281       | 225       |",

Pool generation revenue is a function of volume and pool prices, which are set by the real-time market in each state. In the NEM, the total volume demanded by AGL customers is then purchased from the pool according to the geographical profile of customer demand and is reported as pool purchase volumes and costs. Where AGL's customer demand volumes exceed pool generation volumes, the generation volume deficit needs to be purchased from the pool by AGL.\n\n|                                                                                  | FY23 GWh   | FY22 GWh   | Movement %   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|\n| Pool purchase volume to satisfy Consumer customers                               | 15,362     | 15,145     | 1.4%         |\n| Pool purchase volume to satisfy Large Business customers and Wholesale customers | 23,969     | 24,953     | (3.9)%       |\n| Pool purchase volume 1                                                           | 39,331     | 40,098     | (1.9)%       |\n| Net generation volume (deficit)/surplus                                          | (2,394)    | 657        | (464.4)%     |\n| Pool generation volume                                                           | 36,937     | 40,755     | (9.4)%       |\n| Consumer customers sales                                                         | 14,537     | 14,371     | 1.2%         |\n| Large Business customers sales                                                   | 10,306     | 10,543     | (2.2)%       |\n| Wholesale customers sales                                                        | 13,307     | 14,042     | (5.2)%       |\n| Total customer sales volume                                                      | 38,150     | 38,956     | (2.1)%       |\n| Energy losses                                                                    | 1,181      | 1,142      | 3.4%         |\n| Pool purchase volume 1                                                           | 39,331     | 40,098     | (1.9)%       |\n\nRefer to Section 3.1.4 for commentary on generation volumes.\n\nRefer to Section 3.1.2 for commentary on customer energy demand.\n\n|                                | Portfolio Margin   | Portfolio Margin   | Per Unit   | Per Unit   | Volume Denomination   | Volume Denomination   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Revenue                        | FY23 $m            | FY22 $m            | FY23 $/MWh | FY22 $/MWh | FY23 GWh              | FY22 GWh              |\n| Consumer customers             | 4,248              | 3,975              | 292.2      | 276.6      | 14,537                | 14,371                |\n| Large Business customers       | 1,688              | 1,539              | 163.8      | 146.0      | 10,306                | 10,543                |\n| Wholesale customers 1          | 1,078              | 985                | 81.0       | 70.1       | 13,307                | 14,042                |\n| Operations (ancillary revenue) | 105                | 115                | -          | -          | -                     | -                     |\n| Total revenue                  | 7,119              | 6,614              | 186.6      | 169.8      | 38,150                | 38,956                |\n\nTotal revenue was $7,119 million, up 7.6%.\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue from Consumer customers was $4,248 million, up 6.9%, due to higher revenue rates and higher volumes.\n- \u00b7 Large Business customer revenue was $1,688 million, up 9.7%, primarily driven by an increase in average revenue rates due to an increase in wholesale electricity prices.\n- \u00b7 Wholesale customer revenue was $1,078 million, up 9.4%, primarily driven by an increase in green certificates sold compared to the prior year resulting in improved cash flow management through lower inventory being held.\n- \u00b7 Operations revenue was $105 million, down 8.7%, driven by lower external revenue from the sale of coal from AGL's mine at AGL Loy Yang to the Loy Yang B Power Station.\n\n|",

Governance Summary\n\nAGL is committed to ensuring that its corporate governance framework, policies and practices are of a high standard. Delivering on this commitment requires AGL to have a sound understanding of current governance requirements and practices, as well as being attuned to emerging governance trends and shifting stakeholder expectations. Set out below is a summary of selected aspects of AGL's corporate governance framework and a summary of key governance focus areas during FY23.\n\nThroughout FY23, AGL's corporate governance arrangements were consistent with the Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (4th edition) published by the ASX Corporate Governance Council. AGL's 2023 Corporate Governance Statement is available at agl.com.au/CorporateGovernance .\n\nAGL's 2023 Corporate Governance Statement outlines AGL's arrangements in relation to its Board, Board Committees, Executive Team, risk management framework and financial reporting, diversity and inclusion, key corporate governance policies and shareholder engagement.\n\n## 7.1 Board skills\n\nAGL seeks to maintain a Board of Directors with a broad range of skills, knowledge and experience necessary to provide effective oversight over management and guide the strategic direction of the Company. The Board uses a skills matrix to identify the key skills and experience the AGL Board is seeking to achieve in its membership. The skills matrix is updated regularly by each Director rating their skills, expertise and experience from 1 to 3 for each identified\n\nskill. The self-assessment ratings are subsequently considered and approved by the Board. The skills matrix as at 10 August 2023 is set out in Table 7.2.2.\n\nIn conducting the assessment, Directors were assessed using the following skills rating levels:\n\nSignificant Experience - regarded to have expert or highly qualified proficiency, knowledge and experience in the subject matter or domain and has been seen to contribute these skills in Board and Committee conversations and critical thinking.\n\nDeveloped Understanding - developed a sound working knowledge and understanding of the subject matter through either past executive or management roles, extensive on-the-job application of skills in Board and Committee activities and/or through training and professional development activities.\n\nGeneral Familiarity - possesses an awareness and base literacy around the subject/topic and its relevance to the organisation and the Board.\n\nIndividual Director assessments were aggregated to inform an assessment of the overall level of capability represented across the Board in each of the identified priority areas.\n\nIn the eleven identified areas, the Board as a whole was rated either as having Significant Experience or Developed Understanding.\n\nFurther details about AGL's Board Skills Matrix are set out in AGL's 2023 Corporate Governance Statement available at agl.com.au/CorporateGovernance .\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## Message from the Chair of the People & Performance Committee\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for AGL Energy Limited (AGL) and its consolidated entities for the year ended 30 June 2023 (FY23).\n\n## Dear fellow shareholders,\n\nAs this is my first Remuneration Report as Chair of the People and Performance Committee (the Committee), I would like to acknowledge the significant contribution made by Diane SmithGander as Chair prior to my appointment, and her stewardship of all Committee matters.\n\n## A year of review and renewal\n\nFY23 has been a year of significant change and renewal for AGL, reflective of the pivotal period for the broader energy industry as the transition from fossil fuels to a reliable, low carbon energy future evolves. During FY23, AGL set out a revised strategy, provided clarification of longer-term objectives, and had a period of material Board and management renewal.\n\nAs Chair of the Committee, one of my first tasks was to oversee a review of the AGL executive remuneration framework to ensure it aligns with and will drive the AGL strategy and the commitments made through the Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP). The refinements to the framework are outlined below with further detail provided in Section 8.1.1.\n\n## The 'strike' against the FY22 Remuneration Report and changes to the remuneration framework\n\nIn light of the first 'strike' that AGL received at the AGM in relation to the FY22 Remuneration Report, we have spent time engaging with and listening to our stakeholders' feedback on the remuneration framework and disclosures. Our responses are provided in Section 8.1.\n\nDuring these engagements with stakeholders, we discussed the refinements to the remuneration framework to ensure that there is common understanding of the rationale for the changes.\n\nThe refinements for FY24 have been received positively by stakeholders and are perceived to be appropriate in aligning with AGL's strategic objectives.\n\nDetails of the changes are provided in Section 8.1.1 and are designed to enhance the focus on progressing longer-term decarbonisation objectives whilst maintaining strong cashflows to support future growth and shareholder returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In summary:\n\n- \u00b7 The strategic objectives in the STI scorecard for the Managing Director & CEO (MD & CEO) will increase in weighting from 15% to 20%, aligned with the other executive key management personnel (KMP) to deliver incremental progress against longerterm decarbonisation objectives and future growth;\n- \u00b7 Operating free cash flow will be introduced as a second financial metric, alongside Underlying Profit after tax, to ensure the operational core generates strong cashflows to support future investment in growth;\n- \u00b7 The carbon transition metrics in the LTI plan will increase in weighting from 25% to 30% to enhance the focus on the commitments to decarbonisation made through the CTAP; and\n- \u00b7 The carbon transition metrics have been refined to align with the CTAP commitments.\n\nThese changes will be implemented for FY24 and will be fully detailed in the Remuneration Report next year.\n\nWe continue to engage with stakeholders and look forward to receiving further feedback on our FY23 Remuneration Report as we work to improve our remuneration framework and disclosures.\n\n## Linking FY23 remuneration outcomes to performance\n\nThe Board has determined that the overall remuneration outcomes for FY23 are reflective of and aligned to shareholder experience.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nThe fixed remuneration of both Damien Nicks and Gary Brown, upon appointment as MD & CEO and Chief Financial Officer respectively, was established with reference to market benchmarks but also reflective of their relative experience. This aligns with the AGL approach of establishing an executive's fixed remuneration initially at a level reflecting their experience that allows progressive increases to apply as the executive performs and becomes more experienced in their role.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## Short-term incentives (STI)\n\nThe performance outcomes in the STI scorecard for the year are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Underlying Profit after tax was $ 281m , within the guidance range. This outcome reflects the performance of our generation assets in the second half, the strong performance of our gas portfolio, as well as improvements in customer margin due to disciplined margin management.\n- \u00b7 An increase in recordable injuries occurred in Q4 FY23 resulting in a below target outcome in both the employee/contractor total injury frequency rate (TIFR) and for the serious impact and fatality potential metric, with no fatalities or serious injuries to employees or contractors.\n- \u00b7 Strategic Net Promoter Score (NPS) increased to +5 , the highest AGL has achieved in a high price environment, and there were improvements in the NPS of two events for which AGL customer advocacy is measured compared with FY22.\n- \u00b7 Our employee engagement score increased from 57% in FY22 to 67 %, reflective of our renewed purpose and values, positive sentiment around a clearer future direction and a returned focus on our people programs following a period of uncertainty.\n\nThis resulted in STI outcomes of 73.8% of maximum for the MD & CEO and between 72.1% and 73.8% of maximum for other executives.\n\nThe Board believes this provides a commensurate level of reward to executives for delivering the above performance outcomes and establishing the roadmap for the longer-term strategic objectives for AGL.\n\n## Long-term incentives (LTI)\n\nThe FY20 long-term incentive (LTI) grant, the first LTI offer with the four-year performance period, was tested at the end of FY23. The relative TSR and ROE hurdles were not met and therefore there will be no vesting. This is in line with the shareholder experience over the period of the grant. This is the third consecutive year with zero vesting of LTI (the FY19, FY20 Bridging and FY20 LTI Offers).\n\n## Other remuneration arrangements\n\nIn August 2022, the Board determined that, with the ongoing uncertainty following the withdrawal of the proposed demerger, and the announcement that the previous MD & CEO would be stepping down, retention awards were necessary for both Damien Nicks and Markus Brokhof, Chief Operating Officer, to ensure continuity of leadership for operations and to mitigate the risks of further destabilisation of the executive team. Details are provided in Section 8.4.4. Upon appointment to the MD & CEO role, Mr Nicks opted to forfeit his award in recognition of the opportunity and the increase in remuneration provided by the new role.\n\nNon-Executive Director fees remained unchanged in FY23. The last fee change was in January 2020.\n\n## The year ahead\n\nDuring FY23, in addition to the review of strategy, the publication of the CTAP and the review of the remuneration framework, we also launched our new purpose and values, further underlining the reset for the business and employees alike. FY24 presents an opportunity to embed these elements into AGL's foundations to support the delivery of our long-term goals.\n\nThe AGL employee value proposition remains key to attracting, retaining and rewarding those people who can deliver our long-term goals and the remuneration framework remains a key factor in driving performance while enabling the innovation necessary for the energy transition. The Board will continue to review and monitor remuneration structures and performance metrics to ensure they align with AGL's strategic objectives.\n\nWe welcome your feedback on the remuneration practices and disclosures for AGL and look forward to your support at our 2023 AGM.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Graham Cockroft\n\nChair, People & Performance Committee\n\n|",

The table below summarises the key concerns and issues raised during the engagements with investors and proxy advisors with regard to FY22, noting that proxy advisors were broadly supportive of the FY22 Remuneration Report.\n\n| Concern                                                                                                                                         | Response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Short-term Incentives                                                                                                                           | Short-term Incentives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| The FY22 STI outcomes did not reflect the costs associated with the withdrawn demerger                                                          | Over the course of FY22, a considerable amount of focus for management was on the preparation for, and the implementation of the proposed demerger and progressing Board-approved strategic goals.

The Board considered that the FY22 STI outcomes reflected overall performance of AGL and management in this context.   |\n| Long-term Incentives                                                                                                                            | Long-term Incentives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| The performance metrics in the FY23 LTI offer did not reflect the outcomes of the strategic review or the Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) | Following the outcomes of the strategic review, announced on 29 September 2022, the Board determined to undertake a broader review of the remuneration framework to ensure it remains fit-for-purpose in delivering long-term value for shareholders and driving the energy transition.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## 8.1.1 Refinements to the remuneration framework for FY24\n\nFollowing the 2022 strategic review, publication and approval of the inaugural CTAP, the AGL Board committed to a review of the remuneration framework to ensure that it continues to be fit-for-purpose and delivers long-term value for shareholders whilst driving the transition. The review of the framework included the performance metrics in both the short-term and long-term incentives as the alignment of these with strategy is key to delivering against both annual and longer-term objectives.\n\nThe refined remuneration framework for AGL is designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Enhance the focus on strategic measures to deliver progress against longer-term decarbonisation objectives and support future growth\n- \u00b7 Maintain the focus on the operational core to generate strong cashflows that support delivery of future growth and shareholder returns, and\n- \u00b7 Create long-term shareholder value\n\nThe refinements being made to the remuneration framework for the financial year ending 30 June 2024 (FY24) are outlined below.\n\n## FY24 Short-term incentive refinements\n\n- \u00b7 Operating free cash flow will be added to the STI scorecard as a financial performance metric, equally weighted with Underlying Profit after tax. This is to sharpen the focus on the operational core to generate cashflows to support delivery of future growth objectives.\n- \u00b7 An increase to the weighting of the strategic objectives in the performance scorecard for the Managing Director & CEO from 15% to 20%, with the weighting of the financial metric decreasing from 60% to 55%, to enhance the focus on delivering incremental progress against longer-term decarbonisation objectives and future growth. These weightings align with the other executive KMP.\n\n## FY24 Long-term incentive refinements\n\n- \u00b7 For the FY24 LTI offer, the weighting of the carbon transition metrics will increase from 25% to 30% , with relative TSR decreasing to 70%. This is to enhance alignment of the performance metrics with the delivery of the long-term decarbonisation objectives, whilst also creating shareholder value.\n- \u00b7 The carbon transition metrics have been refined for the FY24 LTI offer to ensure they are aligned with the CTAP and the long-term focus for AGL to progressively decarbonise its asset portfolio with new renewable and firming capacity and to support electrification and customer transition to a low carbon future. In this context, determining the appropriate carbon transition metrics is a critical element in driving progress towards these clear objectives. The carbon transition metrics for the FY24 LTI offer are detailed in Section 8.3.4.\n\nDuring FY23, the Board engaged with investors and proxy advisors on these refinements and generally received support from stakeholders.",

This may or may not result in an increase for executives.\n\n## Are there any other considerations in setting fixed remuneration?\n\n- \u00b7 AGL is committed to gender pay equity across employees, including executives. There are no gender pay gaps in fixed remuneration for current executives in roles of equivalent size, based on relative experience.\n\n|",

The performance metrics also applied to the former Managing Director & CEO for time served in FY23.\n\n## For FY23:\n\n- \u00b7 Underlying Profit after tax is the key financial measure to drive shareholder returns and operate as efficiently as possible in the market within which AGL operates.\n- \u00b7 The group operational measures are focused on safety, customer and employee engagement and are aligned with AGL's Business Value Drivers.\n- \u00b7 The strategic objectives focus on key initiatives to drive the long-term value creation for shareholders.\n\n## How are performance targets established?\n\n- \u00b7 Annual performance targets are determined with reference to a number of inputs: the previous year's performance outcomes, external market conditions, and longer-term business forecasts. Performance targets are set at levels which are considered to be a \"stretch\" in the context of these inputs, stretched beyond business as usual performance standards.\n- \u00b7 The STI target range for net profit after tax is established early in the financial year based on AGL's budget and the perceived degree of difficulty in that budget based on internal forecasts and prevailing market conditions at that time.\n- \u00b7 AGL's budget may not reflect the market guidance range. Guidance is generally released at the time of AGL's results in August and may change during the year. Guidance provides one input into determining the STI target and can have a broader range than incentive targets.\n\n## What is the FY23 award opportunity?\n\n- \u00b7 The opportunities for STI awards, as a % of fixed remuneration, are as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTarget\n\nMaximum\n\nNote : the Managing Director & CEO opportunity shown is for Mr Nicks from appointment to the role on a permanent basis, from 19 January 2023.

The Board may adjust Statutory Profit in consideration of any non-cash fair value movements in financial instruments and non-recurring significant items that materially affect AGL's financial results to derive Underlying Profit after tax. This is to ensure that management are not unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged by items outside their control.\n- \u00b7 The Board expects an executive delivering against all performance objectives to achieve STI outcomes at their target levels given that performance targets are set at \"stretch\" levels.\n- \u00b7 The Board applies discretion in the treatment of any significant items and their impact on outcomes against performance targets and subsequent STI awards. Discretion guidelines were implemented in FY21 to formalise this approach.\n\n## How are STI awards delivered?\n\n- \u00b7 Awards are delivered as a mix of cash and Restricted Shares (no performance conditions apply, restrictions lift after two years):\n- -Managing Director & CEO : 50% cash and 50% Restricted Shares\n- -Other executives : 75% cash and 25% Restricted Shares\n- -Former Managing Director & CEO: 100% cash\n- \u00b7 Restricted Shares carry voting rights and are entitled to receive dividends.\n\n## What happens upon cessation of employment?\n\n- \u00b7 When an executive leaves the organisation prior to the STI payment date by way of resignation or dismissal for cause, the executive would not be eligible to receive any STI award for the relevant year.\n- \u00b7 Where the Board determines that an executive is a \"good leaver\" they may be entitled to a pro-rated award for the year. The grant and treatment of Restricted Shares is subject to Board discretion.\n- \u00b7 Generally, Restricted Shares will be subject to forfeiture if an executive resigns prior to the restrictions lifting.\n\n## 8.3.4 Long-term incentive\n\n## What is the purpose of the LTI?\n\n- \u00b7 The objective of the LTI is to reward executives for delivering long-term performance, to encourage shareholding and deliver long-term value creation for shareholders.\n- \u00b7 The performance metrics are selected to align with the AGL purpose of supporting progress for all its stakeholders.\n\n## What are the performance measures?\n\nTwo performance measures apply to the FY23 LTI offer:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1. Relative TSR: A comparative, external market performance benchmark against the companies in the S&P/ASX100 Index. Provides a direct link between executive reward and shareholder return.\n- 2. Carbon transition metrics: Provides the focus for executives to deliver against carbon transition objectives. Comprises three sub-metrics to ensure a balanced assessment.\n\nThe vesting schedules are provided below under FY23 offer - terms.\n\n## What is the performance period?\n\n- \u00b7 The performance metrics are measured either over a four-year period or at the end of the four-year period (1 July 2022 - 30 June 2026).\n- \u00b7 All performance measures are to be tested once at the end of the performance period to determine the vesting percentage.\n\n|",

Relative TSR: independent assessment of TSR by external advisors is undertaken, based on 30-day average VWAP, and provides the outcome for the Board to consider the final evaluation of performance.\n- 2. Carbon transition: internal calculations are undertaken and are subject to limited assurance by external auditors on an annual basis. Revenue from green electricity and carbon neutral products and services is derived from the reported revenue. The Board determines the final outcome.\n\n## How are the LTI awards delivered?\n\nAwards are delivered in Performance Rights. Participants are not entitled to receive dividends.\n\n## What happens upon cessation of employment?\n\n- \u00b7 Generally, unvested Performance Rights lapse if a participant ceases employment with AGL before the end of the performance period (i.e. through resignation).\n- \u00b7 Where the Board determines that an executive is a \"good leaver\" they may be entitled to retain a pro-rated number of Performance Rights which remain subject to the plan rules until performance testing at the end of the performance period.\n\n## FY23 offer - terms\n\n## Relative TSR vesting schedule\n\n| AGL's relative TSR ranking against comparator group   | Vesting of award (% of maximum)            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Less than 50th percentile                             | 0%                                         |\n| 50th percentile to 75th percentile                    | Straight-line vesting between 50% and 100% |\n| At or above 75th percentile                           | 100%                                       |\n\n## Carbon transition vesting schedules\n\n| Controlled intensity at 30 June 2026   | Vesting of award (% of maximum)            | % Controlled renewable & storage electricity capacity at 30 June 2026   | Vesting of award (% of maximum)            | Green energy & carbon neutral products & services in FY26   | Vesting of award (% of maximum)            |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| More than 0.875 (tCO2e/MWh)            | 0%                                         | Less than 30.8% (of total controlled generation)                        | 0%                                         | Less than 22.2% (of total revenue)                          | 0%                                         |\n| 0.875 to 0.800                         | Straight-line vesting between 50% and 100% | 30.8% to 39.8%                                                          | Straight-line vesting between 50% and 100% | 22.2% to 27.0%                                              | Straight-line vesting between 50% and 100% |\n| Less than 0.800                        | 100%                                       | More than 39.8%                                                         | 100%                                       | More than 27.0%                                             | 100%                                       |",

Mr Nicks' fixed remuneration was established around 10% lower than the previous incumbent in the role. In his prior role as Chief Financial Officer, Mr Nicks was provided with a 3.2% increase in fixed remuneration effective 1 July 2022, to align with market benchmarks for that role at the time.\n- \u00b7 Similarly, the fixed remuneration for Mr Brown, upon appointment to the Chief Financial Officer on a permanent basis, was set with reference to market benchmarks in peer companies.\n- \u00b7 No other changes were made to executives' fixed remuneration levels during FY23.\n\n## 8.4.2 FY23 STI outcomes\n\nThe group STI scorecard outcomes are detailed in Table 8.4.2.1, and the individual strategic objective outcomes are shown in the subsequent tables.\n\n## Group performance objectives and FY23 outcomes\n\n- \u00b7 Financial: Underlying Profit after tax was $281m, in line with expectations and within guidance. This outcome reflects the performance of our generation assets in the second half, the strong performance of our gas portfolio, as well as improvements in customer margin due to disciplined margin management and an increase in customer services. This is partly offset by higher operating costs due to increased maintenance costs, seasonal bad debt expense and the impact of inflation.\n- \u00b7 Safety: Total injury frequency rate was 2.8 per million hours worked, up from 2.1 for FY22, impacted by a high rate of recordable injuries in Q4 FY23. The serious impact and fatality ratio was 1.9:1, a decline compared to 2.8:1 for FY22.\n- \u00b7 Customer: The AGL Net Promoter Score (NPS) has continued the progress made in FY22 with an outcome of +5. AGL ranked #1 against tier 1 competitors in Queensland and Western Australia. Despite rising energy costs, event NPS, which measures the advocacy of customers that have recently completed a specific task with AGL, has improved for two of the events measured.\n- \u00b7 Employee engagement: an engagement score of 67%, up from 57% in FY22, is reflective of the sentiment around the renewed purpose and employee values, a clearer strategic direction and increased stability following a prolonged period of uncertainty.\n\nThe FY23 STI scorecard results in STI outcomes of between 72.1% and 73.8% of maximum for executives. As outlined in Section 8.3.3, when considering the STI outcomes for executives, the Board takes into account the scorecard results, how those outcomes were achieved, and the experience of shareholders over the period. FY23 has been challenging for AGL with a significant 'reset' of the organisation following the strategic review. The Loy Yang A Unit 2 outage continued to impact results for the first half of FY23 but management have delivered a stronger second half with much improved availability and an increase in customer services. After detailed consideration, the Board determined that the outcomes appropriately reflect the company's performance and executive's contributions against the scorecard for the year and has elected not to exercise discretion to adjust the outcomes.",

This was to be provided as 50% cash and 50% equity in August 2023. Upon appointment to the Managing Director & CEO role in January 2023, Mr Nicks opted to forfeit this retention award in full in recognition of the opportunity and increase in remuneration provided by the new role.\n- \u00b7 Mr Brokhof was provided with a retention award of $450,000, to be paid 50% ($225,000) in cash in August 2023, and 50% ($225,000) delivered in equity in August 2023.\n\n|",

Arrangements are in place to ensure any advice is independent of management.\n- \u00b7 During FY23, the Committee engaged EY to act as independent remuneration advisers. EY did not provide any remuneration recommendations as defined in the Corporations Act 2001 to the People & Performance Committee during FY23.\n\n## Further details\n\n- \u00b7 The complete People & Performance Charter is reviewed at least every two years and is available on AGL's website: agl.com.au/BoardAndCommitteeCharters .\n\n## 8.5.2 Management of risk and remuneration\n\nThe AGL remuneration framework is designed to ensure that executives focus on delivering against the strategic objectives, ensuring that company and shareholder outcomes are primary considerations in the decision-making processes. The framework is structured to mitigate against any excessive risk-taking or short-term decisions by executives through the establishment of scorecard metrics that align with strategic objectives. The use of deferred equity in both the short and long-term incentive plans, and the clawback provisions within those equity plans also assists the company in managing risk.",

This discretion ensures that the quantum of executive remuneration is appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Discretion guidelines provide a framework to assist the Board with identifying one-off/extraordinary circumstances (e.g. impairments) and whether those circumstances require an adjustment to incentive outcomes. The guidelines support consistency in application over time and does not limit the Board's overarching discretion under AGL's incentive plans.\n\n## 8.5.4 KMP share ownership\n\nTo provide for shareholder alignment, AGL operates a minimum shareholding policy for KMP and other executives reporting to the Managing Director & CEO, subject to compliance with AGL's Securities Dealing Policy. Shareholdings are reported in Table 8.7.2 for executive KMP and Table 8.8.4 for Non-Executive Directors.\n\nThe minimum shareholding policies stipulate the following requirements:\n\n|                         | Shareholding requirement   | Period to satisfy requirement                                                                                            |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Non-Executive Directors | 100% of base annual fee    | Four years; 50% within two years of appointment; encouraged to hold 10% by the end of the financial year of appointment. |\n| Executives              |                            |                                                                                                                          |\n| Managing Director & CEO | 100% of fixed remuneration | Up to five years from their initial appointment date to an eligible role.                                                |\n| CFO                     | 75% of fixed remuneration  | Up to five years from their initial appointment date to an eligible role.                                                |\n| Other executives        | 50% of fixed remuneration  | Up to five years from their initial appointment date to an eligible role.                                                |\n\n|",

The fee pool is regularly reviewed by the Board and, if appropriate, adjusted (subject to shareholder approval), having regard to the anticipated time commitment, workload and responsibilities attached and the fees paid by comparable organisations. The current fee pool was approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM.\n\n## 8.8.2 Fee policy\n\nNon-Executive Directors receive a base fee. Members of a Committee receive a Committee fee to recognise the associated higher workload and extra responsibilities, and chairing a Committee attracts a higher fee. The Chair of the Board receives a higher base fee in recognition of the added responsibility and time commitment; but does not receive any extra fees for participating in or chairing any Committees. Fees are inclusive of superannuation. There are no additional fees in relation to the Nominations Committee.\n\nIn setting Non-Executive Directors' fees, the Board considers the following:\n\n- \u00b7 time commitment\n- \u00b7 workload\n- \u00b7 risk and responsibility\n- \u00b7 market benchmark data, sourced from companies with market capitalisation of 50-200% of AGL's\n\nTo ensure independence, Non-Executive Directors do not receive performance-related remuneration. This allows the Board to focus on governance and both short and long-term strategy.\n\n## 8.8.3 FY23 fees\n\nFees for Non-Executive Directors remained unchanged during the financial year.\n\n| Board/Committee                   | Chair fee $   | Member fee $   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Board base fee                    | 603,000       | 201,000        |\n| Audit & Risk Management Committee | 55,200        | 27,600         |\n| People & Performance Committee    | 44,900        | 21,200         |\n| Safety & Sustainability Committee | 44,900        | 21,200         |",

        "page_content": "## Other Required Disclosures\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\nThese Other Required Disclosures (pages 82 to 83) are attached to and form part of the Directors' Report.\n\n## 9. Other Required Disclosures\n\n## 9.1 Changes in state of affairs\n\nIn the opinion of the Directors there were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the AGL consolidated entity that occurred during the financial year other than those included in this Directors' Report.\n\n## 9.2 Proceedings on behalf of the company\n\nNo person has applied under Section 237 of the Corporations Act for leave of the Court to bring proceedings on behalf of AGL or intervene in any proceedings to which AGL is a party for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of AGL for all or any part of those proceedings. AGL was not a party to any such proceedings during the year.\n\n## 9.3 Commercial in confidence information\n\nFurther information about likely developments in the operations of AGL and its consolidated entity and the expected results of those operations in the future has been included in this Directors' Report except to the extent disclosure of the information would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the consolidated entity.\n\nThe type of information not disclosed includes commercial in confidence information such as detailed operational plans and strategies that would provide third parties with a commercial advantage.\n\n## 9.4 Auditor and non-audit services\n\nNon-audit services have been provided during the year by the external auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Australia ( Deloitte ). Disclosure of the details of these services can be found in Note 26 of the Financial Report 2023.\n\nThe Board has a formal policy on the provision of auditing and related services. Specifically, the external auditor is precluded from providing any services that might threaten its independence or conflict with its assurance and compliance role. Semi-annual reports on the provision of auditing and related services are provided to the Board through the Audit & Risk Management Committee. The Directors are satisfied that the provision of other accounting advice and services by the external auditor is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors.\n\nThe policy and procedures in place, and the review by the Audit & Risk Management Committee, enable the Directors to conclude that non-audit services provided did not compromise the external auditor's independence requirements of the Corporations Act.\n\nThe external auditor annually provides a letter to the Company Secretary on its independence within the meaning of relevant legislation and professional standards. No officers of AGL were partners or directors of Deloitte during this or prior periods.\n\n## 9.5 Rounding\n\nAGL is an entity to which ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191 applies and, in accordance with that Instrument, amounts in the Financial Report and this Directors' Report have been rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 9.6 Auditor's Independence Declaration\n\nA copy of the external auditor's declaration under Section 307C of the Corporations Act in relation to the audit for the financial year is attached to the AGL Financial Report 2023.\n\n## 9.7 Indemnification and insurance of officers\n\nAGL's constitution indemnifies, to the extent permitted by law, officers of the consolidated entity when acting in their capacity in respect of:\n\n- \u00b7 liability to third parties (other than related entities) when acting in good faith; and\n- \u00b7 costs and expenses of successfully defending legal proceedings and ancillary matters.\n\nThe Directors named earlier in this Report and the Company Secretary have the benefit of the indemnity, together with any other person concerned in, or who takes part in, the management of the consolidated entity.\n\nDuring the year, AGL paid premiums in respect of contracts insuring all Directors of AGL as listed earlier, all Directors of related bodies corporate of AGL, secretaries and other Officers of the consolidated entity against liabilities incurred in their capacity as Director or Officer, as the case may be, of the consolidated entity.\n\nThe contract prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liabilities covered and the amount of premium.\n\n## 9.8 Subsequent events\n\nApart from the matters identified in the financial statements or notes thereto, there has not been any other matter or circumstance that has arisen since the end of the financial year, that has significantly affected or may significantly affect the operations of AGL, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of AGL in future financial periods.\n\n## 9.9 Non-IFRS Financial Information\n\nThe Operating & Financial Review attached to and forming part of this Directors' Report includes a number of non-International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial measures. AGL management uses these non-IFRS financial measures to assess the performance of the business and make decisions on the allocation of resources.\n\nPrincipal among these non-IFRS financial measures is Underlying Profit. This measure is Statutory Profit/(Loss) adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 significant items (which are material items of revenue or expense that are unrelated to the underlying performance of the business); and\n- \u00b7 changes in the fair value of financial instruments recognised in the statement of profit or loss (to remove the volatility caused by mismatches in valuing financial instruments and the underlying asset differently).\n\nAGL believes that Underlying Profit provides a better understanding of its financial performance than Statutory Profit/(Loss) and allows for a more relevant comparison of financial performance between financial periods.\n\n|",

AGL's policy for reporting Underlying Profit is consistent with this guidance. The Directors have had the consistency of the application of the policy reviewed by the external auditor of AGL.\n\n## 9.10 Corporate governance\n\nA copy of AGL's Corporate Governance Statement can be found on the AGL website at agl.com.au/CorporateGovernance .\n\n## 9.11 Environmental regulation\n\nAGL's businesses are subject to a range of environmental laws and regulations as well as project and site-specific environmental permits and approvals issued at both the federal and state government levels.\n\nOn 17 July 2022, at Bayswater Power Station during a Hunter River Salinity Trading Scheme (HRSTS) discharge from a Licenced discharge point from the Lake Liddell Seepage Return System, the maximum discharge rate (136.03 ML/day) was exceeded by 3.47 ML/day for 5 hours and 13 minutes. This event contravened Environment Protection Licence 779 (EPL) Condition E1.3.  On 19 July 2022, AGL Macquarie Pty Ltd (AGLM) notified the NSW Environment Protection Authority (NSW EPA).  AGLM undertook a review of HRSTS operating procedures and included a new risk mitigation action to close off the discharge valve between discharge periods, unless a discharge instruction was received from Water NSW.  On 16 August 2022, NSW EPA issued AGLM with an Official Caution for the alleged contravention of the EPL and the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW) .\n\nOn 30 July 2022, AGL Gas Storage Pty Ltd (AGLGS) became aware of a loss of containment of sales-quality gas within AGL's Wallumbilla LPG Plant.  It is estimated that 0.5TJ of gas (98% methane) was released to atmosphere.  On 1 August 2022, AGLGS notified the Department of Environment and Science (DES) of the event.  The plant was repaired and hydrotested to confirm its integrity.  On 25 August 2022, DES issued AGLGS with a formal warning for a contravention of section 430(3) of the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (QLD) which states that a person must not contravene a condition of the EA.\n\nOn 27 September 2022, AGLGS was notified by a landholder of a loss of containment event along the Sirrah Pipeline within AGL's Silver Springs Gas Field.  The event involved the release of approximately 46kg of natural gas to the atmosphere and 2,000-5,000 litres of produced water (98% produced water, 2% hydrocarbon condensate) from a pipe wall defect in the Sirrah Pipeline.  On 28 September 2022, AGLGS notified the DES.  AGLGS immediately isolated the pipeline and conducted a clean-up and rehabilitation of the impacted area. AGLGS then developed an inspection, repair and corrosion mitigation plan for the continued safe operation of the Sirrah Pipeline to prevent recurrence.  On 21 February 2023, DES issued AGLGS with a Penalty Infringement Notice (PIN) for contravention of Condition E1 of the EA.\n\nBetween 25 November and 1 December 2022, an event occurred at Bayswater Power Station, where a discharge of saline water from the Lake Liddell Seepage Return System entered Bayswater Creek.  On 30 November 2022, AGLM notified the NSW EPA of the event.  In response AGLM implemented two Pollution Reduction Programs on the Bayswater Environment Protection Licence 779 (EPL).  On 8 February 2023, the NSW EPA issued AGLM with a Penalty Infringement Notice (PIN) for contravention of Condition O2.1 of the EPL and a formal warning for delayed notification to NSW EPA.\n\nOn 5 April 2023, the NSW EPA issued a Formal Warning Letter to AGL Upstream Investments Pty Ltd (AGL Upstream) in relation to a contravention of the Petroleum (ONSHORE) Act 1991 (NSW) for the Camden Gas Project Petroleum Operations Plan (POP) during the period of 1 July 2022 to 15 September 2022.  For background, the POPs apply for a financial year.  Each year, AGL prepares a POP during June and submits by 30 June to the Resources Regulator and EPA for approval and for implementation during the following financial year. Understanding that it takes time for the Departments to review the new POP, during the period in question, AGL Upstream had submitted its revised POP but also requested an extension to the existing POP so that it could remain valid until the next POP was approved. The Resources Regulator approved the POP on 15 September 2022.  However due to the Departments approval processing, the existing POP ceased to be valid during this period. EPA NSW issued a formal warning letter for this occurring.  AGL Upstream considered this warning unreasonable as approval was in the Department's hands (i.e. out of AGL Upstream's control). Following receipt of the formal Warning Letter, AGL prepared the next POP earlier than usual, which was approved on 2 June 2023 until 31 December 2023.\n\n## Approval of Directors' Report\n\nThis Directors' Report is made in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors and is signed for and on behalf of the Board this 10th day of August 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Patricia McKenzie\n\nChair\n\n10 August 2023",

Segment information\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nAGL manages its business in three key operating segments:\n\n## Segments\n\n- \u00b7 Customer Markets comprises the Consumer and Large Business customer portfolios responsible for the retailing of electricity, gas, broadband/mobile/voice, solar and energy efficiency products and services to residential, small and large business customers. Customer Markets sources its energy from Integrated Energy at transfer prices that reflect wholesale energy costs in each state, along with other energy costs such as those arising from environmental schemes. Customer Markets also includes sales, marketing, brand, and AGL's customer contact and call centre operations.\n- \u00b7 Integrated Energy operates AGL's power generation portfolio and other key assets, including coal, gas and renewable generation facilities, natural gas storage and production facilities, and development projects. Integrated Energy runs a large trading operation to manages price risk associated with procuring electricity and gas for AGL's customers, manages AGL's obligations in relation to renewable energy schemes, and controls the dispatch of AGL's owned and contracted generation assets, gas offtake agreements and associated portfolio of energy hedging products.\n- \u00b7 Investments comprises AGL's interests in the ActewAGL Retail Partnership, Tilt Renewables, Energy Impact Partners Europe, Ovo Energy Australia Pty Ltd and other investments.\n\nIn the segment financial results, the 'Other' category consists of various Corporate activities. These are not considered to be reportable segments.\n\n## Segment financial results\n\nThe measurement of segment results is in line with the basis of information presented to the Board of Directors for internal management reporting purposes. The performance of each segment is measured based on their Underlying earnings before interest and tax (Underlying EBIT) contribution to AGL. Certain items of income and expense are excluded from the segment results to show a measure of underlying performance. These items include changes in fair value of financial instruments and significant items.\n\nAASB 8 Operating Segments requires AGL to report segment information on the same basis as the internal management structure. As a result, the Customer Markets segment reports the revenue and margin associated with satisfying the gas, electricity and telecommunication requirements of AGL consumer and business customer portfolio and Integrated Energy reports the revenue, expenses and margin related to AGL's operating sites and AGL's wholesale energy portfolio.\n\n|",

Operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of AGL that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance. The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.\n\n## 2.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nAGL's primary revenue streams relate to the retail sale of electricity and gas to residential (consumer) and business customers in Australia, the sale of electricity and gas to wholesale customers in Australia and the sale of generated electricity to the National Electricity Market in Australia. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which AGL expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nThe majority of contractual energy supply arrangements with customers have no fixed duration, generally require no minimum consumption by the customer and are able to be terminated by either party at any time without incurring significant penalty. Given this, the enforceable contracts are considered short term (less than 12 months) in nature. There are some longer term contracts particularly those with business and wholesale customers.\n\nAGL has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\n\nAGL's primary performance obligations are the supply of energy (electricity or gas) over the contractual term. There are either individual contracts representing separate purchasing decisions of customers, or the units of supply of energy represent a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and hence is considered one performance obligation satisfied over time. For the shorter term contracts, the performance obligations are considered to be satisfied, and revenue is recognised, as and when the units of energy are delivered. Additionally, in relation to AGL's longer term contracts, AGL determines that the right-toinvoice approach to measure the progress towards completion of the performance obligation is most appropriate as it depicts AGL's performance. AGL uses the units of energy delivered to the customer as estimated as part of the unbilled process (and later verified by meter readings) or as indicated by the customer's energy meter (where these are known more frequently).\n\nIn most instances, the transaction price is determined by the unbilled process. For some wholesale contracts, AGL also considers the effects of variable consideration and for some business sales, there is non-cash consideration and consideration payable to the customer relating to renewable energy certificates (RECs).\n\n## Electricity and Gas revenue Consumer electricity and gas sales\n\nConsumer energy sales relate to the sale of energy (electricity and gas) to retail customers. Consumer sales are classified as individual, short term, day-by-day contracts and are recognised as revenue on a day-by-day basis upon delivery of energy to customers.\n\nWhere the customers are eligible to receive additional discounts (e.g. pay on time discounts to encourage timely payment of energy invoices), AGL considers this to be variable consideration, which is estimated as part of the unbilled process.\n\n## Portfolio approach for consumer electricity and gas sales\n\nAGL recognises revenue from contracts with its consumers at the electricity and gas portfolio levels. Furthermore, AGL has elected to apply the portfolio approach in accounting for the fair valuing of RECs, accounting for connection fees and sales commissions. Recognition at the portfolio level would not differ materially from applying the standard on a contract-by-contract basis.\n\n## Business electricity and gas sales\n\nBusiness sales represent the sale of energy to business customers. Revenue recognition is largely consistent with consumer sales. These contracts are longer term in nature and represent a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and are treated as one performance obligation satisfied over time based on the output delivered to the customer. For a large majority of business sales customers, revenue is recognised when AGL has the 'right to invoice' the customer for consideration that has been determined to correspond directly with the value of units of energy delivered to that customer.\n\nSome business sales arrangements also include the transfer of RECs to the customer, which can, in some instances, represent a separate performance obligation.\n\n## Material right applicable to residential and business sales\n\nWhere a fixed fee (e.g. connection fee, distribution fee, capacity reservation charge, etc.) received from a customer does not represent a transfer of a good or service to a customer, but the customer is charged an upfront amount, the customer contract contains a material right in that the customer is effectively able to buy additional units of energy at a lower cost per unit.\n\nThe material right is valued based on its relative standalone selling price. If standalone selling prices are not directly observable, the price is estimated by taking into consideration the discount the customer would receive in a standalone transaction and the likelihood that the customer would exercise the option.\n\nRevenue from a material right is recognised as and when the right is exercised by the customer or the right expires, whichever is earlier.\n\n## Wholesale energy sales\n\nWholesale energy sales represent the sale of electricity and gas to wholesale customers. These involve a high volume of energy usually over an extended period of time. Supply of energy represents a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and is the major performance obligation. It is treated as one performance obligation which is satisfied over time. In some",

These include those transferred under a selfsurrender arrangement as part of the consideration for energy and those that are sold to customers.\n\n## Received from customer (self-surrender)\n\nAs a retailer, AGL incurs costs in relation to its renewable energy obligations for which RECs must be surrendered to the government. For most customers, the costs associated with meeting these renewable energy obligations is factored into the cost of energy (i.e. there is a REC cost component built into the price paid). For some customers, instead of paying for the cost of the energy in cash, they have the option to elect to pay for their energy usage in the form of cash and by self-surrendering RECs.\n\nThe obligation to remit RECs to the regulator remains with AGL, but the customer is choosing to meet part of its payment by way of surrendering its own RECs rather than paying for the cost of the RECs as part of the overall cost of the energy.\n\nThe transfer of RECs as consideration in exchange for energy is a form of non-cash consideration. AGL measures non-cash consideration at its fair value at the date of surrender (i.e. the date of transfer by the customer).\n\n## Transferred to the customer\n\nFor some customer contracts, AGL sells both energy and RECs to the customer. A customer may purchase RECs to meet its own REC obligations and/or where it wants actual title to the RECs.\n\nThe RECs sold to a customer represent a separate performance obligation, i.e. a good, as the customer can benefit from the RECs on their own and the promise to transfer RECs to the customer is separately identifiable from the other promises in the contract (e.g. promise to deliver energy).\n\nAGL determines the portion of the transaction price that it allocates to the RECs using the relative standalone selling price method.\n\nThe transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the proportion of the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation to the sum of the stand-alone selling prices of all of the performance obligations in the contract.\n\nRevenue is recognised as and when the control of the RECs are transferred to the customer, which occurs at a point in time. Where the customer is entitled to all the RECs generated at a specified power plant (e.g. in cases where power plants are located at the customer's site), transfer of control to the customer occurs as and when the RECs are generated. In other cases where the RECs are transferred to the customer from inventory, control of the RECs transfers upon receipt by the customer.\n\n## Pool revenue Generation Sales to Pool\n\nPool generation sales and pool purchase costs relate to sales by AGL's generation assets to the grid and purchases of energy by AGL wholesale on behalf of AGL's retail business. AGL has assessed it is acting as the principal in relation to such sales and purchases of energy to the pool and therefore the transactions are recognised on a 'gross' basis. Revenue from these arrangements is recognised at the spot price achieved when control of the energy passes to the grid.\n\n## Variable consideration\n\nIf the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, AGL estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\n\n## Significant financing component\n\nAGL applies the practical expedient in that it does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\n\n## Costs to obtain a contract\n\nCosts that are incurred regardless of whether a contract is obtained are expensed as incurred, unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer. Discretionary bonuses paid to sales staff based on meeting annual sales targets, overall profitability and individual performance evaluations are expensed as incurred as they are not directly attributable to identifiable contracts and do not meet the criteria for capitalisation. The direct costs of establishing customer contracts are recognised as an asset when they relate to a specific customer acquisition campaign. The direct costs are amortised over the minimum contract term. Direct costs include customer acquisition fees paid to channel partners and upfront account purchase payments.\n\n|",

These costs do not fall within the scope of any other standard (i.e. the cost is not part of inventory, an intangible asset or property, plant and equipment). Therefore, these costs are capitalised as a contract cost (cost to fulfil) asset and amortised over the life of the customer contract or customer relationship, where material.\n\n## Cost sharing arrangements\n\nAGL enters into cost sharing arrangements whereby the costs to operate and maintain assets that are shared with\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Variable consideration and constraints\n\nAGL includes variable consideration in the transaction price as estimated at the inception of a contract. However, if it is considered 'highly probable' that a significant reversal of revenue recognised will occur in the future, the variable consideration is constrained and not included in the transaction price.\n\nAGL's contractual arrangements contain a number of variable pricing elements including pay-on-time discounts, payment plans, and escalations. Some of these variable elements are resolved during the reporting period. Where they are not, management estimates the likelihood of the variable pricing\n\nparties outside the AGL Group are recharged to the parties in accordance with their beneficial interest. These recharged amounts are recognised as revenue when the associated costs to which they relate impact the statement of profit or loss. Revenue is measured with reference to the fair value of the consideration received.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that AGL will comply with the conditions of the grant and the grant will be received.\n\nGovernment grants that require AGL to construct an asset are recognised as deferred revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and transferred to profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the related assets.\n\nelement eventuating and recognises the variable pricing element to the extent it is not highly probable that it will reverse.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nAGL recognises revenue from gas and electricity services once the gas and/or electricity has been consumed by the customer. Management estimates customer consumption between the last invoice date and the end of the reporting period when determining gas and electricity revenue for the financial period. Various assumptions and financial models are used to determine the estimated unbilled consumption.\n\n## 3.

AGL's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised\n\nif the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which AGL expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if AGL has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and the deferred",

Trade and other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less an allowance for expected credit loss. AGL's policy requires customers to pay in accordance within agreed payment terms. Depending on the customer segment, trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 days.\n\nAGL assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Expected credit loss on trade receivables and unbilled revenue\n\nAGL uses an allowance matrix to measure expected credit losses of trade receivables and unbilled revenue from its customers. Trade receivable amounts are disaggregated into customer segments.\n\nLoss rates are estimated in each age category and are based on the probability of a receivable progressing through to write-off. Factors to estimate the loss rate are based on risk assessment performed for each customer segment and economic factors such as wholesale electricity forward curves, commodity fuel forward curves and prevailing macro-economic information.\n\n## Unbilled revenue\n\nAGL recognises revenue from gas and electricity sales once the gas and/or electricity has been consumed by the customer.\n\nFor trade receivables, unbilled revenue, contract assets and lease receivables, AGL applies the simplified approach, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n\n## Unbilled revenue\n\nUnbilled revenue represents estimated gas and electricity services supplied to customers but unbilled at the end of the reporting period. Unbilled gas and electricity revenue is not collectible until such time as customers' meters are read and bills rendered.\n\nManagement estimates customer consumption between the last invoice date and the end of the reporting period when determining gas and electricity revenue for the financial period. Various assumptions and financial models are used to determine the estimated unbilled consumption.\n\nSome of the assumptions and estimates include:\n\n- \u00b7 Volume and timing of energy consumed by the customers\n- \u00b7 Various pricing plans prevalent and allocation of the estimated volume to such pricing plans\n- \u00b7 Loss factors\n- \u00b7 Behavioural discounts.\n\n|",

AGL holds green commodity scheme certificates in order to satisfy its surrender obligations under the various schemes.\n\nGreen commodity scheme certificates are initially recorded at cost, being the fair value of the consideration paid or the cost of generation of the certificate. Subsequent to initial recognition, green commodity scheme certificates are recorded at the lower of cost, or net realisable value.\n\n## 13.

Associates are those entities in which AGL has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies of the entity. A joint venture is an arrangement in which AGL has joint control and AGL has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial\n\nPosition at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise AGL's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates and joint ventures. An impairment loss is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss and is reversed if there has been a favourable change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Unrealised gains on transactions between AGL and an associate or a joint venture are eliminated to the extent of AGL's interest in the associate or joint venture. Unrealised losses are also eliminated, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of an impairment.\n\n|",

Finance costs related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised. Cost may also include transfers from other comprehensive income of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.\n\nSubsequent costs are capitalised when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to AGL and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Other costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nThe gain or loss arising on disposal or retirement is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful life to its estimated residual value. Leasehold improvements are amortised over the period of the relevant lease or estimated useful life, whichever is the shorter. Land is not depreciated.\n\nThe estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate at the end of each annual reporting period.\n\nThe following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation:\n\n- \u00b7 Leasehold improvements - lesser of lease period or up to 50 years\n- \u00b7 Plant and equipment - Up to 50 years\n\n## Right-of-use assets (ROU assets)\n\nA ROU asset is recognised in relation to each lease and is initially measured at cost comprising the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made before the commencement date (reduced by lease incentives received), plus initial direct costs incurred in obtaining the lease and an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the\n\nterms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories.\n\nA ROU asset is subsequently measured using the cost model less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. AGL does not apply the revaluation model but instead carries all ROU assets at cost. The ROU asset is depreciated over its useful life. The useful life of a ROU asset for depreciation purposes is the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. Where the ROU asset is adjusted due to changes in the lease liability, the depreciation for the ROU asset is adjusted on a prospective basis.\n\nThe following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation on ROU assets:\n\n- \u00b7 Plant and equipment - ROU assets: lesser of lease period or up to 15 years\n- \u00b7 Other - ROU assets: lesser of lease period or up to 50 years\n\n## Short-term and low value leases as lessee\n\nAGL has elected to apply the practical expedients available for short-term leases (i.e. where the lease period is 12 months or less) and low-value asset leases. As a result of application of these practical expedients, the measurement requirements of accounting standards do not apply and the expense for these leases is recognised on a straight-line basis.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets excluding goodwill\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, AGL reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, AGL estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\n|",

The cost of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is its fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed at least annually for impairment. Finite lived intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful life and tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.\n\nThe estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period.\n\nThe following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of amortisation for intangible assets with finite lives:\n\n- \u00b7 Customer relationships and contracts - 3 to 20 years\n- \u00b7 Software - 3 to 7 years\n- \u00b7 Licences - 3 to 35 years\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of the acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of AGL's CGUs or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from\n\nthe synergies of the combination, and tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nA CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU(s) and then to the other assets of the CGU(s) pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU(s). Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## Software\n\nSoftware is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or development of the software.\n\n## Licences\n\nLicences are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.\n\n## Customer relationships and contracts\n\nCustomer relationships and contracts acquired in a business combination are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the period during which economic benefits are expected to be received.\n\nThe direct costs of establishing customer contracts are recognised as an asset when they relate to a specific customer acquisition campaign. The direct costs are amortised over the minimum contract term. Direct costs include customer acquisition fees paid to channel partners and upfront account purchase payments. All other customer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n|",

An assessment of indications of impairment for each cash generating unit (CGU) is performed at each reporting period end, and if indications exist, a subsequent recoverable value assessment is performed. Notwithstanding the above, the recoverable value of a CGU containing goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or intangible assets in development is determined at least annually. These annual assessments are performed in December each year.\n\nAGL's main CGUs are:\n\n- \u00b7 Generation Fleet\n- \u00b7 Customer Markets\n- \u00b7 Wholesale Gas\n- \u00b7 Flexible Generation\n\n## Impairment testing methodology\n\nAGL is subject to a number of external factors that impact the performance of its CGUs. This includes, but is not limited to, market prices, external regulatory and social factors that may impact the life of assets, competitor behaviour and new entrants and technological change. To respond to the range of potential outcomes that can result from these factors, AGL applies a scenario analysis approach when determining the recoverable value of assets. Each of the scenarios are assigned a probability weighting to estimate the recoverable value of the CGU overall. The methodology of analysing several modelled outcomes is consistent with AGL's external reporting disclosures such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reports and Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP). The scenarios modelled represent a range of outcomes including differing wholesale market prices, asset lives, and operating costs.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of a CGU is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount with any impairment recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Generation Fleet CGU\n\nThe key assumptions in the calculation of value in use include:\n\n- \u00b7 Electricity pool prices;\n- \u00b7 Station closure dates;\n- \u00b7 Discount rate;\n- \u00b7 Generation volumes;\n- \u00b7 Assumptions associated with regulatory outcomes impacting upon operations; and\n- \u00b7 Probability weighting applied to each scenario.\n\nAs part of the review of strategic direction undertaken in September 2022, the estimated recoverable value of the Generation Fleet CGU resulted in the recognition of an impairment expense of $1,008 million (pre tax). A post-tax\n\nweighted average cost of capital of 8.5% (FY22: 6.7%) was utilised to derive the recoverable value.\n\nFor AGL's fleet of finite life generation assets, cash flow forecasts are based on discrete and long-term cash flow forecasts that reflect the life of the assets. The long-term modelling reflects AGL's view of the cash flows anticipated from operations, factoring in known events such as planned outages and expectations, and allows for quantification of sensitivities and scenarios.\n\nAt 30 June 2023, an impairment indicators assessment was performed for the Generation Fleet CGU to determine if there were any indicators of further impairment since September 2022, or reversal of impairment. The assessment has not identified any internal or external indicators that the asset within this CGU is further impaired or the previous impairment expense recognised should be reversed. Accordingly, no further recoverable value assessment was required.\n\nThe recoverable amount is sensitive to reasonably possible changes in assumed electricity pool prices, discount rates, and expected asset closure dates. It is reasonably possible that a change in these assumptions could lead to a reduction in recoverable value. The interrelationship of changes in these and other assumptions is complex. Changes in the external operating environment, such as closure of large load consumers (aluminium smelters), significant new generation capacity or delays in the closure of other non-AGL owned power stations; or changes to government policies can result in changes of pool prices or may reduce the operating lives of AGL's assets which can lead to further impairments.\n\n## Impact of climate change related risk\n\nAGL recognises that there is an increased pace of change in the energy industry, community perspectives and associated political landscape.\n\nThe scenario analysis undertaken as part of AGL's impairment analysis in September 2022 includes scenarios that are consistent with the TCFD analysis performed and reflects AGL's commitments as set out in the CTAP.\n\n## Customer Markets CGU\n\nThe key assumptions in the calculation of value in use include:\n\n- \u00b7 Discount rate;\n- \u00b7 Terminal growth rate;\n- \u00b7 Customer numbers and churn;\n- \u00b7 Gas margins and volumes;\n- \u00b7 Gross margin including assumptions around regulatory outcomes, constraints that impact pricing of market contracts, customer product swaps and customer discounts; and\n- \u00b7 Probability weighting applied to each scenario.\n\nThe outcomes are based on actual regulatory decisions for the current reporting period, which are publicly available, together with AGL's expectations of regulated network prices and regulated pricing (Victorian Default Market Offer/Default Market",

The assumed future gross margin in unregulated markets is determined with reference to historic achieved revenue rates, AGL's expectations of future price changes and impact of expected customer discounts. Customer numbers and consumption volumes are estimated based on historical experience, marketing strategies for the retention and winning of customers and the expected competition from new entrants. A post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.5% (FY22: 6.7%) and terminal growth rate of 2.5% (FY22: 2%) was utilised to derive the recoverable value for the December 2022 impairment assessment.\n\nAt 30 June 2023, an impairment indicators assessment was performed for the Customer Markets CGU. The assessment has not identified any internal or external indicator that the assets within this CGU are impaired and accordingly, no further recoverable value assessment was required.\n\n## Wholesale Gas CGU\n\nThe key assumptions in the calculation of value in use include:\n\n- \u00b7 Discount rate;\n- \u00b7 Terminal growth rate;\n- \u00b7 Gas margins and volumes;\n- \u00b7 Assumptions associated with regulatory outcomes impacting upon operations; and\n- \u00b7 Probability weighting applied to each scenario.\n\nGas procurement costs are estimated based on the actual contract portfolio, together with an estimate of future margins and volumes beyond the period of the actual contract portfolio.\n\nThe recoverable amount is sensitive to reasonably possible changes in assumptions. At December 2022, the recoverable amount of the CGU would equal its carrying amount if the long-term gas margin forecast is reduced by $0.24/GJ in isolation. A post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.5% (FY22: 6.7%) and terminal growth rate of 2.5% (FY22: 2%) was utilised to derive the recoverable value for the December 2022 impairment assessment.\n\nAt 30 June 2023, an impairment indicators assessment was performed for the Wholesale Gas CGU. The assessment has not identified any internal or external indicator that the assets within this CGU are impaired and accordingly, no further recoverable value assessment was required.\n\nThe Wholesale Gas CGU benefits from favourable supply costs associated with existing contractual arrangements. As these contracts lapse and costs reset to terms more consistent with current market conditions, the recoverable value of the Wholesale Gas CGU could potentially decrease. A decreasing recoverable value could give rise to the risk that the recoverable value may be lower than the carrying value and therefore potential impairment in future periods.\n\n## Flexible Generation CGU\n\nAt 30 June 2023, an impairment indicators assessment was performed for the Flexible Generation CGU. The assessment has not identified any internal or external indicator that the assets within this CGU are impaired and accordingly, no further recoverable value assessment was required.\n\n## 17.

As at 30 June 2023, $583 million of this was utilised.\n- \u00b7 In 2018, AGL extended its $410 million club term loan facility from June 2021 to June 2025.

After initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract, AGL assesses whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A contract is, or contains a lease, if the contract conveys to the customer a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nAGL assesses whether:\n\n- \u00b7 The contract involves the use of an identified asset - the asset may be explicitly or implicitly specified in the contract. Capacity portions of larger assets would be considered an identified asset if the portion is physically distinct or if the portion represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset. An asset is not considered an identified asset if the supplier has the substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use.\n- \u00b7 The customer in the contract has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use.\n- \u00b7 The customer in the contract has the right to direct the use of the asset throughout the period of use - the customer is considered to have the right to direct the use of the asset only if either:\n- -The customer has the right to direct how and for what purpose the identified asset is used throughout the period of use; or\n- -The relevant decisions about how and for what purposes the asset is used are predetermined and the customer has the right to operate the asset, or the customer designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose the asset will be used throughout the period of use.\n\n## AGL as lessee\n\nIn contracts where AGL is a lessee, AGL recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease for all leases other than short-term or low-value asset leases.\n\n## Lease Liabilities\n\nA lease liability is recognised in relation to each lease and is initially measured at the present value of future lease payments at the commencement date. To calculate the present value, the future lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease (IRIL), if the rate is readily determinable. If the IRIL cannot be readily determined, the incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date is used. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n- \u00b7 Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date (e.g. payments that vary due to changes in CPI, or commodity prices); and\n- \u00b7 Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, purchase options and termination penalties (where relevant).\n\nVariable payments other than those included in the measurement of the lease liability above (i.e. those not based on an index or rate) are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occur.\n\nFor contracts containing lease and non-lease components, AGL accounts for each lease component separately from the non-lease components of the contract, where material.\n\n|",

This means the liability is:\n\n- \u00b7 Increased to reflect interest on the lease liability;\n- \u00b7 Decreased to reflect lease payments made; and\n- \u00b7 Remeasured to reflect any reassessment of lease payments or lease modifications, or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments.\n\nAfter commencement date, the following amounts are recognised in profit or loss with respect to the payments pursuant to the lease:\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Leases\n\n## Lease term\n\nWhere lease arrangements contain options to extend the term or terminate the contract, AGL assesses whether it is 'reasonably certain' that the option to extend or terminate the contract will be made. Consideration is given to the prevalence of other contractual arrangements and or the economic circumstances relevant to the lease contract, that may indicate the likelihood of the option being exercised. Lease liabilities and ROU assets are measured using the reasonably certain contract term.\n\n## Lease discount rates\n\nThe discount rate applicable to a lease arrangement is determined at the inception of the contract or when certain modifications are made to the contract. The discount rate applied is the rate implicit in the arrangement, or if unknown, AGL's incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is determined with reference to AGL's borrowing portfolio at the inception of the arrangement or the time of the modification and the amount and nature of the lease arrangement. If the arrangement relates to a specialised asset, incremental project financing assumptions are considered.\n\n## 19.

As a result of application of these practical expedients, the measurement requirements above do not apply and the expense for these leases is recognised on a straight-line basis.",

Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. The unwinding of the discount is recognised in profit or loss as part of finance costs.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nA provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.\n\n## Environmental rehabilitation\n\nThe provision for future rehabilitation costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle the rehabilitation obligation at the end of the reporting period, based on current legal requirements and current technology. Future rehabilitation costs are reviewed periodically and any changes are reflected in the provision at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe initial estimate of the environmental rehabilitation provision relating to exploration, development and production facilities is\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Provision for environmental rehabilitation\n\nAGL estimates the future removal and rehabilitation costs of electricity generation assets, oil and gas production facilities, wells, pipelines, mine and related assets at the time of installation of the assets. In most instances, removal of these assets will occur many years into the future. The requirement for rehabilitation is also subject to community and regulatory expectations which may evolve over time and in practice negotiation is required to arrive at a practical rehabilitation strategy. The calculation of this provision requires management to make assumptions regarding the removal date, application of environmental legislation, the extent of rehabilitation activities required and available technologies. The assumptions are highly judgemental and represents management's best estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, given known facts and circumstances at a point in time.\n\n|\n\ncapitalised into the cost of the related asset and depreciated/ amortised on the same basis as the related asset. Changes in the estimate of the provision for environmental rehabilitation are treated in the same manner, except that the unwinding of the effect of discounting on the provision is recognised as a finance cost rather than being capitalised into the cost of the related asset.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nA restructuring provision is recognised when AGL has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. Future operating losses are not provided for.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nA liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave and sick leave when it is probable that settlement will be required and they are capable of being measured reliably.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at their nominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of long-term employee benefits are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by AGL in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period.",

A pre-tax discount rate of 6.86% (FY22: 5.14%) has been used for the purpose of discounting the expected future cashflows.\n\nIn line with AGL's accounting policy, the Provisions for Environmental Rehabilitation are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\n## Provision for onerous contracts\n\nAASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets defines an onerous contract as a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.\n\nAGL recognised a number of legacy power purchase agreements as onerous for the year ended 30 June 2021. Under these legacy power purchase agreements, AGL makes periodic payments for the electricity and green certificates generated by these assets. The agreements were primarily entered between 2006 and 2012 to support the development of the renewables sector at that time. These offtake agreements were entered at prices significantly higher than current and forecast prices for electricity and renewable energy certificates today.\n\nIn line with AGL's accounting policy, the onerous contract provisions are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\n## 20.

Defined benefit superannuation plans\n\nAGL contributes to superannuation plans that provide defined benefit members a lump sum on retirement, death, disablement and withdrawal. Some defined benefit members are eligible for pension benefits in some cases. Lump sum benefits are calculated based on years of service and final average salary. The defined benefit plans are closed to new members.\n\nThe plans are the Equipsuper Fund (EF), Electricity Industry Superannuation Scheme (EISS), State Superannuation Scheme (SSS), State Authorities Superannuation Scheme (SASS) and the State Authorities Non-contributory Superannuation Scheme (SANCS).\n\nThe Superannuation Industry Supervision (SIS) legislation governs the superannuation industry and provides the framework within which superannuation plans operate. The SIS regulations require an actuarial valuation to be performed for each defined benefit plan every three years, or every year if the plan pays defined benefit pensions.\n\nThe plans' trustees are responsible for the governance of the plans. The trustees have a legal obligation to act solely in the best interests of plan beneficiaries. The trustees have the following roles: administration of the plans and payment to the beneficiaries from plan assets when required in accordance with the plan rules; management and investment of the plan assets; and compliance with other applicable regulations.\n\nThere are a number of risks to which the plans expose AGL. The most significant risks are investment risk, salary growth risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk, legislative risk and changes in the life expectancy for members.\n\nAGL also contributes to defined contribution superannuation plans for employees, which are also provided by these plans. Contributions made to these defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Amounts recognised in profit or loss\n\n|                                                                            | 2023 $m   |   2022 $m |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current service cost                                                       | 12        |        17 |\n| Net interest (income)/expense                                              | (1)       |         1 |\n| Expense recognised in profit or loss as part of employee benefits expenses | 11        |        18 |\n\n## Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income\n\n| Remeasurements                                                                         |      |       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------|\n| Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest income/expense)      | (24) | 30    |\n| Actuarial loss arising from changes in demographic assumptions                         | 3    | -     |\n| Actuarial (gain)/loss arising from changes in financial assumptions                    | (8)  | (136) |\n| Actuarial loss/(gain) arising from experience                                          | 11   | 3     |\n| Adjustment for effect of asset ceiling                                                 | 11   | -     |\n| Remeasurement (gain) on defined benefit plans recognised in other comprehensive income | (7)  | (103) |\n\n|",

Funding levels are reviewed regularly. Where assets are less than vested benefits, a management plan must be established to restore the coverage to at least 100%.\n\nAGL expects to contribute $13 million to the defined benefit plans during the year ending 30 June 2024.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation as at 30 June 2023 was EF 9 years; EISS 11 years; and SSS, SASS and SANCS 12 years.\n\n## Defined contribution superannuation plans\n\nAGL makes contributions to a number of defined contribution superannuation plans. The amount recognised as an expense for the year ended 30 June 2023 was $46 million (2022: $48 million).\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Defined benefit superannuation plans\n\nFor defined benefit superannuation plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in the period in which they occur.\n\nChanges in the net defined benefit asset or liability, including all actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating AGL's obligation in respect of the plan are recognised in other comprehensive income when they occur. All other expenses relating to the defined benefit plans are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss. Any defined benefit superannuation plan asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\n## Defined contribution superannuation plans\n\nContributions to defined contribution superannuation plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Defined benefit superannuation plans\n\nVarious actuarial assumptions are utilised in the determination of AGL's defined benefit obligations. AGL uses external actuarial experts to determine these assumptions.",

Share-based payment plans\n\nAGL operates the following share-based payment plans:\n\n- \u00b7 The Share Reward Plan; and\n- \u00b7 The Long-Term Incentive plan.\n\nAGL has the following other equity arrangements:\n\n- \u00b7 The Share Purchase Plan; and\n- \u00b7 The Restricted Equity Plan.\n\n## Share Reward Plan (SRP)\n\nThe SRP is AGL's complying broad-based employee share plan that enables eligible employees to be granted up to $1,000 of ordinary shares in AGL for no consideration each financial year. The SRP is governed by the AGL General Employee Share Plan Rules. The grant of shares is subject to the achievement of performance metrics and can therefore be scaled down in years where all objectives are not met. Shares granted pursuant to the SRP are subject to a trading restriction of the earlier of three years or the participant's cessation of employment.\n\nEligible participants include all AGL employees with at least 12 months service at the eligibility date (generally 1 September following the financial year end). Participants in the long-term incentive plan are excluded from any SRP grant.\n\nDetails of share movements in the SRP during the year are set out below:\n\n| Grant date                     | Balance at 1 July Number   | Granted during the year Number   | Fair Value per share $   | Released during the year Number   | Balance at 30 June Number   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2023                           |                            |                                  |                          |                                   |                             |\n| 30 September 2023              | -                          | 329,700                          | $ 6.58                   | (31,500)                          | 298,200                     |\n| 30 September 2022              | 234,973                    | -                                | -                        | (27,390)                          | 207,583                     |\n| 30 September 2021              | 167,532                    | -                                | -                        | (18,147)                          | 149,385                     |\n| 28 September 2020              | 100,251                    | -                                | -                        | (100,251)                         | -                           |\n| Total Share Reward Plan shares | 502,756                    | 329,700                          |                          | (177,288)                         | 655,168                     |\n| 2022                           |                            |                                  |                          |                                   |                             |\n| 30 September 2022              | -                          | 293,737                          | $5.96                    | (58,764)                          | 234,973                     |\n| 30 September 2021              | 212,037                    | -                                | -                        | (44,505)                          | 167,532                     |\n| 28 September 2020              | 124,221                    | -                                | -                        | (23,970)                          | 100,251                     |\n| 28 September 2019              | 117,260                    | -                                | -                        | (117,260)                         | -                           |\n| Total Share Reward Plan shares | 453,518                    | 293,737                          |                          | (244,499)                         | 502,756                     |\n\nThe expense recognised in profit or loss, as part of employee benefits expense during the year in relation to the SRP, was $2 million (2022: $2 million).\n\n## Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan\n\nThe LTI plan provides for a grant of performance rights to eligible participants subject to AGL's performance against pre-determined metrics over a four-year performance period (prior to FY20, a three-year performance period applied). The LTI is governed by the AGL Employee Share Plan Rules. Participation is determined annually at the discretion of the Board.\n\nGenerally, performance rights are forfeited on cessation of employment. The Board has discretion with reference to the relevant facts and circumstances of the cessation to vest all or part of the balance, or to authorise a portion of the award to be retained and assessed postemployment.\n\n|",

These metrics are based off emissions intensity, controlled renewable capacity and green and carbon neutral revenue.\n\nThe performance period for the outstanding LTI plans as at 30 June 2023 are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 FY23: Four years from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2026\n- \u00b7 FY22: Four years from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2025\n- \u00b7 FY21: Four years from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2024\n- \u00b7 FY20: Four years from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2023\n\nThe number of shares vested are determined by the vesting schedules detailed in the tables below.\n\n## Relative TSR vesting schedule\n\n| AGL's TSR ranking against comparator group   | Percentage of performance rights which vest   | Percentage of performance rights which vest   | Percentage of performance rights which vest   | Percentage of performance rights which vest   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| LTI Plan                                     | FY23                                          | FY22                                          | FY21                                          | FY20                                          |\n| Below 50th percentile                        | Nil                                           | Nil                                           | Nil                                           | Nil                                           |\n| 50th - 75th percentile                       | 50 - 100%                                     | 50 - 100%                                     | 50 - 100%                                     | 50 - 100%                                     |\n| At or above 75th percentile                  | 100%                                          | 100%                                          | 100%                                          | 100%                                          |\n\n## ROE vesting schedule\n\n| Percentage of performance rights which vest   | AGL's average ROE per LTI plan   | AGL's average ROE per LTI plan   | AGL's average ROE per LTI plan   | AGL's average ROE per LTI plan   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| LTI plan                                      | FY23                             | FY22                             | FY21                             | FY20                             |\n| Nil                                           | N/A                              | N/A                              | Below 5.0%                       | Below 8.5%                       |\n| 50 - 90%                                      | N/A                              | N/A                              | 5.0% - 6.5%                      | 8.5% - 10.5%                     |\n| 90 - 100%                                     | N/A                              | N/A                              | 6.5% - 8.0%                      | 10.5% - 12.5%                    |\n| 100%                                          | N/A                              | N/A                              | At or above 8.0%                 | At or above 12.5%                |\n\n## Carbon Transition vesting schedule\n\nThe units of measurement for each of the carbon transition metrics are:\n\n- \u00b7 Controlled intensity is measured at tCO2e/MWh;\n- \u00b7 Percentage of controlled renewable & storage capacity is measured as a proportion of total controlled generation capacity; and\n- \u00b7 Green energy and carbon neutral products and services is measured as a percentage of total revenue.\n\nFY23 plan percentage of performance rights which vest\n\n|           | Controlled intensity at 30 June 2026   | & storage capacity at 30 June 2026   | Green & carbon neutral products & services in FY26   |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0%        | above 0.875                            | below 30.8%                          | below 22.2%                                          |\n| 50 - 100% | 0.875 - 0.800                          | 30.8% - 39.8%                        | 22.2% - 27.0%                                        |\n| 100%      | below 0.800                            | above 39.8%                          | above 27.0%                                          |\n\n% Controlled renewable",

The SPP is governed under the AGL General Employee Share Plan Rules. Shares granted pursuant to the SPP are subject to a trading restriction of the earlier of four years (from the start of the financial year in which they are acquired) or the participant's cessation of employment. The holding lock is in place to provide for a deferral of income tax for participants.\n\nEligible participants include all permanent AGL employees. Non-Executive Directors, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, and members of the executive team are excluded from SPP participation.\n\nDetails of share movements in the SPP during the year are set out below:\n\nGranted\n\nReleased\n\n| Share movements                  | Balance at 1 July Number   | during the year Number   | Fair Value per share $   | during the year Number   | Balance at 30 June Number   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2023                             |                            |                          |                          |                          |                             |\n| Employees                        | 665,444                    | 201,623                  | $ 7.79                   | (175,520)                | 691,547                     |\n| Total share purchase plan shares | 665,444                    | 201,623                  |                          | (175,520)                | 691,547                     |\n| 2022                             |                            |                          |                          |                          |                             |\n| Employees                        | 531,681                    | 378,196                  | $7.08                    | (244,433)                | 665,444                     |\n| Total share purchase plan shares | 531,681                    | 378,196                  |                          | (244,433)                | 665,444                     |\n\n## Restricted Equity Plan (REP)\n\nThe REP provides for a grant of restricted shares, either as the deferral component of STI awards for executives, or for other purposes (for example, sign-on or retention awards).\n\nGenerally, restricted shares are forfeited on cessation of employment.

The fair value is measured at grant date and recognised over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the performance rights. The fair value at grant date is determined by an independent valuer.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, AGL revises its estimate of the number of performance rights expected to vest. The amount previously recognised as an expense is only adjusted when the performance rights do not vest due to non-market related conditions.\n\nPursuant to the AGL Share Reward Plan, shares are issued to eligible employees for no consideration. On the grant date, the market value of the shares issued is recognised as an employee benefits expense, with a corresponding increase in the employee equity benefits reserve.

All other receivables/payables are discounted to determine the fair value if the effect of discounting is material.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates that reflect the credit risk of various counterparties. Interest rate and cross currency swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates that reflect the credit risk of various counterparties.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of borrowings is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows and credit adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yield having regard to timing of cash flows.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of energy derivatives is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows and credit adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yield having regard to timing of cash flows.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of lease liabilities is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted where the effect of discounting is material.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of deferred consideration is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows and credit adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yield having regard to timing of cash flows.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of fair value movements in Level 3 financial instruments.\n\n|                                                    | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Opening balance                                    | (801)     | 741       |\n| Total gains or losses recognised in profit or loss |           |           |\n| Settlements during the year                        | (579)     | (456)     |\n| Changes in fair value                              | 842       | (917)     |\n| Transfer from Level 3 to Level 2 1                 | 253       | (1)       |\n| Premiums                                           | (40)      | -         |\n| Purchases                                          | 1         | (12)      |\n| Disposals                                          | -         | (156)     |\n| Closing balance                                    | (324)     | (801)     |\n\nThe total gains or losses for the year included a loss of $842 million relating to energy derivative Level 3 contracts held at the end of the reporting period (2022: a gain of $870 million). Fair value gains or losses on energy derivatives are included in other expenses in the line item 'Gain on fair value of financial instruments' in Note 4.\n\nThe sensitivity of Level 3 contracts with significant unobservable inputs, where the inputs are higher by 10 percent is $(192) million and lower by 10 percent is $192 million (profit after tax (decrease)/increase)). Input changes were applied to forward prices with references to electricity market and emissions schemes, cost-based indexes, contract volumes and management's assumptions on long-term commodity curves.\n\n## (c) Capital risk management\n\nAGL's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an appropriate capital structure of debt and equity.\n\nIn order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, AGL may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. AGL's overall capital management strategy remains unchanged from 2022.\n\nThe capital structure of AGL consists of net debt (borrowings offset by cash and cash equivalents) and total equity (comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings).\n\nAGL monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio and funds from operations (FFO) to interest expense cover.",

AGL's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of markets and seeks to manage the impact of these risks on its financial performance. AGL uses a range of derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management policy and framework. The Board has established the Audit & Risk Management Committee (the Committee), which is responsible for approving AGL's risk management policy and framework for identifying, assessing and managing risk. The Committee is also responsible for reviewing and updating the risk profile, monitoring the effectiveness of the risk management framework and reviewing at least annually the implementation of the risk management policy and framework. The Committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.\n\nAGL has written policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, energy price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed on a continuous basis.\n\n## (e)  Interest rate risk management\n\nAGL is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swap contracts or other hedging instruments.\n\nAGL regularly analyses its interest rate exposure, by taking into consideration forecast debt positions, refinancing, renewals of existing positions, alternative financing, hedging positions and the mix of fixed and floating interest rates.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, AGL had the following financial assets and liabilities exposed to floating interest rate risk:\n\n| Floating rate instruments                               | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Financial assets                                        |           |           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                               | 148       | 127       |\n| Total financial assets                                  | 148       | 127       |\n| Financial liabilities                                   |           |           |\n| USD senior notes (after effect of cross currency swaps) | 872       | 860       |\n| Bank loans                                              | 1,483     | 1,670     |\n| Interest rate swap contracts                            | (1,450)   | (1,545)   |\n| Total financial liabilities                             | 905       | 985       |\n\n|",

The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is the Australian Bank Bill Swap (BBSW) reference rate. AGL will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis. During the year, no hedges were de-designated. All underlying forecast transactions remain highly probable.\n\n## Interest rate sensitivity\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting period and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, AGL's profit after tax and other comprehensive income would have been affected as follows:\n\n|                                        | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease)   | Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease)   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|                                        | 2023 $m                                       | 2022 $m 1                                     | 2023 $m                                          | 2022 $m 1                                        |\n| Interest rates +0.5% (50 basis points) | (3)                                           | (9)                                           | 3                                                | 2                                                |\n| Interest rates -0.5% (50 basis points) | 3                                             | 9                                             | (3)                                              | -                                                |\n\n## (f) Foreign currency risk management\n\nAGL undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Foreign currency risk arises primarily from overseas term borrowings and firm commitments for the purchase of plant and equipment which are denominated in foreign currencies. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts.\n\n## Forward foreign exchange contracts - cash flow hedges\n\nAGL's Corporate Treasury policy requires the hedging of foreign currency risk using forward foreign exchange contracts. The Corporate Treasury's policy is to hedge currency exposures of anticipated cash flows in excess of $3 million and to not enter into forward foreign exchange contracts until a firm commitment is in place. The forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.  During the year, no hedges were de-designated and all underlying forecast transactions remain highly probable as per original forecast.",

Such contracts enable AGL to eliminate the risk of movements in foreign exchange rates related to foreign currency denominated borrowings.\n\nThe fair value of cross currency swaps at 30 June 2023 was an asset of $26 million (2022: asset of $100 million), of which $117 million (2022: $143 million) is in a cash flow hedge relationship, $(94) million (2022: $(48) million) is in a fair value hedge relationship and $3 million (2022: $5 million) relates to the currency basis of the cross currency swaps.\n\nThe following tables detail the cross currency swap contracts in hedges outstanding at the end of the reporting period:\n\n|                       | Average interest rate   | Average interest rate   | Average exchange rate   | Average exchange rate   | Contract value (foreign currency)   | Contract value (foreign currency)   | Contract value (local currency)   | Contract value (local currency)   | Fair value/ carrying amount   | Fair value/ carrying amount   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Outstanding contracts | 2023 %                  | 2022 %                  | 2023                    | 2022                    | 2023 $m                             | 2023 $m                             | 2023 $m                           | 2022 $m                           | 2023 $m                       | 2022 $m                       |\n| Buy US dollars        |                         |                         |                         |                         |                                     |                                     |                                   |                                   |                               |                               |\n| 1 to 5 years          | 6.04                    | 3.09                    | 0.888                   | 0.888                   | 135                                 | 300                                 | 152                               | 338                               | 44                            | 100                           |\n| 5 years or more       | 6.36                    | 3.10                    | 0.731                   | 0.757                   | 526                                 | 395                                 | 720                               | 522                               | (18)                          | 0                             |\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to foreign currency exchange rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting period and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, if the Australian dollar had weakened or strengthened by 10% against the respective foreign currencies where all other variables remain constant, AGL's profit after tax and other comprehensive income would have been affected as follows:\n\n|                           | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease)   | Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease)   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|                           | 2023 $m                                       | 2022 $m                                       | 2023 $m                                          | 2022 $m                                          |\n| AUD exchange rates +10.0% | -                                             | -                                             | 1                                                | (6)                                              |\n| AUD exchange rates -10.0% | -                                             | -                                             | (1)                                              | 8                                                |\n\n|",

AGL manages energy risk through an established risk management framework consisting of policies to place appropriate risk limits on overall energy market exposures and transaction limits for approved energy commodities, requirements for delegations of authority on trading, regular reporting of exposures and segregation of duties.\n\nIt is AGL's policy to actively manage the energy price exposure arising from both forecast energy supply and customer energy load. AGL's risk management policy for energy price risk is to hedge forecast future positions for up to five years into the future.\n\nExposures to fluctuations in the wholesale market energy prices are managed through the use of various types of hedge contracts including derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Energy derivatives - economic hedges\n\nAGL has entered into certain derivative instruments for economic hedging purposes under the Board-approved risk management policies, which do not satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting under AASB 9 Financial Instruments . These derivatives are therefore required to be categorised as held for trading and are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as economic hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss as part of (loss)/gain on fair value of financial instruments.\n\n## Energy price sensitivity\n\nThe following table details the sensitivity to a 10 percent increase or decrease in the energy contract market forward prices. A sensitivity of 10 percent has been used as this is considered reasonably possible, based on historical data relating to the level of volatility in market prices.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, if the forward prices had been 10 percent higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, AGL's profit after tax and other comprehensive income would have been affected as follows:\n\n|                           | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease)   | Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease)   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|                           | 2023 $m                                       | 2022 $m                                       | 2023 $m                                          | 2022 $m                                          |\n| Energy forward price +10% | (115)                                         | (79)                                          | -                                                | -                                                |\n| Energy forward price -10% | 113                                           | 78                                            | -                                                | -                                                |\n\nThe movement in profit after tax is mainly attributable to an increase/decrease in the fair value of certain energy derivative instruments which are not hedge accounted by AGL. The movement in other comprehensive income is due to the reclassification and/or amortisation of historical hedge accounted derivatives.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\nTrade and other receivables consist of approximately 3.95 million residential, small business and large commercial and industrial services to customers, in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of customers and, where appropriate, an allowance for expected credit loss is raised. AGL does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer or any group of customers.\n\nAGL limits its exposure to credit risk by investing surplus funds and entering into derivative financial instruments only with approved financial institutions that have a credit rating of at least A from Standard & Poor's and within credit limits assigned to each financial institution. Derivative counterparties are limited to high creditworthy financial institutions and other organisations in the energy industry. AGL also utilises International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) agreements with derivative counterparties in order to limit exposure to credit risk through the netting of amounts receivable from and amounts payable to individual counterparties.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, there was a significant concentration of credit risk with certain counterparties in relation to energy derivatives undertaken in accordance with the AGL's hedging and risk management activities. The carrying amount of the financial assets recognised in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.\n\nAGL does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover this credit risk.\n\n## (j) Liquidity risk management\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that AGL will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, who have established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of AGL's short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.\n\nAGL manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe following table details AGL's remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The amounts are based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities on the earliest date on which AGL can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are at floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the end of the reporting period.\n\nLess than 1 year\n\n1 - 2 years\n\n2 - 5 years\n\nMore than 5 years\n\nTotal\n\n| 2023                                 | $m    | $m   | $m    | $m    | $m    |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities |       |      |       |       |       |\n| Trade and other payables 1           | 1,827 | -    | -     | -     | 1,827 |\n| USD senior notes                     | 63    | 63   | 412   | 1,211 | 1,749 |\n| Bank loans                           | 89    | 745  | 896   | -     | 1,730 |\n| CPI bonds                            | 14    | 15   | 31    | -     | 60    |\n| Lease liabilities                    | 39    | 36   | 57    | 304   | 436   |\n| Deferred consideration               | 39    | 40   | 84    | -     | 163   |\n|                                      | 2,071 | 899  | 1,480 | 1,515 | 5,965 |\n\n| 2022                                 | Less than 1 year $m   | 1 - 2 years $m   | 2 - 5 years $m   | More than 5 years $m   | Total $m   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities |                       |                  |                  |                        |            |\n| Trade and other payables             | 3,164                 | -                | -                | -                      | 3,164      |\n| USD senior notes                     | 279                   | 35               | 339              | 703                    | 1,356      |\n| Bank loans                           | 148                   | 330              | 1,370            | -                      | 1,848      |\n| CPI bonds                            | 13                    | 14               | 43               | -                      | 70         |\n| Lease liabilities                    | 29                    | 27               | 43               | 216                    | 315        |\n| Deferred consideration               | 38                    | 39               | 124              | -                      | 201        |\n|                                      | 3,671                 | 445              | 1,919            | 919                    | 6,954      |\n\nThe following table details AGL's liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or other comprehensive income. For investments in debt instruments, this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether AGL has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity instrument at fair value through other comprehensive income. AGL reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\n\n## Measurement\n\nAt initial recognition, AGL measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on AGL's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which AGL classifies its debt instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a debt instrument that is subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.\n- \u00b7 Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Assets that are held for collecting contractual cash flows and through sale on specified dates. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVOCI is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n- \u00b7 Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented net in the statement of profit or loss within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nOn initial recognition, AGL elects to classify each equity instrument as FVTPL or FVOCI. AGL subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where AGL has elected to present fair value gains or losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains or losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when AGL's right to receive payments is established. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Changes in the fair value of equity instrument financial assets classified as FVTPL are recognised in expenses in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are stated at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Where derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of changes in fair value depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging relationship is revoked, the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nAGL documents at the inception of the hedging transaction the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether the instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items. AGL documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception of each hedge relationship.\n\n## Fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in profit or loss in the line item relating to the hedged item.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date.\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity, limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item on a present value basis from the inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, within other expenses.\n\nWhen option contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, AGL may elect to designate only the intrinsic value of the option contract as the hedging instrument. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in intrinsic value of the option contracts are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. Gains or losses related to the time value element of the option are recognised in a cost of hedging reserve.\n\nWhen cross-currency contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, AGL may elect to designate only the change in fair value of the cross-currency contract related to the spot component as the hedging instrument. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in the spot component of the cross-currency contracts are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. The change in the currency basis spread element of the contract that relates to the hedged item is recognised within other comprehensive income in the costs of hedging reserve within equity. In some cases, AGL may designate the full change in fair value of the cross-currency contract (including currency basis spread) as the hedging instrument. In such cases, the gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in fair value of the entire cross-currency contract are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nManagement uses their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active market. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. Other financial instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on assumptions supported, where possible, by observable market prices and rates.\n\n|\n\nAmounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of hedge contracts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss within expenses.\n- \u00b7 The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit or loss within 'finance costs'.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss. Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised in profit or loss within other expenses.\n\n## USD interest rate benchmark reform\n\nAGL has borrowings and derivative financial instruments denominated in USD which are impacted by USD interest rate benchmark reform. Although AGL does not have direct IBOR exposure on account of the borrowings and derivative financial instruments being fixed rate in nature, the valuation of its cross currency interest rate swaps and the underlying hedge relationships reference IBOR.\n\nDuring FY23, AGL has adopted SOFR rates in place of IBOR rates to value cross currency interest rate swaps. The impact from the transition is immaterial.\n\nThere were no changes to AGL's risk management practices and the overall economics of the hedging transactions. AGL's internal hedge accounting documentation has been updated to reflect the use of the SOFR rate as the reference rate for valuation purposes.",

Summary of other significant accounting policies\n\nAGL Energy Limited (the Parent Entity) is a company limited by shares incorporated in Australia whose shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The address of its registered office is Level 24, 200 George Street, Sydney NSW 2000 Australia.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the Parent Entity and its controlled entities (together referred to as AGL). For the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Parent Entity is a for-profit entity.\n\nThe principal activities of AGL are described in Note 1.\n\n## (a) Statement of compliance\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations as issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\nThe consolidated financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 10 August 2023.\n\n## (b) Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, except for derivative financial instruments and equity instrument financial assets, which are measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the fair values of the consideration given in exchange for assets. All amounts are presented in Australian dollars, which is the functional and presentation currency of AGL, unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe Parent Entity is a company of the kind referred to in ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191, dated 24 March 2016, and in accordance with that Instrument, amounts in the financial statements are rounded off to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThe significant accounting policies that have been adopted in the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below.\n\n## (c) Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and Interpretations\n\nAGL has applied the required amendments to Standards and Interpretations that are relevant to its operations and effective for the current reporting period for the first time for the financial year commencing 1 July 2022. These did not have any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in AGL's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (d) Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Entity and entities (including special purpose entities) controlled by the Parent Entity (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved when the Parent Entity is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nAll intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\n## (e) Foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.\n\nNon-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\n\nForeign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.\n\n## (f) Standards and Interpretations on issue not yet adopted\n\nThe following accounting standards, accounting standard amendments and interpretations are due for adoption for the year ending 30 June 2024 or later:\n\n- \u00b7 AASB 2020-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current;\n- \u00b7 AASB 2020-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent - Deferral of Effective Date;\n- \u00b7 AASB 2021-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Disclosure of Accounting Policies and Definition of Accounting Estimates;\n- \u00b7 AASB 2021-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction;\n- \u00b7 AASB 2022-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback;\n- \u00b7 AASB 2022-7 Editorial Corrections to Australian Accounting Standards and Repeal of Superseded and Redundant Standards;\n\n|",

In particular,  that  forecast  price  and  volume assumptions  and  their  interrelationship with  forecast  emissions  costs  and  energy procurement costs may not appropriately reflect actual changes  in  supply  and demand  due  to  the  impact  of  climate change.\n- \uf0b7 As disclosed in Section 3.2 of the operating and  financial  review  within  the  Annual Report  and  Note  15  to  the  financial statements, management  has  brought forward the closure dates of AGL's thermal coal  power  stations  in  line  with  AGL's climate commitments announced as part of the Review of Strategic Direction ('RoSD') and Climate Transition Action Plan ('CTAP') in  September  2022.  The  targeted  useful lives  of  the  thermal  coal  power  stations may  be  further  reduced  as  Australian federal and  state  governments  move towards 'net zero' emissions targets. As a consequence,  the  depreciation  expense may  be  materially  increased,  a  material impairment of property, plant and equipment may be required in the future and the provision for environmental rehabilitation  may  need  to  be  materially increased due to the potential acceleration of timing of performing rehabilitation.\n- \uf0b7 Regulatory change in respect of emissions schemes and targets may  result in increased requirements for capital expenditure.\n\n## How the scope of our audit responded to the Key Audit Matter\n\nWe have considered the areas of AGL's financial statements whereby climate change related risk could have a financial reporting  impact  and  determined  audit  procedures  to specifically  respond  to  this.    Our  procedures  included, amongst others, the following:\n\nIn respect of forecast assumptions used by management in assessing  the  recoverable  amount  of  property,  plant  and equipment and intangible assets, in  conjunction with our valuation specialists, our procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \uf0b7 assessing and challenging the key assumptions for forecast price and volume assumptions used in the forecast cash flows. We  compared these assumptions  to  historical  results  and  economic data  and  industry  forecasts,  considering  the impact  of  climate  change  related  risk,  where applicable. In doing this, we obtained third party outlook  reports  and  information  assessing  the National Electricity Market, which included information  related  to  energy  pricing,  emissions costs, procurement costs, supply, demand, government  policy  and  targeted  thermal  coal power station closure dates.\n\nIn respect  of  the  targeted  useful  lives  adopted  by management as  announced  in  the  CTAP,  our  procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \uf0b7 determining whether the earlier closure of AGL's thermal coal power stations has been appropriately  reflected  in  the  value  in  use discounted  cash  flow  modelling,  as  well  as  the calculation of depreciation expense; and\n- \uf0b7 challenging  management's  assertion  at  30  June 2023  that  no  further  changes  were  required  to useful  lives  as  a  consequence  of  the  potential impact  of  climate  change  related  risk.  We compared  the  assertions  to  third  party  outlook reports  and  information  evaluating  the  National Electricity Market  which  included expected thermal coal power station closure dates.\n\nWe have considered draft and finalised state and federal regulation  in  respect  of  current  and  future  emissions schemes,  including  The  Safeguard  Mechanism,  and  the impact this may have on the net realisable value of AGL's",

In  most instances, removal of these  assets will  occur  many years into the future. The calculation of this  provision  requires  management  to  make  assumptions regarding  the  timing  and quantum of  rehabilitation  cash  flows,  including  closure  date  of  the  associated  asset,  application  of  environmental  legislation  and  future  regulatory  and  societal  expectations,  the  extent  of  rehabilitation  activities | Our procedures included, but were not limited to:  \uf0b7 obtaining  an  understanding  of  the  process  flows  and  key  controls  management  has  in  place  to  determine  the  estimate  of  the  provision  for  environmental rehabilitation;  \uf0b7 understanding  the  relevant  data  sources  of  the  forecast cash flows including use of estimates from  external experts;  \uf0b7 where  relevant,  agreeing  cash  flow  estimates  to  draft or final contractual arrangements;  \uf0b7 assessing  management's  external  expert  for  objectivity and competence in preparing cash flow  estimates;  \uf0b7 comparing  forecast  timing  of  rehabilitation  cash |\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \uf0b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \uf0b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \uf0b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material  uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw  attention  in  our  auditor's  report  to  the  related disclosures  in  the  financial  report  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  inadequate,  to  modify  our  opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and  whether  the  financial  report  represents  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that achieves fair presentation.\n- \uf0b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities  within  the  Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  financial  report.  We  are  responsible  for  the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\n|",

ASAE 3000 requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain limited assurance about whether, anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Subject Matter is not properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.\n\nA limited assurance engagement in accordance with ASAE 3000 involves identifying areas where a material misstatement of the subject matter information is likely to arise, addressing the areas identified and considering the process used to prepare the subject matter information. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk",

Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the subject matter information has been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance the Reporting Criteria.\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of AGL's processes relating to stakeholder identification, engagement and responsiveness, including an assessment of stakeholder engagement outcomes and how this process and the outcomes have been presented in the 2023 Annual Report\n- \u00b7 Review of AGL's process to identify and determine material issues to be included in the 2023 Annual Report with examination of underlying assessments and evidence on a sample basis\n- \u00b7 Interviews with a selection of AGL executives and senior management, including AGL's sustainability management team concerning the overall governance structure, corporate sustainability strategy and policies used for managing and reporting sustainability performance across the business\n- \u00b7 In respect of the FY23 Selected Annual KPI scorecard disclosures:\n- \u00b7 interviews with a selection of AGL management responsible for selected FY23 Annual KPI scorecard disclosures to understand the compilation and review processes;\n- \u00b7 conducting site visits at a sample of facilities;\n- \u00b7 applying analytical and other review procedures including assessing relationships between the reported information and other financial and non-financial data;\n- \u00b7 examination of evidence for a small number of transactions or events;\n- \u00b7 analysing and inspecting on a sample basis, the key systems, processes and procedures and controls relating to the collation, validation, presentation and approval process of the information included in the 2023 Annual Report;\n- \u00b7 review underlying evidence on a sample basis to corroborate that the information is prepared and reported in line with the relevant reporting criteria.\n\n## Inherent limitations\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of an assurance engagement, together with the inherent limitations of any system of internal control there is an unavoidable risk that it is possible that fraud, error, or noncompliance with laws and regulations, where there has been concealment through collusion, forgery and other illegal acts may occur and not be detected, even though the engagement is properly planned and performed in accordance with Standards on Assurance Engagements.\n\n## Restricted Use\n\nThe applicable criteria used for this engagement was designed for a specific purpose of  assisting management of AGL in their reporting of the Selected Annual KPI scorecard disclosures, as a result, the subject matter information may not be suitable for another purpose.\n\nThis report has been prepared for use by management of AGL for the purpose reporting on the subject matter information presented in the 2023 Annual Report. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report or on the Subject Matter to which it relates, to any person other than the management of AGL or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.\n\n|",
