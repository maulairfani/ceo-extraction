We will continue to work together for a better financial future for all our stakeholders.\n\nBanks and the banking system should at all times strive for a high degree of stability and reliability, reflecting their resilience, continuity of service to customers and clients, and the essential mechanics they perform for national and global economies. The premium for stability and reliability, and the challenge of achieving both, rise in difficult times. The essence of our message to you this year is that Barclays is well on the journey to a more sustainable, and satisfactory performance, but has more to do and a plan to do it.\n\nThat the global background is unpredictable is obvious and volatility is now the backdrop to our world, where we seek so many things with only partial success - continuing economic growth, predictable courses for inflation and interest rates, settled patterns of global trade, stability within and between nations.\n\n2023 started with fairly uniform and downbeat economic and equity market expectations. On both counts, however, the intervening twelve months surprised on the positive side, but not without considerable stress being experienced by households and businesses, triggered by inflation and rising interest rates. It is testimony to the resilience of the economic system that this occurred but is sobering to note how wrong so much of the predictive commentary could be.\n\nAs a global bank we must pay close heed to shifts in the external environment and reverberations for our stakeholders. Banks vary enormously, by geography and by individual firm, in terms of how they respond to changes in interest rates and the interest rate curve. After years of negligible interest rates, banks have to find the right balance between higher rates for borrowers, which improve profitability, and sometimes conflicting consumer and political expectations; this is not an easy balance to strike.",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's introduction (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn this environment, Barclays has maintained strong liquidity and operated towards the top of its target range for capital throughout 2023. With a profitable business model we delivered a Return on Tangible Equity for 2023 of 10.6% 1 , enabling capital distributions of c. \u00a33.0bn. These capital returns mean that since 2019 we have returned c.\u00a39bn in dividends and buybacks to our shareholders, representing a share count reduction of 13%. Our management team has brought stability to earnings, delivering consistent underlying returns above 10% since 2021, whilst continuing to oversee significant improvements in the operations of the bank as part of our ambition to achieve a standard of being consistently excellent in all that Barclays does. This has been a very material endeavour and Venkat gives more detail about our renewed operational rigour in his letter.\n\nHowever, both the Board and management team are acutely aware that our returns should be higher, and our valuation is far from where it should be. Our focus since the global financial crisis has been to rebuild and stabilise the bank. In a world of constrained capital and human resource, the bank has prioritised its operational and financial resilience, including significant investments in the technology stack. This has included a considerable shrinkage of geographic footprint and a focus on those businesses where we believe we can be successful.\n\nWe have also reinforced the talent and infrastructure of the Investment Bank, in Markets and Banking in particular, given that these are scale-dependent businesses and are central to the diversified returns strategy we pursue. The consumer businesses of Barclays have received less consistent and focused investment.\n\nThe challenges of performance and valuation are linked but distinct. In addressing the challenges and regulatory requirements of the postfinancial crisis world Barclays has become overly complex and cost-heavy. It is not always the case that more resources and extra processes make a financial institution safer or more resilient. Complexity can lead to accountability or responsibility being unclear at times, and to unnecessary cost; being simpler is often safer, and more cost efficient. In other words, how we operate is as important as the shape of the business model. There are a small number of business lines which we plan to exit in 2024, but these are not particularly material to the performance challenge. The big task is to execute Venkat's ambition to be consistently excellent. The simplification of processes and the streamlining of management layers in the bank are fundamental to this. This process is well underway and it lay behind the decision to take a significant fourth quarter restructuring charge last year.\n\nThe valuation challenge is obviously less directly under our control. The Board's view remains that the diversified returns strategy which we pursue is the right one. However, it brings business complexities, and there is a scarcity of comparable banks in Europe.\n\nOur commitment to the Investment Bank remains strong, and its priority over the next few years, having reached overall scale, is to become more capital efficient and thus profitable, in part through improved prioritisation around activities and clients. The cost structure also requires some work. Given this, we do not envisage needing to add materially to the capital deployed in the Investment Bank. At the same time we will step up investment in the consumer businesses of Barclays on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nAs a result, we expect the allocation of capital within the bank to shift, with Markets and Banking coming to represent a rather lower proportion of RWAs over coming years. We think that this balance, as long as it is reinforced by continuing returns at the appropriate level, should improve investor sentiment towards this business. Secondly, we continue the journey to make sure that investors have more confidence in where and how we make money. Our disclosures around risk and profitability have improved markedly over the last few years and we remain committed to doing more. The new divisional reporting arrangement will help here, including being transparent about those areas of the business where profitability improvement is most needed.\n\nIn his letter to shareholders Venkat sets out in more detail his vision for Barclays, including new financial targets, and a clear plan to achieve them.",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's introduction (continued)\n\nThis path to a simpler, better and more balanced bank is not just based on the work around Barclays' shape, strategy and financial performance. It is also intimately tied to our expression of Purpose, which we have also decided to streamline to emphasise the way in which we need to operate. 'Working together for a better financial future' expresses our drive to deliver high quality products and services which help to improve livelihoods for customers and clients, helping them with the finance and advice to innovate, invest and grow. And for our communities, it is about using our scale and capabilities to fulfil potential. It is also clear that a greater focus on the consumer and on the UK as a whole are crucial here.\n\nDuring 2023, we  continued to make progress to meet our ambition of being a net zero bank by 2050. Capital is critical for a successful energy transition and we are targeting our financing and resources to energy companies committed to decarbonise and investing to enable the transition in the real economy. I am pleased to report that in 2023 we financed $67.8bn of Sustainable and Transition Financing, contributing towards our target of $1trn by the end of 2030.\n\nIn addition, earlier in February we published a revised energy policy to progress our climate strategy, with a commitment not to directly finance energy companies' new oil and gas projects, consistent with the IEA NZE scenario, and setting clear expectations of transition strategies and decarbonisation requirements for our clients. This policy change is an important lever for reducing our financed emissions as we continue towards aligning our financing portfolio to the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nAs you read this report you will also find powerful testimonies as to how Barclays is supporting our communities, including in our UK home market. In 2023 we marked the ten year anniversary of Barclays' LifeSkills programme, which has helped millions of people transform their futures through its employability tools and learning resources.\n\nOur partnerships with sport are another meaningful demonstration of how we can support the development of vital skills and confidence which are critical to the future success of our communities. Building on our comprehensive sponsorship of girls' and women's football since 2019, in 2023 we debuted as the Official Banking Partner of Wimbledon, integrating it with our existing programmes to support employability and skills, our focus on sustainability, and connecting clients, customers and communities.\n\nThe UK has been Barclays' home for over 300 years and as such we play an active part in its economic success. Against a backdrop of constrained public finances, high inflation and interest rates, we recognise the increasing imperative for financial institutions to play a prominent role in fostering sustainable economic growth. We have continued to do just that through 2023, from our growing network of Barclays Eagle Labs supporting entrepreneurship, to our close participation in public policy consideration of how the UK's capital markets can be bolstered to unlock business growth.\n\nThe various threads of our performance I have recounted are only made possible by the steadfast dedication and hard work of colleagues. On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all of them for their ongoing commitment to serve our stakeholders, and to deliver Barclays' success.\n\nI am also grateful to all of my Board colleagues for their contributions this last year. We welcomed Marc Moses to our Board in January 2023 and Sir John Kingman to our Board and as Chair of Barclays Bank UK PLC in June 2023. Both bring a deep experience of financial services. Julia Wilson, who joined the Board in 2021, took over as Chair of the Audit Committee in April 2023 and you can read her letter to shareholders on page 166. I would also like to reiterate my thanks to Mike Ashley and Crawford Gillies who retired from the Board during 2023, having supported Barclays through a period of considerable change during their tenure.\n\nI look forward to discussing Barclays' performance in 2023 and plans for the year ahead at our Annual General Meeting on Thursday 9 May 2024 in Glasgow, which is the home of our net zero campus and base for over 5,000 colleagues. The meeting will take place at the Scottish Events Campus, Armadillo, Glasgow and shareholders will be invited to participate in person or online.\n\n2024 will be notable as we renew our focus on delivering high quality products and service to our customers and clients, and on improving our returns to investors.\n\n## Nigel Higgins\n\nChairman",

We have also strengthened the bank financially, and improved our returns. From these strong foundations, we have a vision for the shape of a better run, more strongly performing and higher returning Barclays.\n\n## Introduction\n\nDuring this year, as in the previous one, we have seen increasing political and economic tensions around the world. Resurging nationalism is precipitating global decoupling, reversing the ratcheting integration of preceding decades. The effects are reflected in increasingly restrictive trade policies, subsidies, mistrust even among allies, and the resurgence of real conflict.\n\nThis riskier market, economic and political environment has several important implications for a global financial institution like Barclays. Notwithstanding global fragmentation, investors continue to need access to world markets. We have to provide this while managing the relatively higher risk of doing so. In the last decade, Barclays has largely curtailed or entirely shut retail operations in Africa, India and Europe. Our footprint today, operating in London and New York, and across major global financial centres, positions us well for this increasingly polarising world.\n\nPerhaps most relevantly, our home in London, remains one of the leading capital market centres.\n\n## Our progress and performance\n\nWe have built a strong position in the UK market, the product of more than three centuries of commitment, with c.20 million personal customers. In the last two decades, we have also built a growing customer franchise in the US, working in partnership with prominent US brands like Gap Inc. and American Airlines, through which we serve c.20 million credit card customers. In parallel, we have established the leading international markets and banking business headquartered outside the US. Barclays Investment Bank has forged a global reputation for sophisticated execution and risk management, and is at a scale which competes directly with US peers. In Global Markets we are Top 3 in Credit and Fixed Income Financing 1 , while in Investment Banking we continue to maintain a 6th position globally 2 . We led on a number of prominent deals through 2023, including Arm's IPO - the largest to price since 2021.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 Coalition Greenwich Competitor Analytics, 1H23 Global Results.

Over the last decade we increased our capitalisation from 10% to nearly 14% CET1, against a backdrop of accelerating digital transformation, an evolving regulatory landscape including Basel III, and significant economic and geopolitical disruption.\n\nSince 2021, we have delivered consistent underlying returns above 10%, through an uncertain operating environment. This strength and resiliency has enabled us to return c.\u00a39bn in dividends and buybacks to our shareholders since 2019, and since 2021 we have distributed 33% of our market cap. With respect to 2023 we have announced c. \u00a33.0bn in dividends and buybacks, an increase of 37% on 2022.\n\nWe continued to deliver well in 2023, despite the mixed macroeconomic backdrop. Our income was \u00a325.4bn, our CIR was 63% - in line with our target - and our RoTE was 10.6%, excluding the structural cost charge taken in Q4 2023. We generated a PBT of \u00a36.6bn, and EPS of 32.4p.\n\n## Our Vision\n\nI have considerable ambition for Barclays. Simply put, I want us to be the UK-centred leader in global finance. At our core we will have a comprehensive and pre-eminent UK consumer, corporate, wealth and private banking franchise, complemented by a strong, specialist US consumer bank. Alongside both will be the leading non-US based Investment Bank.\n\nI want Barclays to be renowned for excellent operational performance, strong product delivery, highly satisfied customers and clients, and robust liquidity, capital and risk management. The outcome of which is a strongly returning, highly valued global bank, centred in the UK, producing higher levels of total shareholder returns.\n\n## Achieving our objective\n\nWe are building from the strong foundations I set out earlier, but we know this is not reflected in our shareholder experience. We have spent time examining the path we are on, and the direction we will take going forward, as we know we need to do better. I believe Barclays is capable of delivering further value for our shareholders.\n\nWe need to continue to improve our operational and financial performance, and improve total shareholder returns. To do so, over the next three years we aim to make Barclays Simpler, Better and More balanced.\n\nWe will manage the bank along five focused business lines, each with ambition of scale and high returns. This will reduce the complexity of our reporting, and improve the accountability and transparency of each individual businesses performance.\n\nOur UK ring-fenced consumer bank - Barclays UK (BUK) - today delivers consistently high returns, has entrenched scale, with full presence across products and clients. We will aim to establish a leadership position in the UK, ever-improving our customer propositions and service. Our emphasis is on regaining share within credit cards and unsecured lending, and delivering greater operational and cost efficiency. We aim to reduce our CIR from 58% in 2023 to c.50% in 2026.\n\nWe will split out Consumer, Cards and Payments (CCP) into three, separately reported businesses: Barclays US Consumer Bank, Barclays UK Corporate Bank and Barclays Private Bank & Wealth Management.\n\nBarclays US Consumer Bank (USCB), is a specialist partnership credit card provider in the US, with a market leading position in Travel and Airlines. Notwithstanding the lower RoTE in 2023 which is explained on page 21 of the Annual Report, we aim to be a partner of choice for America's leading brands, particularly in Retail, achieving an evermore diversified portfolio of blue-chip clients.\n\nWe will continue to invest in a scalable digital platform to increase operating efficiency, and sophisticated capital management techniques to enhance risk-adjusted returns.\n\nWe will also seek to build further on our strengths in Barclays UK Corporate Bank, which has a long and successful history of fostering enterprise in the UK. We have relationships with 25% of UK corporates 2 , and see more than two in five of the UK's credit and debit card transactions.

To support this journey, we have moved the International Corporate Banking business into Investment Banking.\n\nOperating our bank, and each of our businesses, extremely well is fundamental to improving and de-risking our financial outcomes. We will continue to drive operational and process efficiency across the group, by streamlining our workforce, simplifying decision making, upgrading legacy system architecture, and accelerating the pace of delivery. This will deliver improved cost income ratios across every business, even as we invest to drive better returns and improve resilience.\n\nI am also clear we must manage the bank in a consistently excellent way, to avoid unexpected and unnecessary losses from operational errors and give continued confidence to our stakeholders. We have implemented a groupwide culture programme - Consistently Excellent - establishing a very high operating standard for the firm, and targeting best-in-class service across the group. We are making progress advancing this high standard across the bank as numerous examples throughout this Report will attest, but we have more to do as we aim to make it the essence of Barclays.\n\nFinancially, we will increase the allocation of capital to higher-returning businesses. Over the next three years we will deliver a more evenly balanced allocation of RWAs, with more capital deployed to our highest returning consumer businesses, which attract higher investor multiples.\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 This multiyear plan is subject to supervisory and Board approval, anticipated financial performance and our published CET1 range of 13%-14%.\n\nRWAs in Barclays UK, Barclays UK Corporate Bank and Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management will increase by around 4% points as a proportion of total RWAs.\n\nBy no means is this to diminish the importance of our Investment Bank; rather, it is to place our consumer and corporate businesses on a similarly strong footing.\n\nOver the medium-term this will rebalance Barclays RWAs across our consumer and wholesale businesses, to support more consistent and higher returns.\n\nBy being Simpler, Better and More balanced, we can deliver greater shareholder value by 2026. Our new financial framework includes a target to generate a Return on Tangible Equity of greater than 12% by that time, and to return at least \u00a310 billion to shareholders via a mix of dividends and buybacks 1 .\n\n## Shaping Barclays for the future\n\nThe business, operational and financial goals which we have outlined are an important part of success, but they are not all of it. In the increasingly multi-polar world we described at the outset, we must choose what we want to be and where.\n\nThis year signifies our strengthened commitment to the UK. The UK economy continues to prove relatively resilient to global shifts and, as a UK headquartered bank, we are deeply rooted in our domestic market. With a renewed focus on businesses in which we can be successful, and a re-emphasis on delivering excellent customer service, we can build on our valuable brand and capture even more opportunity in our home market.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur commitment to, and deep roots in, the UK have shaped our vision. As part of this resolve, we are purposefully engaged in initiatives to advance UK prosperity, from levelling-up essential life skills for 3.27 million people during 2023, to supporting ambitious start-ups and scale-ups across the UK.\n\nAt the heart of the activity and ambition which I have detailed throughout this letter are our colleagues. Our success is driven by their hard work and dedication and to support our customers, clients and communities. I am pleased to note that Barclays is ranked as Number 1 on LinkedIn's 2023 UK Top Companies list for the third year in a row, demonstrating that we have built an organisation of mutual respect and appreciation, and one in which our colleagues have opportunities to thrive.\n\n2024 will be a crucial year for Barclays. To change the way we operate and achieve sustainable success will take strenuous effort, relentless focus and time. I am confident that our clear plan will achieve these objectives, and take us to new heights.\n\nThank you.\n\n## C. S.

In 2023 we focused on strengthening our customer and client propositions and improving our execution. Our strong franchise and valuable brand are reflected in our financial performance, with Barclays UK delivering a RoTE of 19.2%. Notwithstanding these results, and our progress over the course of 2023 to refine and enhance our customer service, we know we have more to do.\n\nDuring 2023, cost of living pressures and the rising interest rate environment continued to impact our customers in the UK. In response we enhanced the tools and information available to customers via our Money Management Hub - helping them better understand their spending and the steps they can take to improve their financial wellbeing. We also launched our Money 1:1 service, offering customers a personalised financial coaching session with a specially trained Barclays Money Mentor.\n\nTo boost customers' long-term financial resilience we provided options to switch to interest-only mortgages for six months and extensions of their mortgage term where appropriate. Additionally, we helped over 103,000 new customers get on or move up the housing ladder during 2023 - including 33,000 firsttime buyers. We also proactively contacted 1.2 million customers to let them know they could earn more interest by moving to a different savings product. For our business clients, we ran more than 900 Business Health Pledge masterclasses during 2023.\n\nAs part of our customer-centricity we remained focused on improving our customer experience, combining the best of digital with the human touch.\n\nThe transformation of our physical service model means we are able to provide in-person support in our communities, while serving our customers more sustainably. In 2023 we expanded Barclays Local by more than 159 new sites and now have 351 sites in total - in addition to 306 branches and 16 mobile service points (vans). We are also participating in innovative new Shared Banking Hubs.\n\nImproving existing propositions and adding innovative new ones are important ways we continue to drive growth in Barclays UK. To this end, in 2023 we completed the acquisition of Kensington Mortgage Company - an award-winning mortgage lender 1 known for its strong support of specialist customer groups and the intermediary market.\n\nOur Savings strategy is to help customers develop smart savings habits while supporting those already saving to make their money work harder. We offer personal customers interest rates of up to 5%, with our flexible products designed to help customers achieve their goals. For example, customers can segregate money from current accounts to develop savings habits, while Barclays Blue customers are rewarded with a higher rate in the months they have no withdrawals.\n\nIn parallel, we continue to make good progress to ensure digital banking with Barclays is smooth, easy and rewarding - including by improving the navigation and functionality of our app. As a consequence, active app customers increased 5% year on year in 2023. Across all our channels, over 80% of our customer transactions are now digitally enabled - up from 76% in 2022. While we will continue to help customers recognise and embrace the ease and convenience of our digital capabilities, our focus moving forward will shift to improving the depth and quality of engagement from customers already actively using them.\n\nTo further strengthen our customer propositions we also launched Visa Cashback Rewards, giving Barclays Blue customers cash back on their everyday spending.\n\nOur progress to improve the customer experience in 2023 is reflected in Barclays UK's improved Net Promoter Score, which increased by six points versus 2022. We recognise there is still more to do to improve our customer propositions and execution, and we will remain focused on doing so.",

Our 37 business incubators across the UK - which include nine new locations added in 2023 - are part of our ambition to be a bank where entrepreneurs start, scale and achieve their growth ambitions. In 2023 Eagle Labs supported over 4,500 businesses, while Barclays UK more broadly supported over 47,000 new start-up or scale-up customers - including Climate Tech start-ups working on innovative technology to deliver a more sustainable future. We were also entrusted by the UK Government with a \u00a312m Digital Growth Grant to further support the growth of UK tech start-ups and scale-ups over the next two years. The Grant will help deliver 20 national programmes and more than 8,000 business interventions, including our Sustainability Bridge programme, to enable ambitious entrepreneurs.\n\nAnother key way we support customers is through our focus on sustainability. This year we expanded and improved sustainability-related propositions for customers, including a new Green Barclayloan for Business that offers no arrangement fees for lending above \u00a325,000 on a range of green assets supporting our business customers in their transition to net zero. We also expanded our existing Asset Finance proposition via our partner Propel 2 , offering business customers fixed rates on a wider range of green assets, including new fully electric vehicles and solar photovoltaic panels.  Additionally, we extended our Greener Home Reward scheme, which offers a cash reward of up to \u00a32,000 for eligible residential mortgage customers who install eligible energyefficiency-related measures in their homes. 3\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 In 2023 Kensington Mortgage Company won 'Best Specialist Mortgage Lender' at both the What Mortgage and Your Mortgage Awards.

The Hubs consist of a counter service operated by Post Office colleagues, where customers can withdraw and deposit cash, make bill payments and carry out regular banking transactions, in addition to private spaces for financial conversations.\n\nOver 100 Hubs have been announced by Cash Access UK in locations across the UK, helping Barclays UK provide our services in a better and more efficient way while serving our communities.\n\n## Kensington Mortgages\n\nIn March 2023 Barclays bolstered its support for the UK mortgage market by purchasing Kensington Mortgages, the UK's leading residential specialist mortgage lender. Kensington Mortgages brings over 25 years' experience of providing innovative and flexible mortgage products, serving fastgrowing customer groups including the newly self-employed, contract workers, borrowers with multiple sources of income, and those with a weaker credit history. This acquisition broadens our existing mortgage product range and further enhances our product capabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These conditions contributed to subdued primary market activity, as reflected in the 16% year-on- year decline in the global investment banking wallet 1 .\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) delivered a 8.4% RoTE (2022: 10.2%). Our resilient CIB performance reflects the benefits of our income diversification, the strength of our client relationships, and close collaboration across Investment Banking, Corporate Banking and Global Markets.\n\nIn Investment Banking, we continued to deliver for our clients through rigorous focus, consistent execution and a strong solutions mindset. We ranked sixth globally in 2023 2 , and in the UK we topped the investment banking league table - in fees earned - for the first time in six years 3 . Additionally, we continue to excel in areas of traditional strength, such as Debt Capital Markets where we rank fifth globally 2 , and we are successfully expanding in priority areas such as Equity Capital Markets, where our share grew by 70bps.\n\nAmong the year's highlights, Barclays was proud to serve as Joint Global Coordinator and Billing & Delivery Agent on Arm's IPO. Please see the facing case study for further information.\n\nIn Global Markets, we continue to be a leading provider of liquidity to institutional clients around the world, helping them find opportunities and manage risk. Our clients recognised Barclays for our level of service amid continued market volatility as we were named Interest Rate Derivatives House of the Year by Risk magazine, as well as Credit Derivatives and Equity House of the Year by IFR.\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 Dealogic Banking wallet as at December 31st 2023 for the period covering 2022 to 2023.\n- 2 Dealogic for the period covering 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023.\n- 3 Data from Dealogic, UK Investment Bank revenue by bank, full year 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Arm IPO\n\nIn 2023 Barclays helped British semiconductor design company Arm become a publicly listed company through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Barclays acted as Joint Global Coordinator and Billing & Delivery Agent on the IPO. The US $5.2bn offering is the largest IPO to price in 2023.\n\nThis transaction demonstrates the power of our Investment Banking and Global Markets businesses working together to deliver outstanding outcomes for our clients. This resulted from focused and consistent client coverage from across the entirety of our franchise - from ECM to Global Markets - and with teams from across Asia, the UK, and the US.\n\nIt also reflects the value in building multi-year relationships with top clients. Barclays has had a relationship with Softbank for 18 years, over which we have executed numerous transactions.",

Income from our top 100 clients is up 5% year on year, despite lower client activity in markets across the industry. Additionally, client market share data for the first half of 2023 indicates our Global Markets business now ranks fifth globally (up from sixth) with institutional clients 1 .\n\nOur focus remains on delivering sustainable through-the-cycle returns and we have the breadth of capabilities across Fixed Income and Equities, combined with a top tier Financing business, to deliver on this. We continued to make progress against some of our key strategic initiatives, which offset compressed financing spreads and a weaker environment for intermediation. In parallel, we continued to grow our financing capabilities to deliver more stable, higher returning income.\n\nOver the past five years our ranking in Prime Services has moved up from 7 rank to joint 5 rank, complementing our existing strength in Fixed Income Financing where we ranked joint 1 for 2023 2 .\n\nOur Research team provides industry-leading analysis and investment advice for our institutional clients. For the second year in a row, Barclays ranked Top 3 for Fixed Income Research 3 in Institutional Investor Research 2023 rankings - and Top 5 in European Equity Research 3 for the first time - underscoring the value clients and investors place on our differentiated content.\n\nThe CIB continues to play a fundamental role in Barclays' commitment to invest in the transition to a low-carbon economy. This includes delivery towards the Group target to facilitate $1tn of Sustainable and Transition Financing by the end of 2030, providing green, sustainable and transition products and services that will support our clients and the global economy to accelerate the transition to net zero.\n\nIn addition, we continue to invest thoughtfully in our talent to meet client demands and deliver the best service. In early 2024 we announced the formation of a new Energy Transition Group to support our ambition to be a leading adviser and financier to clients as they transition to a lowcarbon future.\n\nIn Corporate Banking, revenues grew off the back of elevated deposits income which continued to benefit from a strong net interest margin, and increased deposit balances from clients. We continued to make progress expanding our international capabilities, building out our Corporate Banking businesses in the US and Europe, alongside strengthening our digital capabilities globally to provide our clients with seamless access to our transaction banking product set.\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 Based on Barclays analysis using internal and external sources.\n- 2 Coalition Greenwich Competitor Analytics, 1H23 Global Results.

As Joint Lead Book-Running Manager on the IPO and first Follow-on Offering, Barclays' Equity Capital Markets and what is now known as the Energy Transition Group worked closely with Nextracker's management, advising on the structure, marketing and execution of both deals.

Our performance was driven by the impact of higher impairment charges, partially offset by deepening client relationships and market share in growth businesses, alongside continued digital innovation to enhance propositions and services.\n\nThe strength of our client relationships is reflected in the performance of our US Consumer Bank (USCB), where income is up 24% year on year - driven by our leading position as the card of choice in the travel & airlines sector 1 . Building on the success of our partnership with Gap Inc., we announced a new partnership with Breeze Airways to issue its first consumer credit card programme. In addition, USCB launched a new partnership with Microsoft and Mastercard to issue Xbox's first co-branded credit card in the US. USCB's retail deposits have grown 14% year on year, reflecting excellent competitive positioning, brand strength, and the broadening of our partner base.\n\nContinued investment in and focus on, enhancing digital propositions played an important role across our specialist businesses. In USCB, mobile app enhancements - including enabling facial biometrics ID as part of app authentication - helped boost the Android app star rating to 4.7 out of 5 in 2023, up from 4 in 2022.\n\nAs further testament of improvements to our digital platform, our USCB Digital tNPS - a newly tracked metric for USCB measuring customer experience at the digital journey level - increased from 59.8 in 2022 to a full year average of 61.3 in 2023.\n\nIn parallel, we have remained focused on enhancing our product capabilities. In the first half of 2023 we launched the new JetBlue programme, a complete redesign to align with the airlines' new loyalty programme. Subsequently, we were recognised by J.D. Power 1 for the JetBlue Plus Card, issued by Barclays, which ranked the highest among cobranded airline credit cards - demonstrating the value it offers customers.\n\nThe successful integration of Private Bank and Wealth Management in 2023 is helping build our advantage in reach and specialist capability. Combined income for 2023 is \u00a31.2bn, alongside Client Assets and Liabilities of \u00a374.1bn and invested assets of \u00a3108.8bn. Alongside the integration there has been an ongoing focus on enhancing the client experience, reflected in the launch of the Wealth Hub to 1.2 million Premier customers in Barclays UK, and providing UK Private Bank clients with an enhanced service experience.\n\nSimilarly, in Barclaycard Payments we saw a 29% year-on-year increase in digital logins and a corresponding 10% reduction in customers using our call centres, supporting our increased efficiency. This momentum reflects the introduction of new digital features - including the launch of Smartpay Anywhere and Smartpay Fuse, enabling small business customers to take online payments as part of a seamless experience.\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 ir.jetblue.com/news/news-details/2023/JetBlue-Plus-CardIssued-by-Barclays-Earns-J.D.-Power-Award-For-RankingNumber-One-Among-Airline-Co-Branded-Credit-Cards/ default.aspx",

We launched the in-app call facility to significantly improve the efficiency and speed of customer service. We also continued to be a leading provider of consumer finance through our credit cards and personal loans business.\n\n## Xbox\n\nBarclays US Consumer Bank further diversified its credit card portfolio with the launch of the Xbox\n\nMastercard, Microsoft's first co-branded card in the US.\n\nUsing research and insights, the credit card product was custom-built to provide the Xbox community with an immersive digital experience across the entire customer journey - from applying through  the Xbox console and web, to earning and redeeming their card rewards, and personalising their card with their gamertag on one of five iconic Xbox-inspired designs.\n\nCreated with customer- and client-centricity in mind, the card aims to heighten enjoyment for Xbox players while deepening their loyalty and enhancing engagement with one of the world's most recognised brands.

We seek to understand our customers' and clients' expectations and aspirations, and develop products and services to support them - especially during difficult economic conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Engaging with customers and clients\n\nBarclays is committed to serving our customers' and clients' best interests. To do so we regularly engage them, building our understanding of their evolving needs and enabling us to adapt our products and services accordingly. We engage in a wide variety of ways, including running regular surveys, analysing customer complaints, direct interaction and drawing on data from millions of individual transactions.\n\nOur engagement is most significant with respect to our large retail presence in the UK, where we offer a wide range of products and services to approximately 20 million customers through Barclays UK.\n\nBarclays UK runs on average eight panels per month for Personal, Premier and Business customers and clients to share their views on our products and services, and on their own financial health. These panels provide regular insights to bring us closer to our customers, and to inform our design principles and the transformation of our customer journeys.\n\nAs described in the Barclays UK section of this report on page 17, inflation has been a dominant theme for customers during 2023 and we have adapted and enhanced our products and services to better serve them in response. One example is our Barclays Money Worries Hub 1 , which was launched to bring together the resources and advice our customers told us they needed in challenging economic times. This is in addition to our specific mortgages and personal savings initiatives also detailed on page 244.\n\nMore broadly, Barclays UK collected over 1.4 million pieces of customer feedback in 2023.\n\nCustomers told us they wanted their experiences with Barclays to feel more personal, as well as showing continued demand for increased convenience and functionality of the Barclays app. In response we have introduced new design principles to ensure every new or updated customer experience feels personalised, and have continued to develop the capabilities of our app. Our work to ensure a seamless digital experience for customers is one of the reasons we have more active digital users than any other UK bank 2 .\n\nWhile we continue to make progress addressing the volume of Barclays UK customer complaints, we recognise there is still more work to do to improve the overall customer experience and address and remove the root causes of customer complaints. This focus is at the core of our new vision and strategy as we work towards improving our propositions and execution in our consumer businesses, in order to deliver best-in-class service and ensure we have highly-satisfied retail customers.\n\nCustomer and client feedback in Barclays US Consumer Bank has recently highlighted positive experiences with our specialists and customer agents, while areas for suggested improvement include making it even easier for customers and clients to interact with us. We are using this feedback to help prioritise improvements, for example simplifying the digital customer journey and reducing the need to contact our call centres as detailed on page 242.",

It provides guidance on Performance Management to promote the right culture to deliver good customer outcomes, supports colleague development and drives sustainable commercial performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fraud and scams\n\nA key way we support the financial resilience of vulnerable customers is through our focus on fraud and scams. While overall rates of fraud and scams continue to rise across the sector, Barclays has one of the lowest scam rates and highest reimbursement rates in the industry, due to our investment in robust security systems and commitment to educating customers\u00b9.\n\nOur fraud detection systems can determine in less than a second if a payment is likely to be a fraudster rather than a customer, and we continue to invest in security features that protect against fraud and scams including 'App ID', which allows customers to verify they are speaking to a Barclays colleague. We are also part of the 'Do not originate' scheme, a partnership with the telecommunications industry, UK Finance and Ofcom to prevent customer phone numbers from being spoofed.\n\nFraud can only be stopped through crosssector collaboration. Barclays is a founding member of Stop Scams UK, a group made up of banks, telecoms and tech firms.\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 PSR report, October 2023, .psr.org.uk/information-forconsumers/app-fraud-performance-data/\n- + You can found out more about Barclays' policy views\n\nhere: home.barclays/news/press-releases/2023/08/eightin-ten-brits-feel-unsafe-on-social-media-due-toscammers/\n\n## Consumer Duty\n\nThe new Consumer Duty marks the beginning of a step-change in UK consumer regulation, requiring firms to act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers - a principle underpinning Barclays' ambition of being a consistently excellent organisation delivering best-in-class service for customers and clients.\n\nWe have undertaken significant work to implement the Duty across the Group, and continue to embed this throughout the organisation. We continue to use and enhance data and insights to ensure our strategy, products and services for retail customers deliver the intended outcomes, with a focus on meeting the needs of people with vulnerable characteristics.\n\nFor example, drawing on data and insights from our Rainy Day Saver product, we contacted over 1.2 million customers to advise them that alternative products may offer a better interest rate for balances over \u00a35,000.\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, complaint volumes increased during 2023, driven by specific issues encountered by customers and rising levels of fraud and scams experienced across industry.

This year's survey generally shows improvement to our scores: Engagement increased +2ppt to 86%, alongside our highest scores to date for Wellbeing (88%) and Inclusion (83%). In addition, our broader Continuous Listening Strategy includes pulse surveys deployed throughout the employee lifecycle, capturing insights that help us improve the colleague experience.\n\nMaintaining a strong and effective partnership with Unite 1 , national works councils and the Barclays Group European Forum helps us gather feedback. We continue to consult with colleague representatives on major change programmes impacting our people, to minimise compulsory job losses and focus on reskilling and redeployment.\n\n## Achieving a consistently excellent standard\n\nAs our CEO discusses in his letter, Barclays continues to focus on delivering to a higher operating standard via our Group-wide cultural change programme, Consistently Excellent. This programme challenges colleagues to address five key areas - Precision, Service, Focus, Efficiency and Diversity of thought - to establish a new operating standard.\n\nThis higher standard is becoming part of our culture and we are working hard to equip everyone with the right skills to achieve this, while rewarding progress. We have incorporated it into our existing Values and Mindset behaviours and as part of an enhanced set of leadership behaviours. We also began updating our key processes for attracting, retaining and developing talent, planning for succession, and recognising and rewarding performance.\n\nTo help create a common understanding across the Group, we led Consistently Excellent workshops throughout 2023 for our senior leaders. In 2024, all colleagues will be invited to attend these workshops.\n\nProgress in embedding this new operating standard with colleagues is reflected in the results from our Autumn 2023 Your View survey. 89% of colleagues felt their peers 'have a good understanding of what it means to be a consistently excellent organisation'. Further, 62% (+2ppt) of colleagues said it was 'simple and straightforward to get things done at Barclays', a concept in line with one of our key Consistently Excellent focus areas, although this result shows there is still more to be done in making Barclays more efficient.\n\n## Investing in our talent\n\nOur talent ambition underpins Barclays' approach to talent attraction, retention and development. We relaunched our ambition in 2023 to focus on the skills and capabilities we require for the future, and set the benchmark for what it means to lead at Barclays through our refreshed leadership framework. Together, these set clear behavioural expectations for our leaders, and enable our leaders to create the right culture for colleagues to deliver to a consistently excellent standard.\n\nUsing this framework we aim to empower Barclays leaders to create an environment of psychological safety and inclusion, and to foster a culture of learning and curiosity where colleagues can thrive - supporting all colleagues across Barclays to grow and progress their careers.",

In 2023, our graduate intake was over 36% female, while our undergraduate Discovery Diversity Programme focused on showcasing successful career paths for underrepresented minorities. These hiring programmes have helped drive applications from a diverse pool of candidates. To further promote social mobility, we will continue our extensive apprentice hiring programme through engagement with educational institutions.\n\n## Delivering on our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion plans and ambitions\n\nAt the end of 2023, 5.1% of UK and 21% of US colleagues were from underrepresented ethnicities, surpassing our ambitions two years early. We are now resetting this ambition to achieve a further 12.5% and 5% respective increase in the UK and the US by the end of 2025.\n\nTo hold ourselves accountable at a senior level we have set a new ambition to increase the number of Managing Directors from underrepresented ethnicities by 50% - to 84 in the UK and US combined by the end of 2025. At the end of 2023 this was 55.\n\nWe are also progressing towards our ambition of 33% representation of women in senior leadership roles (Managing Directors and Directors) by the end of 2025. At the end of 2023 this was 30% \u0394 .\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\n## Maintaining our focus on wellbeing\n\nIn our Autumn 2023 Your View survey the Wellbeing Index score rose to 88% favourable (+2ppt year on year), demonstrating our maintained focus on wellbeing.\n\nWe remain committed to supporting colleague wellbeing using data-driven insights and engagement through leader-led initiatives such as the 'Healthy to Talk' campaign on World Mental Health Day. This is supplemented by dedicated people leader workshops exploring practical ways to continue to embed wellbeing into ways of working.\n\nThere are now over 47,500 colleagues registered on our Be Well wellbeing portal - the highest number since its launch - while our mental health awareness eLearning has been completed by 84% of colleagues and 90% of people leaders.\n\n## Introducing structured hybrid working\n\nFollowing our continuous test and learn approach, Barclays has adapted its ways of working to introduce structured hybrid working supporting colleagues to connect in-person and plan their work to make the most of both their time in the office and remotely.\n\nBuilding connections is a vital part of our culture. In our Autumn 2023 Your View survey, 76% of colleagues told us that their team's hybrid approach enables them to deliver the best outcomes for our colleagues, clients and customers. We continue to monitor colleague perceptions and may evolve our hybrid working approach further as we gather insights and learnings.\n\n## Our people policies\n\nOur people policies 2 help us recruit the best people, provide equal opportunities and create an inclusive culture in line with our Purpose, Values and Mindset, and in support of our longterm success. They are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure alignment with our broader people strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A great place to work\n\nWe were delighted to receive a number of awards in 2023 in recognition of our efforts, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Times Graduate Employer of Choice Award - Finance category\n- \u00b7 LinkedIn Top UK Employer - for the third consecutive year\n- \u00b7 Times Top 100 Graduate Employers - Top 10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to paying our colleagues fairly and appropriately relative to their role, skills, experience and performance.

From 2023, new investment through LifeSkills is focused on targeted support for people in underserved communities, resulting in a smaller number of people reached overall through our programme.\n\n## Our current estimate of our financed emissions based on our disclosed BlueTrack TM methodology\n\n| Portfolio                                                                          | December 2023                                                                      | Cumulative  performance  vs. baseline                                              |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Energy                                                                             | 42.5\u0394 MtCO2e  (absolute emissions)                                                 | -44 %                                                                              |\n| Power                                                                              | 241\u0394 KgCO2e/MWh  (physical intensity)                                              | -26 %                                                                              |\n| Cement                                                                             | 0.573\u0394  tCO2e/t  (physical intensity)                                              | -8 %                                                                               |\n| Metals (Steel)                                                                     | 1.635\u0394 tCO2e/t  (physical intensity)                                               | -16 %                                                                              |\n| Automotive  manufacturing                                                          | 175.2\u0394 gCO2e/km  (physical intensity)                                              | 0 %                                                                                |\n| UK Housing                                                                         | 32.1\u0394 kgCO2e/m 2  (physical intensity)                                             | N/A                                                                                |\n| UK Commercial  real estate                                                         | 30.0\u0394 kgCO2e m 2  (physical intensity)                                             | N/A                                                                                |\n| Agriculture                                                                        | 2.4\u0394 MtCO2e  (absolute emissions)                                                  | N/A                                                                                |\n| Aviation                                                                           | 882\u0394 gCO2e/RTK (physical intensity)                                                | N/A                                                                                |\n| Date baseline set: n December 2020 n December 2021 n December 2022 n December 2023 | Date baseline set: n December 2020 n December 2021 n December 2022 n December 2023 | Date baseline set: n December 2020 n December 2021 n December 2022 n December 2023 |\n\n## About this KPI and why we use it\n\nWe continue to assess the financed emissions across our portfolio and measure the baseline emissions we finance across sectors. Our assessment will inform our plan for target setting in the coming years and  support our better understanding of the extent to which our financing aligns with a 'well below 2\u00b0C' pathway.\n\n## How we performed\n\nDuring 2023 we added further sectors to our BlueTrack TM methodology, progressing towards our NZBA commitment to set science-based targets for all material highemitting sectors (as defined by the NZBA) in our portfolio by April 2024.\n\nOur detailed analysis of our sectors and performance is contained within the Climate & Sustainability section from page 80.\n\n## Sustainable growth: Number of businesses supported (thousands)\n\n2023\n\n5.63\n\n## About this KPI and why we use it\n\nBarclays is championing innovation and sustainable growth through programmes that unlock the world of finance, enabling businesses and economies to grow. The total number of businesses supported in our communities includes those engaged through Barclays' Eagle Labs, Rise, Sustainable Impact Capital and Unreasonable Impact.\n\n## How we performed\n\nThis KPI is new for 2023. In 2023, our impact measurement and reporting evolved to demonstrate Barclays' holistic impact in communities. See the 'Society' section on pages 31-32 for more information.",

The combination of our 2023 Results Announcement, Resegmentation document, and the Investor Update in February 2024 provide further detail on our three-year plan to deliver higher returns, our capital allocation priorities and revised financial targets, as well as the updated divisional structure we will report upon from Q1 2024.\n\nWe also engaged extensively regarding our climate strategy, methodology, and the actions\n\nwe have taken to build a sustainable bank.\n\nAlongside this, our engagement also covered how we have utilised the Board and senior\n\nmanagement to engage with other corporates on governance and the control environment. Shareholder feedback on ESG demonstrated a focus on the development of our climate strategy and policies. In February 2024, we updated our Climate Change Statement, including our policies, targets and financing to reduce financed emissions.\n\nOur 2024 AGM will be hosted in Glasgow to continue our wider engagement with shareholders.\n\n## Performance during the year\n\nBarclays delivered a Group statutory RoTE of 9.0% (2022: 10.4%) with profit before tax of \u00a36.6bn (2022: \u00a37.0bn), which included \u00a30.9bn of structural costs actions in Q423. The prior year included the impact of the Over-issuance of Securities.\n\nThe following performance highlights exclude the impact of the Q423 structural cost actions and the impact of the Over-issuance of Securities in the prior year 1 .\n\nGroup RoTE of 10.6% (2022: 11.6%) with profit before tax of \u00a37.5bn (2022: \u00a37.7bn)\n\nGroup income of \u00a325.4bn, up 3% year-on-year:\n\nBarclays UK income increased 5% to \u00a37.6bn, driven by net interest income growth from higher rates, including higher structural hedge income.\n\nCorporate and Investment Bank (CIB) income decreased 4% to \u00a312.6bn, driven by lower client activity in both Global Markets and Investment Banking, partially offset by a strong performance in Corporate driven by Transaction Banking. Consumer Cards and Payments (CC&P) income increased 18% to \u00a35.3bn reflecting higher balances in US cards and favourability from higher rates and client balance growth in Private Bank.\n\nGroup total operating expenses were \u00a316.0bn, up 2% year-on-year. Cost: income ratio of 63%as the Group delivered positive cost: income jaws of 1%.\n\nCredit impairment charges were \u00a31.9bn (2022: \u00a31.2bn) with an LLR of 46bps (2022: 30bps).\n\nCET1 ratio of 13.8% (2022: 13.9%), with risk weighted assets (RWAs) of \u00a3342.7bn (December 2022: \u00a3336.5bn) and tangible net asset value per share of 331p (December 2022: 295p).\n\nCapital distributions: Total capital distributions of \u00a33.0bn announced in relation to 2023, up c.37% on 2022, reflecting a total dividend of 8.0p and total share buybacks of \u00a31.75bn for 2023. This includes our intention to initiate a further share buyback of up to \u00a31.0bn.\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 Page 391 includes a reconciliation of financial results excluding the impact of Q423 structural costs actions and the Overissuance of Securities in 2022.",

This is to ensure the Group is appropriately capitalised relative to the minimum regulatory and stressed capital requirements, and to support the Group's risk appetite, growth, and strategy whilst seeking to maintain a robust credit proposition for the Group.\n\nThe ratio expresses the Group's CET1 capital as a percentage of its RWAs. RWAs are a measure of the Group's assets adjusted for their respective associated risks.\n\n## How we performed\n\nThe CET1 ratio decreased to 13.8% (December 2022: 13.9%), within our target range, as RWAs increased by \u00a36.2bn to \u00a3342.7bn partially offset by an increase in CET1 capital of \u00a30.4bn to \u00a347.3bn.\n\n+\n\nSee page 191 for details on Executive Director remuneration linked to these KPIs\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 KPIs reflect the targets and ambitions followed during 2023.

It is calculated as profit after tax attributable to ordinary shareholders as a proportion of average shareholders' equity excluding noncontrolling interests and other equity instruments adjusted for the deduction of intangible assets and goodwill. This measure indicates the return generated by the management of the business based on shareholders' tangible equity.\n\nAchieving a target RoTE demonstrates the organisation's ability to execute its strategy and to align management's interests with those of its shareholders. RoTE lies at the heart of the Group's capital allocation and performance management process.\n\n## How we performed\n\nStatutory RoTE was 9.0% (2022: 10.4%) including \u00a30.9bn of structural cost actions in Q423.\n\nExcluding Q423 structural cost actions, RoTE was 10.6% 3 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## About this KPI and why we use it\n\nWe view total operating expenses as a key strategic area for banks. Those that actively manage costs and control them effectively will gain a strong competitive advantage.\n\n## How we performed\n\nGroup operating expenses increased to \u00a316.9bn (2022: \u00a316.7bn) reflecting \u00a30.9bn of structural cost actions in Q423, business growth and investments in resilience and controls, partially offset by lower litigation and conduct charges.\n\nThe prior year included \u00a31.0bn of litigation and conduct charges related to the Overissuance of Securities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## About this KPI and why we use it\n\nThe cost: income ratio measures total operating expenses as a percentage of total income and is used to assess the productivity of our business operations.\n\n## How we performed\n\nThe Group cost: income ratio was 67% (2022: 67%). Excluding Q423 structural cost actions, Group cost: income ratio was 63% 2 as the Group delivered positive jaws of 1%.",

You can also read about the key activities of the Board and decisions taken during the year, along with details of the Board's engagement with colleagues in Key Board Activities in 2023 in the Board Governance report.\n\n## Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the Board and individual Directors engage directly and indirectly with stakeholders to ensure they have a deep understanding of the impact of the Group's operations on key stakeholders, as well as their interests and views. This includes meeting with customers and clients, colleagues, investors, proxy advisers, key regulators, NGOs and other stakeholders.\n\nThis engagement, both directly and through reporting by executive management, to whom the day-to-day operations of the business are delegated, seeks to ensure the Board understands the key issues to enable the Directors to comply with their legal duty under Section 172(1).\n\nYou can find out more about how the Directors have had regard to the matters set out in Section 172(1) when discharging their duties, and the effect of those considerations in reaching certain decisions below.\n\n## Embedding a standard of consistent excellence across Barclays\n\nAs reported in our 2022 Annual Report, towards the end of 2022, Barclays established a groupwide cultural change programme led by our Group Chief Executive, to set a standard of consistent excellence, recognising that both our stakeholders and management want Barclays to perform at a consistently very high level, each and every day. This programme challenges colleagues to address five key areas - service, precision, focus, simplicity and diversity of thought - to establish a new operating standard.\n\nThis programme is supported by our existing Purpose, Values and Mindset. The Board recognises that this cultural change programme is key to driving better outcomes for Barclays' stakeholders, including for our investors, customers, clients and colleagues. As such, oversight of this programme has been a key area of focus for the Board in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the Board received updates on the progress of this programme at each Board meeting, including the key levers necessary to achieve the required outcomes.\n\nBoard members have discussed with management the importance of 'tone from the top', recognising the need for senior leadership accountability and support in order to drive a broader cultural shift across the wider colleague base.\n\n## What a consistently excellent standard means to Barclays\n\n## We are holding ourselves to a high standard across:\n\n| Service:       | Precision:         | Focus:        | Simplicity:       | Diversity       |\n|----------------|--------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| world-class    | in our operations, | on businesses | simplicity        | of thought:     |\n| service        | our risk           | and projects  | and efficiency,   | championing     |\n| for clients    | management         | where we      | seeking out every | new thinking,   |\n| and customers, | and our controls   | can excel     | opportunity       | and challenging |\n| every time     |                    |               | to automate       | the status quo  |\n\nThe Board recognises that in order to drive change across the organisation it is key that colleagues understand and believe in the aims of the programme and recognise their personal accountability for delivering the right outcomes, including their role in challenging processes and controls that can be improved or simplified.\n\nTo support this, a high profile internal campaign led by the Group Executive Committee has been launched which recognises and celebrates the successes of colleagues in driving simplification, and risk and control improvements across the organisation, providing real examples which bring the aim of the programme to life. Throughout 2023, a programme of events has been held for management level colleagues, the aim of which is to ensure senior colleagues understand the importance of the programme objectives and that they are supported in developing the skills they need to implement and embed the change in the organisation.\n\nThis included Consistently Excellent workshops for our senior leaders, to help create a common understanding across the Group. In 2024, all colleagues will be invited to attend these workshops. As part of that programme, our Group Chief Executive interviewed Brian Gilvary, our Senior Independent Director, about his experiences during his executive career of dealing with operational challenges and cultural change programmes.\n\nA key part of achieving the aims of this cultural change programme is driving operational excellence. The Board Audit Committee has oversight of the execution and sustainable embedding of the Group's key remediation programmes, and received regular briefings throughout the year on the progress of these programmes, including deep dives into specific projects.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

S. Venkatakrishnan\n\nGroup Chief Executive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Implementing and embedding the new FCA Consumer Duty\n\nIn July 2023, the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) Consumer Duty came into force. The Consumer Duty is a new outcomes-based regulation, designed to ensure relevant financial services firms deliver good outcomes for retail customers consistent with the three cross-cutting rules to (i) act in good faith, (ii) avoid causing foreseeable harm, and (iii) enable and support retail customers, and the four retail customers outcomes relating to: (i) products and services, (ii) price and value, (iii) consumer understanding, and (iv) consumer support.\n\nThe implementation of, and ongoing compliance with, the Consumer Duty is the responsibility of the operating entities within the Group, primarily BBPLC and BBUKPLC. However, given the significance of the Consumer Duty, the Board also provides relevant oversight of the Consumer Duty across the Group. In this respect, in February 2023, the Board approved changes to its Matters Reserved in order to reflect its responsibility for this oversight.\n\nThroughout the first half of 2023, the Board retained oversight of Barclays' planning for the first Consumer Duty implementation deadline of 31 July 2023 for in-scope products and services. In addition to receiving its regular updates on the status of the Group's implementation plans, the Board received a final update on the Group's overall compliance readiness shortly before the July implementation deadline. This update included information on work conducted to ensure all relevant Group frameworks align with the Consumer Duty rules and guidance and ongoing work to embed the Consumer Duty, including the roll-out of mandatory Consumer Duty training for colleagues.\n\nA Consumer Duty lens has been applied in the development of the Barclays Group-wide change programme, Consistently Excellent, with the spirit of the Consumer Duty reflected in the 'world-class service for clients and customers'. In May 2023, the Chairman, together with Mary Francis (as BBPLC Consumer Duty Champion) and the BBUKPLC Consumer Duty Champion, visited our contact centre in Wavertree, Liverpool, to experience Consumer Duty in action, meeting with customer-facing colleagues and learning about how Barclays is addressing vulnerable customer needs.\n\nIn late 2023, the Board received a further progress report on the continuing work to operationalise and embed the Consumer Duty across the Group, the roll-out of new Consumer Duty management information and ongoing planning for the second implementation date of 31 July 2024 for closed products.\n\nOne continuing area of Board focus is the Group oversight of work to develop robust data and monitoring capabilities to assess customer outcomes and identify potential or actual risks, and for reporting at business, Executive and Board level.\n\nGiven the Group-wide significance of the Consumer Duty, throughout 2023, there has been extensive engagement by the Boards of BPLC, BBPLC and BBUKPLC on this subject.\n\nThe Board will continue its oversight of BBPLC and BBUKPLC's embedding and implementation of the Consumer Duty in 2024, noting that, from July 2024, each of the BBPLC and BBUKPLC Boards is required to review and approve its first assessment as to whether each business is delivering good outcomes for its retail customers which are consistent with the Consumer Duty.",

These risks are managed as part of our business model.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF)\n\nAt Barclays, risks are identified and overseen in accordance with the ERMF, which supports the business in its aim to embed effective risk management and a strong risk management culture.\n\nThe ERMF governs the way in which Barclays identifies and manages its risks.\n\nThe management of risk is then embedded into each level of the business, with all colleagues being responsible for identifying and controlling risk. In 2023, the Conduct Risk Principal Risk was renamed \"Compliance Risk\" and now incorporates Conduct Risk as well as risks from a failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations applicable to the firm.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nRisk appetite defines the level of risk we are prepared to accept across the different risk types, taking into consideration varying levels of financial and operational stress. Risk appetite is key to our decision-making processes, including ongoing business planning and setting of strategy, new product approvals and business change initiatives.\n\nThe Group sets its risk appetite in terms of performance metrics as well as a set of mandate and scale limits to monitor risks (i.e. to ensure business activities are aligned with expectations and are of an appropriate scale relative to the risk and reward of the underlying activities). During 2023, the Group's performance remained within its risk appetite limits.\n\n'The ERMF governs the way in which Barclays identifies and manages its risks.'\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\nThe first line of defence is comprised of the revenue-generating and client-facing areas, along with all associated support functions, including Finance, Treasury, Human Resources and Operations and Technology. The first line identifies the risks, sets the controls and escalates risk events to the second line of defence. Employees in the first line have primary responsibility for their risks and their activities are subject to oversight from the relevant parts of the second and third lines.\n\nThe second line of defence is made up of Risk and Compliance and oversees the first line by setting limits, rules and constraints on their operations, consistent with the risk appetite. The third line of defence is comprised of Internal Audit, providing independent assurance to the Board and Executive Committee on the effectiveness of governance, risk management and control over current, systemic and evolving risks.\n\nThe Legal function provides support to all areas of the business and is not formally part of any of the three lines of defence, The Legal function is responsible for proactively identifying, communicating and providing legal advice on applicable laws, rules and regulations. Except in relation to the legal advice it provides or procures, it is subject to second line oversight with respect to its own operational and compliance risks, as well as with respect to the legal risks to which the Group is exposed.\n\n## Monitoring the risk profile\n\nTogether with a strong governance process, using business and Group-level Risk Committees as well as Board-level forums, the Board receives regular information in respect of the risk profile of the Group, and has ultimate responsibility for Group risk appetite and capital plans. Information received includes measures of risk profile against risk appetite as well as the identification of new and emerging risks, which are derived by mapping risk drivers, identified through horizon scanning, to risk themes, and similar analysis.\n\nDuring 2023, Barclays ran a stress test to assess its capital adequacy and resilience under a severe but plausible macroeconomic scenario. This stress test targeted risks such as inflation, financial stress and a shock on demand; with terminal low rates set to test the Group's vulnerabilities through Net Interest Income (NII) margin compression. The stress test outcome for macroeconomic tests assesses our full financial performance over the horizon of the scenario in terms of profitability, capital, liquidity and leverage to ensure the Group remains viable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details of the stress test, please refer to page 55 .\n\nWe believe that our structure and governance supports us in managing risk in the changing economic, political and market environments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further detailed analysis of approach to risk management and risk performance, please see our full Risk review on pages 254 to 372 of Part 3 of the Annual Report",

This time frame is used in management's Working Capital and Viability Report (WCR), prepared at the start of February 2024. The WCR is a formal projection of capital and liquidity based upon formal profitability forecasts. The availability of the WCR gives management and the Board sufficient visibility and confidence on the future operating environment for this time period.\n\nThe three-year time frame has also been chosen because:\n\n- \u25aa it is within the period covered by the formal medium-term plans approved by the Board which contain projections of profitability, cash flows, capital requirements and capital resources\n- \u25aa it is also within the period over which internal stress testing is carried out\n- \u25aa it is an appropriate horizon over which to consider the impacts of new regulations in the financial services industry.\n\nThe Directors are satisfied that this period is sufficient to enable a reasonable assessment of viability to be made.\n\n## Considerations\n\nIn making its assessment the Board has:\n\n- \u25aa carried out a robust and detailed assessment of the Group's risk profile and material existing and emerging risks (see below for further details), in particular those risks which senior management believes could cause the Group's future results of operations or financial condition to differ materially from current expectations or could adversely impact the Group's ability to meet its material regulatory requirements\n- \u25aa reviewed how those risks are identified, managed and controlled (further detail provided on pages 51 to 53)\n- \u25aa considered the WCR which provides an assessment of forecast CET1, leverage, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, as well as the build-up of minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) up to the end of 2025\n- \u25aa considered the Group's Medium Term Plan\n- \u25aa reviewed the Group's liquidity and funding profile, including forecasts of the Group's Internal Liquidity Stress Test (ILST), regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratios (NSFR)\n\n## The financial statements and accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n- \u25aa considered the Group's viability under a specific internal stress scenario (see below for further detail)\n- \u25aa considered the stability of the major markets in which it operates, supply chain resilience and material known regulatory changes to be enacted\n- \u25aa considered the sustainability of any future capital distributions\n- \u25aa considered scenarios which might affect the operational resilience of the Group\n- \u25aa considered factors that may inform the impact of a severe recession in major economies with affordability pressures on consumers from high inflation and rising interest rates, energy supply pressures, and financial markets instability\n- \u25aa considered the impact of the Group's ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050 and support its clients' transition to a low-carbon economy, including the need to continue to incorporate climate considerations into its strategy, business model, the products and services it provides to customers and its financial and non-financial risk management processes\n- \u25aa reviewed the draft statutory accounts and the financial performance of the Group\n- \u25aa reviewed the possible impact of legal, competition and regulatory matters set out in Note 25 to the financial statements on pages 470 to 474.\n\nThe Group's Medium Term Plan is based on assumptions for macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, inflation, unemployment, which have been consistently applied for the purpose of forecasting the Group's capital and liquidity position and ratios, as well as any credit impairment charges or releases.\n\n## Assessment of the Group's risk profile\n\nRisks faced by the Group's business, including in respect of financial, conduct and operational risks, are controlled and managed within the Group in line with the ERMF. Executive management sets a risk appetite for the Group, which is then approved by the Board. Limits are set to control risk appetite, within which businesses are required to operate.\n\nManagement and the Board then oversee the ongoing risk profile. Internal Audit provides independent assurance to the Board and Executive Committee over the effectiveness of governance, risk management and control over current and evolving risks.\n\nA full set of material risks to which the organisation is exposed can be found in the material existing and emerging risks on pages 258 to 271 .\n\nCertain risks are additionally identified as key themes and monitored closely by the Board and Board Committees. These are chosen on the basis of their potential to impact viability during the time frame of the assessment but in some instances the risks may continue beyond this time frame.",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\n## Viability statement (continued)\n\nThese particular risks include:\n\n- \u25aa the potential impact of increased recession risk heightened by the turbulent geopolitical outlook and volatile market conditions\n- \u25aa failure to successfully adapt the Group's operations and business strategy to address the financial risks resulting from both: (i) the physical risk of climate change; and (ii) the risk from the transition to a low-carbon economy\n- \u25aa legal proceedings, competition, regulatory and conduct matters giving rise to the potential risk of penalties, damages or fines, loss of regulatory licences and permissions and other sanctions, as well as potential adverse impacts on our reputation with clients and customers and on investor confidence and/or potentially resulting in adverse impacts on capital, liquidity and funding\n- \u25aa sudden shocks or geopolitical instability in any of the major economies in which the Group operates which could alter the behaviour of depositors and other counterparties, affect the ability of the firm to maintain appropriate capital and liquidity ratios or impact the Group's credit ratings\n- \u25aa evolving operational risks (notably cyber security, technology and resilience) and the ability to respond to the new and emerging technologies in a controlled fashion.\n\nAs a universal bank with a diversified and connected portfolio of businesses, servicing customers and clients globally, the Group is impacted in the longer term by a wide range of macroeconomic, political, regulatory and accounting, technological, social and environmental developments. The evolving operating environment presents opportunities and risks in respect of which the Group continues to evaluate and take steps to appropriately adapt its strategy and its delivery.\n\n## Stress tests\n\nThe Board has also considered the Group's viability under a specific internal stress scenario.\n\nThe latest macroeconomic internal stress test, conducted in H2 2023, targets risks such as inflation, financial stress and a shock on demand; with terminal low rates set to test Barclays' vulnerabilities through NII margin compression:\n\n- \u00b7 severe UK recession (GDP low point -4.5%) brought by falling household real incomes, job losses leading to 8.3% unemployment rate, declining economic confidence and tight financial conditions. Other major economies experience very similar shocks\n- \u00b7 high interest rates (peak 8.5% UK, 8.5% US) lead to additional stress in banking and nonbanking sectors. As financial conditions tighten, central banks rapidly reverse policy and low interest rates persist (1% UK, 1.5% US) to stimulate the economy and avoid an even worse outcome\n- \u00b7 inflation, after a short-term spike (UK 10.4%, US 8.1%), begins to reduce towards the end of 2025 gradually falling to 2% in the outer year forecast horizon. The short-term affordability pressures on customers ease as interest rates and inflation falls\n- \u00b7 residential house prices in the UK decline 33% while in the US commercial real estate prices fall 45%, reflecting the contagion effects from the financial markets.\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nThe results of the macroeconomic internal stress test were approved by the Board Risk Committee and allowed the Board to approve the Medium Term Plan as being able to sustain a severe but plausible scenario and remain within risk appetite.\n\nBased on current forecasts, taking account of material known regulatory changes to be enacted and having considered possible stress scenarios, the current liquidity and capital position of the Group continues to support the Board's assessment of the Group's viability.\n\nThe stress test outcome for macroeconomic tests assesses our full financial performance over the horizon of the scenario in terms of profitability, capital, liquidity and leverage to ensure we remain viable.\n\nIn addition to a macroeconomic internal stress test, a climate internal stress test was run this year and presented to the Board Risk Committee for approval. See page 176. The exercise confirmed the Bank is financially resilient to climate risks. Refer to the 'scenario analysis' section in page 131 for the key learnings from the climate internal stress test.\n\nThe Group-wide stress testing framework also includes internal reverse stress testing assessments, conducted once a year, which aim to identify the circumstances under which the Group's business model would no longer be viable, leading to a significant change in business strategy and to the identification of appropriate mitigating actions. Examples include extreme macroeconomic downturn ('severely adverse') scenarios, or specific one-off events, covering both operational risk and capital/liquidity items. Reverse stress testing is used to help support ongoing risk management and is an input to the Group's recovery planning process.\n\nLegal proceedings, competition, regulatory and remediation/redress conduct matters are also assessed as part of the stress testing process. Capital and the ILST are set at a level designed to enable the Group to withstand various stress scenarios. As part of this process, management also identified actions, including cost reductions and withdrawal from lines of business, available to restore the Group to its desired capital flight path. These internal stress tests informed the conclusions of the WCR.",

Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue', 'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but also may be made verbally by directors, officers and employees of the Group (including during management presentations) in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group's future financial position, business strategy, income levels, costs, assets and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, capital leverage and other regulatory ratios, capital distributions (including policy on dividends and share buybacks), return on tangible equity, projected levels of growth in banking and financial markets, industry trends, any commitments and targets (including environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments and targets), plans and objectives for future operations and other statements that are not historical or current facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. Forward-looking statements speak only as at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking\n\nstatements may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation: changes in legislation, regulations, governmental and regulatory policies, expectations and actions, voluntary codes of practices and the interpretation thereof, changes in International Financial Reporting Standards and other accounting standards, including practices with regard to the interpretation and application thereof and emerging and developing ESG reporting standards; the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; the Group's ability along with governments and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; environmental, social and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics and similar events beyond the Group's control; the impact of competition in the banking and financial services industry; capital, liquidity, leverage and other regulatory rules and requirements applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions, including inflation; volatility in credit and capital markets; market related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; higher or lower asset valuations; changes in credit ratings of any entity within the Group or any securities issued by it; changes in counterparty risk; changes in consumer behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on European and global macroeconomic conditions, political stability and financial markets; political elections; developments in the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU); the risk of cyberattacks, information or security breaches, technology failures or other operational disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the Group's reputation, business or operations; the Group's ability to access funding; and the success of acquisitions, disposals and other\n\nstrategic transactions. A number of these factors are beyond the Group's control. As a result, the Group's actual financial position, results, financial and non-financial metrics or performance measures or its ability to meet commitments and targets may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in the Group's forward-looking statements. In setting its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, Barclays has made certain assumptions about the macro-economic environment, including, without limitation, inflation, interest and unemployment rates, the different markets and competitive conditions in which Barclays operates, and its ability to grow certain businesses and achieve costs savings and other structural actions. Additional risks and factors which may impact the Group's future financial condition and performance are identified in the description of material existing and emerging risks beginning on page 258 of this Annual Report.\n\nSubject to Barclays PLC's obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the UK and the US) in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.",

We continued to source 100% \u0394 renewable electricity for our global real estate portfolio and met our 90% Scope 1 and 2 marketbased emissions reduction target - reducing these emissions by 93% \u0394 .\n\nWe are also committed to reducing our financed emissions, those deriving from the activities of the clients that we finance and those generated in their respective value chains, by providing financial advice and support as they transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nWe have now set 2030 emissions reduction targets for eight of the highest-emitting sectors in our portfolio: Energy, Power, Cement, Steel, Automotive manufacturing, Aviation, Agriculture and Commercial Real Estate; and have assessed the baseline and convergence point for our UK Housing portfolio. This meets our commitment under the NZBA to set targets for material highemitting sectors in our portfolio.\n\nOur 2030 target-setting includes the integration of 1.5 o C aligned scenarios, such as the IEA Net Zero 2050 scenario, in our financed emission targets, and includes ranges for certain sectors to reflect\n\ndependencies outside our control that will determine how quickly our financed emissions can be reduced in these sectors.\n\nThis year, we have further extended the scope of our calculations to cover the full in-scope balance sheet financed emissions, largely aligned to the PCAF Standard. We used our methodology for measuring our financed emissions and tracking them at a portfolio level against the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement - this methodology is called BlueTrack\u2122.\n\nCapital is critical for a successful energy transition and we are focusing our financing to those clients actively engaged in the energy transition.\n\nThe scale of our business gives us the opportunity to help finance the energy transition - to use our global reach, products, expertise and position in the global economy to work with our clients, including those in the Energy sector, as they transition to a low-carbon business model.\n\nTo reduce reliance on fossil fuels the world needs to accelerate and scale the supply and capacity of renewables and climate tech solutions that will help to decarbonise high-emitting activities. The Climate Policy Initiative estimates that this requires at least $4.3trillion of climate finance a year by 2030 1 .\n\n## Notes:\n\n- \u0394   2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK)3000 and ISAE 3410.

        "page_content": "## Barclays' climate strategy (continued)\n\nBarclays is committed to help finance the energy transition, In 2022 we set a target to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and Transition Financing between 2023 and the end of 2030.\n\nDuring 2023, we facilitated $67.8bn \u0394 of sustainable and transition financing. $67.4bn was sustainable financing and $0.4bn \u0394 was transition financing that qualified against our new Transition Finance Framework.\n\nWe are also focused on investing and scaling the climate tech - hydrogen, carbon capture, batteries, amongst others - needed by society and our clients to transition, generate economic growth and create a new wave of green jobs. To support this, we have a mandate to invest up to \u00a3500m of Barclays' own capital by the end of 2027 and we have invested \u00a3138m into 21 innovative companies to date.\n\nAn important lever for reducing our financed emissions is our policy. In February 2024, we updated our Climate Change Statement with new restrictions on financing upstream oil and gas, including unconventional oil and gas and additional Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) requirements for biomass.\n\nFossil fuels are still required for many essential activities - including electricity generation, transport and heating. In the International Energy Agency NZE scenario, new long lead time upstream oil and gas projects are not required on a 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway. For current and future (declining) global demand to be satisfied, investment is needed to support existing assets, while clean energy is scaled 2 . Barclays understands the critical importance of energy being secure, reliable and affordable for our customers and clients.\n\nBarclays will continue to support an energy sector in transition, focusing on the diversified energy companies investing in low carbon and with greater scrutiny on those engaged in developing new oil and gas projects.\n\nThe trajectory for our clients' transition to a lowcarbon economy is influenced by a number of external factors, including market developments, technological advancement, the public policy environment, geopolitical developments and regional variations, behavioural change in society and the scale of change needed to adapt their business models. Client transition pathways will vary, even within the same sectors and geographies.\n\nMany highly carbon-intensive sectors require finance to transition to a low carbon economy. Restricting the flow of capital to these sectors could be harmful to the pace of the transition, limiting the real terms impact on global warming. The energy companies unable or unwilling to reduce their emissions or play a role in the energy transition may find it increasingly difficult to access financing from Barclays.\n\nWe are committed to continuing the work we began in 2020. Our climate strategy will continue to evolve and adapt in light of the rapidly changing environment and the need to support governments and clients, in our efforts to meet our ambition of being a net zero bank by 2050.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- \u0394    2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410.

Barclays participated in a number of working groups for the TPT, including inputting into the Banks Sector Guidance - which adds further depth and detail for preparers of transition plans operating in the banking sector. Barclays contributed to the development of the additional guidance, sharing its views on particular nuances of transition planning for banks - including the incorporation of nature and just transition elements. The guidance was published for consultation in October 2023, with Barclays participating in the launch event.\n\n## Further details can be found at:\n\ntransitiontaskforce.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TPT-Banks-SectorGuidance.pdf\n\n+\n\n## Our approach to TPT disclosures\n\nOver 2023, Barclays participated in a number of working groups of the Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT), supporting the development of its framework for transition plan disclosures. We are developing our approach to the TPT's recommendations, taking into account relevant guidance as it develops, and elements of the TPT's Disclosure Framework (including the Implementation Guidance and draft Banks Sector Guidance) are addressed in our climate related disclosures included in this Annual Report. During 2024, we will look to further develop elements of our climate disclosures including transition planning. This will be reflected in future disclosures, as we work towards publishing our own transition plan.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and opportunities\n\nTCFD Strategy Recommendation (a)\n\n## Climate-related risks identified over the short, medium and long term\n\nOur climate strategy is underpinned by the way we assess and manage our exposure to climate-related risks. Climate risk is a Principal Risk within the Barclays Enterprise Risk Management Framework.\n\nBarclays faces exposure to climate-related risks either directly through its operations and infrastructure or indirectly through its financing and investment activities. The two main categories of climate-related risks are physical risks and transition risks.\n\n## Physical risks\n\nPhysical risks result from a changing climate and can be event-driven (acute risks), including increased frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events such as cyclone, hurricanes and flooding. Physical risks can also be driven by longer-term shifts in climate patterns (chronic risks) from sustained higher temperatures, leading to rising sea levels, rising mean temperatures and more severe weather events.\n\n## Transition risks\n\nTransition risks result from the transition to a lower-carbon economy. This is likely to involve significant, rapid policy, regulatory and legal changes, as well as the evolution of technology and markets to adapt to a changing climate and associated impacts.\n\n## Time horizons\n\nThe impact of physical and transition risks can be significant and widespread, affecting Barclays' portfolio and financial performance over short-, medium- and long-terms horizons.\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nIn the short term, physical risks arising from extreme weather events and climate-related disasters pose a direct threat to Barclays' physical assets and infrastructure. This can potentially result in immediate losses, increased costs for repair and higher insurance premiums. Similarly, acute events may also potentially damage the physical facilities of Barclays' clients or cause business disruptions, which may adversely impact the value of clients' assets, reduce their profitability and subsequently lead to potential increase in credit risk for Barclays. Additionally, operations in regions prone to high physical risks may also experience higher insurance premiums or limited insurance coverage.\n\nTransition risks are expected to occur in all timeframes, but more broadly over the medium term. The cost of transitioning to cleaner technologies and sustainable business practices may strain the financial resources of businesses, affecting profitability and long-term viability. Financial institutions like Barclays could also face significant increases in costs and resources allocated to adhere to new policies, laws and regulations aimed at transitioning to a lowercarbon economy. This in turn may lead to higher conduct and operational risks to Barclays. At an individual level, there may be challenges related to employment opportunities as businesses transition away from carbon-intensive practices. This in turn may impact the creditworthiness of Barclays' clients and their ability to repay loans.\n\nTransition risks aimed at mitigating climate change can also impact the profitability and value of assets in Barclays' portfolio, particularly those linked to carbon-intensive industries. Companies perceived as slow to adapt or unresponsive to environmental concerns may face reputational damage or legal actions leading to decreased customer trust and investor support.\n\nWith escalating concerns and heightened global awareness of climate risks, it is likely that litigation linked to these risks will increase. Additionally, Barclays may face greater scrutiny of the type of business it conducts - including in the form of adverse media coverage and an increase in climate-related litigation cases. This in turn may adversely impact customer demand for Barclays' products, returns on business activities, value of assets and trading positions, resulting in higher impairment charges.\n\nLooking to the longer term, the cumulative effects of global temperature rise are likely to become increasingly pronounced - influencing ecosystems, sea levels and societal structures. Climate change can also trigger tipping points through feedback loops that amplify its effects. Certain tipping points are already underway, manifesting in observable changes across the globe. Different tipping elements, such as the melting of ice sheets or changes in ocean circulation, have varying time horizons. As the science develops, we are observing that some tipping points may run on a shorter timeline than initially expected. Accordingly, the uncertainty of exact timeframes in which such tipping points are expected to materialise adds a layer of complexity - making it challenging to precisely predict when impacts will materialise.\n\nWhen considering the timescales of climaterelated risks, Barclays has categorised short, medium and long term as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Short term (S): 0-1 year\n- \u00b7 Medium term (M): 1-5 years\n- \u00b7 Long term (L): 5-30 years.\n\nThe short-term timescale coincides with the short-term plan for annual budgets and granular financial plans. The medium term coincides with the five-year financial, capital and funding plans.\n\n## Climate change as a driver of risk\n\nThe feedback effects of climate risk drivers through macro and micro transmission channels are observed in Barclays' portfolio through traditional risk categories such as credit risk, market risk, treasury and capital risk, operational risk and reputational risk. The approach to identifying, measuring and managing climaterelated risks is consistent with other key risks, however there remains significant uncertainty around when these risks will materialise.\n\nClimate risk is integrated into the broader Enterprise Risk Management Framework, aligning with other Principal Risks and ensuring a holistic approach to risk identification, assessment and management. Barclays' Climate Risk Framework facilitates a structured integration of climate risk considerations into the Bank's operations. It undergoes regular reviews and updates - including changes to risk taxonomy, definitions and methodology - to align with changing regulatory expectations and external developments. Following the annual review of the Climate Risk Framework in 2023, Barclays no longer considers that a separate category is needed to capture second-order impacts of physical and transition risk, as these impacts are already being captured and managed within the existing assessments and framework. Therefore, connected risks no longer features as a separate category.\n\nThe potential impacts of physical and transition risk drivers will vary across Barclays' portfolios depending on composition, industry, geographic location, business operations and other contextual factors.\n\nThe tables below set out the example drivers, example potential impacts and expected time horizons of various physical and transition risks.\n\n+\n\nFurther details on how Barclays manages climate risk can be found on pages 272 to 276.",

These risks can be physical risks and transition risks, which in turn can present financial risks 1 .\n\nAs such, this year we have undertaken further work to develop our understanding of nature-related risks and how these relate to different industry sectors. Building on last year's heatmap analysis, we have updated our approach using publicly available data and explored a wider set of impacts and dependencies. This work has been designed to help build our understanding of the material naturerelated impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities within priority industry sectors, and indicate where we might focus further analysis, as we continue to build our nature related assessment and decision-making capabilities.\n\nThrough this work, we have developed an updated heatmap by mapping industry classification codes and the associated qualitative nature-related impact and dependency ratings from ENCORE 2 and SBTN 3 to Barclays' internal sector classifications. The mapping was undertaken for sectors with material impacts and dependencies as identified by TNFD in its Guidance for Financial Institutions 4 .\n\nWe then undertook an exploratory exercise which highlighted in which of these industry sectors particular nature-related impacts and dependencies are most likely to occur.\n\nThis work created a heatmap with ratings representing an average global view of the potential impacts and dependencies that may be associated with the direct operations of companies in these sectors.\n\nThe preliminary heatmap analysis highlighted that, for most of the priority industry sectors, there are a number of potential impacts and dependencies rated as high or very high, including impacts related to land-use change, water use and pollution, as well as dependencies on ecosystem services such as ground and surface water, climate regulation and flood-storm protection. These insights will be used to help inform our future analysis, taking into account that this represents one data source, and specific nature related risks within the same sector might vary substantially from company or project and an aggregated heatmap is not necessarily representative of the actual impacts and dependencies of Barclays' client base.\n\nOur proposed next steps include building on the TNFD LEAP pilot undertaken in 2022/2023 to conduct further sector-level analysis, taking into account the results of the heatmap, Barclays' exposure and client base and emerging thinking on impact and risk data and methodologies.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 Source: tnfd.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Recommendations\\_of\\_the\\_Taskforce\\_on\\_Nature-related\\_Financial\\_Disclosures\\_September\\_2023.pdf?v=1695118661\n- 2 ENCORE stands for Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks, and Exposure and is a tool developed by Global Economy, UNEP-FI, and UNEPWCMC.\n- 3 SBTN stands for Science Based Targets Network and builds on the momentum of the Science Based Targets initiative helping companies set science-based targets for nature.\n- 4 Source: tnfd.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Guidance\\_for\\_Financial\\_Institutions\\_v1.pdf\n\nNature-related data, models and methodologies are a nascent area and therefore evolving and reliant on externally sourced data mapped to internal sector identifiers, with various limitations. We will continue to review the applied data, models, and methodologies, as such the results of similar assessments are likely to change in the future.",

At the end of 2022, we announced a new target to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and Transition Finance. This followed a review of the financing requirements arising from the global transition to a low-carbon economy if the world is to avoid the worst effects of climate change and the potential addressable market for Barclays. During 2023 we built on this work to develop a Group-wide sustainable finance strategy to operationalise our ambition.\n\n## The market opportunity\n\nWe recognise the opportunities arising from the global transition to a low-carbon economy which will involve scaling up zero or near-zero emitting technologies and businesses and supporting emissions reductions in high-emitting and hard-to-abate sectors if the world is to avoid the worst effects of climate change.\n\nIn 2022, we completed a review of the market and identified three medium-term thematic areas of potential opportunity for Barclays, as outlined below. Although markets may have evolved during 2023 we believe these still represent growth opportunities for Barclays.\n\n## Energy Transition Finance\n\nThe analysis indicated that, based on current policy, technology and market developments, Energy Transition Finance - including renewables and nascent or early-stage climate technologies that are needed to scale to support the transition to net zero - represents an estimated 10-year addressable opportunity of over $16trn across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific (excluding China).\n\nThis extends to up to $24trn over the same time period if policy, technology and market developments step up to deliver on net zero by 2050.\n\nThis consists of a number of mature and scaling technologies with renewable energy (including wind and solar) and low-emissions transport (including electric vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles and mass transit) expected to make up over half of the addressable market through to 2030. The analysis also indicated significant longer-term opportunities in financing the scaling of capabilities in nascent technologies such as carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen solutions.\n\n## Sustainable finance instruments\n\nSustainable finance instruments represent an estimated $3.5trn-6trn annual issuance opportunity through to 2030 across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific (excluding China), with Europe  expected to remain the primary market for ESG debt.\n\nThe analysis indicated that all ESG instruments are expected to grow to 2030 with ESG debt excluding green bonds and loans represents an estimated 10-year $400-650bn cumulative financing opportunity for Barclays based on our global market share in sustainable finance instruments.\n\n## Retail and business banking\n\nBarclays UK recognises the environmental and societal benefits - and the commercial opportunities - that can be delivered through financing the UK economy's transition to net zero. Embracing the challenge of capturing opportunities from the transition to a low-carbon economy aligns with Barclays' Purpose and positions us to capitalise on the growing market for sustainable finance.\n\nOur 2022 market review indicated that, within the UK, sustainable opportunities in retail and business banking represent a $225-286bn market opportunity by 2025, increasing to an estimated $640bn-1trn by 2030.\n\nAccording to our 2022 market review, Green Home Mortgages represent the largest individual market for Barclays UK by 2030. We are actively exploring ways to unlock the decarbonisation of homes at scale by developing secured and unsecured lending for energy-efficiency-related technologies. We are also exploring strategic partnerships to provide customers and businesses with financing and guidance to make more sustainable choices. However, there are significant dependencies for this opportunity to be realised - namely customer demand, supply chain maturity and policy intervention.\n\n## Assessing the market opportunity\n\nTo determine the addressable global market for sustainable finance to 2030, Barclays' 2022 market review  leveraged widely used and credible third-party sources including the IEA, IRENA, Climate Bonds Initiative and the IFC as well as Barclays' own industry, ESG and market research. The analysis considered the investment needed through to 2030 for the world to align to net zero, including the accelerated scenarios reflecting possible policy and market developments. Having determined the global addressable market, Barclays developed scenarios for the Bank's potential market for various asset classes, product sets, technological sectors and geographic markets, validated through comparison with historic growth rates and our projected share of the overall market.\n\n## $1trn Sustainable and Transition Financing Target\n\nFollowing analysis of the market opportunity for sustainable financing, together with a review of the Group's capabilities, in December 2022 we announced a new target to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and Transition Financing between 2023 and the end of 2030,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- + Further details of Barclays' sustainable finance targets can be found on page 101 and further details on how Barclays' products  and services are harnessing these opportunities from page 107.\n\nWe recognise that we must tackle the decarbonisation of 'hard-to-abate' sectors that are carbon intensive - including through scaling and commercialising new technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture.\n\nDuring 2023 we developed a Transition Finance Framework, which we announced in early 2024. The Transition Finance Framework sets out the criteria for the inclusion of transition financing in our $1trn target. The inclusion of transition financing reflects our recognition of the importance of lending and facilitating funding and investing in technologies and activities that support GHG emission reduction (directly or indirectly) in high-emitting and hard-to-abate sectors.\n\n+\n\nFurther details of Barclays' Transition Finance Framework can be found on page 104.",

The strategy aligns with the climate and environmental themes that were identified when we announced our $1trn Sustainable and Transition Financing target in December 2022 and therefore underpins our plan to deliver that ambition.\n\nIn the development of the strategy, we identified three sustainability themes which are important in the journey towards a net zero and sustainable future, where we see significant commercial opportunity and where we believe we can focus and differentiate:\n\n- 1 Decarbonising industry\n- 2 Contributing to a nature-positive food system\n- 3 Supporting consumers on the path to net zero We also identified three pillars of competitive advantage for Barclays across those sustainability themes, through which we believe we can deliver for our clients by working collectively across our different businesses:\n- 1 Our strength in the UK\n- 2  Our focus on being a leading partner to climate technologies\n- 3  The strength of our business across sustainable credit markets\n\n## Our strategy to deliver on our sustainable finance ambition\n\nThree pillars where we can deliver for clients and stakeholders:\n\n## Support UK net zero\n\n## Leading climate tech partner\n\n## Sustainable credit markets\n\n- \u00b7 Facilitate the flow of capital to consumers and businesses\n- \u00b7 Deliver on our social purpose agenda by supporting the just transition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Decarbonising industry\n\nSupport SMEs and corporates across major industries to decarbonise, deploy new technology and manage their transitions\n\n- \u00b7 Facilitate the flow of capital to new and existing technologies critical to the net zero transition\n- \u00b7 Develop expertise and infrastructure financing solutions for the deployment of new technologies\n- \u00b7 Support climate tech companies across the lifecycle, from startup to IPO\n- \u00b7 Leverage strength in credit markets to facilitate clients' transition plans\n- \u00b7 Play a leading role in the creation of carbon and biodiversity markets\n- \u00b7 Unlock additional sources of capital, including through securitisation, savings and investments\n\n## Three sustainability themes where we can focus and differentiate:\n\n## Contributing to a naturepositive food system\n\nDrive the evolution to sustainable agriculture and foods, and facilitate regenerative land use\n\nThe graphic below provides a summary of the themes and pillars. At the intersection of each theme and pillar we are developing tailored products and services for our clients and customers to help them deliver on their transition and sustainability objectives.\n\nFor example, with our focus on climate technologies, we are supporting the development of start-ups in targeted technologies and nature from idea to IPO. We are also advising sustainable and Agtech companies on areas such as raising finance and M&A.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting consumers on the path to net zero\n\nProvide financing to facilitate consumer products to live and act sustainably, and support consumer-oriented climate tech and financing models\n\nThrough our sustainable finance strategy and our $1trn Sustainable and Transition Financing target, we have set out an ambition and approach that will support our clients and customers in their transition. Delivery of the strategy will require a multi-year investment in our people and capabilities, which we are now accelerating the execution of.\n\n## Identifying nature-related opportunities\n\nNature-related financing presents future opportunities for the financial sector given the capital requirements to address and reverse nature loss: the biodiversity financing gap is estimated to be $700bn per year 1 . As we execute our sustainable finance strategy, we aim to identify opportunities to play a role in supporting the financing of nature.\n\n+\n\nSee section Financing nature on page 105 for details of our approach.\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 cbd.int/doc/c/e6d3/cd1d/daf663719a03902a9b116c34/ cop-15-l-25-en.pdf",

We continued to source 100% \u0394 renewable electricity 4 for our global real estate portfolio 5 and continued to meet our 90% Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions reduction target 6 - reducing these emissions by 93% \u0394 .\n\nKey contributors to our progress include global real estate portfolio right-sizing 7 and energy efficiency programmes, as well as company vehicles electrification, and our continued focus on renewable electricity sourcing.\n\nFor our Scope 3 operational emissions, our focus remained on engaging with our key stakeholders and making data enhancements, particularly by acquiring primary supplier data and evolving our accounting methodology in line with industry standards and best practice. We also continued to pursue the integration of ESG considerations and expectations into processes throughout the procurement lifecycle.\n\nWe expect that our progress against our net zero operations targets and milestones is likely to be variable and non-linear. Our net zero operations strategy is dependent on broader industry, technological and regulatory changes that are outside Barclays' control and may affect our ability to achieve our targets and milestones. Further, as the accounting standards and data underlying our net zero operations strategy continue to evolve and be refined, this could impact our metrics, targets and milestones. Progress against our targets and milestones may also be impacted by management decisions based on key drivers unrelated to climate, for example prudent risk management practices.\n\nOur intent is to enhance data collection and accuracy to help identify key contributors to our impact, determine opportunities for improvement, and support the integration of sustainability into our business operations.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- \u0394    2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410.

\"milestone' denotes an indicator we are working towards and report against.\n- 3 We have updated internal data which has resulted in minor updates to FY2022 on-site renewable electricity capacity (from 0.26MW to 0.30MW).\n- 4 Targets are considered 'science-based' if they are in line with what the latest climate science deems necessary to meet the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement - limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), provides companies with independent assessment and validation of targets and is currently the internationally accepted standard.\n- 5 Indicative number provided to illustrate the number of suppliers by total addressable spend that have committed to or have science-based targets in place. In our 2022 Annual Report we reported 47% progress based on a review of our top 500 suppliers by addressable spend. Our current progress is reported here based on a review of our top 2,000 suppliers by addressable spend.\n- 6 Based on our indicative supply chain emissions inventory. DEFRA conversion factors - which Barclays uses to calculate spend data into supply chain emissions - were revised in 2023. These have been retrospectively applied to Barclays' 2018 baseline and 2022 disclosure, resulting in an increased 2018 baseline and recalculated 2022 metrics. In FY 2022 we reported 8% reduction in our supply chain GHG emissions and due to the changes in the DEFRA conversion factors and updated internal data, we recalculated the 2022 figure to be 17%. As our suppliers continue to develop the quality of emissions data for the goods and services we purchase, our reliance on spend data to calculate our emissions will reduce and the volume of primary data will increase.\n- 7 Campuses include 1 Churchill Place, Radbroke, Northampton, Glasgow, Pune, Whippany, 745 7th Avenue, Dryrock.\n- 8 Reported waste diversion performance for FY2022 has been recalculated from 65% to 49%, to account for an update in external data.\n- 9 Addressable spend is defined as external costs incurred by Barclays in the normal course of business where Procurement has influence over where the spend is placed. It excludes costs such as regulatory fines or charges, exchange fees, taxation, employee expenses or litigation costs, and property rent.\n\nPlease see ESG Data Centre for all recalculations and ESG Reporting Framework for our operational emissions accounting approach.\n\n- \u0394   2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410.

In 2023 we reported GHG emissions of Categories 1, 2 and 4 by aggregating these under Category 1. It is our intent to assign emissions to each of these separate categories in due course.\n- 2 The methodology used to calculate our GHG emissions follows the 'Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG): A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition)', defined by the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development. We have adopted the operational control approach on reporting boundaries.\n- 3 We continuously review and update our performance data based on updated GHG emission factor, improvements in data quality and updates to estimates previously applied. For 2023, we have applied the latest emissions factors as of 31 December 2023.

Energy efficiency measures reduce our overall energy demand and reliance on the grid to power our operations. Concurrently, by replacing fossilfuel-powered infrastructure, for example, by electrifying our buildings and company vehicles, we will aim to eliminate a significant part of our Scope 1 emissions and prepare our infrastructure to consume electricity from renewable sources.\n\n## Increasing energy efficiency\n\nTo continually improve operational energy efficiency, in 2023 we maintained global demand reduction programmes and right-sized 1 our global real estate portfolio - resulting in 44% energy consumption reduction against a 2018 baseline. These efforts also contributed to progress against our global corporate offices, 2 energy use intensity (EUI) milestone by reducing our EUI by 27% against a 2018 baseline.\n\nOur global energy optimisation programme contributed to our EUI reduction by adjusting corporate offices' settings and systems during periods of low or no occupancy to reduce our demand for energy while keeping our buildings running. In 2023 3 the programme contributed to approximately 9.1 GWh in energy savings at our UK corporate offices - equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of approximately 2,600 UK households. Programme projects included Glasgow campus baseload 4 reductions, where we reduced overnight usage of building equipment such as our lighting, heating and cooling systems, and power reductions for our building equipment at 1 Churchill Place in London, planned over bank holidays. Moving forward, we plan to implement the energy optimisation programme at additional corporate offices.\n\n## Electrification and replacing fossil-fuelpowered infrastructure\n\nIn 2023 we continued electrifying our real estate portfolio by replacing end-of-life natural gas heating and cooling equipment with electricpowered alternatives and prioritising electrification in campus developments wherever possible, For example, at our Glasgow campus we replaced natural gas boilers with an air source heat pump - leading to an 84% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions compared to 2022 at that campus. As part of the campus redevelopments at 1 Churchill Place, we are electrifying our kitchen cooking stoves. We will continue to incorporate electrification and fossilfuel-powered infrastructure replacement into future real estate decisions.\n\nAs part of our commitment to Climate Group's EV100 initiative, we have also made progress in transitioning our corporate vehicle fleet to electric vehicles (EVs) or ultra-low emissions vehicles (ULEVs). By the end of 2023 88% of our UK fleet was converted to EVs and 42% of our global fleet was converted to EVs or ULEVs.\n\nAll UK colleagues provided with a company car for their role have also been offered funded home-charging equipment to ease the transition to a fully electrified fleet.\n\nIn addition, we are replacing existing mobile banking vans with electric vans, providing a less carbon-intensive method of serving our Barclays UK customers and communities compared to the previous diesel-fuelled vehicles.\n\n## Replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy\n\nIn 2023 we maintained 100% \u0394 renewable electricity sourcing for our global real estate portfolio through instruments including green tariffs 5 (55%) and energy attribute certificates 6 (EACs)(45%), continuing to meet our 2025 target ahead of schedule.\n\nWe also maintained our long-term focus on planning additional on-site renewable energy installations and exploring tools like Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that bring additional renewable energy to the grid.\n\nWe continued developing strategies for on-site renewable energy installations such as solar panels, and have coordinated with stakeholders like local utilities and planning boards with the intent of installing these types of projects in coming years. Sites with existing solar panel installations, including Glasgow, Pune, Northampton and Cambridge Eagle Lab, have 0.40 MW of renewable electricity capacity.\n\nBeginning in 2024, up to 80% 7 of Barclays' annual UK electricity needs will be sourced through a PPA supporting Creag Riabhach, an onshore wind farm project in Scotland.\n\n## Scope 1 and 2 emissions data accounting\n\nWe continue to work on improving our data quality and accounting methodologies to make meaningful comparisons of emissions data over time and to make informed strategic decisions. Given the evolving nature of climate data and methodologies, past-period figures may change to reflect updates. To manage the impact of these changes we have detailed our operational climate data accounting approach in the ESG Reporting Framework on our ESG Resource Hub.\n\n## Embedding sustainability into operational practices\n\nAcross our operations we are introducing new standards and guidelines to help enable the integration of sustainability into decision making.\n\nFor example, in 2023 we introduced the Sustainability Design and Construction Checklist and Green Leasing Toolkit, which are guidelines that help integrate sustainability criteria into real estate processes in alignment with Barclays' net zero operations strategy. Both guidelines help teams identify gaps in existing real estate processes for leasing transactions and in design and construction projects. They serve as a record of inclusion and applicability of sustainability criteria for a given project, allowing teams to flag inconsistencies between project design and sustainability expectations.\n\n## Notes\n\n:\n\n- 1 By right-sizing we are optimising our space and associated resources for our operational needs.\n- 2 Corporate offices include offices and campuses.\n- 3 Data represents reduction from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023.\n- 4 Baseload is the minimum load experienced by a building energy system over a given period of time, that must be supplied at all times.\n- 5 Green tariffs are programmes in regulated electricity markets offered by utilities, allowing large commercial and industrial customers to buy bundled renewable electricity from a specific project through a special utility tariff rate.\n- 6 Energy attribute certificates are the official documentation to prove renewable energy procurement. Each EAC represents proof that 1 MWh of renewable energy has been produced and added to the grid. Global EAC standards for renewable claims are primarily Guarantees of Origin in Europe and UK,Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in North America and International RECs (I-RECs) in a growing number of countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.\n- 7 Figure has been estimated using 2022 UK real estate property portfolio electricity consumption as a reference.\n- \u0394    2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410.

In developing our supply chain net zero emissions pathway, we used the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Corporate Net Zero Standard and Target Setting Tool, consistent with a 1.5\u00baCaligned pathway.\n\n## Engagement and integration\n\nEngagement with our suppliers is a key vehicle for change. Our strategy is to engage proactively and constructively across our supplier organisations to increase climate transparency and accountability, and promote emissions reduction. In 2023 we invited 489 of our suppliers to disclose climaterelated information such as governance, risk strategy, targets and performance, emissions methodology and data related to climate change, through CDP. We achieved a 75% participation rate, representing approximately 75% of Barclays' 2023 supply chain emissions.\n\nIn 2022 we updated our standard supplier contract terms with requirements relating to climate change, including an obligation for our suppliers to have an emissions reduction programme in place by 2025, supported by a public reduction target and a commitment to achieve net zero GHG emissions no later than 2050. In 2023 we continued to embed the discussion and negotiation of these terms into new contracts and renewals. This is one of the steps we are taking to work towards our milestone of 90% of our suppliers, by addressable spend, to have sciencebased GHG emissions reduction targets in place by end of 2030. The terms also include a requirement for our suppliers to periodically disclose their direct and indirect GHG emissions using a recognised standard, such as the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.\n\nWe have also continued to work internally with our Sourcing colleagues to embed the consideration of GHG emissions into some of our key tenders for Supplier and Product selection. We are starting to embed the consideration of GHG emissions at the point of demand through seeking less-GHG-emissionintensive ways of meeting our needs. For example, the procurement process for capital projects now integrates sustainability into building design principles through embedding a Sustainability Design and Construction Checklist (see page 76 for more information).\n\nLastly, to support our engagement with suppliers, in 2023 we conducted an intelligence gathering exercise across our top 2,000 suppliers (based on spend 1 ) to seek understanding of their position on environmental and social matters.\n\n## Data enhancement\n\nOur strategy to achieve our milestones is underpinned by obtaining more accurate emissions data from our suppliers, to inform our approach to reducing emissions. Ultimately, we are reliant on our suppliers to provide accurate product-level primary data, in addition to reducing GHG emissions associated with the goods and services we purchase from them, to achieve emissions reductions across their own organisations. To measure progress towards our emissions reduction milestones and inform our supplier intervention strategy, reliable primary GHG emissions data will need to be collected and tracked over time across our supplier organisations. In 2022 primary data accounted for approximately 15% of our supply chain emissions inventory, increasing to 27% in 2023.\n\nWe understand that our success depends on that of our suppliers, and that progress may be variable and non-linear. Geographic considerations, resource capacities, data availability, legal requirements, market conditions and the varying transition pathways individual companies take, given the technologies available, may all affect the speed at which they can reduce emissions.\n\n## Supply chain baseline\n\nDEFRA conversion factors - which Barclays uses to calculate spend data into supply chain emissions - were revised in 2023. These have been retrospectively applied to Barclays' 2018 baseline and 2022 supply chain emissions, resulting in an increased 2018 baseline and revised 2022 figures. Our 2022 performance against supply chain milestone 2 increased from 8% to 17% due to the change in the DEFRA conversion factors and updated internal data. As our suppliers continue to develop the quality of emissions data for the goods and services we purchase, our reliance on spend data to calculate our emissions will reduce and the volume of primary data will increase.\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 In this section, when referring to 'spend', this is addressable spend, defined as external costs incurred by Barclays in the normal course of business where Procurement has influence over where the spend is placed. It excludes costs such as regulatory fines or charges, exchange fees, taxation, employee expenses or litigation costs, and property rent.\n- 2 Milestones referred to include: 'By end of 2030 we intend to work towards the milestone of 50% GHG supply chain emissions reduction (against a 2018 baseline).' and 'By end of 2050 we intend to work towards the milestone of 90% GHG supply chain emissions reduction (against a 2018 baseline)'.",

For example, we updated our booking and reporting platforms to highlight low-carbon modes of transport for our colleagues, including EV rentals where available. We provided colleagues with additional guidelines illustrating how they can reduce their travel emissions - identifying, for example, where they could combine multiple trips or switch from air to rail travel. We also continued to engage with our preferred airline partners to explore their plans to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).\n\nOur 2023 total colleague business travel emissions reduced by 43% against a 2018 baseline - noting these emissions doubled compared to 2022 due to a return to business travel post-COVID. We will continue to engage with our stakeholders and provide colleagues with the tools and resources to align with our net zero ambition. Our intent is to improve the accuracy of our business travel data to better inform emission reduction strategies.\n\n## Leased assets and waste\n\nWhile our leased assets and waste emissions are lower than other operational emissions, we are pursuing opportunities to reduce them.\n\nFor example, in 2023 we introduced a Green Leasing Toolkit to support engagements with landlords by encouraging the inclusion of our sustainability criteria throughout the leasing real estate lifecycle. The toolkit includes guidance and preferred contractual language for lease preferences.\n\nWe are also embedding circular economy principles within our operations. Further details are provided on page 79.\n\n## Supporting our colleagues\n\nOur goal is to provide colleagues with the tools and support needed to help reduce their individual environmental footprints.\n\nIn 2023, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 We continued to expand our range of green benefits for colleagues, including our UK EV salary sacrifice and UK and Ireland Bike4Work schemes. In 2023 over 900 colleagues ordered EVs through salary sacrifice and over 650 made use of Bike4Work\n- \u00b7 Officially launched in 2022, our Barclays Go Green sustainability gamification programme helps colleagues take and track actions that reduce their personal environmental footprint. In 2023, colleagues participated in over 20,000 activities such as switching off laptop equipment, opting for lower-carbon travel methods and replacing single-use items like cups with reusable alternatives\n- \u00b7 Our 14 global employee-led environment networks created and participated in activities aligned with Barclays' climate and sustainability strategy.\n\n+\n\nFurther information about how Barclays engages with colleagues can be found on page 122.\n\n## Carbon credits\n\nWe are currently reviewing our approach to the use of voluntary carbon market credits for operational emissions.\n\nWe remain supportive of initiatives to enhance the integrity of the voluntary carbon market across both the supply and demand side.",

This evaluation includes assessing our real estate operations' water, pollution, biodiversity and resource use impacts and dependencies. We will continue the assessment in 2024 to evaluate nature considerations in our operations moving forward.\n\nThe assessment will support our focus on improving resource use and the ability to protect natural environments through circular design principles - including designing-out waste and pollution across our operations, recycling, and regenerating natural ecosystems.\n\n## Circular economy principles and zero waste\n\nWe are working to embed circular economy principles across our operations by seeking to eliminate waste at the source through resource use reductions and by improving recycling rates.\n\nAcross our key campuses 1 we have an ambition to achieve and maintain TRUE (Total Resource Use and Efficiency) zero waste certified projects by end of 2035 with a milestone to divert 90% of waste from landfill, incineration and the environment by end of 2035 - and in 2023 achieved a 53% diversion rate of all waste, a 4% increase from the previous year 2 . Even though more colleagues have returned to work in our office locations, causing the total tonnage of waste to increase since 2022, the waste diversion rate from landfill and incineration has improved.\n\nThis result illustrates that, while more waste has been created, we are diverting more of it through increased waste segregation and reduced waste stream contamination - as well as through the introduction of more reusable items in our campuses.\n\nFor example, at our Glasgow and Pune campuses, we have increased waste segregation streams making it easier for colleagues to put the correct waste in the correct bin. The increased waste segregation streams resulted in an average contamination rate of 14% between Pune and Glasgow, compared to our average of 45% at key campuses where these solutions have not yet been implemented. The overall reduction in contamination rates supports our recycling rates - and, ultimately, our waste diversion milestone.\n\nIn addition, we are working to divert food waste from landfill and incineration through projects including the installation of on-site composters at our Glasgow and Pune campuses and the creation of commercial food waste collection points at various office locations.\n\nIn 2023 we also launched our reusable food and beverage dishware programmes across four key campuses with the aim to reduce single-use items and therefore waste.\n\n## Pollution management\n\nBarclays has controls in place to address pollution risks across our property portfolio globally where we operate generators and store diesel. The pollution risk controls are engineered to identify possible pollution sources and pathways for an uncontrolled release to cause environmental harm, assess mitigation measures and identify improvements and actions that can be taken to further enhance our pollution prevention and mitigation measures.\n\nIn 2023, 41% of our global real estate portfolio remains certified to ISO 14001, the international standard for designing and implementing an Environmental Management System (EMS).\n\n## Unreasonable Impact company Re:Dish powering sustainable solutions for Barclays\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter receiving support from Barclays through the Unreasonable Impact programme, Re:Dish has brought its reusable dishware programme full circle to Barclays' New York City, Wilmington and Whippany campuses.\n\nAs part of our ambition to become a net zero bank by 2050, Barclays is working to achieve and maintain TRUE (Total Resource Use and Efficiency) zero-waste-certified projects across key campuses by 2035.\n\nRe:Dish supports our goal by helping us remove hundreds of thousands of single-use items a year from our waste stream. Re:Dish delivers food and beverage containers to Barclays, collects used containers and cups to clean and sanitise, and returns them for reuse. Instead of requiring more materials and resources for new containers and specialised cleaning equipment, Barclays taps into an existing network of fit-for-purpose dishware and washing services that can efficiently accommodate fluctuating demand.\n\nIn addition, Re:Dish and Barclays partnered to build colleagues' understanding of circularity - an important contributing factor to the success of these programmes. Re:Dish containers have a QR code colleagues can scan to see exactly how many times that specific unit has been reused and the resulting estimated environmental impact.\n\nTo learn more about Unreasonable Impact partnerships, see page 110.\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 Key campuses include 1 Churchill Place, Radbroke, Northampton, Glasgow, Pune, Whippany, 745 7th Avenue, Dryrock.\n- 2 Reported waste diversion performance for FY2022 has been recalculated from 65% to 49%, to account for an update in external data.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on Barclays' approach to biodiversity can be found on page 124 .",

To meet our ambition, we need to reduce the client emissions we finance - not just for lending but for capital markets activities, too.\n\nWe work closely with our clients to ensure that over time the activities we finance are aligned to the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement. Consistent with our Purpose, and taking into account considerations of all relevant business factors, we continue to set emissions reduction targets for our portfolios where possible, aligned with the ambitions of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), of which we are a founding member. We also continue to set and follow clear restrictions on financing certain activities.\n\n+\n\nFurther details on our restrictive policies can be found on page 100.\n\nThe core building block for developing the transition framework for Barclays to be a net zero bank is our ability to estimate the full in-scope balance sheet financed emissions.\n\n- 1 In 2020, we developed our BlueTrack TM methodology to measure and track our progress against our financed emissions, setting targets for Energy upstream and Power generation initially.\n- 2 As of 2022, we had reported the baseline financed emissions for five sectors covered under BlueTrack TM where we have set reduction targets as well as UK Residential Real Estate where we set a convergence point.\n- 3 In 2023, we have further extended the scope of our calculations to cover the full in-scope balance sheet financed emissions based on methodology which has been developed using the PCAF\n\nStandard and have expanded the scope of BlueTrack TM to set reduction targets for three new sectors - Agriculture, Aviation and UK Commercial Real estate. Additionally, we have expanded the scope of our UK Residential Real Estate 1 convergence point.\n\nHence, we are pivoting our approach to disclosing our financed emissions across two sections:\n\n- 1 Estimating the full in-scope balance sheet financed emissions using a methodology which has been developed using the PCAF Standard 2 . The data reported in this section of the Annual Report (up to page 83) is as at December 2022. Hence, these numbers follow a lag of one year when compared to other climate-related disclosures based on December 2023 in this report, due to the lead time required to fully analyse our entire in-scope exposures.\n- 2 Continuing to use the BlueTrack\u2122 methodology to assess financed emissions for material sectors and set 2030 targets integrating 1.5\u00b0C scenarios. This data is being reported as at December 2023.\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 For further details please see page 98.\n- 2 PCAF Standard - PCAF (2022).

For instance, in the case of a loan we consider the committed amount (both drawn and undrawn), as opposed to just outstanding amounts (which is the approach preferred by PCAF) for calculating financed emissions.\n- 2 We have also consistently used the book value of equity and debt for all clients to calculate the attribution factor, while PCAF recommends using the Enterprise Value Including Cash (EVIC) for listed entities.\n- 3 PCAF recommends calculating emissions at a client level. For certain sectors, clients could have presence in activities across multiple parts of the value chain and in such cases reported emissions may not be consistent and reliable to estimate financed emissions. To overcome this challenge we calculate emissions at an activity level, using a range of options aligned to the PCAF Standard's guidance to calculate client emissions.\n\nFor certain activities - including fossil fuel exploration and production, electric power generation and automotive manufacturing - we employ asset-level production data to estimate client emissions. For activities such as cement and steel production, we use client-reported emissions. Where we do not have sufficient data on reported emissions or physical activities - for example in relation to mortgages where we do not have EPC data available - we use fall-backs based on emission factors.\n\nFor an immaterial part of our balance sheet (c. 1%), where the appropriate sector fall-backs could not be reliably obtained, we have used the overall portfolio average economic emissions intensity to estimate emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- + Our Financed Emissions Methodology paper (published in 2024) provides more details of our methodology and can be found within the ESG Resource Hub: home.barclays/ sustainability/esg-resource-hub/reporting-and-disclosures/\n\n## Results\n\nBarclays has assessed the extent to which the business is aligned to a well-below 2 o C pathway by calculating an estimate of our financed emissions for the full in-scope balance sheet as at December 2022, which has enabled us to calculate the coverage of our financed emissions reduction targets across our portfolio (including integration of 1.5\u00b0C aligned scenarios and ranges for certain sectors to reflect dependencies outside our control that will determine how quickly our financed emissions can be reduced in these sectors).\n\nOur estimation of our overall financed emissions indicates a total annual Scope 1,2 emissions of c.80MtCO2e for FY2022. Among these, we have set 2030 financed emissions targets covering our clients' Scope 1,2 emissions (including integration of 1.5\u00b0C aligned scenarios and ranges for certain sectors and including UK Housing for which we have set a convergence point) for 55% of our full in-scope balance sheet financed emissions. Beyond this we have also set 2030 targets integrating a 1.5\u00b0C aligned scenario covering Scope 3 emissions for Energy Upstream, Automotive manufacturing LDVs, Aviation and UK Agriculture - Livestock and Dairy Farming.\n\n## Emissions coverage\n\nWe have computed our overall financed emissions based on Scope 1 and Scope 2 of our clients' emissions as at December 2022. Hence, these numbers follow a lag of one year when compared to other disclosures based on December 2023 in this report. The lag of one year is due to the lead time required to fully analyse our entire in-scope exposures.\n\nWe have excluded our clients' Scope 3 emissions from these calculations except for activities where we have set a target on Scope 3 emissions - which includes Energy Upstream, Automotive manufacturing LDVs, Aviation and UK Agriculture. - Livestock and Dairy Farming. This is due to challenges in sourcing reliable and consistent data, not just on reported Scope 3 emissions but also the fall-back emission factors for downstream emission estimations. As we refine our approach and data sourcing strategy, we will assess the suitability of including Scope 3 emissions in our financed emissions disclosures.\n\nAligned to the guidance issued by the NZBA, our metrics and targets for all sectors capture emissions on a CO2e basis. For activities where we have set targets, we have assessed which GHGs are relevant and material for the respective sector.",

The PCAF Standard provides guidance to measure data quality (DQ) through a hierarchy ranging from DQ1 (best) to DQ5 (worst) specific to each asset class. Our estimation of the data quality is also largely aligned to the PCAF Standard's guidance.\n\nOur current data quality is dispersed across DQ1-2 (reported emissions) data, DQ3 (deriving emissions from physical activity data) and DQ4-5 (deriving emissions from revenue or asset-based emission factors). For activities where we have set targets, DQ is mostly concentrated across DQ1-2 and DQ3. We have identified a concentration of lower DQ scores for the category of activities where we are yet to set targets - including banks, financial institutions and sovereigns. This indicates that we need to consider the current estimate of financed emissions for these activities as highly preliminary and indicative only, and which can change materially as we improve data quality.\n\nClimate data, models and methodologies are evolving - and are not yet at the same standard as more traditional financial metrics. Our financed emissions calculations rely on externally sourced data mapped to internal customer and client identifiers. The externally sourced data has various limitations for each sector, including lack of coverage, low resolution, consistency and transparency of company-reported data, as well as the time lag for external sources to report estimates or actuals.\n\n## Data quality distribution of Barclays' financed emissions calculation (as at December 2022)\n\n|                                                                                      | Scope 1,2 emissions 1                           | Scope 1,2 emissions 1                                 | Scope 1,2 emissions 1                                   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Category                                                                             | DQ1-2 Reported emissions  (verified/unverified) | DQ3 Use of physical-activity- based emissions factors | DQ4-5 Use of economic-activity- based emissions factors |\n| Activities with 2030 targets integrating 1.5\u00b0C scenario as at December 2022 2        | 18  %                                           | 74  %                                                 | 7  %                                                    |\n| UK Housing (Convergence Point)                                                       | -                                               | 63  %                                                 | 37  %                                                   |\n| Activities with 2030 targets integrating 1.5\u00b0C scenario after December 2022          | 22  %                                           | -                                                     | 78  %                                                   |\n| Activities not covered by targets integrating 1.5\u00b0C scenarios (including Sovereigns) | 25  %                                           | -                                                     | 75  %                                                   |\n| Total                                                                                | 19 %                                            | 17 %                                                  | 64 %                                                    |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 For sectors where we calculate Scope 3 emissions - Aviation, UK Livestock and Dairy Farming, Fossil Fuel Extraction and Production, and Automotive manufacturing (LDV) - our data quality distribution is 85% in DQ3 and 15% in DQ4-5.\n- 2 Totals may not be equal to 100% due to rounding.\n\nTime lags could be as much as two years for data such as company value, company revenue share, emissions, production capacity and capacity factors.

To manage the impact of these changes we have adopted a principles-based approach to guide whether prior metrics and baselines should be restated or re-baselined.\n\n- \u00b7 A restatement involves updating the historical starting point for a period and recalculating the historical performance.\n- \u00b7 A re-baseline involves keeping the historical performance constant and recalculating the current period baseline to ensure consistency when reviewing performance. The indicative historical baseline will also be disclosed.\n\nDue to this, direct like-for-like comparisons of financed emissions information disclosed may not always be possible from one reporting period to another. Where information is restated or re-baselined this will be identified or explained.\n\nIn line with our reporting approach for past period metrics, we have re-baselined internal and external data, which has resulted in minor updates (less than 1%) to Energy, Cement and Automotive Manufacturing metrics and a c.2% impact to the Power metrics. The most material change has been the treatment of multi-client shared facilities, which has led to an additional c.4% impact in the baseline (2022) metrics for Automotive Manufacturing.\n\n| Scenario                                                                                                                                          |                 | Our approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Error identified in our internal finance data or  methodology                                                                                     | Restatement     | \u00b7 Financed emissions metrics for all years impacted by the error will be restated, including the baseline year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Changes to our methodology and/or data sources to  calculate financed emissions (for example, including  additional GHGs)                         | Re-baseline     | \u00b7 The updated methodology will be applied from the start of the current reporting period. \u00b7 The last reported financed emissions spot metric will be recalculated using the new methodology/data source to  provide the new baseline.

We have developed our BlueTrack TM methodology to measure and track our targets, which incorporate a 1.5\u00b0C scenario for our 2030 targets, for these high emitting material sectors 2 . BlueTrack TM starts by selecting a benchmark for a sector that defines how financed emissions for a portfolio need to change over time, in line with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement - consistent with scenarios limiting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5\u00b0C. We measure the financed emissions within a selected boundary for a sector, then aggregate these into a portfoliolevel metric - which is then compared to the benchmark.\n\nTM\n\nBlueTrack is being expanded to cover the Agriculture, Aviation and UK Commercial Real Estate sectors. The Residential Real Estate sector is also being expanded to include housing associations and small business buy-to-let lending, and is now referred to as UK Housing. During 2023 we assessed our baseline emissions from our Shipping sector portfolio as part of our NZBA commitment to set targets covering the transportation sector. This assessment concluded that we provided limited financing to a small number of clients and have limited financed emissions overall. We have therefore not set a target for the Shipping sector at this time. We may reassess our approach in the future should this become a more material contributor to our\n\noverall financed emissions.\n\n+ Our Financed Emissions Methodology paper (published in 2024) provides more details of our methodology and can be found within the ESG Resource Hub at: home.barclays/ sustainability/esg-resource-hub/reporting-and-disclosures/\n\n## Sector boundaries\n\nWe have set targets on the segment of the value chain where either (i) it is generally recognised that decarbonisation efforts are likely to spur the rest of the sector value chain to fall into alignment or (ii) where financiers are likely to have more influence over companies active in that segment. Our choice of segment is based on Barclays' own view, informed by guidance and recommended practice from portfolio alignment initiatives such as PACTA, SBTi and others.\n\n## Emissions scope\n\nFor each sector target in BlueTrack TM we must consider which of a company's emissions we should measure - for example, direct or indirect emissions, or selected greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. We define this according to the GHG Protocol definition of Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Within the boundary of our target we aim to capture the part of a company's value chain that generates  most of their emissions, taking into account considerations including materiality, consistency to benchmark, level of control and whether the emissions can be abated by the company. For example, our Upstream Energy target includes Scope 3 emissions - recognising they are significant for a company extracting fossil fuels. The financed emissions covered under BlueTrack TM are therefore a subset of the total financed emissions for each customer or client, as they only include the portion of the client's activities that are within both the value chain we have chosen for the sector and the scope of emissions we deem material for that activity.\n\n## Use of carbon credits\n\nWe do not allow company-purchased offsets such as carbon credits to reduce emissions, as we believe it is important to base a metric on operational activities under a company's control - rather than on unrelated credits, the availability of which may be limited.\n\nThe methodology does allow company-operated removals, such as on-site carbon capture at a plant - however, given this is currently marginal in the context of emissions, there is currently no impact on our portfolio-financed emissions metrics.\n\n## Target metrics\n\nBarclays uses two financed emissions metrics to set targets:\n\n- 1. Emissions Intensity: how much CO2e (Carbon Dioxide Equivalent) is released on average for a certain amount of economic activity or material produced;\n- 2. Absolute Emissions: a measure of the absolute emissions generated, or fair share, of the company's emissions over time.\n\nWe use absolute emissions for the Energy and Agriculture sectors, whose decarbonisation pathway relies on a reduction in production volume as well as on a reduction in intensity. The Energy sector cannot reduce its carbon emissions intensity below a certain point - a barrel of oil cannot be decarbonised, for instance - and therefore a reduction in absolute carbon emissions is more appropriate. The Agriculture sector requires a shift away from the production of meat and dairy towards alternative protein sources, as farmers respond to changing diets. We use emissions intensity for the other sectors, whose decarbonisation pathway relies primarily on reduction in intensity rather than volumes. These metrics are sensitive to factors which are not directly related to real world emissions, such as changes in the book value of debt and equity, for absolute emissions, and changes in revenue share for emissions intensity.\n\n## Reference scenarios\n\nEach of our 2030 target ranges is developed with reference to a 1.5\u00b0C-aligned scenario. For the majority this is the IEA's Net Zero by 2050 (NZE2050) scenario. In calculating a convergence point for our UK Housing portfolio and a target for\n\nUK Agriculture, we use a UK-focused Balanced Net Zero Scenario developed by the UK's Climate Change Committee (CCC BNZ). For the UK CRE portfolio we use the CRREM scenario that provides decarbonisation pathways across different property types consistent with the NZE2050 scenario. For the Aviation sector we use the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP)'s 'Prudent' (PRU) scenario - a 1.5\u00b0C-compatible roadmap for the sector to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\n\n## Baseline year\n\nWe measure our financed emissions for each portfolio against a baseline metric determined in the year we first assessed that target. The baseline year therefore varies across the nine sectors assessed to date, to ensure we are using the most up-to-date data available when we set our targets or, in the case of UK Housing, a convergence point.\n\n## Use of target ranges\n\nFor Power, Cement, Steel, Automotive manufacturing and Aviation, we have set emissions intensity targets using a target range. While we are clear on the reduction required to align with the 1.5 o C benchmark pathway - the higher emissions reduction in the range - we recognise there are dependencies outside our control that will determine how quickly our financed emissions intensity can be reduced in these sectors. The lower emissions reduction in the range reflects our view of the sector, client pathways and commitments at the time of setting the target. We seek to achieve the higher emissions reduction, consistent with our net zero ambition, but achieving it will depend on external factors.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 As defined in Foundations of Climate Mitigation Target Setting published by the UNEP Finance Initiative (unepfi.org/wordpress/ wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-for-climatemitigation-target-setting.pdf).\n- 2 When we first developed BlueTrack, the best available scenario to develop Paris-aligned benchmarks for our financing portfolios was the International Energy Agency's Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) which was aligned to a 1.7\u00b0C world. The 2025 targets set for the Energy and Power sectors were informed by the SDS scenario.",

In 2023 and cumulatively, there are a number of drivers behind the changes in our portfolio emissions, including changes in our financing across both our lending and capital markets financing activity, our clients' emissions, client data and metrics such as company valuation, and other data inputs and methodology updates as defined in our Financed Emissions Methodology paper (published in 2024). We expect to continue to see these impact our metrics in the future as data availability and quality, methodologies, guidance, and best practices for calculating our financed emissions metrics - all of which include differing levels of estimation -continue to evolve and be refined.\n\n## Energy\n\nTo date our absolute financed emissions from our upstream Energy portfolio are down 44% to 42.5 MtCO2e \u0394 from our 2020 baseline - an additional 12% reduction from our 2022 level. Of our total financed emissions, c.79% was related to oil, gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) production, with NGLs being relatively immaterial. The remaining c.21% was attributable to coal production. Our progress in 2023 largely reflects reductions in our total financing volumes for this portfolio as well as impacts from changes in company book values which can fluctuate year to year and thus impact cumulative and year-over-year progress (either positively or negatively) on our target.\n\n## Power\n\nIn 2023 our Power generation portfolio achieved a 26% cumulative reduction in emission intensity - an additional 17% reduction from our 2022 levels. This reflects our clients' continued progress in reducing their own emissions\n\nintensity, which was identified in part through improved data collection and analysis, as well as net reductions in the intensity of our new lending activity - but was partially offset by a higher intensity mix for our capital markets financing.\n\nAdditionally a material portion of our 2023 progress was driven by a short-term transaction. There is a risk that we are not able to replace this with a transaction(s) of similar size and emissions intensity which could result in an increase in our reported emissions intensity.\n\nWithin our Power portfolio our clients' ability to continue transitioning, and therefore our ability to continue increasing our green and transition financing to help deliver our BlueTrack TM and Sustainable Financing targets, are dependent, at least in part, on supply chains for renewable energy, required investments in grid infrastructure, a stable or positive policy environment, and other factors potentially beyond our control, including our clients' strategic or financing decisions.\n\nDespite our progress to date and the actions we have taken to manage our portfolio, the likelihood of achieving our targets - particularly the 2025 target where the potential management actions are narrowing - could be significantly impacted by the variables and dependencies described on this page.\n\n## Cement\n\nThe emissions intensity of our Cement portfolio has reduced by a cumulative 8% against our 2021 baseline - a decrease of 6% from last year's metric. During 2023 we've seen a material number of our clients in this sector update their emissions intensity targets and receive SBTi validation as 1.5\u00b0C-aligned.\n\n## Steel\n\nOur Steel portfolio emissions intensity has dropped by c.16% from our 2021 baseline - an additional 5% decrease this year. During 2023\n\nthe decreased intensity reflects our clients' continued progress in achieving emissions reductions and a shift in our financing activity mix towards lower-emissions clients.\n\n## Automotive manufacturing\n\nDuring 2023 our Automotive manufacturing portfolio's emissions intensity remained broadly flat. This reflects a reduction in the emissions intensity of our clients as they increase their electric vehicle sales, but was partially offset by year-over-year reductions in our clients' green bond issuance and a net increase in the emissions intensity of our lending activity due to the mix of our portfolio.\n\n## Future target progress\n\nTo date, emissions reductions in the real economy have not been sufficient to align economies to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway.\n\nWe expect our progress against these targets will continue to be non-linear, due to the many external dependencies and variables beyond Barclays' control that may determine the pace of transition. For example, a recent assessment identified that plans, projections and policies for fossil fuel production by governments are not in line with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement 1 .\n\nGoing forward our metrics will continue to have the potential to reflect different levels of volatility and could be impacted by a variety of external factors, including but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 The pace and timing of our clients' progress, on their individual transition pathways\n- \u00b7 Future technological advancements\n- \u00b7 The public policy and regulatory environment\n- \u00b7 Geopolitical or regional developments\n- \u00b7 Updates to data inputs used by BlueTrack TM (e.g. company valuations).\n\nThe volatility of the mix and volume of capital markets financing, which is included in our\n\nmetrics, may also result in significant increases and decreases in our metrics. Our ability to achieve our targets may be affected positively or negatively by these external factors.\n\nOur target progress in future years could be impacted by client portfolio decisions driven by other non-financial factors, such as counterparty risk, and other relevant business considerations. Changes in our financing activity for a single client within a portfolio can have a significant impact on our reported metrics and progress and may be outside of our control.\n\nProgress against our targets may also be impacted by management decisions based on key drivers unrelated to climate or the transition, for example prudent risk management practices. Specifically across the Cement, Steel and Automotive manufacturing portfolios, in addition to the general risks and dependencies outlined above, these targets are particularly sensitive to even minor changes in our financing mix or clients' emissions intensity, given the relatively limited number of clients included in these portfolios - so progress towards these targets could be particularly volatile and significantly impacted by the portfolio and client\n\ndependencies outlined above.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 unep.org/resources/production-gap-report-2023\n- \u0394  2023 data subject to independent Limited Assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410. Current limited assurance scope and opinions can be found within the ESG Resource Hub: home.barclays/sustainability/esg-resource-hub/reporting-anddisclosures/\n\n## Managing our portfolios\n\nWe continue to manage our portfolios, balancing between our commercial objectives, prudent risk management practices and other non-financial objectives in support of our strategy. As part of this we take into account our relevant climaterelated risks and considerations, including how our portfolios are performing against our BlueTrack TM targets so this can be evaluated in context alongside other relevant business metrics.",

Where we identify targets are potentially at risk of being missed particularly as target dates draw nearer and the opportunities for us to take management actions narrow - we will continue to reassess our approach, taking into account broader business considerations including potential franchise impacts.\n\nDuring 2023 we have continued to invest in building improved reporting, tools, and processes including our Client Transition Framework, which enables us to adjust management oversight based on our evolving estimates of our future potential performance against these targets.\n\n+\n\n- Further details of how climate risk-related considerations are managed can be found in the managing impacts in lending and financing section on page 236.\n\n## Client Transition Framework (CTF)\n\nThe CTF, first piloted in 2022, supports our evaluation of our corporate clients' current and expected future progress as they transition to a low-carbon business model.\n\nWe conduct these assessments annually for corporate clients in the Corporate and Investment Bank that are in-scope for sectors where BlueTrack TM targets have been set. As new BlueTrack TM targets are set the CTF will be applied to our corporate clients in those sectors.\n\nDuring 2023 we enhanced our CTF based on recommendations from the external review of our pilot. The continued development of the CTF leverages climate expertise across Barclays and is informed by the evolving landscape and guidance from third-party frameworks such as TPI, CA100+ and SBTi, and other industry initiatives including the UK's Transition Plan Taskforce, and GFANZ. We have maintained the general structure of our assessments with component scores aggregating into an overall CTF score.\n\nThe ambition component seeks to assess a client's alignment with our emissions reduction targets and 1.5\u00b0C scenario benchmarks across the past, present, near- and long-term future emissions. In our scoring assessments we place a higher weighting on their past, present and near-term future emissions targets than on their long-term ones.\n\nThe credibility component seeks to assess the qualitative elements of a client's transition plan. It considers criteria that indicate the likelihood a client will meet its targets, such as board oversight, low-carbon technologies employed, and green capital or operational expenditure plans. We more heavily weight the criteria that are critical to having a credible plan than those that are determined to be supporting criteria.\n\nMost of these criteria are consistent across sectors, however, we also consider some sectorspecific criteria. In total we evaluate over 80 data points for each assessment. Examples of our CTF criteria include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 The company's ambition and targets to reduce operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions\n- \u00b7 Historic Scope 3 disclosures and Scope 3 reduction targets, along with a 2030 target\n- \u00b7 Any expansion of high-carbon activities\n- \u00b7 Forward-looking green capex plan to achieve their targets.\n\nThe sub-scores for each component are combined to arrive at an overall CTF score from T1 (best) to T5 (worst).\n\nWe have codified where clients would be deemed out-of-scope for our CTF assessments. We have set a minimum revenue share threshold to identify which clients are required to be assessed, though clients below this threshold may still be assessed.\n\n## CTF overview\n\n## Ambition\n\n## Credibility\n\nAssesses clients' past, present and future emissions as a proxy for their emissions reduction ambition\n\nPast emissions\n\nPresent emissions\n\nFuture emissions\n\nAssesses the critical and supporting qualitative elements of clients' transition plans as a proxy for the credibility of their plans\n\nCritical criteria\n\nSupporting criteria\n\nAssessment of disclosed indicators that significantly impact the likelihood of achieving set target(s), such as governance indicators, use of low-carbon technologies, green spending plans, and expansion of carbon-intensive assets\n\nAssessment of the level of consistency given to transitioning their business, such as the use of offsets/ credits, TCFD alignment and SBTi target validation submission\n\nEvidence of progress in emissions over the last three years\n\nComparison of current BlueTrack TM emissions against target glidepaths\n\nAssessment of client targets including projected emissions metrics and rates of change to 2030 and 2050\n\n## Sector-specific considerations\n\nAssesses transition-related elements that have not been addressed within the other sections\n\n## Sector-specific indicators\n\n## Unscored criteria\n\nAdditional sector-specific factors that impact the strength of a transition plan\n\nFactoring additional data points that might be beneficial for benchmarking purposes and/or for future reference\n\nEnergy\n\nPower\n\nCement\n\nJust transition pilot\n\n- \u00b7 Methane commitments\n- \u00b7 Coal phaseout plan\n- \u00b7 Target set on gross basis\n\n## Ambition score\n\n## Credibility score\n\nA1- A5\n\nC1 - C5\n\nBest\n\nT1\n\nT2\n\nT3\n\nT4\n\nT5\n\nWorst\n\n## Client Transition Framework score",

The CTF informs our engagement with clients while also helping to identify and manage transition risk in our own financing portfolios.\n\nCapital is critical for a successful energy transition and we are focusing our financing towards clients actively engaged in the energy transition. The scale of our business gives us the opportunity to help finance the energy transition - to use our global reach, products, expertise and position in the global economy to work with our clients, including those in the Energy sector, as they transition to a low-carbon business model.\n\nIn 2023 we began climate-specific engagement for those clients with CTF scores of T4 and T5, facilitated by a newly established Client Transition Review Forum (CTRF).\n\nThe CTRF consists of senior representatives from across Sustainable Finance, ESG & Sustainability, Climate Risk, Portfolio Management, and Banking and is chaired by the Head of Sustainable Finance. Informed by the CTF, this new forum conducts holistic reviews of our business appetite alongside the future client relationship potential. These are informed by the CTF assessment and take into account consideration of relevant risks and other business factors.\n\nThese reviews help determine our financing appetite for these clients (including consideration of client retention and conditions to refinancings), alongside implications for our emissions reduction targets, commercial, credit and reputational impacts. Notwithstanding the outcomes of the CTRF reviews, financing decisions are transaction specific, and will continue to be subject to consideration by relevant committees, such as in relation to credit risk, reputation, and capital impact.\n\nAs a newly established forum, its governance of the CTRF will continue to evolve to ensure it remains fit for purpose.\n\nWe reviewed over 300 client counterparties at the CTRF in 2023, engaging with clients as appropriate, to help build awareness of the need to transition and gather information on how we can best support them in their journey. The CTF helps us prioritise client engagement, focusing on those most at risk of falling behind our transition expectations.\n\nWe have also begun to use the results from the CTF assessments to drive engagements with clients, facilitating discussions about their transition plans and providing insights such as highlighting how they benchmark against their peers.\n\nWe have found this engagement helps increase our connectivity with these clients and can be useful in identifying opportunities to further finance their transition.\n\nWe are also using the CTF scores to inform our business and credit appetite as we look to manage transition risks within our portfolios. To do this we have begun implementing CTF-linked mandate and scale limits.\n\nThe CTF approach is kept under review and we are considering enhancements in 2024, including reviewing the weightings for criteria such as energy clients capex, to align elements more closely to our updated Climate Change Policy.\n\n## CTF results\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: Charts and figures exclude clients determined to be out of scope for the CTF assessments. Clients may have scores in multiple sectors but are included only once to avoid doublecounting.\n\nUsing our updated CTF methodology we completed assessments covering over 1,250 counterparties during 2023 across our Power, Energy, Steel, Cement, Automotive manufacturing and Aviation BlueTrack TM sector portfolios.\n\nFindings, by client count, from our assessments include:\n\n- \u00b7 86% have a public emissions reduction target\n- \u00b7 of which 38% in SBTi-eligible sectors have had their targets validated\n- \u00b7 67% have executive compensation tied to ESG progress\n- \u00b7 85% have explicit board oversight of their transition plan or emissions targets\n- \u00b7 40% have committed to a just transition.",

Emissions from fossil fuel extraction, including from flaring and venting, is also significant - and responsible for 40% of global methane emissions 2 .\n\nThe global economy still uses fossil fuels for many essential activities - including electricity generation, transport and heating. The IEA scenarios to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C assume continued but reducing use of fossil fuels as part of the energy mix.\n\nAs Energy and Power play a fundamental role in society, the transition must balance the need to address energy security and shift energy supply while meeting energy demand. Consideration must also be given to the need for a just transition, ensuring equitable access to energy across communities.\n\nWe will continue to support an energy sector in transition, focusing on the diversified energy companies investing in low carbon and with greater scrutiny on those engaged in developing new oil and gas projects.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 See climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions\n- 2 See iea.org/energy-system/fossil-fuels/methane-abatement\n\n## Reducing our Energy and Power-financed emissions\n\nWe have set targets to reduce our financed emissions from our Energy and Power portfolios in line with the decarbonisation pathway set out in the IEA Net Zero scenario (IEA NZE).\n\nTo meet our targets we utilise our full toolkit including CTF assessments, client engagement, portfolio management and restrictive policies, which are included in our Climate Change Statement.\n\nAs outlined on page 90 above, our CTF assessments evaluate over 80 data points for each assessment and, in relation to Energy and Power, include the following additional criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 Methane emissions reduction targets (for Energy)\n- \u00b7 Commitments to phase-out thermal coal (for Power)\n\nWe actively engage with clients to help build awareness of the need to transition and gather information on how we can best support them in their journey. The CTF is helping us to prioritise client engagement, focusing on those most at risk of falling behind our transition expectations.\n\nWe have established a climate portfolio management team to steer our portfolio towards achieving our targets and manage transition risks, using CTF scores to inform our business and credit appetite.\n\nTotal exposure to the Energy sector is subject to a constrained and closely monitored aggregate risk appetite. We have begun implementing CTFlinked credit limits for the clients most at risk of failing to transition in line with our targets and climate risk appetite - currently identified as those with scores of T4 and T5.\n\nWe have a Climate Change Statement which sets out our positions and approach to sensitive sectors. In 2024 we have updated the Climate Change Statement to include new requirements for the Energy sector and restrictions on the type of exposures and risk we will finance going forward.\n\nNotwithstanding the outcomes of the CTRF reviews, financing decisions are transaction specific, and will continue to be subject to consideration by relevant committees, such as in relation to credit risk, reputation and capital impact.\n\nBy 2026, we will only provide financing to Energy clients with Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets, methane emissions targets, and commitments to end all routine and nonessential venting and flaring.\n\n+\n\nMore details on the updated policy can be found on page 100, our Climate Change Statement can be found home.barclays/ sustainability/esg-resource-hub/statements-and-policypositions/ and further information on our client engagement can be found on page 107.\n\n## Power portfolio\n\n- \u00b7 74% of in-scope clients will have phased-out coal by 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: Charts and figures exclude clients determined to be out of scope for the CTF assessments\n\nUnder the updated Climate Change Statement, Energy Groups with more than 10% of their total planned upstream oil and gas capital expenditure in expansion, non-diversified groups and Energy Groups with the lowest CTF assessment scores will be subject to mandatory annual review by the CTRF to determine whether continued financing support is appropriate in the context of their expansion plans and overall transition plan.\n\n## CTF Energy and Power portfolio results\n\n## Energy portfolio\n\n- \u00b7 78% of in-scope clients have a methanereduction target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CTF energy portfolio score descriptions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClients are fully aligned with our NZE targets. This requires net zero targets (NZE 1.5\u00b0C-aligned or equivalent) across all relevant scopes, including Use of Sold Product (Scope 3, Category 11) by 2050 (for Energy), evidence of strong progress already made, and disclosures of advanced planning to reduce emissions further.\n\nClients have targets across all relevant scopes and strong plans but may be missing some of the clarifying details of a T1 plan - or may not have demonstrated strong steps taken to date. Clients may have very ambitious targets but lack the details to evidence that they will achieve it, a weak target but robust disclosures evidencing that they will achieve it, or a combination thereof. Energy clients without Scope 3 disclosures and Scope 3 targets cannot achieve better than T3.\n\nClients have poorly disclosed plans. They generally have some combination of targets that are weaker than the scenarios require, disclosures lacking in detail, or limited evidence that steps are already being taken.\n\nClients have the default and lowest score. These clients provide limited publicly available information on their sustainability targets and strategy. A client must have publicly demonstrated transition planning including some evidence of their historic, current and future emissions reduction efforts to score better than T5.",

Therefore, decarbonising the Aviation sector over the next 10-15 years will require a significant increase in the historical pace of emissions reductions which will be dependent on both the price and availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and the continued production and delivery of loweremissions aircraft.\n\n## Our Aviation emissions intensity target\n\nWe have set a target to reduce the financed emissions intensity of our Airlines portfolio by 11-16% by end of 2030 against a 2023 baseline, calculated using our BlueTrack TM methodology:\n\n- \u00b7 The lower emissions reduction in the range reflects a convergence point for our portfolio with the MPP PRU scenario, which is consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n- \u00b7 The higher emissions reduction in the range is aligned to the rate of emissions intensity reduction in the MPP PRU scenario, consistent with our approach for our other existing 2030 targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Estimating our financed emissions\n\nBarclays is a founding signatory to the Pegasus Principles - the first climate-aligned finance framework for the Aviation sector, developed by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) in partnership with global banks and in consultation with leading airlines and lessors, The Pegasus Principles will launch publicly this spring.\n\nIn developing our approach for the Aviation sector we have worked closely to align our BlueTrack\u2122 methodology with this common framework we expect will also be used by a number of other peer banks. By aligning ourselves with an emerging industry consensus approach we hope to create consistency and transparency for our clients and for our stakeholders in our own reporting.\n\nIn line with the Pegasus Principles we are estimating the financed emissions and emissions intensity of our Aviation portfolio using a physical intensity metric, gCO2e/revenue-tonne-kilometre (gCO2e/ RTK). The scope of this portfolio target includes emissions related to direct combustion of jet fuel by aircrafts (tank-to-wake/Scope 1) and upstream production and refining (well-to-tank/ Scope 3) for commercial passengers (including belly cargo) and dedicated air cargo operators.\n\nEmissions scope can differ based on the actual operator of the aircraft, as the owner of the aircraft may not necessarily be the operator lessors versus airlines, for example. Military aviation, corporate jets, general civil aviation, tour operators and multi-modal logistics companies are out of scope due to low materiality (as a share of sector emissions) and data availability challenges.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\nTo do this we have partnered with PACE (Platform for Analysing Carbon Emissions), a Pegasus Principles-qualified data provider, to provide granular emissions and activity data based on specific flight routes and aircraft flown for each airline operator.\n\n+\n\nFurther details on our financed emissions methodology can be found in our latest Financed Emissions Methodology paper (published in 2024) at: home.barclays/esg-resource-hub/ reporting-and-disclosures/\n\n## Future progress against this target\n\nThe general factors outlined on page 89 in relation to progress against our targets will equally be relevant to this portfolio. Additionally, and more specifically, we are clear as to the level of emissions reductions required to align with the MPP pathway - but we recognise there are many dependencies and variables outside of our control, and that of our clients, which will determine how quickly emissions intensity can reduce in this sector.\n\nWe note that our clients' ability to meet their own targets is dependent on continued regulatory, policy, technical, and supply chain support for the industry - including the future availability and price of SAF - and clients' progress towards achieving their targets may impact our ability to achieve our own.\n\nAdditionally we note that, while we are setting an 2030 interim target, many of our clients have set their own interim targets to a 2035 date to specifically account for hoped-for growth in SAF production - and, since the level and timing of that growth is an imperfect estimate, the pathway to our targets may not be linear (or close to linear), and may limit our ability to accurately determine whether we are on path to achieve, or are able to achieve, our own targets.\n\n## Note:\n\n- \u0394    2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410.

As one of the largest lenders to farmers in the UK, Barclays is well placed to provide support through the changing nature of the Agricultural sector - in particular the ongoing shifts in consumer diets. Other factors important to consider are the impact of decarbonisation on broader food security and affordability, where upside and downside risks exist depending on the form the transition takes as well as the opportunity for carbon sequestration and improving biodiversity - given the sector controls 71% of land in the UK.\n\n- + Further information on our management of nature-related risks, including in the UK Farming sector, identified during our TNFD assessment of our European Agriculture and Food portfolio can be found on page 276.\n\nTo support UK farmers through this transitional period, Barclays finances activities that aim to reduce emissions in Agriculture and result in nature-positive outcomes. This includes investment in low-carbon farming measures and financing to improve machinery energy efficiency. We also have a dedicated Agriculture Technology Fund to support farming clients undertaking more sustainable practices or implementing energyefficiency improvements. In addition, we support early-stage companies developing technology solutions needed for the transition to net zero through our Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio. For example, in 2023 we invested in Agricarbon a UK-based soil carbon measurement start-up.\n\n+\n\nFurther details on our Sustainable Impact Capital can be found on page 117.\n\nBarclays engages with farmers to explore the challenges and opportunities that may emerge from the decarbonisation of the Agricultural sector. In 2023 we launched a survey of our UK Livestock and Dairy farming clients to better understand the challenges they may face in progressing towards net zero.\n\nWe also work individually with clients using our Client Transition Tool (CTT) to identify nature and decarbonisation risks, as well as considering social risks. We support peer-to-peer learning through our Farm to Farm initiative that facilitates events for farmers in similar geographic areas to cultivate innovative sustainable farming practices. Over 100 farming clients attended Farm to Farm events in 2023, with further events planned for 2024.\n\n## Estimating our financed emissions\n\nThere are significant challenges to calculating emissions for the Agricultural sector, notably a critical lack of data on the activities and practices of our agricultural customers and clients, and modelling challenges around agricultural emissions intensity. This is exacerbated by the highly disaggregated nature of the farming industry - characterised by a large number of small farm holdings - which makes collating and processing data challenging, and requires the use of estimated data.\n\nAs a result Barclays has focused its initial assessment on the UK Dairy and Livestock sector - which is responsible for c.70% of UK total agricultural GHG emissions. Barclays is setting a target to reduce the absolute emissions (MtCO2e) of our UK Dairy and Livestock portfolio by 21% by end of 2030, against a 2023 baseline in line with the Balanced Net Zero (BNZ) 1.5\u00b0Caligned scenario developed by the CCC.\n\nTo help advance approaches to Agriculturefinanced emissions measurement, and target setting in the banking sector more broadly, Barclays is a member of the Banking for Impact on Climate in Agriculture (B4ICA) working group which produced an introductory guide on target setting for the sector in 2022 and worked on a further update over 2023.\n\n- + B4ICA Introductory guide can be found at: wbcsd.org/FocusAreas/Banking-for-Impact-on-Climate-in-Agriculture-B4ICA\n\n## Future progress against this target\n\nThe general factors outlined on page 89 in relation to progress against our targets will equally be relevant to this portfolio. Additionally, and more specifically, the transition of the UK Dairy and Livestock sector is significantly dependent on broader consumer behavioural change and public policy interventions - which are outside Barclays' control and may affect our ability to achieve this target.\n\nFurther, we expect the data underlying the UK Dairy and Livestock model to continue to evolve and be refined in order to address the challenges outlined above, and that this could impact our metrics and this target.\n\nBarclays is also engaged in a three-year collaboration with Oxford University to develop food type production datasets for the UK. The aim is to quantify Barclays-financed emissions in more detail and consider additional transition risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on our partnership with Oxford University can be found at: home.barclays/news/pressreleases/2022/10/ barclays-and-oxford-universityannounce- 3-year-agriclimate-part/\n\n- + Further details on our financed emissions methodology can be found in our latest Financed Emissions Methodology paper (published in 2024) at: home.barclays/esg-resource-hub/ reporting-and-disclosures/\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Note:\n\n- \u0394    2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410.

In 2023 Barclays partnered with The Royal Countryside Fund to expand its Carbon Clarity programme and provide free support for 53 farms in Somerset and Norfolk to understand how they could better manage carbon. The programme offered an introduction to carbon reduction on farms through group workshops, one-to-one support, and assistance in creating a carbon 'action plan'.",

CRE represents the next highest portion of GHG emissions in that sector after residential buildings, primarily from the fossil fuel heating systems used. There are number of significant challenges to decarbonising the entire UK buildings sector, which require engagement and systematic change, outside of Barclays' control and as further outlined on page 97. CRE sector challenges are further compounded by the added complexity of landlord-tenant dynamics which requires collaboration on minimising energy use, sharing of energy data and consideration of energy intensity of fit-outs and retrofit solutions. Further, the diverse building stock in the UK is likely to require tailored client strategies for these retrofit solutions.\n\nThe different characteristics of the clients in this portfolio - which include institutional real estate investors and quoted real estate companies with their own transition strategies and stakeholder expectations - mean there are different and additional potential drivers of transition in this portfolio. Further, the relationship-led nature of the UK Corporate Bank and its in-house asset management expertise enables a client-first approach to influence transition planning at a portfolio level. We are therefore setting a target for this portfolio but recognise that there are significant challenges to achieving it as a result of factors outside of Barclays' control.\n\n## Estimating our financed emissions\n\nThe in-scope portfolio represents the majority of the UK commercial and residential real estate investment financing to assets across a diverse range of sub-sectors including office, retail, industrial and logistics, and residential properties managed within the UK Corporate Bank.\n\nTo support the transition of our commercial real estate clients we have set a target to reduce the financed emissions intensity (kgCO2e/m 2 ) by 51% by end of 2030 against a 2023 baseline, calculated using our BlueTrack TM methodology and integrating the approach recommended by PCAF.\n\nThe emission reductions required aligns with CRREM 2022 - the leading global standard and initiative for operational decarbonisation of real estate assets - which provides the granularity of pathways for sub-sectors within the in-scope portfolio. We may expect our CRREM pathway to change if the portfolio materially changes.\n\nThe high proportion of commercial properties within scope has created challenges in data matching to external sources. Consequently, we are investing in our systems to increase the data coverage and decrease the use of estimations in our target setting in future years.\n\n- + Further details on our financed emissions  methodology can be found in our latest Financed Emissions Methodology paper (published in 2024) at: home.barclays/esg-resource-hub/ reporting-and-disclosures/\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Note:\n\n- \u0394    2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410.

Additionally, and more specifically, CRE is dependent on broader industry and regulatory changes which are required to deliver the decarbonisation of the UK energy grid, the phasing-out of fossil fuel heating, and the maturity of supply chain to deliver the required retrofit solutions. Regulation and policy advancement will also play a key role, especially in relation to supporting low-carbon heating and setting requirements in relation to EPC standards. These changes are outside Barclays' control and may affect our ability to achieve this target.\n\nFurther, as the data underlying our model continues to evolve and be refined to address the challenges outlined above, this could impact our metrics and this target.\n\nWe will continue to engage with clients to understand their approach to the transition and how Barclays can best support - ranging from education to tailored loan solutions. Over the medium term, supporting new residential developments through our Sustainable Residential Development Framework - which enables the classification and tracking of residential development loans to our UK Corporate Banking clients, as well as the deployment of sustainability-linked loans - which will support our housebuilding clients in achieving their sustainability goals including reducing emissions of new homes built.\n\n+\n\n- Read more about the Sustainable Residential Development Framework here: .barclayscorporate.com/ content/dam/barclayscorporate-com/documents/ solutions/corporate-banking-solutions/Green-solutions/ Sustainable-residential-development-landscape.pdf",

Decarbonising UK homes is a complex challenge that will require widespread engagement and systemic change.\n\nIn an effort to confront and quantify these challenges we are expanding the scope of our previously announced UK Residential Real Estate convergence point. The expanded scope, renamed to UK Housing sector, now includes Social Housing and Business Banking Real Estate portfolios, alongside the previous scope of Barclays UK residential and Private Banking mortgage portfolios. The real estate portfolios within the UK Housing sector share similar underlying assets - 99% are UK residential properties - thereby referencing the same CCC BNZ pathway and sharing similar decarbonisation levers. Barclays continues to support the UK Housing sector through the provision of mortgages, financing of social housing providers and expanded product offerings designed to support the decarbonisation of the UK Housing stock.\n\n## Composition of UK Housing portfolio Dec'23\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Note:\n\n- \u0394    2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410. Current limited assurance scope and opinions can be found within the ESG Resource Hub: home.barclays/sustainability/esg-resource-hub/reporting-and-disclosures/\n\n## Estimating our financed emissions\n\nThe decarbonisation of the UK Housing sector in line with the CCC BNZ scenario depends mostly on external changes and public policy interventions. Without these external changes, Barclays cannot materially decrease the emissions intensity of its UK Housing portfolio. Barclays has therefore chosen to identify the 2030 emissions intensity 'convergence point' - and measure our progress towards it - but not to set a formal target at this time. In 2022 we estimated the financed emissions and emissions intensity of our UK Residential Real Estate sector by integrating the PCAF approach into BlueTrack TM .\n\nIn 2023 the emissions intensity for that sector increased by c.1% due to increased emissions from the UK electricity grid - despite an improvement in known EPC ratings for our Barclays UK mortgage portfolio. Going forwards, the additional portfolios making up the expanded scope of the UK Housing sector will be tracked.\n\nWe continue to use the CCC BNZ scenario as the benchmark for this sector as it is specific to the UK, independent, developed by a credible institution and aims to achieve net zero emissions for the UK by 2050. We are maintaining a convergence point of a 40% reduction in CO2e emissions intensity by the end of 2030. However, to reflect the expanded scope, this will now be against a 2023 baseline for the UK Housing sector.\n\nFurther details on our financed emissions methodology can be found in our latest Financed Emissions Methodology paper at: home.barclays/esg-resource-hub/reporting-anddisclosures/\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n## Drivers of reduction in emissions in UK Housing\n\nKey drivers in the transition to net zero in the UK Housing sector are the decarbonisation of the UK electricity grid and the phasing-out of fossil fuels in domestic heating through the switch to low-carbon heating - bringing cleaner energy into our customers' homes. This will largely be driven by the transition of the Power sector alongside UK Government policy to drive the decarbonisation of the UK electricity grid and promote take up of low-carbon heating. Barclays can play a role through supporting renewable energy projects and clients in the Power sector, through Sustainable and Transition Finance activity and through Sustainable Impact Capital investments.\n\nAnother key driver required to reach net zero in the UK Housing sector is to improve the energy efficiency of existing homes - which includes improving the fabric of homes and adopting other energy efficiency measures. Other key contributors include new homes being built to net zero standard, with low-carbon energy sources and high energy efficiency ratings, and a reduction in energy consumption through changes in behaviour.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about the Barclays-commissioned report from Ipsos UK on consumer retrofitting behaviour on page 112.\n\nAs a mortgage lender to retail and business banking clients, we can support customers who choose to retrofit their properties, switch to lowcarbon heating, and explore ways to reduce their energy consumption by providing financial products, services and partner offers.\n\n+\n\nFurther details on our Greener Homes Propositions can be found on page 111.",

The sector is already demonstrating aboveaverage energy efficiency in portfolios and many housing associations have a stated objective of moving stock to EPC C or better by 2030. Aligned to this objective the sector's energy efficiency has been improving - and we are seeing examples of deep retrofit projects and newly delivered housing schemes with properties rated EPC band A/B.\n\nAs an established lender to the Social Housing sector, we continue to be an active market participant, are structuring some of our loans with sustainability metrics where this is within client appetite, and have amended covenant terms we are prepared to accept to support retrofit.\n\nHowever, we expect the overall impact of our actions to be low given the barriers to retrofitting - such as high upfront costs and current low customer demand due to low incentives to change. Additionally, the potential management actions available to Barclays are limited due to this being a portfolio of customers or end users who are retail in nature, and predominantly consisting of residential properties.\n\nTo see more about Barclays actions with regards to the drivers of net zero for UK Buildings, please refer to the table on page 97 above for details of Barclays' approach to drivers in UK buildings.\n\n## Our EPC ambition\n\nBarclays is expanding its EPC ambition scope 1 to include Social Housing, Business Banking Real Estate and Kensington Mortgage Company Limited 2 , alongside the previous scope of the Barclays UK mortgages portfolio.\n\nIn line with our efforts to improve the energy efficiency of our UK Housing portfolio, Barclays has set an updated EPC ambition of 55% of properties and collateral in scope of our EPC ambition - with a known EPC to be rated band C or better by 2030.\n\nAs at the end of Q3 2023, 47.9% 3 of Barclays properties and collateral in scope of our EPC ambition with a known EPC were rated band C or better.\n\nThere are industry-wide challenges to ensure the properties in our portfolio have EPC certificates, given approximately one-third of housing stock in England and Wales does not have a valid EPC rating.\n\n## EPC ratings of properties and collateral in scope of EPC ambition 4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n47.9%\n\n## of properties and collateral rated A-C of available EPCs\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 EPC ambition scope does not currently include Private Bank due to EPC data reporting limitations.\n- 2 Kensington Mortgage Company Limited is not currently included in UK Housing sector emissions intensity convergence point due to portfolio reporting limitations.\n- 3 Metric based on number of properties and collateral in portfolios that make up the EPC ambition scope as of 31 December 2023.\n- 4 EPC data for Barclays UK mortgages and Kensington Mortgage Company Limited are as of 30 September 2023. Matched EPC data for Social Housing and Business Banking Real Estate are as of 31 October 2023.\n\nWe intend to build on this assessment to deepen our understanding of the emissions associated with our financing activities. Informed by this work, we intend to consider the most appropriate approach to extend our target coverage with the aim of ensuring it covers relevant areas of the value chain and/or our financing activities.\n\nTogether, our work to set financed emissions reduction targets as part of our commitment to the NZBA, and to establish a baseline assessment of the emissions associated with our financing activities consistent with the PCAF Standard, will aid our understanding of the extent to which our financing aligns with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement.\n\nDuring 2024 we intend to further develop our approach to the implementation of the Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT)'s recommendations - and to include information relating to transition planning in future climate disclosures. As part of this, we intend to develop Sector Transition Strategies aimed at summarising our approach to support the transition in a particular sector.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 As defined in Foundations of Climate Mitigation Target Setting published by the UNEP Finance Initiative (unepfi.org/wordpress/ wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-for-climatemitigation-target-setting.pdf).\n- 2 With the exception of diversified mining companies where aluminium production is a small element of their overall activities, and where it would therefore be difficult to set standalone aluminium emissions intensity reduction targets.\n\n## Ongoing work on portfolio alignment\n\nAs part of our commitment under the NZBA, we have set targets for material 1 high-emitting sectors in our portfolio.\n\nUsing BlueTrack TM , we have assessed our financed emissions and have targets for eight high-emitting sectors. These targets cover our Energy, Power, Cement, Steel, Automotive manufacturing, Agriculture, Aviation, and CRE portfolios. We have also set a convergence point for UK Housing.\n\nWe previously assessed financed emissions for Aluminium - and, during 2023, for Shipping - but decided against setting targets. For Aluminium, this was the result of a detailed review of our Metals (Steel and Aluminium) portfolios, which found that Barclays does not have a material exposure to the Aluminium sector 2 . For Shipping, as explained on page 85 in relation to material sectors and net-zero-aligned targets, our assessment identified that due to our limited financing volumes and financed emissions across a small number of clients it would be difficult to set a target at this time.\n\nDuring 2023 we also developed a high-level modelled assessment of the emissions associated with our financing activities across our portfolio, largely aligned to the PCAF Standard - including undrawn commitments, contingent liabilities and capital markets financing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee section Reducing our financed emissions on page 80.",

These policies are listed below and set out in detail within our statements and policy positions.\n\nOur restrictive policies are regularly reviewed and updated in light of the rapidly changing external environment and are informed by engagement with our stakeholders, including shareholders, clients, subject specialists and civil society groups. In 2023 this included a review of naturerelated impacts and dependencies and social risks of different technology types to help inform our approach to due diligence.\n\nOur Climate Change Statement sets out our positions and approach to sensitive sectors with tightening policy criteria and increasing expectations over time. In 2024 we have updated the Climate Change Statement to include new requirements for upstream oil and gas and restrictions on the type of exposures and risk we will finance going forward, as well as additional restrictions on financing in relation to the Amazon Biome, ultra-deep water and extra heavy oil).\n\nFor further details on the scope and application of the updated positions please see page 63.\n\nBarclays will continue to support an energy sector in transition, focusing on the diversified energy companies investing in low carbon and with greater scrutiny on those engaged in developing new upstream oil and gas projects.\n\nThe experience of the last few years leads us to recognise that client transition pathways will vary and the ability of our clients to meet our requirements may be affected (positively or negatively) by external factors, including, for example, the public policy and regulatory environment, technological advancement, geopolitical or regional developments, energy security, cost of living and just transition factors. We intend to continue to work with and support our clients as they transition their business and will monitor and engage with them on their progress and the impact of external factors over time, through our Enhanced Due Diligence and Client Transition Framework.\n\nWe anticipate that companies which are unable or unwilling to reduce or eliminate their emissions consistent with internationally accepted pathways may find it increasingly difficult to access financing, including through Barclays. Further restrictions are set out in our Position Statements relating to Forestry & Agricultural Commodities as well as World Heritage Site and Ramsar Wetlands, which were reviewed in April 2023. In the latter case only minor changes were made.\n\nWe will continue to keep our policies, targets and progress under review in light of the output of both EDD and CTF reviews, the rapidly changing external environment and the need to support governments and clients, in our efforts to meet our ambition of being a net zero bank by 2050.\n\n## Position and policy statements on sensitive sectors\n\n## Climate change\n\n- \u00b7 Upstream oil and gas  (new)\n- \u00b7 Unconventional oil and gas\n- - Oil sands\n- - Fracking\n- -  Arctic oil and gas\n- -  Amazon oil and gas (new)\n- - Ultra-deep water (new)\n- -  Extra heavy oil (new)\n- \u00b7 Thermal coal mining\n- \u00b7 Thermal coal power\n- \u00b7 Biomass (new)\n\n+\n\n## Further details can be found at:\n\nhome.barclays/sustainability/esg-resource-hub/statements-and-policy-positions/\n\n## Forestry and Agricultural commodities\n\n- \u00b7 Timber, pulp and paper\n- \u00b7 Palm oil\n- \u00b7 Soy\n- \u00b7 Beef (new)\n\n## Forestry and Agricultural Commodities Statement\n\nBarclays recognises the critical importance of addressing deforestation in delivering on global climate and biodiversity goals. A major cause of deforestation is the production of forestry and agricultural commodities such as timber, beef, palm oil and soy, and we have a position statement and due diligence approach that applies to clients involved in these activities (first published in 2019 for forestry and palm oil and refreshed in 2020 to include soy).\n\nWe have engaged with investors, clients and civil society organisations on this topic, which has informed a review of our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities Statement. This was updated in April 2023 with a number of significant changes.\n\nThe updated Statement now covers clients involved in South American beef production or primary processing, and enhances the existing requirements for clients involved in soy and palm oil. Among other criteria, the Statement requires that these clients commit to having fully traceable and deforestation-free commodity supply chains by the end of 2025 - a position aligned with industry good practice guidance such as the Accountability Framework Initiative\u00b9 and Agriculture Sector Roadmap for 1.5\u00b0C\u00b2.\n\nIn addition, the Statement requires that clients prohibit the production or primary processing of soy or beef from deforested areas of the Amazon, in recognition of the critical nature of this biome to biodiversity and climate objectives.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 accountability-framework.org/\n- 2 tropicalforestalliance.org/en/collective-action-agenda/ cop27-roadmap/\n\n+\n\nFor further information, please see our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities Statement: home.barclays/ content/dam/home-barclays/documents/citizenship/ourreporting-and-policy-positions/Forestry-and-AgriculturalCommodities-Statement.pdf",

We also announced an extension of our Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio, with a new mandate to invest up to \u00a3500m into global climate tech start-ups by the end of 2027.\n\n## Facilitating $1trn of Sustainable and Transition Financing\n\nAt Barclays we are clear that addressing climate change is a complex challenge that demands a fundamental transformation of the global economy. Low-carbon technologies, infrastructure and capacity must be scaled up to meet growing energy demands and for the world to reach net zero. The financial sector has an important role to play in supporting the transition and we are determined to play our part. We are deploying financing to help scale-up the necessary activities needed in the transition to net zero.\n\n+\n\nFor further details on climate-related opportunities see page 70.\n\nIn December 2022 we announced a new target, to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and Transition Financing between 2023 and the end of 2030. This followed our two previously announced targets: to deliver \u00a3150bn of social, environmental and sustainability-linked financing by 2025, which we surpassed in 2021, and to deliver \u00a3100bn of green financing by 2030, which we surpassed in 2023.\n\nOur $1trn target encompasses the green, social, transition and broader sustainability-linked financing requirements of clients including corporates, governments and the public sector, financial institutions and consumers. This includes financing of climate and environmental solutions including green mortgages, energyefficient technology and renewable energy, as well as financing for broader social and sustainability work - including sustainability-linked structures and areas such as affordable housing. We are also facilitating funding into green technologies and lowcarbon infrastructure projects, as well as using our advisory capabilities, product sets and financial expertise to help our customers and clients realise their own transitions to a low-carbon economy.\n\nThe inclusion of transition financing in this target reflects our recognition of the importance of supporting the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors that are carbon intensive. In early 2024 we announced our Transition Finance Framework (TFF), which outlines the criteria for transactions to qualify as transition financing and sits alongside our Sustainable Finance Framework (SFF) to define what can be included against this target.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+ Examples of qualifying transactions can be seen in our case studies on pages 30, 115 and 116.\n\nOur ability to meet the $1trn target and progress towards it from year to year will be dependent on a number of factors and variables outside our control. Factors such as market conditions, policy, laws, regulation, geopolitical developments and stakeholder expectations including approaches to product labelling and regulatory scrutiny of green, sustainability-linked and social products - could impact lending and capital markets appetite and our approach to risk management, and therefore present a risk to our progress against, and delivery of, the target.\n\nAdditionally, new climate and decarbonisation technologies may scale at varying rates, including being reliant on the supply and demand of raw materials, which may impact financing volumes.\n\nWe will continue to review and adapt our approach to Sustainable and Transition Financing in response to the evolving market opportunities.\n\n## Progress against our $1trn target\n\nDuring 2023 we facilitated $67.8bn \u0394 of Sustainable and Transition Financing, of which $67.4bn was sustainable financing, slightly up on 2022 of $65.3bn, and $0.4bn \u0394 was transition financing that qualified against our new Transition Finance Framework. Our facilitation of $67.8bn \u0394 of Sustainable and Transition Financing in a challenging market demonstrates our continued focus on supporting our clients on their sustainability journeys.\n\nBond issuance 1 was the largest product category in 2023, accounting for 76% of total Sustainable and Transition Financing while loans and equity accounted for 19% and 3% respectively. This mix showed a small shift towards bond activity and away from loans compared to the mix of our 2022 sustainable financing of $65.3bn, which comprised 71% bond issuance, 26% loans and 2% equity.\n\n## Sustainable finance\n\nSustainable financing, aligned to our Sustainable Finance Framework, consists of financing for dedicated use of proceeds, financing for clients with an eligible business mix in relevant environmental and social categories, and sustainability-linked financing which refers to general purpose funding.\n\n## Social financing\n\nRaising finance for clients including supranational, national and regional development institutions was a key driver of the $32.4bn \u0394 of social financing facilitated in 2023 (2022: $30.0bn). In 2023, we continued to see issuers aligning their financing commitments to social use of proceeds bonds which allocate funds to categories such as access to healthcare, affordable housing and essential services. As in 2022, we have also seen the use of social KPIs within sustainability-linked financing such as targets linked to gender diversity.\n\n## Environmental financing\n\nIn 2023, we facilitated $24.1bn \u0394 of environmental financing (2022: $21.7bn). This performance reflected continued demand from our clients and our strategy to work with them to help facilitate their transitions to a low-carbon economy.\n\n## Sustainability-linked financing\n\nSustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) and sustainability-linked loans (SLLs) are forwardlooking, performance-based debt instruments issued with specific sustainability performance targets. Our sustainability-linked financing totalled $10.9bn \u0394 in 2023 (2022: $13.7bn). The sustainability-linked market continues to be of importance to both investors and issuers alike who use these instruments to embed their sustainability targets into financing commitments and we look forward to continuing to work with our clients to innovate the product set.\n\n## Note\n\n- \u0394    2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410.

While new technologies are still emerging, we are identifying opportunities to finance decarbonisation pathways across highemitting sectors, including energy, power, chemicals, and metals. We are looking to play a role in supporting a range of carbon and emission reduction projects - from the manufacturing of blue hydrogen and related infrastructure for end-use sectors with limited decarbonisation alternatives, to the electrification of compressor units, resulting in the elimination of natural gas use, as well as the adoption of low-carbon technologies, As emerging technologies scale and continue to develop, we are committed to leveraging our expertise to further identify opportunities for transition financing.\n\n+\n\nFor further details on our Sustainable Finance Framework and Transition Finance Framework see page 104.\n\n## Facilitating \u00a3100bn of green financing\n\nSince 2018 we have facilitated a total of \u00a3113.7bn \u0394 green financing - exceeding our target of \u00a3100bn well ahead of the 2030 target date.\n\nIn 2023 we facilitated \u00a325.9bn \u0394 (2022: \u00a325.5bn), comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 Labelled use of proceeds and general purpose financing in environmental categories of \u00a319.8bn \u0394 (2022: \u00a318.0bn)\n- \u00b7 Sustainability-linked financing that incorporates environmental performance targets of \u00a36.2bn \u0394 (2022:\u00a37.5bn).\n\nBreaking down our green financing by product type, the largest category in 2023 was bond issuance - accounting for 63% of the total (2022: 61%). Loans and equity made up 30% (2022: 33%) and 6% (2022: 4%) respectively.\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Bond issuance includes Bonds (DCM), CMBS, Securitization, Munis and PCM Debt.\n- \u0394    2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410.

In 2020 Barclays announced that it would invest up to \u00a3175m equity capital in environmentally focused climate technology companies by 2025 - helping support our clients to transition towards a low-carbon economy, scale solutions to environmental challenges, and fill their growth-stage funding gaps.\n\nIn evidence of the success of the investments, in December 2022 we announced an increase of the investment mandate to invest up to \u00a3500m by the end of 2027.\n\nTo date we have invested \u00a3138m into 21 innovative companies. These investments have supported many aspects of climate tech innovation, from property retrofit solutions to long-duration energy storage and hydrogen technologies.\n\nWe continue to drive wider commercial and strategic opportunities for Barclays UK, Corporate Banking and Investment Banking with those companies.\n\nWe continue to focus on decarbonisation technologies supporting transition within carbon-intensive sectors, particularly where Barclays has meaningful client exposure - such as Power, Industry, Transport, Agriculture and Real Estate - including solutions delivering carbon capture, carbon dioxide removal and green hydrogen.",

Our sustainable financing is tracked using the methodology set out in the Barclays Sustainable Finance Framework (SFF). This framework defines the criteria we use for social financing, sustainable financing, green financing and sustainability-linked financing. This includes 'dedicated purpose' green and social financing, 'general purpose' financing based on eligible company business mix and sustainability-linked financing, and sets out applicable criteria drawing on industry guidelines and principles.\n\nIt should be noted that the methodology is reliant on a range of data sources including Dealogic and Bloomberg transaction listings and league tables, as well as other third-party data and verification sources including company disclosures to aid the classification of financing into eligible green and social categories.\n\nWe recognise that the quality, consistency and comparability of the data relied upon is not yet of the same standard as more traditional financial metrics and presents an inherent limitation to the performance reported. We will continue to review available data sources and enhance our methodology and processes to improve the robustness of the performance disclosed.\n\nThe legal and regulatory landscape relating to sustainable financing - including the naming and categorisation of products as 'green', 'social', 'sustainability-linked' and otherwise - is rapidly evolving with differing regulations across jurisdictions. We may wish to revisit our approach in that context in the future.\n\nThere is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) governing what constitutes 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', or similarly labelled products - nor is there unanimous agreement on what attributes a particular investment, product or asset should have to be labelled as such.\n\nFurthermore, no assurance can be given that a globally accepted definition or consensus will develop over time. We will continue to monitor and comply with applicable jurisdictional regulatory taxonomy definitions and product labelling obligations as they emerge.\n\nAs innovation in sustainable finance continues to accelerate, we will continue to review and update our SFF, our measurement of our performance against targets, and keep our general approach under review.\n\nWe have updated our SFF to version 4.1, published in February 2024, which will apply to financing volumes from January 2024 tracked against our target to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and Transition Financing between 2023 and the end of 2030.\n\n+\n\nBarclays' Sustainable Finance Framework can be found online in our ESG Resource Hub at: home.barclays/ sustainability/esg-resource-hub/reporting-and-disclosures/\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n## Transition Finance Framework\n\nOur transition financing is tracked using the methodology set out in the Barclays Transition Finance Framework (TFF).\n\nBarclays has developed and published in February 2024 the first version of the TFF for classifying financing as 'transition' for the purpose of tracking and disclosing our performance against our target to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and Transition Financing between 2023 and the end of 2030.\n\nThe inclusion of transition financing in this target reflects our recognition of the importance of lending, facilitating funding and investing in technologies and activities that support GHG emissions reduction, directly or indirectly, in high-emitting and hard-to-abate sectors.\n\nThe TFF is complementary to our Sustainable Finance Framework, The TFF augments the scope of Barclays' SFF and determines the eligibility of transition activities that sit outside the sustainable finance already covered by the SFF.\n\nAs there is no universal consensus as to how to define 'transition' activities, Barclays has developed its own definition of transition finance as follows:\n\n## Our definition of transition finance\n\nTransition finance is any financing including lending, capital markets and other financing solutions provided to clients for activities - including technologies - that support GHG emissions reduction directly or indirectly in high-emitting and hard-toabate sectors towards a 1.5\u00b0C pathway.\n\nThe TFF outlines the criteria for eligible transactions with a set of defined principles to guide us in the application of our definition of transition finance as we support high-emitting clients and finance real economy decarbonisation.\n\nAs innovation and market principles in relation to transition finance continue to accelerate and evolve, we will continue to consider and develop our definition of transition finance and the coverage under the TFF.\n\n+\n\nBarclays' Transition Finance Framework can be found online in our ESG Resource Hub at: home.barclays/sustainability/esgresource-hub/reporting-and-disclosures/",

In 2023 we identified the opportunity for Barclays to contribute to the goal of a nature-positive food system as one of three strategic themes during the development of our Group sustainable finance strategy. Although our financing activities in relation to nature may still be relatively nascent, we are aiming to expand on these and have provided some examples of progress made and initiatives developed in 2023 below.\n\nIn Barclays UK we believe nature is a key area where we can make an impact, due to our prominent role in financing UK agriculture and agricultural land purchases. During the past year we have lent funds to customers to purchase land for deployment under the Biodiversity Net Gain scheme, and supported a leading wilding estate in commercialising its activities as it prepares for future sales from nature-positive outcomes. We also support farmers who seek to apply more sustainable farming practices, and have been actively investigating how we can support farmers to safely access private nature markets. Finally, Barclays Eagle Labs is supporting a Venture Launchpad cohort run by Carbon13 - focused on Land, Food and Nature.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting soil through technology investment\n\nRegenerative agricultural practices have significant potential to support climate change mitigation and enhance the resilience of food value chains through improved soil health. Accurate measurement of soil carbon is a factor constraining the growth of regenerative practices in UK agriculture, where Barclays has a strong presence.\n\nThe market for scalable, high-accuracy soil carbon measurement is nascent, with several early-stage companies pioneering new technologies.\n\nIn 2023 SIC invested in Agricarbon, a UKbased company that has developed marketleading soil carbon measurement technology, to support the growth of regenerative agricultural practices.\n\nAgricarbon's end-to-end measurement process - which involves automating labbased processes, including elemental analysis - addresses the gap in the market for scalable, high-accuracy soil carbon measurement.\n\nAgricarbon has grown rapidly since its commercial launch in 2021, and the company already serves an international client base including some of the world's largest food and beverage companies, carbon project developers, and natural capital asset managers. With the proceeds from the fundraising, Agricarbon is seeking to accelerate its international expansion.\n\nWe are supporting environmentally focused start-ups through our Sustainable Impact Capital (SIC) portfolio, led by Barclays' Principal Investments team - which has a mandate to invest up to \u00a3500m by the end of 2027 in the equity of these companies, which target the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement. We are also actively developing nature-related products and solutions to support our clients in the Corporate and Investment Bank. In 2023 we strengthened our coverage of Agriculture and AgTech companies through a senior hire in\n\nour Sustainable and Impact Banking team.\n\n## Financing coastal nature-based solutions document\n\nThe Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) Financial Services Task Force ( FSTF) is a group of CEO-level executives from some of the world's largest banks. It brings together financial services leaders to develop and enable solutions that aim to help facilitate the transition to sustainable markets and support the rapid decarbonisation required across the real economy.\n\nBarclays is a member of the FSTF and this year, alongside HSBC and with support from Pollination, developed the Financing Coastal Nature-based Solutions (NbS) document.\n\nThe document serves as a practitioner's guide to building awareness and addressing key potential considerations for embedding coastal NbS in financial structuring.\n\nWe are also exploring other innovative financial structures that can redirect financing at scale towards nature, such as debt for nature swaps.\n\nIn addition to client offerings, we have also identified the need to build institutional capacity to enable us and the broader industry to tackle the technical challenges involved in scaling financing towards nature-based solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe full Financing Coastal Nature-based solutions document can be found at this link a.storyblok.com/ f/109506/x/6298e4ed77/2023-11-22\\_fstf-financingcoastal-nbs-report\\_final.pdf\n\nFurther details on the SMI can be found  on page 127.\n\nThe guide identifies key considerations for financing coastal NbS projects in terms of commercial viability, risk mitigation and impact reporting through practical case studies, including a carbon credit project and debt conversion structures. The guide was produced as a foundational resource for building institutional capacity to understand coastal NbS within the context of the financial services industry. We expect the points raised in the guide, which includes the role of different asset classes in shifting capital towards coastal NbS, to evolve, incorporating the latest trends in coastal NbS financing.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At its heart are the 17 SDGs, which are a call for action by all countries developed and developing - in a global partnership. Barclays is pleased to play its part, working in partnership with our stakeholders to support the delivery of the SDGs.\n\nSince 2018 we have tracked our annual contribution to the SDGs through our financing activities. An illustrative breakdown of how our social and environmental financing contributes to the SDGs is provided in the chart opposite.\n\nOur financing covers a range of activities including debt and equity capital markets, corporate lending, trade finance and consumer lending. It helps to generate positive social and environmental outcomes through financing of activities such as, but not limited to, energy efficiency, renewable energy, affordable housing, basic infrastructure and services. Financing of activities set out in our SFF in turn supports progress towards achieving the SDGs.\n\nFor a full list of eligible social and environmental activities see the SFF, which shows how eligible social and environmental activities contribute to individual SDGs - supported through an analysis of the underlying SDG targets. As we evolve our understanding of how our financing contributes to the SDGs, we will refine our methodology accordingly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBeyond our financing activities, our community programmes contribute to Goal 8: decent work and economic growth.\n\nWe also contribute to the SDGs through our work implementing the UN Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), and continue to analyse the potential positive and negative impacts of our business through these principles. Barclays has set targets in line with some of our significant impact areas to drive alignment with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement and to contribute to the SDGs.\n\n+\n\nFor further details, our PRB disclosure can be found online in our ESG Resource Hub at: home.barclays/sustainability/esgresource-hub/reporting-and-disclosures/\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

We are working on expanding our sustainable finance offering through our specialist teams to help clients navigate this period of extraordinary change.\n\n## Engaging clients through business and events\n\nWe believe the transition to a low-carbon economy is a defining opportunity for innovation and growth - and that we can make the greatest difference by supporting and engaging with our clients as they transition, using our advisory and financial expertise to help them navigate this period of extraordinary change.\n\nAs trusted advisers we continue to proactively engage with our clients on the risks and opportunities for their businesses arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy. This includes working with climate technology companies across their stages of development, and with larger, established and/or higherintensity clients on their transition journeys.\n\nWe support clients executing their climate strategies, including supporting the facilitation of initial public offerings for climate-focused growth companies, acquisitions of emerging climate technology start-ups to diversify incumbent clients' business models, and financing to mobilise the decarbonisation of operational activities.\n\nBy way of example of the extent of our engagement, over the course of 2023 we had over 17,500 (2022: 15,000) engagements with clients within the Corporate Bank on ESG topics, thanks to focused efforts by relationship teams to raise ESG topics proactively.\n\nWe also held numerous client events on ESG and sustainability topics, including our inaugural flagship Sustainable Finance Conference in New York with an attendance of over 400 people.\n\n## Engaging clients through our Client Transition Framework\n\nThe CTF, as outlined on page 90, supports us to direct our engagement efforts towards clients that are most exposed to the risk of failing to transition in line with the sectoral pathways reflected in our targets.\n\nThis is informed by the outcomes of CTF assessments, allowing us to be targeted in our engagement efforts and provide clients with clear communication on our expectations for transition planning. It also helps inform our advice on how clients best take advantage of transition finance opportunities.\n\n+\n\nFurther details on our Client Transition Framework on page 90.\n\n## Engaging clients through research\n\nWe provide thought leadership to support our clients using our in-house ESG Research capability. Clients who have access to our research publications tell us it prompts greater evaluation of their business needs - and we have seen a number of instances of this leading to broader conversations about the transition to a low-carbon economy, the ways investors can support the transition, and the ways Barclays is on hand to support. In 2023 we published over 475 ESG-focused research reports.\n\n## Products and services\n\nWe support a wide range of customers and clients - from individuals and small businesses through our consumer and business banking services, to mid-sized and larger businesses and institutions, including governments, through our corporate and investment banking services.\n\nBarclays' position in the market, offering retail, corporate and investment banking services, provides us the opportunity to deliver an end-toend proposition - offering innovative products and solutions to meet our clients' needs using the power of One Barclays. Through collaboration with our colleagues across businesses, we have built capabilities to help support the innovation needed to make the transition a success. For example, through our climate-technology escalator we provide support for scaling early-stage companies through tailored, specialist support at each stage of their development from idea to IPO.\n\nThis helps to ensure these companies can access capital as they grow, for example through our\n\nSustainable Impact Capital mandate and network of accelerators, our corporate bank and via the capital markets.\n\nDuring 2023, reflecting on engagement with and feedback from our clients, we continued to build the expertise and knowledge that clients are looking for as they scale their businesses and transition to a low-carbon economy. This included:\n\n- \u00b7 Continuing to strengthen our dedicated teams, capabilities and propositions supporting businesses developing and scaling the technologies that will help the world reduce emissions\n- \u00b7 Providing the finance to scale-up the infrastructure and capacity to deliver the renewable energy the world requires\n- \u00b7 Enhancing our teams through specialist hires in areas including sustainable project finance, ESG ratings advisory and carbon trading, as well as tailored sector training focused on decarbonisation pathways.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The 'Exploring Home Energy Efficiency Exhibition' ran for six weeks between October 2023 and December 2023, showcasing some of the technology that could help customers improve the energy efficiency of their home and potentially help lower their bills. Each week focused on a different energy efficiency theme, including low-carbon technology, retrofitting and the financial support available to households. Customers were able to learn and engage through weekly interactive sessions and Q&A panels made up of speakers from British Gas, Barclays and others. To coincide with National Green Careers Week in November, Plymouth City Council ran a series of carbon literacy events for career changers, job seekers and schools in the branch - and customers had the opportunity to take part in a 'green careers fair' to understand what a net zero career could look like for them.\n\nTotal since 2018",

We have seen continuing interest in microgeneration, with 45% of applications so far for solar panels and solar battery storage. However, demand for the offer remains limited.

In September 2023 we convened a roundtable in Parliament with representatives from UK Government, consumer groups, industry and academia to discuss a Barclayscommissioned report from Ipsos UK on consumer retrofitting behaviour. The report identified potential barriers to action among 'able to pay' homeowners who could potentially undertake retrofitting to increase the energy efficiency of their property. The report made a series of recommendations to improve uptake of retrofitting due to limited levels of this activity currently. There was agreement among roundtable representatives that there is a significant awareness gap that could be addressed by promoting the benefits of retrofitting and improving access to practical guidance. However, there were a range of views on how to share the burden of responsibility for these actions - with a number of attendees, including Barclays, underlining the important role for bolder UK Government leadership and policy to drive behaviour change.\n\n## Business Bank\n\nBarclays continues to support Business Bank clients to understand the case for sustainability, recognising that clients are at varying stages of their transition to net zero.\n\n## Embedding sustainability across the Business Bank\n\nWe continue to build our net zero expertise to give eligible businesses that bank with us the chance to explore the options available to them as part of transition plans towards net zero. In 2023 we provided sustainability training for Business Bank colleagues, including Real Estate,\n\nAgriculture and Specialist Client Solutions teams.\n\nFor clients that prefer to self-serve, we created a series of educational videos to raise awareness of themes relating to the transition to a lowcarbon economy.\n\nIn 2023 we launched an EPC dashboard to enable Real Estate Relationship Managers to provide a view of EPC ratings across a clients' portfolio with Barclays UK - and use it to discuss potential benefits around EPC improvements.\n\nIn July 2023 we expanded our existing Asset Finance proposition via our partner Propel to offer fixed rates on a wider range of green assets including new fully electric vehicles, solar photovoltaic panels, battery storage units, LED lighting, heat pumps and electric vehicle charging points. In September 2023 we launched our Green Barclayloan for Business, which offers no arrangement fees for lending above \u00a325,000 on a range of eligible green assets - supporting our business clients in their transition to net zero.\n\n+\n\nFurther details on Barclays Eagle Labs can be found at: labs.uk.barclays\n\n## External engagement\n\nIn 2023 we joined the Broadway Initiative and sit on the advisory board for the UK Business Climate Hub, which will help facilitate net zero support for our clients.\n\nTo recognise the positive impact of ESGfocused entrepreneurs on the wider economy, the 'Sustainability Award' category for the Barclays Entrepreneur Awards was awarded for the second time in 2023 - attracting over 100 applications.\n\n## Barclays Eagle Labs\n\nBarclays Eagle Labs look to help incubate, inspire and educate UK founders, start-ups and scaleups and help them to succeed and grow.

Eagle Labs have partnered with Carbon13 to develop a Venture Launchpad to help pre-seed and early-stage businesses launch high-potential and global-impact climate tech ventures. The first Carbon13 Venture Launchpad programme brought together 22 companies focused on innovation in the built environment. From April 2023 to October 2023, founders were supported to help set each of their businesses on a trajectory to mitigate 10 million tonnes of CO2e at scale.

We have applied this mindset to consider how we can best serve our clients' needs relating to Sustainable and Transition Financing through an integrated approach across Barclays' products and services. This has included the strengthening of our sustainable finance teams, working together to deliver for our clients and embedding sustainability across our sector and industry coverage teams.\n\n## Strengthening our sustainable finance teams\n\nThrough the continued investment in our team we are able to deliver a fuller suite of products, solutions and expertise to clients as they transition towards a low-carbon economy.\n\nDuring 2023 we invested significantly in our sustainable finance capabilities through key senior and specialist hires which have strengthened our existing teams and expanded our sustainable finance product offering. This included hiring new Heads of Sustainable Project Finance and Carbon & Environmental Products Trading, facilitating the expansion of our product reach into these areas in recognition of client demand and the commercial opportunity.\n\nWe have also continued to strengthen our existing sustainable finance teams with the hiring of senior specialists including across ESG ratings advisory, AgriTech and battery technologies, and regionally focused sustainable finance specialists covering the Middle East, North Africa and Asia Pacific.\n\nFollowing growth in the team over the past few years, at the end of 2023 we had in excess of 90 sustainable finance-focused bankers in the CIB, supported by ongoing investment in expertise in our sustainable finance and ESG-focused functional teams.\n\n## Working together to deliver for our clients\n\nWe continue to facilitate collaboration across CIB teams in order to work more closely together on sustainable finance topics and solutions. In 2023 we created a Sustainable Finance Leadership Group bringing together key 'champions' of sustainable finance from across the CIB with a view to creating more frequent and deeper exchanges of ideas - which will help strengthen our dialogue with clients and drive better outcomes for them.\n\nWe believe that the strength of our franchise is truly unlocked when we work closely together across our teams.

Looking forward into 2024 we expect to expand into other sustainable and energy-efficient technologies and opportunities.\n\nBarclays also grew its footprint in originating and distributing social and sustainability-linked loans, as well as structured financing with sustainable use of proceeds instruments\n\n## Green & Social Notes programme\n\nThe Barclays Bank PLC Green & Social Notes Programme covers Barclays-issued products in the Equities and Rates space, leveraging use-ofproceeds assets including renewable energy, low-carbon transport and energy-efficient real estate, in line with the requirements set out in our Green & Social Notes Framework. All green assets in the pool are verified by a third party and aligned to industry standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on our green notes programme can be found at: home.barclays/greenbonds/\n\n## ESG across our research teams\n\nOur approach to ESG research is differentiated through broad-based engagement with ESG issues and higher-quality insights with our investor clients. The ESG Research team collaborates with Equity and FICC research teams to identify and analyse material ESG opportunities and risks, and to integrate ESG into their analysis and recommendations. The team also analyses how investors measure and consider ESG factors in the investment process, helping asset managers structure their portfolios and investment decisions.\n\nOver 475 ESG-focused research reports were published in 2023. Our expectation is that topics such as climate change, decarbonisation and biodiversity - as well as other sustainability themes and specific ESG attributes - will continue to grow in importance, and that the global momentum behind ESG investing will continue at pace, making it an essential requisite\n\nfor a large and growing number of investors. During 2023 ESG Research hosted and contributed content to client events around the world - including Barclays' first Sustainable Finance Conference in New York, its fourth annual ESG Research conference in London, its first Sustainable Finance Conference in Singapore, its Sustainable Policy Forum in Brussels and its ESG Emerging Market Corporate Day.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on ESG Research can be found at: cib.barclays/research\n\n## Sustainable and Thematic Investing\n\nThe Sustainable and Thematic Investing Research team at Barclays focuses on sustainability and long-term thematic disruption. Its reports are produced in conjunction with sector analysts, with the aim of identifying multiyear sector trends that could help shape the future business environment. Typically the team identify topics with a five- to 10-year horizon, with investment opportunities spanning both public and private companies.\n\nTo aid thematic and ESG investors, the team maintains an investment framework known as the '2030 Thematic Roadmap: 150 Trends' - and has published reports on various trends relating to disruptive technology, sustainability and demographic change. The team has also developed a range of investment tools including trend momentum scores, UN SDG mapping and company revenue tagging.\n\nRelevant 2023 publications include Advance Chemical Recycling, Grid Infrastructure, Digital Safety, Vehicle Grid Integration, Cultured Meat, Gender & Social Inclusion, Human Capital and VC Trends.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on the Sustainable and Thematic Investing Research team can be found at: cib.barclays/ our-insights",

With the global transition to EVs there is growing demand for key raw materials - especially rare-earth minerals for use in magnets essential for EV motor production. However, the limited global production capacity of these materials poses a significant challenge.\n\nAEM's next-generation electric motors and powertrain systems are designed without rareearth magnets and copper windings, while focused on performance, range and efficiency. This breakthrough not only ensures a sustainable supply chain but also enhances recyclability contributing to a circular economy.\n\nIn an era where sustainable mobility solutions are crucial, Barclays' investment in AEM represents a significant step towards unlocking electric mobility's potential while addressing critical raw material challenges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found at: home.barclays/\n\nnews/2023/10/sic-advanced-electric-machines/\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainable Ventures\n\nBarclays' Sustainable Impact Capital led Sustainable Ventures' first-ever fundraising round, with participation from angel investors.

Our Discretionary Portfolio Management (DPM) services are offered across the Private Bank and sit at the core of its longterm strategy. Our DPM Traditional strategies include the Global Multi-Asset Class Strategy, Equity strategies and Fixed Income strategies. Our DPM Sustainable strategies are the MultiAsset Class Sustainable Total Return Strategy and the Sustainable Global Equity Strategy.\n\nWhile we incorporate the same approach in each of our discretionary strategies and in all jurisdictions 1 in which we operate, we may have portfolios with specific requirements where we need to vary our approach to our core strategies. For our Traditional strategies we maintain a standard set of exclusions that do not allow us to invest in businesses we view as being involved in the manufacture of controversial weapons, and we consider material ESG risks as part of the standard investment process.\n\nOur Sustainable strategies seek to invest in businesses that provide products and services to support the transition to a more sustainable economy. These identify businesses we believe are able to mitigate ESG risks from an investment perspective, demonstrate high standards of non-financial ESG quality, and address sustainability considerations through their economic activities by aligning to at least one of the UN SDGs. Our Sustainable strategies also exclude certain companies that generate revenues over our internally defined thresholds from adult entertainment, alcohol, armaments, gambling, fossil fuels, tobacco and controversial weapons.\n\nAll our DPM strategies seek to deliver competitive investment returns for our clients and create long-term value for stakeholders.

The vast majority of our clients' assets are managed by external fund managers. We aim to assess each of those managers based on their ESG credentials among other relevant factors. Every manager's offering is given a single standalone score from A to C for ESG considerations - reflecting both their intent and their outcome. We focus on how ESG is embedded across each of five key areas: the parent company; the people managing the assets; the investment philosophy employed; the robustness of the process; and the performance achieved. Ultimately, we award an ESG score for every fund we recommend or invest in. The team uses data from different sources, including investment managers and MSCI ESG Manager, and as such there may be some limitations in the data we use.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- + Further details on BISL's approach to responsible investing\n\ncan be found at: barclays.co.uk/wealth-management/ important-information/responsible-investing-statement\n\n## Industry initiatives\n\n## Private Bank\n\nBarclays Private Bank Investment Management became a signatory of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) in 2022, completing its first reporting to the PRI on responsible investing activities in 2023.\n\nBeing a signatory to the PRI allows us to publicly demonstrate our commitment to responsible investment. The PRI defines responsible investment as a strategy and practice to incorporate ESG factors in investment decisions and active ownership. Its goal is to help contribute to the creation of a sustainable financial system, with signatories committing to incorporate ESG issues via the six Principles in their investment practice.\n\n## Barclays Investment Solutions Limited\n\nBISL became a signatory to the PRI in 2023. Prior to this, and since 2016, BISL's subsidiary Barclays Asset Management Limited was a signatory. BISL also became a signatory to the UK Stewardship Code in 2023, which sets high stewardship standards for those investing money on behalf of UK savers and pensioners and those that support them. Stewardship is the responsible allocation, management and oversight of capital to create long-term value for clients and beneficiaries with the aim of achieving sustainable benefits for the economy, the environment and society.\n\n## Engagement and voting\n\nPrivate Bank and Barclays Investment Solutions Limited (BISL)\n\nBoth the Private Bank and BISL undertake engagement and voting in partnership with our stewardship services provider, EOS at Federated Hermes (EOS), in respect of certain holdings relating to specific services 2 . We view engagement and voting as an important mechanism through which to hold management to account and act as a lever to promote change in investee companies on material ESG issues where appropriate. We believe companies that can better manage material ESG issues could be less prone to severe incidents such as fraud, litigation or reputational risks.\n\nVoting forms an integral part of the Private Bank and BISL's overall stewardship strategy and is used as a tactical tool to achieve desired changes on ESG issues. Based on various metrics, BISL filters EOS's voting recommendations in relation to company holdings and, if deemed necessary, our portfolio managers may deviate from EOS's recommendation.\n\nAt Private Bank, for our direct equity holdings, we use our rights as shareholders to seek and drive our desired changes. Following receipt of EOS's voting recommendations, our Equity portfolio managers meet to discuss this information for a select number of voting issues in advance of making the voting decision on behalf of our clients. Our Equity portfolio managers are ultimately responsible for making voting decisions.\n\nAll voting activities sit alongside engagement practices, reflecting both the Private Bank and BISL approach of promoting constructive dialogue with investee companies by building long-term relationships to seek to influence ESG and other practices. This is mostly undertaken by EOS, which engages on behalf of clients including Barclays with a wide range of stakeholders including government authorities, trade bodies, unions, investors and NGOs - to seek to identify and respond to market-wide and systemic risks.\n\nBoth the Private Bank and BISL make their engagement and voting activities publicly available to all stakeholders on the Barclays website. We believe such transparency is an integral part of good governance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Further details on engagement and voting can be found at: Private Bank: privatebank.barclays.com/what-we-offer/ investments/responsible-investing-engagement-and-votingactivities\n\nBISL: barclays.co.uk/wealth-management/importantinformation/responsible-investing-statement\n\n## Responsible Lending\n\n## Private Bank\n\nWe have launched our Greener Mortgage Discount 3 for UK properties, offering a reduced arrangement fee for new-build properties with an EPC rating of A-B - incentivising clients to seek energy-efficient properties and to encourage homebuilders to achieve maximum energy efficiency from their projects. Clients will also be supported in improving the energy efficiency of their existing properties - we have publications available to encourage clients to consider sustainably retrofitting their homes to improve energy efficiency, and intend to enhance this throughout 2024. This falls into the wider work we have undertaken on creating educational content and guidance 4 for clients in relation to ESG in the Real Estate space and beyond. For our wider credit offering in this space we are exploring opportunities to enhance our proposition to support clients in making more sustainable choices across the spectrum of lending products throughout 2024 and 2025 .\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 The exception is India, where we offer strategies developed for the local market.

In 2022, Climate risk became a Principal Risk within our Enterprise Risk Management Framework, aiming to ensure a holistic approach to risk identification, assessment and management.\n\nBarclays' Climate Risk Framework facilitates the structured integration of climate risk considerations into the Bank's operations. It undergoes regular reviews and updates including changes to risk taxonomy, definitions and methodology - which align to align the Framework with changing regulatory expectations and external developments.\n\n+\n\nFurther details on climate risk identification, assessment and management can be navigated via the Risk Review contents section on page 254.\n\nWe continue to build on our inclusion of Climate Strategy and climate-related risks and opportunities in our financial planning, working to further embed these considerations into our products and services and operations.\n\nWe have continued to work on embedding climate and sustainability considerations into the culture of the organisation through training and knowledge building. We have developed several climate- and sustainability-related mandatory and non-mandatory training initiatives across the organisation and provided training to a number of functions across the Group.\n\n## Impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our business, strategy and financial planning\n\nBarclays' 2023 financial planning process included a review of our strategy, its implementation, and tracking of our progress against climate-related targets - as well as capturing a view of climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nDuring 2023 we enhanced our monthly reporting framework to cover a view of the balance sheet and revenue from Sustainable Financing. This supports our ability to review our sustainable financing portfolio at greater granularity and improve relevant business engagement through the financial planning process. Enhancements were made to help us further evaluate the portfolio's performance and identify opportunities to maximise revenue generation activities.\n\n- \u00b7 We are tracking progress towards portfolio alignment of our financed emissions with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement through BlueTrack\u2122, which includes a number of portfolio alignment metrics and levers available to manage the portfolio against these targets while understanding their financial implications. The metrics are subject to second-line review by the Climate Risk team to assess the strategy against the targets. We have developed an internal approach to track and monitor progress against our targets and how we govern these internally\n- \u00b7 We conduct portfolio reviews to monitor whether business activities are conducted within Barclays' mandate and aligned with our expectations, and whether they are of an appropriate scale relative to the risk and reward of the underlying activities. Mandate & Scale Exposure Controls form part of our overall Risk Appetite Control Framework and climate risks have been integrated into annual credit portfolio reviews for elevated risk sectors since 2020. Furthermore, we have introduced mandate and scale limits linked to scoring within our Client Transition Framework.\n\nThese outputs have been incorporated in our financial planning process for 2023. Our planning process also considered current climate policies to ensure they are included in the base scenario. We also considered impairment over the horizon of the financial plan. At this point in time, there are no material amendments required to the\n\nfinancial plan.\n\nAll key businesses and functions are involved in integrating climate-related risks and opportunities into our financial planning process. Implementing our Climate Strategy is managed through central Sustainable Finance teams under the Heads of Sustainable Finance for both CIB and Barclays UK. We are developing processes and levers that we anticipate will allow us to further engage and impact the businesses we work with.\n\n## For example:\n\n- \u00b7 The three pillars of our Climate Strategy, as well as our Sustainable and Transition Financing target of $1trn, are key drivers of our finance planning process with a pathway to achieve this as well as risks and opportunities reviewed with business heads\n- \u00b7 We continue to develop our green, sustainable and transition finance banking product sets, including for retail customers, (for example green mortgages), bonds/loans (including Project Finance for renewables) and securitised products\n- \u00b7 We strive to continue to decarbonise our own operations, reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and our Scope 3 operational emissions",

The baseline scenario considered the impact of current and agreed climate policies across the UK, US and EU on macroeconomic variables such as GDP and Unemployment. This was done via a detailed assessment of climate policy impacts, likelihood of implementation and current level of policy progress. The outcome of this assessment led to a comparison between the climate baseline scenario and the scenarios used for financial planning, indicating a current de minimis impact on the macroeconomic variables used to project financial performance. We will continue to review how climate risks manifest in the economy through a baseline scenario - and, where these impacts increase, will consider those within our financial planning process.\n\nWorkstreams specifically related to finance have been further embedded within our overall global financial planning processes, including dedicated climate management reporting information. Further details of how this work has served as an input in our five-year financial planning process are set out below - including our approach to sustainable financing, targets and capital investments.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial planning process we assessed the financial impact of embedding individual parts of our Climate Strategy, new initiatives and targets across our businesses. This includes the wholesale credit book, sustainable financing and sustainable lending in the CIB, and initiatives across our retail businesses such as green mortgages and sustainable investing. Build-out of new product capabilities including Global Project Finance are also captured.\n\nA range of scenario analyses was undertaken this year with the aim to further uncover areas of risk and opportunity, as well as integrate climate scenario analysis into our strategic and financial planning. This included two climate stress-tests with the results allowing Barclays to understand resilience to Climate risk in those scenarios.\n\nThe strategic review of sustainable financing was also refreshed during the year across Barclays UK and the CIB. The review built upon both new and previously identified commercial opportunities. The output was considered in the financial planning process, including incremental revenue, cost and capital.\n\nKey opportunities continue to reside within Equity Capital Markets, Debt Capital Markets and lending, and some smaller new markets.\n\nThe planning process included an assessment of our financed emissions reduction targets for some of our highest-emitting sectors: Energy, Power, Cement, Automotive and Steel. Barclays has set absolute emissions or emissions intensity targets for these sectors and the impacts of meeting them are integrated into the financial planning process.\n\nBarclays continues to engage with our clients to support their transition to a low-carbon economy. Our current emissions targets are not forecasted to materially impact financial performance over the next five years.\n\nAs we strengthen our sustainability capability and culture, our colleagues continue to build insights and expertise to help execute our Climate Strategy. We have made online learning available to grow everyone's knowledge, and created upskilling for specific areas in line with strategic priorities - including mandatory training and targeted development for certain teams relevant to their roles and responsibilities. This is alongside investment in our future pipeline of colleague skills through a newly created apprenticeship programme. A communications campaign informed colleagues of how Barclays is responding to climate change and sustainability more broadly, reinforcing how they can take action - including building their knowledge and skills in this area.\n\nOur suite of Sustainability training resources is supporting wider awareness across the organisation, comprising of videos and elearning. We intend to evolve this during 2024. The topics covered include addressing climate change, principles of sustainability, how we support our communities, and modern slavery. During 2023 a mandatory online climate risk training module was provided to 12,306 colleagues across Risk, Compliance, Internal Audit, Markets Post Trade and Business Banking. This training focused on the elevation of climate to a Principal Risk.\n\nThe financial planning process also covered a review of our net zero operations strategy. Building on the hiring of our Heads of Sustainable Finance in CIB and Barclays UK, over the past year we have continued to grow our existing talent with several strategic hires - with a focus on expanding our product capabilities as we continue to drive performance against our selected targets. Each hire will allow us to further accelerate our Climate Strategy and increase coordination, with a focus on how we can help our customers and clients with their individual transitions to a low-carbon economy.\n\nWe will continue to further enhance how our Climate Strategy is embedded into the way we think about financial planning over the coming years - reflecting on the progress we made during 2023.\n\n## Skills, culture and training Building our expertise\n\nWe are aware that responding effectively to climate and sustainability issues is one of the greatest challenges facing businesses, investors, and society today. In 2023 we continued to educate colleagues on sustainability and climate change risk and opportunities, their impact on society and the Bank, and Barclays' strategy and response.",

This module focused on how Barclays manages climate risk, as well as covering the Group sustainability-related statements and internal standards and how they should be applied.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on Barclays' sustainability statements and policy positions can be found from page 40.\n\nWe also collaborated with external suppliers to deliver accredited development programmes for teams seeking to build specialist sustainability knowledge. For example, a development programme began in 2023 for 300 Corporate Bank colleagues in our Sustainability Academy pilot to develop their climate and sustainability knowledge. We intend to support more Corporate Banking colleagues through the programme during 2024. In addition, we delivered training to colleagues in the Business Bank on strategies for supporting SME customers on their transition to net zero.\n\nIn Barclays UK we launched our Sustainability Champions community to bring together our most engaged colleagues. In the Consumer Bank specifically, we provided training on home energy efficiency and climate risk for mortgage advisors, and hosted a webinar for mortgage brokers on retrofitting. We are continuing to build a targeted learning proposition for our Corporate and Investment Bank to support their ongoing development on the client transition strategy.\n\nTraining on greenwashing was delivered to targeted colleagues in Barclays UK, Private Bank and Wealth Management, Corporate Bank, Legal, Compliance, Marketing and Corporate Communications in EMEA, the US and APAC. This covered topics including forthcoming regulation and how to identify and mitigate greenwashing risk.\n\n## Incentives\n\nFor the Executive Directors of Barclays PLC, an element of each of their annual bonus awards and Long-Term Incentive Plan awards is driven by non-financial performance measures - including measures relating to climate and sustainability.\n\nBarclays' performance against non-financial measures, including ESG metrics, is also explicitly considered in the determination of the incentive pool - directly impacting pay levels of the wider workforce.\n\nNon-financial performance for the Executive Directors' 2023 annual bonus and the 2023 incentives pool was assessed against three categories: Customers and clients; Colleagues; and Climate and Sustainability. The latter included climate-related measures such as performance against our Sustainable and Transition Financing target, financed emissions reduction targets, carbon footprint reduction, and increase in renewable energy usage - as well as measures relating to our investment in communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found in our Remuneration report from page 191.\n\nIn Q3 2023, Sustainability September a communications campaign across the organisation - helped engage colleagues on key sustainability-related topics. This included short videos, a series of live recorded conversations with senior leaders, and associated reading materials.\n\nTo ensure our workforce of the future is well positioned to understand climate risk, in November 2023 we introduced a new Sustainability Apprenticeship - targeting internal colleagues and working in partnership with an external provider. The apprenticeship is one of six selected by industry experts to mark His Majesty The King's Coronation, gaining recognition for educating people to understand and develop ways to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

In the UK, the Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) integrated the recommendations of the Just Transition Working Group in the Disclosure Framework, encouraging companies to disclose whether and how - they have identified, assessed and taken into account the impacts and dependencies of the transition plans on stakeholders, society, the economy and the natural environment throughout their value chain.\n\nIn turn, the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Disclosure Framework included recommendations to disclose details of human rights policies and engagement activities with respect to the assessment and response to nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities.\n\nIn this context Barclays continues to acknowledge the role financial institutions play in supporting a just transition. We have also continued our efforts to build an approach to just transition that considers the social risks and opportunities of the transition and seeks to engage relevant stakeholders.\n\nAs we pilot our approach to just transition in our Client Transition Framework, the findings of our pilot show that 40% of the assessed clients have committed to a just transition. We will consider these findings in our engagement with clients. We also intend to include social considerations as we develop our transition plan.\n\nBarclays UK has continued to identify opportunities to address the social challenges of the transition in the context of the energy crisis. For example, in 2023 we launched a pilot with our strategic partner British Gas, aiming to support thousands of customers experiencing low financial wellbeing in accessing support with their energy bills and relevant grants to make energyefficiency-related improvements to their homes.\n\nWe have continued to contribute to the development of a just transition approach for the financial sector through our engagement with initiatives and the organisation of thought leadership events and discussions, as described below:\n\n- \u00b7 During New York Climate Week Barclays hosted an event with UNEP FI, Ceres and Boston Consulting Group (BCG), bringing together leaders in the sustainability and finance space to discuss the role finance can play in ensuring an equitable climate transition.\n- \u00b7 During COP28 Barclays co-hosted and organised three events alongside its partners:\n- - an event with LSE discussing the barriers to investing in emerging markets and mobilising debt markets;\n- - an event with Ceres on the regional approach to financing a just transition; and\n- - an event with BCG and Ceres discussing whether financial institutions can facilitate a just transition through cleantech financing and green jobs.\n- \u00b7 As part of our participation in the LSE Financing a Just Transition Alliance (FJTA), we contributed to the report 'Sowing seeds: How finance can support a just transition in UK agriculture', which was designed to increase understanding across the financial sector of how it can support a just transition in agriculture by mobilising more finance towards companies committed to and making progress to support a just nature transition.\n- \u00b7 Barclays is a Founding Funder of LSE's Just Transition Finance Lab, which launches in February 2024. The Lab plans to work on the development of financial tools and instruments for the just transition, metrics to measure just transition performance; identify appropriate policy reforms to help to mobilise finance for the just transition, and develop case studies that demonstrate how just transition finance can be applied in practice.\n\nCognisant of the importance of local approaches for just transition and the integration of the voices of impacted stakeholders, we also organised a stakeholder engagement, with the support of Ceres, that allowed us to access the perspectives of investors, non-profits, and community leaders to help our understanding of just transition in the US.\n\n## Our approach to nature and biodiversity\n\nBanks have an important role to play in contributing to nature-positive finance and managing their nature-related risks.\n\nNature is a key sustainability focus for Barclays and the wider industry going forward, given that nature and its ecosystem services fundamentally underpin economies and societies. Nature is also important to the banking sector due to the interlinkages with climate change and social impacts, with disclosure requirements moving towards a holistic approach to nature, climate and social risks and opportunities. During 2023 nature loss continued to be recognised within new and emerging guidance and regulation. Significantly for companies and financial institutions, the TNFD finalised its framework for organisations to assess and disclose nature-related risks and opportunities. Upcoming disclosure requirements on nature-related topics were confirmed under the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, as well as within guidance published by the TPT regarding incorporating nature-related impacts and dependencies associated with climate transition plans.\n\nWe continue to work to build an understanding of the ways our activities and those of our clients impact and depend on nature. This includes engaging with industry and cross-sector groups as detailed in the 'Engagement' section on the following page. We continue to explore how to integrate these considerations into policy and process and reviewing the ways our financing activities can contribute to nature.\n\nGiven the interdependencies across the climate, nature and social agendas, reviewing ways we can address these areas holistically is important. For instance, drawing on the work of the TPT, we are considering nature-related topics in our sector approach for Agriculture. See page 93 for details.",

We recognise the need for continuous improvement with regard to available data and technologies, in particular noting the complexity and challenge given the number of nature attributes and their associated metrics. During 2023 we engaged with a number of data providers to better understand data availability and capability. The following sets out a summary of this work.\n\n+\n\nFurther information on our approach to nature can be found throughout the report.\n\nNature-related risk -\n\nsee pages 69, 100, and 276\n\nNature-related opportunity -\n\nsee page 105\n\nNature-related governance -\n\nsee page 232\n\nNature in our operations see page 79\n\nTNFD pilot - see page 276\n\n## Nature-related risk in financing\n\nWe include financing restrictions that seek to address nature-related risk within our position statements on Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands, and Climate Change. We continue to review and monitor how we can strengthen our approach. In 2023 we undertook a significant update of our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities Statement to expand the scope to include, for the first time, requirements for clients involved in South American beef production or primary processing and enhanced the existing requirements for clients involved in palm oil and soy. See page 100.\n\nWe have continued to develop our approach to evaluating nature-related risk in financing. This included building on work across 2022-23 in which we piloted the TNFD Framework on our lending portfolio for Agriculture and Food in Europe, with a focus on UK Farming - in which Barclays has a significant presence. The results informed development of new questions for the Client Transition Tool (CTT) for UK farmers, which are due to be incorporated in 2024. See page 93 for details of our approach to the UK Agriculture sector. In recognition of naturerelated impacts identified in the agricultural value chain, we also strengthened our approach to financing agricultural commodity sectors exposed to significant deforestation risk.\n\nWe refined the work undertaken in 2022 to develop a sectoral heatmap, refreshing the industries included to align with the TNFD's priority sector list. Our proposed next steps include consideration of the TNFD LEAP framework to conduct further sector-level analysis. See page 69 for more details.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found in our position statements on the Barclays ESG Resource Hub at: home.barclays/ sustainability/esg-resource-hub/ Further details on our position statements can be found in\n\nthe non-financial information statement from page 40.\n\n## Nature-related financing\n\nNature-related financing presents significant future opportunities for the financial sector, given the capital requirements to address and reverse nature loss. The biodiversity financing gap is estimated to be $700bn per year\u00b9.\n\nWe will continue to work towards meeting our green and sustainable finance targets, which include financing relevant to nature.\n\nBarclays provided input into the nature components of the TPT's disclosure guidance for climate transition plans as part of the TPT's Nature Working Group. See page 61 for details of our wider engagement with TPT.\n\nWe continued engagement with a number of industry and cross-sector groups, including the UN Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) Nature Working Group - with which we fed into a guide to setting targets relating to banks' practices and processes on nature. We further provided input into the LSE's FJTA's publication on a just nature transition - see page 124 for details.\n\nAs part of the Sustainable Markets Initiative's Financial Services Task Force, Barclays co-led the publication of a guide on Financing Coastal Nature-based (NbS) Solutions - see page 105 for details.\n\nBarclays completed the third and final year of our partnership with the Blue Marine Foundation, which had the aim of supporting them in seeking to deliver their goal of ensuring that at least 30% of the global ocean is effectively protected and the other 70% sustainably managed by 2030. Our donation contributed to conservation outcomes including support for more than 445,000km of newly designated Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), 900km 2 of newly proposed MPAs, and advocacy and educational outreach to support the ongoing protection and restoration of the ocean - including through the award-winning 'The Sea We Breathe' educational site.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\nFurther details on Blue Marine Foundation can be found at: bluemarinefoundation.com bluemarinefoundation.com/the-sea-we-breathe/\n\n## For more details, see:\n\nunepfi.org/industries/banking/nature-target-settingguidance/\n\nlse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/publication/sowing-seeds-howfinance-can-support-a-just-transition-in-uk-agriculture/\n\nOur Sustainable Finance Framework includes categories such as Sustainable Food, Agriculture, Forestry, Aquaculture and Fisheries, which we have mapped to nature-related UN SDGs including SDG14, Life Under Water, and SDG 15, Life on Land.\n\nIn Barclays UK we believe the nature transition is a key area where we can make an impact due to our prominent role in financing UK agriculture and agricultural land purchases. In 2023 examples of nature-related financing have included lending funds in relation to the Biodiversity Net Gain scheme and support for farmers who seek to apply more sustainable farming practices.\n\nWe are supporting environmentally-focused climate technology start-ups through our SIC portfolio led by Barclays' Principal Investments team. We are also exploring nature-related products and solutions for our clients in the CIB. See page 105 for details.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details of our green and sustainable financing and financing nature see the 'Financing the transition section from page 105.\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 cbd.int/doc/decisions/cop-15/cop-15-dec-04-en.pdf\n\n## Engagement\n\nWe see appropriate collaboration and engagement across industry as essential for sharing learnings across the sector and a successful nature-related transition.\n\nIn 2023 we continued to provide feedback to the TNFD - both bilaterally, as part of our membership of the TNFD Forum, and through industry groups ahead of the finalisation of the TNFD Framework.",

At a minimum, strategic partnerships with key stakeholders enables knowledge sharing and supports informed decision making. Collaborating with NGOs, academia, government agencies, private sector peers and local communities enhances our ability to understand, assess and address the intricate issues associated with climate change. These partnerships have the potential to uncover opportunities to deploy capital into areas that suffer from existing financing gaps and scale companies to disrupt markets and innovate for impact. During 2023, Barclays contributed to several workstreams across climate, nature, just transition, and advancing data and reporting standards.\n\nOur involvements in these workstreams highlighted the significant financing gaps that exist across sectors and markets. This theme was in full focus throughout our conversations at London Climate Action Week, New York Climate Week, and COP28 in Dubai, where we hosted and co-hosted several action-oriented sessions. At COP28 we sponsored the Start-Up Village located in the Green Zone, which enabled over 100 start-ups to demonstrate their various climate technologies on a world stage - including three Barclays SIC portfolio companies: ZeroAvia, GeoPura, and ECOncrete.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PCAF Capital Markets working group\n\nBarclays has been an active member of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) - an industry-wide initiative that aims to build consensus on approaches to carbon accounting, disclosure and portfolio alignment - since 2020. In 2023, and for the third year running, Barclays co-chaired the PCAF Capital Markets working group comprising eight other banks.\n\nThe working group has developed a standard to account for the facilitated emissions associated with capital markets transactions, which was published in December 2023. The Standard (Part B) builds on the extensive work carried out by the working group over the past three years and follows on from the 2021 Discussion Paper, the 2022 Proposed Methodology document, and two public consultations.\n\n+",

We seek to engage constructively with policymakers in jurisdictions where the firm operates, including with governments, legislatures, regulators and other organisations.\n\nIn our discussions we seek to make contributions that are accurate, honest and evidence-based. Barclays' advocacy and engagement activities, including direct and indirect lobbying, must also be undertaken in line with our internal controls including Barclays' code of conduct (The Barclays Way), which requires that \"where we engage with governments and regulators on issues relevant to our business, we are honest and transparent in our communication with them\". The Barclays Way also provides detailed guidance on speaking up and raising concerns, directing employees to speak up if they see \"behaviours and practices that are not in line with our Barclays Values\" - making clear that speaking up, whether formally or informally, will not come at a consequence to them. We also believe that Barclays should only engage on issues where we have a legitimate interest - for example where there is a consequence for our business, our customers and clients, or our colleagues. Barclays' Group Head of Strategic Policy is responsible for the co-ordination and oversight of public policy advocacy.\n\nBarclays retains the services of public affairs agencies in certain jurisdictions. These agencies primarily assist with political monitoring and strategic advice. We work very closely with these agencies on a day-to-day basis, to help ensure that the Strategic Policy Group has oversight of the work being undertaken for Barclays.\n\nAdvocacy with public officials in the US is publicly reported, as required by the Lobbying Disclosure Act. Barclays also discloses its EU advocacy activities on the European Commission's Transparency Register.\n\nIn addition, Barclays is a member of a number of trade associations globally. These associations work to represent their members, and for many this involves undertaking work to shape industry's collective response to various public policy issues. We seek to be an engaged and productive member of all associations in which Barclays participates, predominantly through the committees and working groups formed by each. Active participation in the discussions and working groups facilitated by these trade associations helps encourage the adoption of policy positions consistent with Barclays' public policy objectives. Where we identify divergence on key policy matters we seek to engage and influence these positions. The Strategic Policy Group also supports senior executives occupying trade association board positions, as appropriate.\n\nAs part of our commitment to transparency we publish a range of information on our Public Policy Engagement website, including certain details regarding the aforementioned agencies and trade association memberships. We also publish details of Barclays' bilateral responses to material government and public policy consultations on certain issues with which we are principally engaged, in the UK and EU, either in full summary or part. In other jurisdictions, including across Asia and the US, responses to public consultations are published on the respective government websites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Public Policy Engagement website can be found at:\n\nhome.barclays/sustainability/esg-resource-hub/reportingand-disclosures/public-policy-engagement/\n\n## Climate policy engagement\n\nBarclays seeks to proactively engage in climate and sustainable finance-related public policy conversations and development, directly and indirectly, consistent with our business strategy including our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050 and our commitment to aligning our financing with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe proactively pursue opportunities for seniorlevel dialogue with policymakers to demonstrate private sector leadership on sustainable finance and the energy transition. We provide feedback, as an individual institution and via trade associations to relevant consultation processes launched by standard setters, multilateral organisations and NGOs, including those that could inform future policy recommendations. We also engage with governments and other key stakeholders to promote policies that facilitate greater investment in climate solutions. This includes participating in key international and domestic forums - such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) and the UK's Global Investment Summit 2023 - to promote net-zero-aligned public policy at senior levels.\n\nBarclays endeavours to support the development of public policy positions that facilitate sustainable finance and the broader energy transition through proactive engagement in relevant trade association working groups, where we seek to promote positions consistent with our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050. We engage with many trade associations on climate issues and will continue to do so to promote our net zero objectives. Reflective of the pace of developments and regional differences in approaches to sustainability, there can be diverging views within trade associations. Many of these trade associations also do not focus exclusively on\n\nsustainability, but rather engage across the full breadth of financial services-related policy - and do not have stated positions in relation to net zero.\n\nWhere misalignment between an association's advocacy position and Barclays' own net zero ambitions is identified, we seek to manage this appropriately by addressing it through proactive engagement where possible. Where there is a material and ongoing difference identified through our routine engagement, Barclays may publicly dissent from a trade association's position. Should a trade association adopt a material position that, following engagement, remains irreconcilable with our Values or strategy, we can exercise the option to end our membership.\n\nIn 2023 we undertook another internal review of the climate policy positions of certain material trade associations, including their alignment with our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050 and our commitment to aligning our financing with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement. A list of these trade associations in scope can be found on our Public Policy Engagement web page. This review was informed by publicly available information on each trade association's website, which could include climate policy position statements and, where directly related to climate, consultation responses, commission reports and statements from an association's senior leadership. For a number of trade associations inscope of the review, we were unable to identify a clearly articulated position on net zero. Of those with a clear position, the majority were considered to be aligned or partially aligned with our net zero by 2050 ambition. In 2023 we began to proactively engage with trade associations to better understand their climate policy positions and activities, and we will continue to keep our approach under review.",

        "page_content": "Risk\n\nreview\n\n## Resilience of our strategy (continued)\n\n## TCFD Strategy Recommendation (c)\n\n## Barclays' resilience to climate scenarios\n\nBased on the exercises undertaken to date, our understanding is that Barclays' strategy remains resilient to climate scenarios. This assessment includes consideration of two climate stress tests completed in 2023, with further details included in subsequent sections of this chapter.\n\nIn addition Barclays considers the impact of climate scenarios within its financial planning process, including the use of a baseline climate scenario within the Medium Term Planning process and the financial impacts from Barclays meeting its sectoral BlueTrack TM targets, aligned to 1.5\u00b0C scenario pathways. Finally, Barclays has considered the impact of climate scenarios within its assessment of Expected Credit Losses reported under IFRS9, for year-end 2023. More detail on these two elements can be found on page 121 and 310 respectively.\n\nNevertheless, given the evolving climate landscape, we seek to further enhance our capabilities and modelling in order to refine our understanding of the Bank's resilience to various climate scenarios, particularly given high uncertainty within climate scenario analysis.\n\nThe aims of our two climate stress tests, each with their own scenario, were to assess Barclays' financial resiliency to climate risks over and above the financial impact of existing macroeconomic internal stress tests - and the extent to which Barclays would remain within risk appetite.\n\nBoth stress tests were designed as Bank-wide exercises, conducted over a five-year time period, to assess an accelerated transition and specific climate vulnerabilities to the Bank's business plan.\n\nThese exercises include an assessment of the financial impact to our clients of a structural decline in fossil fuel demand and consumption and shift towards low-carbon products and services.\n\nThe two scenarios have been internally designed with consideration of Barclays' specific portfolio vulnerabilities. External scenarios such as those provided by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), while offering granular and detailed scenario information for financial institutions, tend to focus on longer trends and display limited volatility, with assumptions that may be less relevant to our specific businesses. As such we have designed scenarios with a greater focus on short-term tail risks and volatility to assess Barclays' resiliency.\n\nResults of the two exercises indicate a c.10% drag on the Bank's profitability, falling in the range projected for the UK banking sector by the Bank of England's 2021 Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES). In addition the exercises represent a c.10-20% uplift in losses incurred in existing macroeconomic internal stress tests. In order to manage and mitigate these potential risks, Barclays has for the first time quantitatively integrated the results of its stress tests into its internal capital adequacy assessments, ensuring the Bank remains appropriately capitalised for climate risks, and to ensure business resilience.\n\nThe results of our exercises have highlighted risks within our key businesses to either Physical Risk, Transition Risk or both. We have aggregated results for Barclays' three main business units, Barclays International, Retail and SME Banking, and Head Office, in the heatmap on the right for the stress test most recently completed.\n\nThe assessment indicates the relative impact from the climate scenario against Barclays' medium-term plan, calculated as the additional losses compared to the expected business cycle. Losses appear highest in the Barclays International segment relative to the baseline. This is predominantly attributed to our Global\n\nBanking & Markets business, driven by exposure to more carbon intensive sectors that are most impacted from the fast transition scenario, such as the introduction of carbon pricing schemes. In addition, cascading transitional impacts drive up unemployment, stressing our cards portfolios.\n\nMeanwhile, within Retail, UK residential real estate exposures face increased acute physical events and additional energy remediation costs. Further detail of these exercises is included in subsequent sections.\n\n| Business               | Impacts   |\n|------------------------|-----------|\n| Barclays International | Medium    |\n| Retail and SME Banking | Low       |\n| Head Office            | Low       |\n\n## Climate stress tests\n\nTwo climate stress tests have been conducted during 2023, each with their own short-term scenario, to assess the Bank's financial resiliency to transition and physical risks. The H2 exercise builds upon the learnings from H1, enhancing climate stress testing design, integration, and execution as part of the Bank's planning and stress-testing framework. Key developments include full macroeconomic scenario expansion, the broadening of assessment scope, and the refinement of climate methodologies.\n\n## Climate stress test (H1)\n\nIn the first half of 2023 Barclays performed a Bankwide climate stress test, which tested the impact of a tipping point event, with subsequent shifts in consumer behaviour and financial market activity. The scenario began with a substantial weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, leading to a disruption in heat transfer and\n\nchanges in atmospheric circulation - resulting in direct physical risk events across the globe. Structural changes in weather patterns drive indirect physical risks, and industries reliant on a stable climate begin to deteriorate. As climate disasters manifest, societal actors including governments, markets, consumers and NGOs take action in attempts to curb further materialisation of climate risks. This exercise was used to test the Bank's resilience to credit, market, operational, liquidity, and reputational risks arising from climate change. The scenario was developed internally, based on the latest scientific research from the IPCC, with review by Oxford University.\n\n## Results and insights\n\nOverall, losses represent a c.10% drag on profits, falling in the range projected in the Bank of England's CBES. Climate impacts were driven notably by fossil-fuel-intensive industries and assets, and those sectors where consumers 'vote with their feet' and change spending patterns to more sustainable options. While physical risks losses represented a lower portion of overall losses across businesses, physical risks are significant and concentrated in industries with high reliance on buildings and infrastructure.\n\n## Climate internal stress test (H2)\n\nDuring the second half of 2023 Barclays undertook a climate stress test, part of an annually scheduled climate stress-testing programme, in line with existing internal macroeconomic stress tests. The formal integration of climate stresstesting into the Bank's Stress Testing Framework is an important development and further embeds ongoing management of climate risks, enables consistent analysis of how these risks change through time, and incorporates into assessments of the Bank's risk appetite. In order to appropriately assess Barclays' resiliency to climate-related changes, we assess scenarios against our internal climate risk register, to select those most relevant to both self-identified areas of risk and those that require further exploration.",

Specific variables were expanded using a combination of models and Subject Matter Expert (SME) judgement by Barclays' internal Scenario Expansion Team to assess both physical and transition Climate Risks. The exercise is designed to complement conventional Barclays macroeconomic stress-testing, and seeks to understand:\n\n- 1) How climate can influence conventional macroeconomic stressed environment pathways and severity; and\n- 2) The incremental impact of climate above macroeconomic stressed pathways.\n\nThe climate scenario involves initial policy announcements that trigger immediate asset repricing, while more stringent policy requirements unfold over a longer time horizon dampening recovery in the outer years as depicted in the below chart through stages 1, 2, and 3. Against this backdrop the scenario also includes consideration of physical risk, notably hazards of which Barclays' clients are most susceptible to such as flood and drought.\n\nImplications and policies of the three stages are outlined below:\n\n## Stage 1:\n\na) Consumer preferences shift toward greener products and practices while consumption is cut to cope with the recessionary environment. Behavioural shifts are pronounced at sector level as consumers turn away from firms who finance carbon-heavy industries.\n\nb) Investors reassess their participation with certain firms. Those with heavy exposure to brown income and/or assets, combined with poor transition plans, are negatively impacted in equity markets - with capital reallocated to greener firms.\n\nc) In the UK, existing proposals to tighten EPC minimum standards are accelerated, bringing forward the compliance date for Buy-to-Let, Social Housing, and Commercial Real Estate buildings to be at EPC C or above.\n\n## Scenario impact (Illustrative only)\n\n+\n\n-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stage 2:\n\na) As the economy moves past peak recession, large parts of it start to consider how it can build back greener. Under continued behavioural pressure from consumers and investors, largescale plans for transitioning to a more sustainable business model occur where possible.\n\nThe return of capital on these plans and the associated delay to recovery leads to a slight prolonging of the stress, but the creation of a transition plan leads to confidence in financial markets by investors.\n\nb) Additional policies in the UK and US are accelerated or announced. For example, the Government will rapidly increase the investment and deployment of EV charging infrastructure to support faster transition in the automotive sector.\n\n## Stage 3:\n\na) The EU and UK governments ramp up their existing emissions trading schemes to achieve 1.5C, with a carbon price shock increasing $150/ tCO2 within 12 months from 2026 and continuously increasing. This dampens economic recovery and leads to prolonged higher inflation as production costs are higher due to increased energy costs. However, to some extent, this is offset by both public and private investment to enable faster transition. b) Introduction of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms, resulting in supply-side shocks, a reduction in exports, and other trading frictions.",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\n## Resilience of our strategy (continued)\n\n## TCFD Strategy Recommendation (c)\n\nThe scenario will have significant impacts on Barclays, including:\n\n- 1) Amplified market shocks: additional to existing macroeconomic shocks, there will be further equity and credit shocks for brown industries and financiers, as a result of immediate repricing.\n- 2) Amplified credit deterioration: additional credit risk on brown industries as a result of lower earnings expectations and refinancing risks.\n- 3) Increase in frequency of physical risk events: throughout the time horizon, there is an increase in the occurrence of physical hazards such as flood, hurricanes and droughts.\n\nFollowing the above narrative, scenario variables are provided with varying levels of granularity. For example, global variables - notably demand in climate-sensitive sectors such as Energy, Power and Automotive - national variables - including unemployment rates, GDP, HPI, CPI, government legislation on EPC with further distinction between commercial and residential real estate - and property level variables, including subsidence and flood. Calibration is guided by the narrative with consideration for compounding effects of existing economic downturn and climate stresses, informing the shape and magnitude of variable calibration over the scenario horizon.\n\nMaterial technological development has not been assumed within the economic projections, given the immediate and short time horizon of the scenario. Variables are leveraged to assess impacts on Credit Risk, Market Risk,\n\nCounterparty Credit Risk, Underwriting, Nontraded Market Risk, Income and Balance Sheet, Expenses, Pension, Liquidity, and Capital across Barclays - with a focus on UK, US, and EU regions.\n\n## Results and insights\n\nOverall, losses are comparable with those seen in H1, also representing a c.10% drag on profits. While losses are significant, they remain manageable within the Bank's existing risk profile.\n\nWithin Barclays International, losses were driven mostly by companies operating in heavily emission-intensive industries due to rising carbon prices over the scenario, or those within sectors where demand for products and services rapidly fall due to consumer behaviour shifts or wider decarbonisation of the economy. In addition, market pressures and government policies on low-energy-efficiency Commercial Real Estate leads to deterioration in these markets both in the UK and US.\n\nIn addition, rising unemployment rates across Barclays' major operating geographies cause negative impacts on consumer affordability through the loss of jobs and a weakened macroeconomic environment. Nevertheless, Barclays remains resilient to these additional losses, and current risk management mitigates these macroeconomic drivers.\n\nRetail and SME segment is impacted by higher frequency of acute events with real estate and agricultural assets susceptible to physical risks such as drought and flood. Despite this, the portfolios remain resilient due to availability of household insurance and the strong loan-tovalue profile of the lending. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to severely constrained household insurance availability, with Barclays remaining resilient, albeit noting small populations would be impacted significantly.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\nWe will continue to refine and adapt our insurance assumptions to reflect ongoing changes in market expectations. In addition, while transition policies on emissions reduction and energy efficiency improvements do yield greater impacts, especially as customers begin to price energy performance more explicitly in their decisions, the resultant drag on annual profits remains manageable.\n\nWe acknowledge, however, that further advances in modelling capability and data availability are needed to fully understand the extent of these losses, given high uncertainty in climate scenario analysis. For example, the scenario does not capture compounding and interaction effects between physical and transition risks that could potentially amplify such loss.\n\nAs such, Barclays' annual climate stress-testing cycle is in place to address these uncertainties, by testing our business resilience under different climate scenarios and continuously refining our climate methodologies.\n\n## 2023 Enhancements and beyond\n\nDuring 2023 Barclays made several key enhancements across climate scenario development, climate risk modelling, and the ways we embed climate learnings into our risk management.\n\n- \u00b7 Climate scenarios are designed and developed with our internal specialist scenario expansion team, leveraging the tools and approaches of the existing scenario expansion processes and supplementing these with specific climate analysis. This ensures consistency in climate scenario design alongside existing regulatory internal scenarios, as well as detailed and granular climate scenario expansion.\n\n- \u00b7 Climate risk models are developed according to Barclays' Climate Credit Risk Adjustment Framework, such that model execution across our suite of climate models follows a consistent process - adhering to defined principles and integrated strategically with our existing model suite whilst still having the flexibility to include portfolio-specific constraints and characteristics. Although for stress-testing purposes Barclays' focus remains on five-year scenarios aligned with our usual planning horizon, models in development are designed to enable assessment of longer horizons - 10 years or longer - should we decide to explore these in the future.\n\n## Climate Credit Risk Adjustment Framework\n\nFurther design and piloting of Barclays' climate risk model methodology is underway, focusing on integrating new climate modelling techniques into the Bank's existing financial analysis processes. The target state is a flexible and adaptable process that can support various modelling techniques and allow us to test a wide range of possible future scenarios. Estimates of incremental credit risk spreads will be integrated with Capital, Impairment and Stress Testing Models to quantify climate risk.\n\n## Residential Real Estate\n\nWe have continued to improve our understanding of how physical and transition risks could impact our Mortgages portfolio in the UK, reflecting on learnings in previous scenario analysis exercises such as the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario, engaging with specialist data providers, and undertaking quantitative analysis of the impacts of climate risks.",

The schematic below outlines the Climate Mortgage model.\n\nThe impact of climate physical and transition drivers at a customer level are assessed, yielding probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) spreads that are fed downstream into our existing stress-testing models.\n\nThe Residential Real Estate Model will act as a pilot implementation for the Climate Credit Risk Adjustment Framework. Over time, we intend to incorporate additional climate risk drivers such as coastal flooding and storm damage, and refine modelling of customer behaviour in this market as the evidence on how customers respond to climate-related risks becomes apparent.\n\nFinancial\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n## Corporates\n\nThe Barclays Corporate Transition Forecast Model was first published in 2021. We will be doing further work during 2024 to update and enhance this model. Enhancements will include improving geographical granularity by leveraging asset-level data, incorporating sub-sector specific drivers, considering interaction of physical and transition risks as one, and addressing the known enhancements as published in 2021.\n\nFurther details on The Barclays Corporate Transition\n\n+\n\nForecast can be found at:\n\nhome.barclays/content/dam/\n\nhome-barclays/documents/citizenship/ESG/2021/Corporate-\n\nTransition-Forecast-Model-2021.pdf\n\n## Challenges and limitations\n\nHaving undertaken a number of climate scenario analysis exercises, Barclays has gained a greater understanding of the challenges and nuances of climate modelling and continues to develop new and enhance existing tools for scenario analysis and stress-testing.\n\n## Data\n\nThere exist inherent challenges in climate modelling due to limitations in data quality and availability, given the short history of climate assessments within the financial services industry.\n\n- \u00b7 Data coverage is often lacking, where a subset of assets may not have the appropriate information publicly disclosed. Climate scenario risk analysis requires approaches and tools that are more granular (e.g. focus on company-level analysis), which differs from more traditional stress-testing exercises conducted at portfolio or sector level. This creates a need for more granular data that Barclays may not typically have maintained\n\n- \u00b7 While high data granularity is desirable to model client specific features, the balances between high data granularity and the additional insights provided must be investigated to assess the appropriate level of modelling\n- \u00b7 Data coherence issues may present inconsistencies in modelling. Emissions data is often one-year lagged, thus where the latest quarter/year financials are available, the emissions data may not be reflective of the company's operations, especially where there has been substantial growth or decline, mergers and acquisitions or other special activities.\n\n## Scenario\n\nThere exist inherent uncertainties with scenario design largely attributed to limited history of the interactions between climate risks and the economy.\n\n- \u00b7 Timing and interactions of physical and transition risks can greatly impact the Bank's assessment of capital adequacy and resilience. Assumptions around such compounding effects, while nuanced, are critical to our loss assessment and subsequently risk management processes and business strategy\n- \u00b7 There is a significant level of uncertainty with climate stress-testing projections in (i) how the scenario will manifest; (ii) how customers and clients will react; and (iii) the final loss quantification\n- \u00b7 An understanding of compounding risks and feedback loops between financial systems, the economy, and climate risks remains a challenge, given the lack of historical precedent of such interactions. Over longer time horizons, it becomes increasingly difficult to capture the range of second-order effects as physical and transition risks evolve, assess the rate in which risks manifest or subside, or identify inflection points.",

The absence of clearly defined milestones for full decarbonisation at a national level introduces ambiguity over the channelling of financial resources to ensure an orderly and just transition\n- \u00b7 Optimising carbon-pricing mechanisms: A comprehensive carbon-pricing scheme is a key lever to address the current market failure of externalities from GHGs emissions. The UK and EU announcements for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will go some way to addressing this dependency. However, IMF research\u00b9 shows prices (avg $6/ tCO2) are currently insufficient to achieve 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C targets\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/07/21/blog-more-countriesare-pricing-carbon-but-emissions-are-still-too-cheap\n- \u00b7 Enhancing attractiveness of technological innovations for lenders: A key commercial constraint on the scalability of climate technologies is access to cost-competitive capital. Improving risk-adjusted returns is required to incentivise private financial flows towards nascent technologies and developing nations - essential to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Blended finance mechanisms have potential to unlock large quantities of private investment when both public and philanthropic funds provide first loss tranches. The subsequent adjusted risk-return profiles can make previously high-risk investments marketable\n\n+\n\nBarclays is committed to scaling climate solutions through our Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio, with a mandate to invest up to \u00a3500m in global climate tech start-ups by the end of 2027. For further information see page 117.\n\nFinancial\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n- \u00b7 Addressing sector-specific challenges: Myriad sector-specific challenges persist. This year a backlog of grid connectivity requests for new renewable power projects highlighted the complexity of a transition to net zero. Delays to approval for low-carbon projects impacts investor confidence, slowing the transition\n\n+\n\n- For more information on sector-specific challenges and dependencies, see BlueTrack TM sector pages 92 to 99.\n- \u00b7 Cultivating consumer confidence and investment incentives: Increased confidence in the multi-faceted and potential financial benefits of decarbonisation among society would help spur action. Clear messaging and incentives for households and businesses to generate tangible returns on investment in low-carbon products is critical for driving the transition towards net zero, particularly in sectors reliant on consumer behaviour such as Housing and Agriculture\n- \u00b7 Improving access to sustainability-related risk and impacts data: Accurate assessments of client data, including Scope 3 emissions, is needed to enable a data-driven approach required to mitigate non-financial risks and plot the path to net zero. The evolving nature of corporate and financial sector reporting, and the persistent challenges stemming from data gaps, can hinder progress towards these goals\n\n+\n\n- Barclays remains engaged in the development of mechanisms to bridge these gaps, highlighted by our work with the Transition Plan Taskforce to set out transition plan disclosure guidance. For further details see page 61 .\n\n## \u00b7 Global harmonisation of regulation:\n\nTo date, an increasing number of countries and territories have some degree of mandatory ESG disclosure. Non-financial regulatory requirements are necessary for investors to accurately assess climate-related risks - however, major jurisdictions risk hindering the transition through regulatory fragmentation. As a bank with a global presence, interoperability of regulatory frameworks is essential to enable focused progress towards net zero.\n\nIn addition to the risks arising from our clients' and suppliers' transitions, we are also dependent on wider market and geopolitical developments outside our control. For example, progress may be impacted by geopolitical developments that result in energy supply pressures or the varying pathways individual companies take to transition.",

Disclosure expectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast moving, and differ from more traditional areas of reporting including in relation to the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts on the environment and other persons. We have adapted our approach in relation to the disclosure of such matters. Our climate and sustainability disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, which may include evolving stakeholder views, the development of our climate strategy, longer timeframes for assessing potential risks and impacts, international long-term climate- and nature-based policy goals and evolving sustainability-related policy frameworks. Our climate and sustainability disclosures are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects, given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness - the use of estimates, judgements and assumptions which are likely to change over time, the application and development of data, models, scenarios and methodologies, the change in regulatory landscape, and variations in reporting standards.\n\nThese factors mean disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability develops, and could cause actual achievements, results, performance or other future events or conditions to differ, in some cases materially, from those stated, implied and/or reflected in any forward-looking statements or metrics included in our climate and sustainability disclosures. We give no assurance as to the likelihood of the achievement or reasonableness of any projections, estimates, forecasts, targets, commitments, ambitions, prospects or returns contained in our climate and sustainability disclosures and make no commitment to revise or update any such disclosures to reflect events or circumstances occurring or existing after the date of such statements.\n\n## Disclaimers\n\nIn preparing the climate and sustainability content within the Barclays PLC Annual Report wherever it appears, we have:\n\n- \u00b7 Made certain key judgements, estimations and assumptions. This is, for example, the case in relation to financed emissions, portfolio alignment, classification of environmental and social financing, operational emissions and sustainability metrics, measurement of climate risk and scenario analysis\n\nFinancial\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n- \u00b7 Used climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies we consider to be appropriate and suitable for these purposes as at the date on which they were deployed. This includes data, models, scenarios and methodologies made available by third parties (over which we have no control) and which may have been prepared using a range of different methodologies, or where the basis of preparation may not be known to us. Methodologies, interpretations or assumptions may not be capable of being independently verified and may therefore be inaccurate. Climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies are subject to future risks and uncertainties and may change over time. Climate and sustainability disclosures in this document, including climate and sustainability-related data, models and methodologies, are not of the same standard as those available in the context of other financial information and use a greater number and level of judgements, assumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification of climate and sustainable financing activities. Climate and sustainability disclosures are also not subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. Historical data cannot be relied on as a strong indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, processed data, scenario analysis and the application of methodologies will also be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess, or challenges in accessing data on a timely basis\n- \u00b7 Continued (and will continue) to review and develop our approach to data, models, scenarios and methodologies in line with market principles and standards as this subject area matures. The data, models, scenarios and methodologies used (including those made available by third parties) and the judgements, estimates and/or assumptions made in them or by us are rapidly evolving, and this may directly or indirectly affect the metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in the climate and sustainability content within the Annual Report. Further, changes in external factors which are outside of our control such as accounting and/or reporting standards, improvements in data quality, data availability, or updates to methodologies and models and/ or updates or restatements of data by third parties, could impact - potentially materially the performance metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in the climate and sustainability content within the Annual Report. In future reports we may present some or all of the information for this reporting period (including information made available by third parties) using updated or more granular data or improved models, scenarios methodologies, market practices or standards. Equally, we may need to rebaseline, restate, revise, recalculate or recalibrate performance against targets, convergence points or milestones on the basis of such updated data.",

Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance, and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue', 'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but may also be made verbally by directors, officers and employees of the Group, including during management presentations, in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group's future financial position, business strategy, income levels, costs, assets and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios,\n\ncapital distributions - including policy on dividends and share buybacks - return on tangible equity, projected levels of growth in banking and financial markets, industry trends, any commitments and targets - including ESG commitments and targets - plans and objectives for future operations, and other statements that are not historical or current facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. Forward-looking statements speak only as at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking statements may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation: changes in legislation; regulations, governmental and regulatory policies, expectations and actions, voluntary codes of practices, and the interpretation thereof; changes in International Financial Reporting Standards and other accounting standards, including practices with regard to the interpretation and application thereof and emerging and developing ESG reporting standards; the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; the Group's ability along with governments and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; environmental, social\n\nand geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\nand similar events beyond the Group's control; the impact of competition in the banking and financial services industry; capital, liquidity, leverage and other regulatory rules and requirements applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions, including inflation; volatility in credit and capital markets; market-related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; higher or lower asset valuations; changes in credit ratings of any entity within the Group or any securities issued by it; changes in counterparty risk; changes in consumer behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on European and global macroeconomic conditions, political stability and financial markets; political elections; developments in the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU); the risk of cyberattacks, information or security breaches, technology failures or other operational disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the Group's reputation, business or operations; the Group's ability to access funding; and the success of acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions. A number of these factors are beyond the Group's control.\n\nAs a result, the Group's actual financial position, results, financial and non-financial metrics or performance measures or its ability to meet commitments and targets may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in the Group's forward-looking statements. In setting its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, Barclays has made certain assumptions about the macro-economic environment, including, without limitation, inflation, interest and unemployment rates, the different markets and competitive conditions in which Barclays operates, and its ability to grow certain businesses and achieve costs savings and other structural actions. Additional risks and factors that may impact the Group's future financial condition and performance are identified in the description of material existing and emerging risks beginning on page 258 of this Annual Report.\n\nSubject to Barclays PLC's obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction - including, without limitation, the UK and the US - in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.",

We think of governance as how the Board makes decisions and provides oversight to promote Barclays' success for the long-term sustainable benefit of our shareholders, having regard to the interests of our stakeholders (including our clients, customers, colleagues and the society and wider environment in which we operate).\n\nOur Group-wide governance framework is constructed to:\n\n- \u00b7 facilitate the effective management of the Group by our Group Chief Executive and his ExCo across our diverse businesses\n- \u00b7 support and provide oversight and constructive challenge of the Group's major subsidiary boards in the UK, Ireland and the US, consistent with the legal, regulatory and independence requirements applicable to those entities.\n\nGenerally, there is one set of rules for the Group. Group-wide frameworks, policies and standards are adopted throughout the Group unless local laws or regulations (for example, the ring-fencing obligations applicable to BBUKPLC) require otherwise, or ExCo deems that it would otherwise be appropriate in a specific instance.\n\n## Corporate Governance Operating Manual\n\nOur Corporate Governance Operating Manual outlines how the Group's significant subsidiaries (and their respective boards and board committees) should interact with each other. It also provides guidance and clarity for management and Directors as to how these relationships and processes should work in practice. This is a dynamic document that evolves with the changing nature of the Group.\n\n## The role of the Board\n\nThe BPLC Board sets the Purpose, strategic direction and risk appetite for the Group and is the ultimate decision-making body for matters of Group-wide strategic, financial, regulatory or reputational significance.\n\nWe partially consolidated and streamlined the membership of the BPLC and BBPLC Boards in 2019, to improve efficiency and co-ordination while reducing complexity and unnecessary duplication.\n\nAs a result, membership of the BBPLC Board is a subset of the BPLC Board. All members of the BPLC Board (except the Senior Independent Director, Chair of BBUKPLC and at least one other NonExecutive Director) also serve on the Board of BBPLC.\n\nWe believe that having members of the BPLC Board serving as the Chairs of some of the Group's main subsidiaries supports improved efficiency, escalation and coordination while ensuring an appropriate focus is given to matters relevant to each entity.",

Those matters include material decisions relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 strategy\n- \u00b7 risk appetite\n- \u00b7 medium term plans\n- \u00b7 capital and liquidity plans\n- \u00b7 risk management and controls frameworks\n- \u00b7 approval of financial statements\n- \u00b7 approval of large transactions\n- \u00b7 approval of share allotments, dividends and share buybacks.\n\nResponsibility for the Group's business on a day-to-day basis has been delegated by the Board to the Group Chief Executive, supported by his ExCo, to make and implement operational decisions.\n\n## Information provided to the Board\n\nThe Group Chairman is responsible for setting the Board's agenda, primarily focused on strategy, performance, value creation, culture, stakeholders and accountability. The Chairman also ensures that Board members receive timely and high-quality information to enable them to make sound decisions and promote the success of BPLC.\n\nThe Group Company Secretary, working in collaboration with the Group Chairman, is responsible for ensuring good governance and information flow, to support the Board's effectiveness. In 2023, we continued to strive for balanced papers which clearly identify substantive issues and key points for the Board's attention, continuing the momentum created in previous years.\n\nThe Board is kept informed of key business developments throughout the year through regular updates from the Executive Directors and senior management, in addition to the presentations delivered to the Board and the Board Committees as part of formal meetings.\n\n+\n\nDetails of key Board activities for 2023 are set out on pages 153 to 155.\n\nDirectors are able to seek independent and professional advice at Barclays' expense, where required, to enable them to fulfil their obligations to the Board.\n\n## Attendance at Board meetings\n\nDirectors are expected to attend every Board meeting. Where a Director is not able to attend a Board meeting, the relevant Director's views are made known to the Group Chairman in advance of the meeting. The Chairman also meets privately, on a regular basis, with each Non-Executive Director.\n\n+\n\nDetails of Director attendance at Board meetings in 2023 are shown on the next page.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board is supported in its work by its Committees - the Board Nominations Committee, Board Audit Committee, Board Risk Committee, Board\n\nRemuneration Committee and the Board Sustainability Committee - each of which has its own terms of reference clearly setting out its remit and decision-making powers. This structure enables the Board to spend a significant proportion of its time focusing on the Group's strategy.\n\nThe Board Committees are comprised solely of Non-Executive Directors, with the exception of the Board Sustainability Committee of which the Group Chief Executive is an Executive member.\n\nThe Chairs of each Committee report on their Committee's work at every scheduled Board meeting.\n\n## Board effectiveness\n\nThe effectiveness of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors are assessed on an annual basis. We carried out an internally facilitated effectiveness review for 2023, which was led by the SID and supported by the Group Company Secretary. In line with the requirements of the Code, we intend to conduct an externally-facilitated review of the Board, Board Committees and individual Directors in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can read more about the 2023 effectiveness review, and progress against recommendations from the 2022 review, in the Board Nominations Committee report on page 164.",

You can read about how the Board has taken into account stakeholder interests in our Section 172(1) statement in the Strategic report from page 38.\n\nWithin the overarching consideration of Group strategy matters, the Board continued to give significant consideration to our climate and sustainability strategy. Given the importance of the work to address the climate challenge, the Board approved the establishment of the Board Sustainability Committee in March 2023. The Board Sustainability Committee supports the Board's oversight of the Group's climate strategy and sustainability agenda, including our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050. Please see the Board Sustainability Committee report on page 180 for further detail.\n\nYou can read more about the key areas of Board focus in 2023 in the rest of this section.\n\n## Spotlight\n\n## Board engagement with colleagues\n\nThe Board strongly believes in the importance of engaging with our stakeholders and hearing their views, which brings valuable outside perspectives to the Board. In particular, the Board recognises that our colleagues are critical to our success. Ensuring that Board members have an opportunity to engage directly with colleagues is an important part of our method of workforce engagement and helps the Board take the issues of interest to our colleagues into account in its decision-making. During 2023, Board engagement with colleagues included:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group Chairman and Mary Francis visited our contact centre in Wavertree, Liverpool, to experience the Consumer Duty 'in action', meeting with customer-facing colleagues and learning about how Barclays is addressing vulnerable customer needs.\n- \u00b7 The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director hosted quarterly all-colleague town halls on Barclays' financial performance.\n\n- \u00b7 Robert Berry and Sir John Kingman visited Barclays branches in London where they met colleagues.\n- \u00b7 The Group Chief Executive hosted the Citizenship and Diversity Awards to celebrate colleagues who have made a positive impact in their communities and have helped to strengthen the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) culture within Barclays.\n- \u00b7 Julia Wilson participated in a celebration event to congratulate newly promoted Managing Directors from across the Group.\n- \u00b7 The Group Chairman, along with other Board members, visited the new trading floors at our head office in London, meeting colleagues in the Markets business and experiencing the trading floors first-hand.\n- \u00b7 Board members spent time with Barclays UK colleagues based in the UK and India.\n- \u00b7 The Group Finance Director met colleagues during visits to our New York, Glasgow and Northampton Campuses, and hosted other colleague events including an event to mark International Women's Day.",

Board and Board Committee changes are set out in the table on the previous page of this report.\n\nThe Board considers that these changes have enhanced the effectiveness of the Board and relevant Committees, providing valuable input and support to their work as well as bringing new and diverse perspectives to discussions.\n\nWe continued to strengthen the composition of the Board with the addition of two Non-Executive Directors in 2023. Marc Moses, appointed with effect from 23 January 2023, brings to the Board a strong technical finance background and extensive knowledge of banking and financial services. Sir John Kingman has a deep background in financial services, gained from his executive and nonexecutive career, and joined as a NonExecutive Director with effect from 1 June 2023, upon taking up his role as Chair of BBUKPLC.\n\nMike Ashley retired from the Board at the conclusion of our AGM on 3 May 2023 and Crawford Gillies retired shortly thereafter on 31 May 2023, each having served on the Board for around nine years.

As part of this, the Committee takes into account the need for the Board to be small enough to operate in an efficient and collaborative manner yet large enough to ensure an appropriate mix of skills and diversity, to support succession planning and to accommodate the additional roles and responsibilities of some of our Directors on Board Committees, and on the Boards of BBPLC, BBUKPLC, Barclays Europe, Barclays US LLC and BX.\n\nThe Committee considers that the size of the Board contributes to its effectiveness.\n\n## Industry and leadership experience\u00b2\n\n(number of Directors)\n\nMarketing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Please refer to the section entitled 'Succession' later in this report in relation to Tim Breedon's tenure and continued independence.\n- 2 Individual Directors may fall into one or more categories.\n- 3 International experience is based on the location of the headquarters/registered office of a company.",

Data relating to the gender and ethnic diversity of executive management (as defined) was sourced from this existing data, which is held within Barclays' secure HR system.\n\n## Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy\n\nOn the recommendation of the Committee, the Board adopted a revised version of the Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy on 8 February 2024.\n\nThe policy confirms the Board is supportive of the Group's culture in which Barclays is committed to continuing to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace, and that the Board recognises the benefits of a diverse, equitable and inclusive Board, reflective of the communities in which we operate, in driving effective decision-making.\n\n## Gender diversity reporting as at 31 December 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 In accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules and for the purposes of this table only, 'executive management' comprises the Group Executive Committee and the Group Company Secretary.\n\n## Ethnic diversity reporting as at 31 December 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                 | Board members   | Board members   | Number of senior                                  | Executive management 1   | Executive management 1   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                                 | Number          | Percentage      | positions on the Board  (CEO, CFO, SID and Chair) | Number                   | Percentage               |\n| White British or other White  (including minority-white groups) | 10              | 77%             | 3 (75%)                                           | 9                        | 75%                      |\n| Mixed/Multiple Ethnic Groups                                    |                 |                 |                                                   |                          |                          |\n| Asian/British Asian                                             | 1               | 8%              | 1 (25%)                                           | 3                        | 25%                      |\n| Black/African/Caribbean/ Black British                          |                 |                 |                                                   |                          |                          |\n| Other ethnic group, including  Arab                             | 2               | 15%             |                                                   |                          |                          |\n| Not specified/prefer not to say                                 |                 |                 |                                                   |                          |                          |\n\n- 1 In accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules and for the purposes of this table only, 'executive management' comprises the Group Executive Committee and the Group Company Secretary.\n\nIt confirms Barclays' commitment to ensuring that Board appointments and succession plans are based on merit and objective criteria, recognising the benefits that diversity, in all its forms, brings to the Board, and that due regard will be also given to diversity and inclusion characteristics when considering Board Committee appointments.\n\nThe policy sets out the Board's existing gender and ethnic diversity targets detailed in the table on the following page, which are aligned with the targets recommended by the FTSE Women Leaders Review on gender diversity and the Parker Review Committee Report into Ethnic Diversity of UK Boards, which are reflected in the Listing Rules.",

While this fell short of the 40% target set out in the Listing Rules, FTSE Women Leaders Review and our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy, the Board satisfied the target of having at least one woman in a senior Board role.\n\nAs we reported in our 2022 Annual Report and as set out in our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy (as described above), the Committee and the Board remain committed to ensuring that all Board appointments and succession plans are based on merit and objective criteria, with due regard given to diversity, and focused on meeting our gender diversity targets as set out in our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy by 2025 while continuing to bring the very best, diverse talent we can attract to the Board. You can read more about the Board appointment process and succession planning in the sections that follow.\n\nWe also recognise and embrace the benefits of diversity at Board Committee level. As at 31 December 2023, Board Committee gender diversity was as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Board Nominations Committee - 40% women\n- \u00b7 Board Audit Committee - 50% women\n- \u00b7 Board Risk Committee - 43% women\n- \u00b7 Board Sustainability Committee - 43% women\n- \u00b7 Board Remuneration Committee - 60% women\n\n## Gender diversity within ExCo, ExCo direct reports and the wider workforce\n\nGroup-wide, Barclays remains committed to its DEI vision and strategy, which was refreshed in 2022, and includes a series of principles and strategic priorities designed to support Barclays make progress against the six DEI agendas including its Gender Ambition, which is focused on improving gender diversity in senior leadership across Barclays.\n\nThe Board received an update during the year on Barclays' DEI ambitions, including a focus on the Gender Ambition, as described in the Key Board activities section on page 153.\n\nIn 2022, Barclays announced its refreshed Gender Ambition of 33% representation of women in senior leadership roles Managing Directors and Directors - by the end of 2025, having achieved its initial target of 28% representation of women in these roles by the end of 2021.\n\nTo achieve this ambition, Barclays focuses on the retention, development, progression and hiring of diverse talent at all levels. Regular reporting on progress against ambitions is shared with senior management. As at 31 December 2023, representation of women among Managing Directors and Directors was at 30% \u0394 globally, and Barclays is focused on continuing its efforts to identify diverse talent in the market and develop existing diverse talent within Barclays.\n\nThe Committee is also mindful of the voluntary target recommended by the FTSE Women Leaders Review of 40% representation of women for ExCo and their direct reports by the end of 2025.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, representation of women among ExCo and their direct reports stood at 27% \u0394 , remaining level with the 2022 year end position.\n\nWhile this fell short of the FTSE Women Leaders Review recommendation, increasing gender diversity within both ExCo and their direct reports, to ensure a diverse pipeline for ExCo succession, remains a key priority for Barclays and the Committee.\n\nIn 2023, Barclays continued to have one ex-officio position on ExCo, with each appointee serving for a four-month rotation. This initiative, first introduced in 2016, broadens the scope of perspectives and contributions made to ExCo, while also providing appointees with exposure to matters of Group-wide significance and further leadership experience. In 2023, all three holders of this position were women.\n\nThere are additional initiatives and actions being taken across our businesses to further strengthen the senior leadership pipeline; these include using the ex officio position at business unit executive committees, sponsorship programmes to support individual development and working with senior recruitment partners to strengthen our external pipeline.\n\n## Note\n\n- \u0394   2023 data subject to independent Limited Assurance under ISAE(UK)3000 and ISAE3410.

Venkat, our Group Chief Executive, has made a significant contribution to Barclays' diversity agenda. Having achieved our Race at Work ambition to double the number of Black Managing Directors globally from nine to 18 by 2022, in January 2023, we set a new ambition to increase the population of Managing Directors from underrepresented ethnicities by at least 50% by the end of 2025.\n\nYou can find more information on Barclays' continued commitment to its Multicultural agenda, including information regarding our ethnic minority percentage target for ExCo and their direct reports and data relating to ethnic diversity in Barclays' wider workforce, in our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion report, which will be available on our website later in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can read more about Barclays' approach to DEI within the Colleagues section in the Strategic report from page 27.\n\nYou can find a copy of our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy at home.barclays/who-we-are/ our-governance/our-framework-code-and-rules\n\n## Process for appointments\n\nThe Committee leads the process for Board appointments, ensuring that all appointments are based on merit and objective criteria - focusing on the skills, experience and knowledge required for the Board's effectiveness and to support the continued delivery of the Group's strategy - while also promoting diversity of background and opinion.\n\nAppointments to the Board are made following a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure, facilitated by the Committee with the aid of external search consultancy firms, as outlined in further detail below.\n\n## Non-Executive Director recruitment\n\nThe Committee regularly reviews and updates a series of skills-based NonExecutive Director recruitment priorities. These priorities underpin the searches required for the Board to ensure orderly succession as Non-Executive Directors approach the end of their tenure and to ensure an optimum balance of skills and experience on the Board.\n\nThe Committee considered and refreshed the priorities in 2023, in light of NonExecutive Director recruitment activity, including the appointments of Marc Moses and Sir John Kingman during 2023 and two Non-Executive Directors having stepped down from the Board in 2023 at the end of their tenure. The Committee has agreed that all Board members should have the opportunity to meet leading candidates, and that diversity should remain a priority in all searches.\n\nBased on the agreed priorities, the Committee has set rigorous criteria for the roles it is seeking to fill, both in terms of experience and personal qualities. Independent search firms Spencer Stuart and Egon Zehnder supported our targeted external mapping and search processes for additional Non-Executive Directors to complement the range of skills on the Board in 2023, based on the agreed criteria. Diversity of background and experience remain at the forefront of those searches.\n\nSpencer Stuart and Egon Zehnder do not have any connection to Barclays or any of the Directors other than to assist with searches for executive and non-executive\n\ntalent. Open advertising for Board positions was not used in 2023.\n\nThe Committee will continue to review the Board's recruitment priorities and give further consideration to the desired skills and experience for potential candidates, to ensure that due consideration continues to be given to strong potential candidates who would enhance the effectiveness of the Board.\n\n## Non-Executive Director independence\n\nIn line with the requirements of the Code, a majority of our Board comprises independent Non-Executive Directors. The independence of our Non-Executive Directors is considered by the Committee on an annual basis, having regard to the independence criteria set out in the Code. As part of this process, the Committee reviews the length of tenure of all Directors, which can affect independence, and makes any recommendations to the Board accordingly.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the independence of all Non-Executive Directors serving on the Board as at 31 December 2023. The independence of those who had served on the Board for more than six years (Diane Schueneman and Mary Francis) and more than nine years (Tim Breedon) was subject to a more rigorous review. The Committee remains satisfied that the length of their tenure has no impact on their respective levels of independence or the effectiveness of their contributions. The Committee and the Board consider all of the Non-Executive Directors to be independent.\n\nFor further details of the Committee's review of the independence of Tim Breedon, please refer to the Succession section below.\n\nDuring 2023, Mike Ashley and Crawford Gillies stepped down from the Board. Mike and Crawford did not raise any concerns about the operation of the Board or management.",

Expected time commitments are agreed with each Non-Executive Director on an individual basis, and include time to understand the business and complete training as well as time to attend and prepare for formal Board and Board Committee meetings. In considering whether a Director has sufficient time to commit to their role, the Committee has regard to regulatory and Code requirements, as well as key investor and proxy advisor guidelines. Details of the external executive and non-executive directorships held within listed companies for each of the Directors are set out in the table on this page. You can find details of other principal appointments for each Director in the Board of Directors section\n\nfrom page 145.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the existing commitments disclosed by each of Marc Moses and Sir John Kingman ahead of their respective appointments to the Board, and was comfortable that these would not impact their ability to devote such time as is necessary to discharge their duties to Barclays effectively.\n\nBefore accepting any significant new commitment outside of Barclays, all Directors must seek approval from the Board (providing an indication of expected time commitment). Prior to approving any significant new external commitment for a Director, the Board reviews all relevant facts and circumstances (including the expected role and time commitment, as well as the nature of the external organisation).\n\n## Barclays PLC Board - Listed company external directorships 1\n\nAs at 31 December 2023\n\n| Director             | Executive   | Non-Executive   | Non-Executive Chair   | Total   |\n|----------------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------------|---------|\n| Nigel Higgins        |             |                 |                       | None    |\n| C.S.

In early 2024, the Committee undertook a rigorous assessment of Tim's continued independence, as it had done in the two previous years. Following careful consideration, the Committee concluded that it remained appropriate for Tim to continue to serve on the Board beyond his 11-year tenure.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Committee recognises the significant value that Tim continues to bring to Board discussions, particularly given his breadth of financial services sector experience and deep knowledge of risk and regulatory issues.\n\nBoth the Committee and the Board continue to believe that it is advantageous for Group-wide decision-making to have the Chairs of the Group's significant subsidiaries sit on the BPLC Board, considering that this provides connectivity with the Group's significant subsidiaries, bringing with it important insight into Board discussions. With these factors in mind, and in light of Tim's ongoing role as Chair of Barclays Europe, the Group's principal European subsidiary, the Committee and the Board consider it is appropriate for Tim to continue as an independent NonExecutive Director on the BPLC Board in the near-term.\n\nGiven the Board's preference for the Chairs of the Group's significant subsidiaries to also be represented on the Board, in light of Tim's tenure, the Committee is giving due consideration to potential successors for his roles on the Board and as Chair of Barclays Europe.\n\nDiane Schueneman will have been on the Board for nine years in June 2024, and the Committee is also giving due consideration to potential successors for her roles on the BPLC Board and as Chair of BX.\n\n## Tenure\n\nThe Committee and the Board consider that length of tenure is only one of the factors to be considered with respect to Director independence, and accordingly, that tenure alone should not result in a loss of independence. The Committee and the Board are confident that Tim remains independent and continues to provide effective challenge, advice and support to management on business performance and decision-making. Having undertaken a rigorous review of Tim's performance as a Non-Executive Director and taking into account other relevant factors that might be considered likely to impair, or could appear to impair, his independence including as set out in Provision 10 of the Code, the Committee and the Board consider Tim to be independent.\n\n## ExCo succession\n\nThe Committee approves all changes to ExCo composition prior to announcement, taking into account executive succession plans.\n\nIn 2023, the Committee received updates regarding succession planning and proposed appointments for ExCo, including in relation to the review of the balance of skills and diversity on ExCo and for key successors. The Committee approved the ExCo changes in 2023, as set out on page 149, prior to implementation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can read more about gender diversity within ExCo and their direct reports in the Diversity section of this Board Nominations Committee report.",

Board members emphasised how this culture is supported by the inclusive style of the Group Chairman and his values-driven approach. The review indicated that Board composition is considered to be a strength, bringing together a range of diverse and complementary backgrounds, including deep financial services expertise. The interaction between the Board and the Board Committees was commented upon favourably, with regular reporting ensuring the Board has good visibility on key areas of focus. The review highlighted the positive relationship between the Board and management, and an appropriate level of support and challenge.\n\n## Recommendations from 2023 review\n\nThe 2023 review outlined the following key recommendations:\n\n- \u00b7 consider how Board agendas might be structured to (i) allow for deeper discussion of business performance; and (ii) create more flexibility for discussion of key topics and reflections within the agenda\n- \u00b7 identify opportunities for more open and wide-ranging discussions on big picture issues\n- \u00b7 continue to focus on ensuring balanced papers which clearly identify substantive points and key issues for the Board's attention\n- \u00b7 continue to identify opportunities to bring external perspectives into the Board.\n\n## 2023 Board Committee effectiveness review\n\nThe Board Committee reviews are an important part of the way Barclays monitors and improves Committee performance and effectiveness, maximising strengths and highlighting areas for further development.\n\nThe results of the 2023 Board Nominations Committee effectiveness review are reported below, and the results of the reviews of the effectiveness of the other Board Committees are reported within their individual reports elsewhere in this Board Governance report.\n\nFollowing consideration of the findings of the 2023 Board Committee effectiveness reviews, the Committee remains satisfied that each of the Board Committees are operating effectively.\n\n## Review of Board Nominations Committee effectiveness\n\nThe results of the 2023 review confirm the Committee is operating effectively. It is considered well constituted and chaired, providing high-quality oversight and constructive challenge to management in the areas within its remit. The review highlights that the Committee is considered to have the right level of skills and experience.\n\nFeedback indicates that the allocation of time between agenda items in Committee meetings is appropriate, with sufficient time for discussion and challenge, and focus on the right areas.\n\nThe Committee's interaction with the Board, Board Committees and senior management is considered effective, noting that sufficient time is allocated at Board meetings for the Chair to report to the Board on the work of the Committee. Feedback indicated that concurrent meetings of the BPLC and BBPLC Board Nominations Committee continue to be effective, with coverage of BBPLC matters within concurrent meetings considered appropriate.\n\nInteraction with the BBUKPLC Board Nominations Committee was also considered effective, confirming that the Committee continues to exercise sufficient oversight of issues relevant to the Committee's remit relating to BBUKPLC.\n\n## Individual Director effectiveness\n\nAll Directors in office at the end of 2023 were subject to an individual effectiveness review. The Group Chairman considered each Director's individual contribution to the Board as well as any feedback received as part of the broader Board and Board Committee effectiveness reviews.\n\nBased on these reviews, the Board accepted the view of the Committee that each Director to be proposed for election or re-election at the 2024 AGM continues to be effective and contributes to Barclays' long-term sustainable success.\n\nAll of the current Directors of the Company intend to submit themselves for election or re-election at the 2024 AGM and will be unanimously recommended by the Board for election or re-election as appropriate.",

We also welcomed Marc Moses to the Committee on 23 January 2023, bringing his strong technical finance background with a deep knowledge of banking and financial services.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee has had a significant focus on management's initiatives to drive sustainable improvements in the Group's internal control environment. Specifically, the Committee received regular updates on the internal control environment from the business heads, Group Chief Internal Auditor, Group Chief Controls Officer and KPMG, identifying any thematic trends which may be arising across the Group and encouraging management to take a proactive approach in identifying areas for enhancement.\n\nThe Committee also maintained close oversight of an internal programme established by the Group Chief Executive at the end of 2022, and led by the Group Chief Operating Officer, to improve senior oversight of the more material regulatory remediation programmes with a view to enhancing controls in order to achieve a consistently excellent operating environment across the Group. This programme operates in parallel with the broader cultural change programme led by our Group Chief Executive, which you can read more about in the Section 172(1) statement in the Strategic report.\n\nThe Committee recognises that maintaining a robust system of internal control is a continuous journey and there will always be programmes in train to ensure that ongoing improvements are made. As part of this, the Committee has been receiving reports on an internal programme to enhance the system\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof risk management and internal control for compliance with laws, rules and regulations. Financial crime controls also continue to be an area of significant focus for the Group and the Committee is closely following management's progress in this area to ensure that the control framework is robust. Previous reports of the Committee also highlighted significant work by management on control remediation and enhancement programmes in relation to trading controls. While that work remains ongoing, the Committee was pleased to see significant progress made during 2023, with key remediation programmes in those areas scheduled to achieve significant milestones or complete during 2024.\n\nTo decide whether any control issues required specific disclosure in this Annual Report, the Committee continued to apply similar concepts to those used for assessing internal control over financial reporting for the purposes of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOx). The Committee is satisfied that there are no control issues which are considered to be a material weakness and which merit specific disclosure.\n\n| Member           | Meetings attended/eligible to attend   |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Julia Wilson     | 12/12                                  |\n| Robert Berry     | 12/12                                  |\n| Marc Moses 2     | 12/12                                  |\n| Diane Schueneman | 8/12                                   |\n| Mike Ashley 3    | 6/6                                    |\n\nIn overseeing the integrity of our financial disclosures, the Committee was mindful that the macroeconomic environment during the year remained challenging with continuing high interest rates, inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainty. The Committee received regular updates from the Group Finance Director and Group Chief Accounting Officer, focusing on key areas including credit impairment and coverage, provisions, valuations and tax. The Committee will continue to closely monitor management's judgements in these areas and their disclosure.\n\nThe Committee works closely with the Board Risk Committee and Board Sustainability Committee, ensuring a streamlined view of matters of relevance across the Committees. The Committee welcomed enhanced reporting by management with the incorporation of operational risk dashboards to provide a more holistic view across the controls and risk space. This is expected to support the effective and efficient consideration by the Board Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee of matters relevant to both committees.",

Best practice and regulation regarding climate and sustainability reporting and related assurance are still evolving, while investor and other stakeholder appetite for information continues to grow, and this is an area to which the Committee will continue to have close regard. Barclays' climate strategy remains a key focus of the Group and the Committee continues to monitor that the impact of climate change has been addressed in preparing the Group's financial statements.\n\nThe independent assurance and challenge provided by both Barclays Internal Audit (BIA) and KPMG as statutory auditor are critical to the Committee's oversight role in relation to internal controls and financial reporting. For this reason, the Committee continues to hold regular separate private sessions with each of the Group Chief Internal Auditor and the lead KPMG audit engagement partner without management present.\n\nThe Committee has oversight of Barclays' whistleblowing programme and I took over the role of Group Whistleblowers' Champion upon my appointment as Committee Chair. During 2023, I met with the FCA and also held regular meetings with the Whistleblowing team to understand their key areas of focus and the Committee continues to receive detailed semi-annual whistleblowing updates.\n\nThroughout the year I also held regular meetings with a number of other colleagues and stakeholders to discuss any material and emerging key issues impacting the Group (including its key subsidiaries) and of relevance to the Committee. This included regular meetings with the Chair of the BBUKPLC Board Audit Committee, the Group Finance Director, Group Chief Internal Auditor and lead KPMG audit partner. As Committee Chair, throughout the year I also engaged regularly with the Group's key regulators, including meeting with representatives of the PRA, FCA and FRBNY.\n\n## Committee effectiveness\n\nThe results of the Committee effectiveness review for 2023 confirm the Committee is operating effectively. It is considered well constituted and chaired, providing an effective and appropriate level of challenge and oversight of the areas within its remit. Feedback recognised the effective transition of the Chair in April 2023. The review highlights that the Committee is considered to have the right level of skills and experience, including recent and relevant financial experience, and is of an appropriate size. Feedback indicates that the Committee is considered to operate at the right level of debate, and confirms that the allocation of time between agenda items in Committee meetings is appropriate, with sufficient time for discussion and challenge.\n\nThe Committee's interaction with the Board, Board Committees and senior management is considered effective, noting that sufficient time is allocated at Board meetings for the Chair to report to the Board on the work of the Committee. Feedback indicated that concurrent meetings of the BPLC and BBPLC Board Audit Committee continue to be effective, with coverage of BBPLC matters within concurrent meetings considered appropriate.\n\nInteraction with the BBUKPLC Board Audit Committee was also considered effective, confirming that the Committee continues to exercise sufficient oversight of issues relevant to the Committee's remit relating to BBUKPLC.\n\nPlease see the report of the Board Nominations Committee for details on the process for conducting the 2023 Committee effectiveness review.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nManagement has made some significant progress on remediation during the course of 2023; maintaining that momentum in 2024 will be a key focus of the Committee.\n\nFinally, after some five years in the role, and having made significant progress in the operation and methodologies used by BIA, Lindsay O'Reilly will be stepping down as Group Chief Internal Auditor during 2024. The Committee will be looking to approve the appointment of a new Group Chief Internal Auditor in the coming months and would like to extend its thanks to Lindsay for her invaluable support, which is continuing through this transition period.\n\n## Julia Wilson\n\nChair, Board Audit Committee 19 February 2024",

Membership of the Committee is designed to provide the breadth of financial expertise and commercial acumen that the\n\nCommittee needs to fulfil its responsibilities. Its members as a whole have recent and relevant experience of the banking and financial services sector, in addition to general management and commercial experience; and are financially literate. Julia Wilson, the Committee Chair, and who is the designated financial expert on the Committee for the purposes of SOx, has significant corporate finance, tax and accounting experience including serving as the Group Finance Director of 3i plc from 2008 to 2022 and as Chair of the board audit committee at Legal & General Group plc.\n\nIn 2023, the Committee met 12 times, with no ad hoc meetings held during the year (2022: 14 times, including four ad hoc meetings). Attendance by members at Committee meetings is shown on page 166.\n\nCommittee meetings were attended by representatives from management, including the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Chief Internal Auditor, Group Chief Controls Officer, Group Chief Risk Officer, Group Chief Operating Officer, Group General Counsel and Group Chief Compliance Officer, as well as representatives from the businesses and other functions, and from BBPLC senior management reflecting the partially consolidated operation of the BPLC and BBPLC Committee meetings. The lead audit engagement partner of KPMG also attended Committee meetings.\n\nThe Board, together with the Committee, is responsible for ensuring the independence and effectiveness of the internal audit function and external auditors. The appointment and removal of the Group Chief Internal Auditor is a matter reserved to the Committee, and the appointment and removal of the external auditor is a matter reserved to the Board based on the recommendation of the Committee. Neither task is delegated to management.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe role of the Committee is to review and monitor, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 the integrity of the Group's financial statements and related announcements\n- \u00b7 the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls\n- \u00b7 the independence and effectiveness of the internal and external audit processes\n- \u00b7 the Group's relationship with the external auditor\n- \u00b7 the effectiveness of the Group's whistleblowing procedures.\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference are available at home.barclays/whowe-are/our-governance/boardcommittees/\n\n## Primary activities\n\nThe Committee discharged its responsibilities in 2023 through monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control environment and internal and external audit processes, as well as the integrity of financial statements and related announcements having regard to the current macroeconomic environment.\n\n| Areas of focus                                                                                              | Role of Committee / Key issues considered                                                                                                          | Conclusion/action taken                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial reporting                                                                                         | Financial reporting                                                                                                                                | Financial reporting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Fair, balanced and  understandable  reporting (including Country- by- Country Reporting and  Modern Slavery | In light of the Board's obligation under the  Code, the Committee assesses external  reporting to ensure it is fair, balanced and  understandable. | In addition to this Annual Report and associated year-end reports, the  Committee also reviewed the Group's half-year and quarterly results  announcements and the presentations to analysts.

Stuart Crisp, Barclays' lead audit engagement partner, has been in the role since 2022 and attends all meetings of the Committee.\n\n## Assessing external auditor effectiveness, objectivity and independence and non-audit services\n\nThe Committee is responsible for assessing the effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the Group's statutory auditor. This responsibility was discharged by the Committee throughout the year at formal meetings, during private meetings with KPMG and through discussions with key Group executives. In particular, the Committee assessed KPMG's effectiveness, objectivity and independence in the following ways:\n\n## Throughout the year\n\n- \u00b7 Met with senior members of the KPMG audit team from the UK, Ireland and US to discuss the approach to the 2023 audit.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed regular reports from management on the nonaudit services provided by KPMG to Barclays.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed regular reports from management detailing any employees or workers hired from KPMG.\n- \u00b7 Discussed with KPMG their consideration of internal controls over financial reporting.\n- \u00b7 Considered areas in which KPMG had challenged management's assumptions in areas of key judgement.\n- \u00b7 Assessed any potential threats to independence that were self-identified and reported by KPMG, all of which were regarded by the Committee as being adequately addressed.\n\n## Annual assessment, audit quality and external findings\n\n- \u00b7 The Group undertakes an annual formal assessment of KPMG's performance, independence and objectivity. The assessment for 2023 was conducted in early 2024, by way of a questionnaire completed by key stakeholders across the Group who have regular interaction with KPMG. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate KPMG's audit process, its effectiveness and overall output.\n- \u00b7 Consistent with previous years, in 2023 KPMG nominated a senior partner of the audit team to have specific responsibility for ensuring audit quality. The Committee received reports from him during the year on his assessment of audit quality.\n- \u00b7 The findings of the FRC's Audit Quality Report on KPMG published in July 2023, including its inspection of the Barclays audit for the year ended 31 December 2021, provided further comfort to the Committee on the quality and effectiveness of KPMG's audit, acknowledging that there remains areas for improvement.\n\n## Outcome\n\nTaking into account the result of all of the above, the Committee considered that KPMG maintained its independence and objectivity, exercised robust challenge and demonstrated professional scepticism in the audit process. The Committee was therefore satisfied that the audit process was effective.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nIn order to safeguard the auditor's independence and objectivity, Barclays has in place the Group Policy on the Provision of Services by the Group Statutory Auditor (the Policy) setting out the circumstances in which the auditor may be engaged to provide non-audit services. The Policy applies to all Barclays subsidiaries and other material entities over which Barclays has significant influence. The core principle of the Policy is that non-audit services (other than those legally required to be carried out by the Group's auditor) should be performed by the auditor only in certain controlled circumstances. A summary of the Policy can be found at home.barclays/ who-we-are/our-governance/auditorindependence/\n\nThe Policy sets out the type of services that the auditor is permitted to carry out and pre-approves certain of these services provided the fee is below a certain threshold, except for specific categories of permitted services that require explicit\n\nCommittee approval. All other permitted services must be approved in advance by the Committee. The Policy requires that all proposed work must be sponsored by a senior executive who is not involved in any work to which the proposed engagement relates. The audit assignment partner must also confirm that the engagement has been approved in accordance with the auditor's own internal ethical standards and does not pose any threat to the auditor's independence or objectivity.\n\nThe Policy is reviewed by the Committee on an annual basis to ensure that it is fit for purpose and that it reflects applicable rules and guidelines. The Policy is aligned with both the FRC's requirements and KPMG's own internal policy on non-audit services for FTSE 350 companies, which broadly restricts non-audit work to services that are 'closely related' to the audit.\n\nIn early 2023, KPMG advised the Committee that, following on from an event notified to the Committee in late 2022, a further instance had been\n\nidentified of a KPMG member firm having provided services in connection with the preparation of local statutory accounts of a small overseas subsidiary not in scope for the Group audit. KPMG assured the Committee, having made appropriate enquiries of their member firms providing services to the Group, that these were isolated instances. In these circumstances, the Committee agreed with KPMG's assessment that this had not impaired their integrity or objectivity.\n\nIn view of the events notified by KPMG, the Committee reviewed the Policy in early 2023 to determine whether any revisions were required to ensure such events did not arise again. While it was determined that the Policy provided sufficiently clear guidance in terms of prohibited non-audit service work, certain enhancements were made to the Policy to further support the operation of the Policy including by specifying examples of the type of work prohibited under each headline service.",

A breakdown of the fees payable to the auditor for statutory audit and nonaudit work can be found in Note 39 of the financial statements. Of the \u00a314m of nonaudit services provided by KPMG during 2023, the significant categories of engagement, i.e. services where the fees amounted to more than \u00a3500,000, included:\n\n- \u00b7 audit-related services: services in connection with CASS (Client Assets Sourcebook) audits\n- \u00b7 other services in connection with regulatory, compliance and internal control reports and specific audit procedures, required by law or regulation to be provided by the statutory auditor\n- \u00b7 other attestation and assurance services, such as ongoing attestation and assurance services for treasury and capital markets transactions to meet regulatory requirements, including regular reporting obligations and verification reports.\n\n## The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014\n\nAn external audit tender was conducted in 2015 and the decision was made to appoint KPMG as Barclays' external auditor with effect from the 2017 financial year.\n\nBarclays is in compliance with the requirements of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the frequency and governance of tenders for the appointment of the external auditor and the setting of a policy on the provision of non-audit services.\n\nAs explained in previous Committee reports, provided that KPMG continues to maintain its independence and objectivity, and the Committee remains satisfied with its performance, the Board does not intend to tender for an alternative external auditor to be appointed before the end of the current required period of 10 years. Accordingly, any tender is expected to be in respect of the 2027 financial year onwards and is likely to take place in 2025. The Committee has reconfirmed that it would not be appropriate to tender before this date. The Committee observed that there has been significant rotation of the senior members of the audit team since 2017 and more recent changes in certain members of the Barclays senior finance team, both of which have reduced any potential familiarisation threat.",

As the year came to a close, market participants remained focused on the expected turn of the rates cycle and the implications for asset prices and the credit cycle. The Committee remained watchful of these events and other risks, such as the potential for disorderly market corrections and economic slowdowns across the globe; alongside wider geopolitical tensions and their impact on Barclays' portfolios and businesses. Throughout the year the Committee heard from and challenged senior business leaders, in addition to second line risk and compliance colleagues, about how they consider and manage risks as they execute their business strategies, including any mitigating actions being taken.\n\n2023 was undoubtedly a challenging year for the banking sector with significant market volatility, particularly in the first half of the year, coupled with the collapse of a number of US regional banks and the takeover of a distressed global bank. In addition to overseeing Barclays' management of its liquidity and capital positions, the Committee reviewed management's learnings from these events to help ensure that Barclays remains resilient through periods of stress.\n\n## Board Risk Committee\n\n## Robert Berry\n\nChair, Board Risk Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 There were nine scheduled meetings and two ad hoc meetings of the Committee in 2023. Owing to prior commitments and ad hoc meetings being called at short notice, Mohamed A. El-Erian was unable to attend two scheduled meetings, Diane Schueneman was unable to attend one scheduled meeting and one ad hoc meeting and Brian Gilvary was unable to attend one ad hoc meeting. Notes\n\nAlongside financial risks, the Committee oversaw management's work to drive robust operational risk management across Barclays; in this regard, the Committee considered the risks of cyberrelated attacks and their potential impact on customers and clients, and heard from management about ongoing work to strengthen the bank's cybersecurity defences. In addition, the Committee monitored work in Barclays UK designed to reduce risk by improving the control environment and drive efficiencies.\n\nThe Committee tracked Barclays' progress towards ensuring it can recover its most important business services in the event of material service disruption within tolerance by the regulatory deadline of March 2025.\n\n## Committee membership and meeting attendance in 2023 1\n\n| Member              | Meetings attended/eligible to attend  (including ad hoc meetings)   |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Robert Berry        | 11/11                                                               |\n| Mohamed A.

In recognition of the growing risks, the Committee closely monitored management's work to identify and mitigate financial crime risk across the Group, in line with increased regulatory expectations.\n\nConduct risk remains a key area of oversight. The Committee oversaw management's preparations for the implementation of the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) 'Consumer Duty' in July 2023, and continues to monitor management's efforts to ensure good outcomes for retail customers.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee reviewed changes to the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF), to underpin work to strengthen how the Group manages the risks of noncompliance with laws, rules and regulations (LRR). As part of this a new LRR risk was established alongside conduct risk under a new Principal Risk called Compliance risk.",

The Committee received updates on the Bank's ongoing advancements to its climate risk management approach, including the development of a risk appetite, monitored through a range of quantitative metrics. The Committee also heard from senior business leaders about how climate risks are being integrated into their business strategies and plans.\n\nThe Committee approved the results of the 2023 internal climate stress test (CST) and considered lessons learned that will enable Barclays to better assess specific climate vulnerabilities as well as the impact that climate factors can have on the financial stresses used to calibrate overall risk appetite. The Committee will continue to maintain close oversight of the annual CST as it is further integrated into the Group's planning and stress testing framework.\n\nAs part of its work overseeing climate risk, the Committee worked closely with the Board Audit Committee and Board Sustainability Committee, ensuring a streamlined view of matters of relevance across the Committees.\n\nThe Group uses models and data to support a broad range of business decisions and risk management activities across the Group. This is an area impacted by rapid technological change and increasing regulatory scrutiny and the Committee continued to focus on the Bank's approach to managing the associated risks, including its approach to developing and validating models, and monitoring of their performance through a volatile macro environment.\n\nThe volume of regulatory change across the global financial services industry is significant. The Committee heard from management about the impact of these changes for Barclays and the work necessary to ensure compliance. This is an area to which the Committee expects to devote attention in 2024 and beyond.\n\nBy way of a final word, in 2023, the Committee oversaw a change to the senior management of the Compliance function, with the appointment of a new Group Chief Compliance Officer, Kirsty Everett, who took up the role in July 2023. In 2023 we also welcomed both Marc Moses and Sir John Kingman (Chair of Barclays UK) to the Committee, both of whom bring with them a deep knowledge of financial services.\n\n## Committee effectiveness\n\nThe results of the Committee effectiveness review for 2023 confirm the Committee is operating effectively; it is considered well constituted and chaired, providing an effective and appropriate level of challenge and oversight of the areas within its remit. Feedback noted members' wide and diverse skills and experience, recognising that recent additions to Committee composition had been positive in providing the Committee with a deeper retail perspective. Feedback indicates that the Committee is considered to operate at the right level of debate. It also confirms that the allocation of time between agenda items in meetings is appropriate, with sufficient time for discussion and challenge.\n\nThe Committee's interaction with the Board, Board Committees and senior management is also considered effective, noting that sufficient time is allocated at Board meetings for the Chair to report to the Board on the work of the Committee. Feedback indicated that concurrent meetings of the BPLC and BBPLC Board Risk Committee continue to be effective, with coverage of BBPLC matters within concurrent meetings considered appropriate.\n\nInteraction with the BBUKPLC Board Risk Committee was also considered effective, confirming that the Committee continues to exercise appropriate oversight of issues relevant to the Committee's remit relating to BBUKPLC.\n\nPlease see the report of the Board Nominations Committee for further details on the process for conducting the 2023 Committee effectiveness review.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThe Committee actively encourages management to be alert to areas of emerging risk, particularly in light of the rapidly evolving macroeconomic, geopolitical and technological environments. As we move into 2024, geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty and inflationary pressures are expected to continue, with further uncertainty on the horizon in light of the upcoming election cycles in many of our key markets, including the US and UK. The Committee will continue to work with management to anticipate, stress test and prepare for periods of volatility to prevent outsized or unexpected losses materialising and to manage emerging risks as they arise.\n\n## Robert Berry\n\nChair, Board Risk Committee 19 February 2024",

In 2023, we continued to pursue opportunities and support our clients as they transition their businesses to a lowcarbon economy.\n\nWhen I wrote to you ahead of our 2023 AGM, I highlighted that a key commitment for Barclays over the subsequent 12 months was to help finance this transition and in December 2022 we announced a new target to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and Transition Financing between 2023 and 2030, and increased our investment mandate to \u00a3500m of capital to invest in early-stage climate-tech companies by the end of 2027. Today we are reporting $67.8bn financing facilitated towards the $1trn Sustainable and Transition Financing target and \u00a3138m invested since March 2020 in 21 climate-tech companies.\n\nA second key priority was to assess baseline emissions for the four remaining high-emitting sectors in our portfolio, as well as developing a high-level modelled assessment of our overall balance sheet, consistent with the approach outlined by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). We have announced new targets for Aviation, Commercial Real Estate and Agriculture, and published our first high-level modelled assessment under PCAF. We have also published our updated Climate Change Statement which includes new restrictions on oil and gas financing. In particular, we will stop directly financing new oil and gas projects, and have set clear expectations for our energy clients to produce transition or decarbonisation plans and set near-term targets to reduce emissions.\n\nThe final key priority was to refine our Client Transition Framework so as to improve our ability to work with clients in high-emitting sectors on their individual transition plans. This will allow us to measure and monitor our clients' decarbonisation progress and assess the implications for our targets, and to offer more tailored support to clients' transition requirements.\n\n## Board Sustainability Committee\n\nNigel Higgins\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 There were four scheduled Committee meetings held in 2023. Owing to prior commitments, Brian Gilvary was unable to attend two meetings and Dawn Fitzpatrick was unable to attend one meeting.\n\nThe Board has direct oversight of and responsibility for the Group's climate and sustainability strategy. However, given the importance of this work and the growing importance of other sustainability areas, including nature and biodiversity, in March 2023 the Board approved the establishment of a new Board Sustainability Committee to support and advise the Board in its oversight of climate and sustainability matters.\n\nThe Committee receives presentations into the challenges and opportunities in this area (including external input on specific areas of focus), undertakes detailed reviews and discussions and makes recommendations to the Board on key topics. The table on page 182 provides an overview of the Committee's work in 2023 supporting the Board in overseeing the activities to meet our climate priorities.\n\nIn addition to myself, the members of the Committee are Robert Berry, Dawn Fitzpatrick, Mary Francis, Brian Gilvary, C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Julia Wilson. Tracy Corrigan also attends Committee meetings as a non-executive representative of the BBUKPLC Board.\n\n## Committee membership and meeting attendance in 2023 1\n\n| Member               | Meetings attended/eligible to attend   |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Nigel Higgins        | 4/4                                    |\n| Robert Berry         | 4/4                                    |\n| Dawn Fitzpatrick     | 3/4                                    |\n| Mary Francis         | 4/4                                    |\n| Brian Gilvary        | 2/4                                    |\n| C.S.

It is considered well constituted and chaired, providing high-quality oversight and constructive challenge to management in the areas within its remit. The review highlights that the Committee is considered to have the right level of skills and experience, including climate/ sustainability expertise, and is of an appropriate size. The review noted the benefits of having cross-membership between the Committee and the Board Risk Committee and the Board Audit Committee, and having the Group Chief Executive as a member of the Committee in the context of the development of Barclays' climate strategy as well as the skills and experience he brings to the Committee.\n\nAs an Executive member of the Committee, our Group Chief Executive brings invaluable climate and sustainability insight to the Committee's discussions, including the views of key external stakeholders. He is also a member of the UNEP FI Leadership Council and a member of the CNBC ESG Council, and through those roles he is able to bring external perspectives of key climate/sustainability matters to the Committee's discussions.",

Feedback indicated that concurrent meetings of the BPLC and BBPLC Board Sustainability Committee are effective, with coverage of BBPLC matters within concurrent meetings considered appropriate. The addition of a representative to the Committee from the BBUKPLC Board at\n\nthe beginning of 2024 was considered to support ongoing BBUKPLC Board engagement in respect of sustainability matters impacting the Group.\n\nPlease see the report of the Board Nominations Committee for further details on the process for conducting the 2023 Committee effectiveness review.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, a key focus for the Committee will be oversight of management's development of Barclays' transition plan, informed by the work of the UK's Transition Plan Taskforce, in conjunction with ongoing work to implement the Group's climate strategy by supporting clients with their transition plans.\n\nA critical component of the work undertaken to addressing the climate challenge is the approach by governments with respect to climate and sustainability policy and financing. The importance of\n\nhaving clear requirements for the transition, and clarity and consistency in respect of government policy and financing, are key in supporting all those committed to transitioning to a low carbon economy. This is an area to which the Committee will have close regard this year.\n\nFinally, as indicated above, nature and biodiversity are areas of growing importance on the sustainability agenda. The Committee is looking forward to building on the work done in 2023 and the external briefing it received on this subject by having a greater focus on the impact of these areas, including how they can be reflected in Barclays' own ambition to be a net zero bank.\n\n## Nigel Higgins\n\nChair, Board Sustainability Committee 19 February 2024\n\n## The role of the Board and its Committees in overseeing climate-related matters\n\n## Board\n\n## Sets and oversees the Group's climate and sustainability strategy\n\n## Board Audit Committee\n\n## Board Risk Committee\n\n## Board Sustainability Committee\n\n## Board Remuneration Committee\n\n'Best practice and regulation regarding climate and sustainability reporting and related assurance are still evolving \u2026 and this is an area to which the Committee will continue to have close regard.'\n\nJulia Wilson Chair\n\nRobert Berry Chair\n\nConsiders the impact of climate on the Group's financial statements and reviews key climaterelated narrative reporting.\n\nOversees Barclays' progress in its climate risk management approach, including a focus on developing quantitative risk appetites.\n\n+\n\nSee the Board Audit Committee report on page 166.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee the Board Risk Committee report on page 174.\n\n'The Committee...heard from senior business leaders about how climate risks are being integrated into their business strategies and plans.'\n\n'In 2023, we continued to pursue opportunities and support our clients as they transition their businesses to a low-carbon economy.'\n\nNigel Higgins\n\nChair\n\nSupports the Board in its oversight of climate matters and the sustainability agenda.\n\nReflects progress against climate-related measures in remuneration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee the Board Sustainability Committee report on page 180.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee the Remuneration report on page 191.\n\n\"When we set the incentive pool and Executive Directors' incentive outcomes for 2023, we incorporated consideration of progress against our climate strategy, as we will for 2024.\"\n\nBrian Gilvary Chair",

This section and our Board Governance report sets out how we complied with the Code in 2023.\n\nBy virtue of the information included in the Annual Report, we comply with the corporate governance statement requirements of the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTRs). The information required to be disclosed pursuant to DTR 7.2.6 is located on pages 185 to 190. Information in relation to the Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy, as required to be disclosed pursuant to DTR 7.2.8A, can be found on pages 158 to 160.\n\nBarclays is permitted by NYSE rules to follow UK corporate governance practices instead of those applied in the US. Any significant variations must be explained in Barclays' Form 20-F filing, found at the Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR database or on our website, home.barclays\n\nThe way in which Barclays has applied the principles and provisions of the Code during 2023 is summarised below and on the next page.\n\n## Board Leadership and Company Purpose\n\nOur Board governance is designed to deliver an effective and entrepreneurial Board, which discharges its role effectively and efficiently. Details can be found on pages 150 to 152, including our Group-wide governance framework and the Board's responsibilities. Key Board activities for 2023 are set out on pages 153 to 155.\n\nThe Board is fully supportive of The Barclays Way , which sets out our Purpose, Values and Mindset, and is our Code of Conduct, providing a path for achieving a dynamic and positive culture in the Group. Refer to page 245 for further detail.\n\nOur Group Whistleblowing Standard enables colleagues to raise any matters of concern anonymously and is embedded into our business. Further information can be found on page 246.\n\nThroughout 2023, we engaged with our stakeholders through a variety of means. Refer to page 23 of the Strategic report for further detail about how Barclays engages with our stakeholders. You can read about how the Board engages with stakeholders in our Section 172(1) statement in the Strategic report from page 38 and examples of the Board's engagement with colleagues during 2023 can be found on page 153.\n\n## Division of Responsibility\n\nThe majority of the Board comprises independent Non-Executive Directors. The Group Chairman and Group Company Secretary work in collaboration to ensure an effective and efficient Board, as further described in Our governance framework from page 150. All Directors have access to the advice of the Group Company Secretary.\n\nThe roles of Chair, Group Chief Executive, SID and Non-Executive Directors are defined within the Barclays Charter of Expectations , along with the behaviours and competencies for each role, as outlined on page 152. Directors are expected to commit sufficient time to ensure they can discharge their obligations to Barclays effectively, as detailed in our Board Nominations Committee report on page 161.\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting the strategy for the Group. The day-to-day management of the Group is delegated by the Board to the Group Chief Executive who is supported by his ExCo, the composition of which is outlined on page 149.\n\nDetails of the number of meetings of the Board and its Committees, and the individual attendance by Directors, can be found in Our governance framework on page 152 and in each respective Board Committee report.\n\n## Composition, Succession and Evaluation\n\nAll Board and senior management appointments are viewed through a diversity lens and are based on merit and objective criteria, which focus on the skills and experience required for the Board's effectiveness and the delivery of the Group's strategy.\n\nA revised Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy was adopted on 8 February 2024. For further detail, refer to the Board Nominations Committee report on page 158.\n\nBoard appointments are made following a rigorous and transparent process facilitated by the Board Nominations Committee, with the aid of external search consultancy firms.\n\nAll Directors are subject to annual re-election at the AGM. See page 185 for further detail.\n\nEach year, we carry out an effectiveness review to evaluate the performance of the Board, Board Committees and individual Directors. In line with the Code, the review was conducted internally for 2023, and is expected to be conducted externally in 2024. Refer to the Board Nominations Committee report on page 164 for details of the 2023 effectiveness review as well as progress against the findings from the 2022 review.",

Such a system is designed to identify, evaluate and manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nProcesses are in place for identifying, evaluating and managing the Principal Risks facing the Group. A key component of The Barclays Guide is the ERMF. The purpose of the ERMF is to identify and set minimum requirements of the main risks to the strategic objectives of the Group.\n\nThe Group is committed to operating within a strong system of internal control. The Barclays Guide contains the overarching framework setting out the approach of the Group to internal governance.\n\nKey controls are assessed on a regular basis for both design and operating effectiveness. Issues arising out of these assessments, where appropriate, are reported to the Board Audit Committee.\n\nThe Board Audit Committee oversees the control environment (and remediation of related issues). It also reviews annually the risk management and internal control system.\n\nThe Board Audit Committee has concluded that throughout the year ended 31 December 2023 and to date, the Group has operated an effective system of internal control that provides reasonable assurance of financial and operational controls and compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nYou can read more about the Board Audit Committee and its work, including its oversight of the internal control framework and areas of ongoing enhancement, from page 191.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe Remuneration report from page 191 sets out the purpose and activities of the Board Remuneration Committee, a summary of the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and how it is aligned with the policy for the wider workforce, as well as the Directors' remuneration outcomes for 2023.\n\nThe remuneration policies and procedures support the Group's strategy and enable us to reward sustainable performance, which is a key element of our Remuneration Philosophy, in line with our Values, Mindset and risk expectations.\n\nAll Executive Director and senior management remuneration policies are developed in accordance with the Group's formal and transparent procedures (ensuring that no Director is involved in deciding their own remuneration outcome) and are, where possible, aligned to wider workforce policies.\n\nBoard Remuneration Committee members exercise independent judgement and discretion when determining remuneration outcomes, considering the company and individual performance, wider workforce and other relevant stakeholder considerations.",

The 2023 full year dividend of 5.3p per ordinary share will be paid on 3 April 2024 to shareholders whose names are on the Register of Members at the close of business on 1 March 2024.

The Group also maintains Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance which gives appropriate cover for legal action brought against its Directors.\n\nQualifying pension scheme indemnity provisions (as defined by Section 235 of the Companies Act 2006) were in force during the course of the financial year ended 31 December 2023 for the benefit of the then Directors, and at the date of this report are in force for the benefit of directors of Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited as trustee of the Barclays Bank UK Retirement Fund, and Barclays Executive Schemes Trustees Limited as Trustee of Barclays Capital International Pension Scheme (No.1) and Barclays PLC Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme. The directors of the trustees are indemnified against liability incurred in connection with the trustees' activities in relation to the Barclays Bank UK Retirement Fund, Barclays Capital International Pension Scheme (No.1) and Barclays PLC Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme.\n\n## Political donations\n\nThe Group did not give any money for political purposes in the UK or outside the UK, nor did it make any political donations to political parties or other political organisations or to any independent election candidates, nor did it incur any political expenditure during the year. In accordance with the US Federal Election Campaign Act, Barclays provides administrative support to a federal Political Action Committee (PAC) in the US, funded by the voluntary political contributions of eligible employees.\n\nThe PAC is not controlled or funded by Barclays and all decisions regarding the amounts and recipients of contributions are directed by a steering committee comprising employees eligible to contribute to the PAC.\n\nContributions to political organisations reported by the PAC during the calendar year 2023 totalled $60,159 (2022: $105,000).\n\n## Country-by-Country reporting\n\nThe Capital Requirements (Country-byCountry reporting) Regulations 2013 require the Company to publish additional information in respect of the year ended 31 December 2023. This information is included in the Barclays Country Snapshot available on the Barclays website: home.barclays/annualreport\n\n## Support for candidates and colleagues with disabilities and long-term conditions\n\nBarclays is committed to attracting and retaining a diverse workforce, and our commitment to inclusion means we want to ensure that candidates with disabilities and long-term health conditions receive support and adjustments in the application process and beyond. Barclays welcomes applications from all candidates and is committed to ensuring reasonable adjustments (accommodations) are put in place to ensure a fair and inclusive recruitment process. Barclays is committed to providing all colleagues with the support and tools they need to have a productive and fulfilling career. We can consider making adjustments to remove or reduce barriers colleagues might face if they have a disability, health concern or mental health condition We also ensure opportunities for training, career development and promotion are available to all.\n\n## Research and development\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group develops new products and services in each of its business divisions.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and energy efficiency action\n\nAlthough financed emissions account for the greatest proportion of our climate impact, we have also continued addressing our operational emissions - an important factor in meeting our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050.\n\n## Progress to date\n\nIn 2023 we achieved our milestone 1 of 50% reduction of our Scope 1 and 2 location-based GHG emissions ahead of 2030 - reducing these emissions by 51% \u0394 . We continued to source 100% renewable \u0394 electricity 2 for our global real estate portfolio 3 and continued to meet our 90% Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions reduction target 4 - reducing these emissions by 93% \u0394 .\n\nKey contributors to our progress include global real estate portfolio right-sizing 5 and energy efficiency programmes, as well as company vehicles electrification, and our continued focus on renewable electricity sourcing.\n\nFor our Scope 3 operational emissions our focus remained on engaging with our key stakeholders and making data enhancements, particularly by acquiring primary supplier data and evolving our accounting methodology in line with industry standards and best practice. We also continued to pursue the integration of ESG considerations and expectations into processes throughout the procurement lifecycle.\n\nWe expect that our progress against our net zero operations targets and milestones is likely to be variable and nonlinear. Our net zero operations strategy is dependent on broader industry, technological and regulatory changes that are outside Barclays' control and may affect our ability to achieve our targets and milestones. Further, as the accounting standards and data underlying our net zero operations strategy continue to evolve and be refined, this could impact our metrics, targets and milestones.\n\n## Note\n\n- \u0394    2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410.

our GHG emissions is 1 October to 30 September. The carbon reporting year is not fully aligned to the financial reporting year covered by this Directors' report. Details of our approach to assurance over the data is set out in the 2023 Barclays Strategic report.\n- 2 The methodology used to calculate our GHG emissions follows the 'Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG): A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition)', defined by the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development. We have adopted the operational control approach to define our reporting boundary. For 2023, we have applied the latest emission factors as of 31 December 2023. Reported emissions for Scope 2 location and market-based have been recalculated back to the 2018 baseline, due to updated internal and external data. The associated emissions have also been re-classified from Scope 2 electricity to Scope 3 Category 8 (Upstream Leased Assets) as these emissions are currently outside of our operational control. In 2022 we reported Scope 2 location-based emissions of 103,422 tCo2e; the recalculated figure is 99,782 tCO2e. In 2022 we reported Scope 2 market-based emissions of 1,883 tCo2e; the recalculated figure is 1,963 tCO2e. In 2022 we reported energy use of 467,939 MWh; the recalculated figure is 463,973 MWh.\n- 3 Scope 1 emissions include our direct GHG emissions from natural gas, fuel oil, company cars and HFC refrigerants. In the case of company-owned vehicles, emissions are limited to UK vehicles only as this is the only country in which expense data is available.\n- 4 Scope 2 GHG emissions include our indirect GHG emissions from purchased electricity, purchased heat, cooling and steam . Market-based emissions have been reported for 2023 and 2022. We have used a zero emission factor where we have green tariffs or energy attribute certificates in place globally.\n- 5 Scope 3 category 1, 2 and 4 emissions are excluded as these emissions cannot be broken down by country. Scope 3 category 1, 2 and 4 emissions can be found in the Operational Footprint tab of the ESG Data Centre.\n- 6 Intensity ratio calculations have been calculated using location-based emission factors only.\n- 7 Energy consumption data is captured through utility billing; meter reads or estimates. Principal measures we have undertaken in 2023 to improve energy efficiency include the following: \u00b7 Right-sized our global real estate portfolio, therefore optimising our space and associated resources for our operational needs.\n- \u00b7 Deployed our global energy optimisation programme by adjusting corporate offices' settings and systems during periods of low or no occupancy to reduce our demand for energy while keeping our buildings running. In 2023 the programme contributed to approximately 9.1 GWh in energy savings at our UK sites - equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of approximately 2,600 UK households.\n- \u0394    2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410. Current and previous limited assurance scope and opinions can be found within the ESG Resource Hub for further details: home.barclays/sustainability/esg-resource-hub/reporting-and-disclosures/\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 In this section, a reference to a 'milestone' denotes an indicator we are working towards and report against.\n- 2 We maintained 100% renewable electricity sourcing for our global real estate portfolio through instruments including green tariffs (55%) and energy attribute certificates (EACs)(45%).\n- 3 Global real estate portfolio includes offices, branches, campuses and data centres.\n- 4 In this section, a reference to a 'target' denotes an indicator linked to our executive remuneration.\n- 5 By right-sizing we are optimising our space and associated resources for our operational needs.",

The Company's Articles also allow for the issuance of sterling, US dollar, euro and yen preference shares (preference shares). No preference shares have been issued as at 16 February 2024 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report). Ordinary shares therefore represent 100% of the total issued share capital as at 31 December 2023 and as at 16 February 2024 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report).\n\nDetails of the movement in ordinary share capital during the year can be found in Note 27 to the financial statements.\n\nThe rights and obligations attaching to the Company's ordinary shares and preference shares are set out in the Company's Articles, copies of which are available on the Company's website at home.barclays/corporategovernance\n\n## Voting\n\nEvery member who is present in person or represented at any general meeting of the Company, and who is entitled to vote, has one vote on a show of hands. Every proxy present has one vote. The proxy will have one vote for, and one vote against, a resolution if he/she has been instructed to vote for, or against, the resolution by different members or in one direction by a member while another member has permitted the proxy discretion as to how to vote.\n\nOn a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy and who is entitled to vote has one vote for every share held. In the case of joint holders, only the vote of the senior holder (as determined by the order in the share register) or his/her proxy may be counted. If any sum payable remains unpaid in relation to a member's shareholding, that member is not entitled to vote that share or exercise any other right in relation to a meeting of the Company unless the Board otherwise determines.\n\nIf any member, or any other person appearing to be interested in any of the Company's ordinary shares, is served with a notice under Section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and does not supply the Company with the information required in the notice, then the Board, in its absolute discretion, may direct that that member shall not be entitled to attend or vote at any meeting of the Company.\n\nThe Board may further direct that, if the shares of the defaulting member represent 0.25% or more of the issued shares of the relevant class, dividends or other monies payable on those shares shall be retained by the Company until the direction ceases to have effect and no transfer of those shares shall be registered (other than certain specified 'excepted transfers'). A direction ceases to have effect seven days after the Company has received the information requested, or when the Company is notified that an excepted transfer of all of the relevant shares to a third party has occurred, or as the Board otherwise determines.\n\n## Transfers\n\nOrdinary shares may be held in either certificated or uncertificated form. Certificated ordinary shares may be transferred in writing in any usual or other form approved by the Group Company Secretary and executed by or on behalf of the transferor. Transfers of uncertificated ordinary shares must be made in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the CREST Regulations.\n\nThe Board is not bound to register a transfer of partly paid ordinary shares or fully paid shares in exceptional circumstances approved by the FCA.\n\nThe Board may also decline to register an instrument of transfer of certificated ordinary shares unless (i) it is duly stamped, deposited at the prescribed place and accompanied by the share certificate(s) and such other evidence as reasonably required by the Board to evidence right to transfer, (ii) it is in respect of one class of shares only, and (iii) it is in favour of a single transferee or not more than four joint transferees (except in the case of executors or trustees of a member).\n\nThe Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.\n\n## Variation of rights\n\nThe rights attached to any class of shares may be varied either with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. The rights of shares shall not (unless expressly provided by the rights attached to such shares) be deemed varied by the creation of further shares ranking equally with them or subsequent to them.\n\n## Limitations on foreign shareholders\n\nThere are no restrictions imposed by the Articles or (subject to the effect of any economic sanctions that may be in force from time to time) by current UK laws which relate only to non-residents of the UK and which limit the rights of such nonresidents to hold or (when entitled to do so) vote the ordinary shares.\n\n## Exercisability of rights under an employee share scheme\n\nEBTs operate in connection with certain of the Group's Employee Share Plans (Plans). The trustees of the EBTs may exercise all rights attached to the shares in accordance with their fiduciary duties, other than as specifically restricted in the documents governing the Plans. The trustees of the EBTs have informed the Company that their normal policy is to abstain from voting in respect of the Barclays shares held in trust. The trustees of the Global Sharepurchase EBT and UK Sharepurchase EBT may vote in respect of Barclays shares held in the EBTs, but only as instructed by participants in those Plans in respect of their partnership shares and (when vested) matching and dividend shares. The trustees will not otherwise vote in respect of shares held in the Sharepurchase EBTs.\n\n## Special rights\n\nThere are no persons holding securities that carry special rights with regard to the control of the Company.\n\n## Major shareholders\n\nMajor shareholders do not have different voting rights from those of other shareholders. Information provided to the Company by substantial shareholders (holding voting rights of 3% or more in the financial instruments of the Company) pursuant to the DTRs are published via a Regulatory Information Service and is available on the Company's website. As at 31 December 2023, the Company had been notified under Rule 5 of the DTRs of the following holdings of voting rights in its shares.\n\nBetween 31 December 2023 and 16 February 2024 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report), the Company has not received any additional notifications pursuant to Rule 5 of the DTRs.\n\n| Person interested   | Number of  Barclays Shares   |   % of total voting rights attaching to  issued share capital 1 | Nature of holding (direct or  indirect)   |\n|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| BlackRock, Inc. 2   | 944,022,209                  |                                                            5.78 | indirect                                  |\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 The percentage of voting rights detailed above was calculated at the time of the relevant disclosures made in accordance with Rule 5 of the DTRs.\n- 2 Total shown includes 6,687,206 contracts for difference to which voting rights are attached. Part of the holding is held as American Depositary Receipts. On 25 January 2024, BlackRock, Inc. disclosed by way of a Schedule 13G filed with the SEC beneficial ownership of 1,303,920,163 ordinary shares of the Company as at 31 December 2023, representing 8.6% of that class of shares.",

        "page_content": "Risk\n\nreview\n\nGovernance\n\n## Directors' report: Other statutory and regulatory information (continued)\n\n## Powers of Directors to issue and allot or buy back the Company's shares\n\nThe powers of the Directors are determined by the Companies Act 2006 and the Company's Articles. The Directors are authorised to issue and allot shares and to buy back shares subject to, and on the terms of, the annual shareholder approval at the AGM. Such authorities were granted by shareholders at the 2023 AGM. It will be proposed at the 2024 AGM that the Directors be granted new authorities to issue and allot and buy back shares.\n\n## Repurchase of shares\n\nOn 13 March 2023 and 28 July 2023 the Company commenced share buy-back programmes to purchase its ordinary shares of \u00a30.25p each up a maximum consideration of \u00a3500m and \u00a3750m, respectively. The first share buy-back programme concluded on 14 April 2023 and the second share buy-back programme concluded on 23 October 2023. The Company repurchased for cancellation 343,041,720 ordinary shares at a volume weighted average price of 145.7549 pence per ordinary share during the first buy-back programme and 493,603,770 ordinary shares at a volume weighted average price of 151.9437 pence per ordinary share during the second buyback programme. The purpose of the buyback programmes was to reduce the Company's number of outstanding ordinary shares.\n\nIn aggregate, the Company purchased 836,645,490 ordinary shares during 2023 with an aggregate nominal value of approximately \u00a3209m (this represented approximately 5.5% of the Company's issued share capital as at 31 December 2023) for an aggregate consideration of \u00a31,250m excluding taxes and expenses. All of the repurchased ordinary shares have been cancelled.\n\nNo further shares have been repurchased since the completion of the second share buy-back programme on 23 October 2023. The maximum number of ordinary shares which could be repurchased by the Company as part of any share buy-back under the authority for on-market share buy-backs granted at the 2023 AGM is 1,093,533,143 ordinary shares (being 1,587,136,913 less the 493,603,770 shares repurchased as part of the second share buy-back programme).\n\n## Distributable reserves\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the distributable reserves of the Company were \u00a321,162m (2022: \u00a321,701m).\n\n## Change of control\n\nThere are no significant agreements to which the Company is a party that take effect, alter or terminate on a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid. There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.\n\n## Controls over financial reporting\n\nA framework of disclosure controls and procedures is in place to support the approval of the financial statements of the Group.\n\nSpecific governance committees are responsible for examining the financial reports and disclosures to help ensure that they have been subject to adequate verification and comply with applicable standards and legislation.\n\nWhere appropriate, these committees report their conclusions to the Board Audit Committee, which debates such conclusions and provides further challenge. Finally, the Board scrutinises and approves results announcements and the Annual Report to ensure that appropriate disclosures have been made. This governance process is designed to ensure that both management and the Board are given sufficient opportunity to debate and challenge the financial statements of the Group and other significant disclosures before they are made public.\n\n## Management's report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting under the supervision of the principal executive and financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements, in accordance with (a) UK-adopted international accounting standards; and (b) International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail:\n\n- \u00b7 accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with UKadopted international accounting standards and IFRS and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and the respective Directors\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nInternal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement has assessed internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2023. In making its assessment, management utilised the criteria set out in the 2013 COSO framework. Management has concluded that, based on its assessment, internal control over financial reporting was effective as at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe system of internal financial and operational controls is also subject to regulatory oversight in the UK and overseas. Further information on supervision by financial services regulators is provided under Supervision and Regulation in the Risk review section on pages 363 to 372.\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting\n\nThere have been no changes that occurred during the period covered by this report, which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Group's internal control over financial reporting.",

I would like formally to welcome them both.\n\nI would also like to thank you, our shareholders, for the support you showed at our 2023 Annual General Meeting, approving both our current Directors' Remuneration Policy to apply for three years from the date of that meeting supported by 97% of shareholder votes and the implementation during 2022 of our previous Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n\n## Performance in 2023\n\nAs always, our remuneration approach is rooted in our commitment to reward sustainable performance. As the Group Chief Executive sets out in his review, our diversified income approach has enabled us to continue to deliver well in 2023 despite an external backdrop of persistent uncertainty - with heightened volatility across asset classes, some significant market disruption, and escalating geopolitical tensions. In this testing environment, we took deliberate, proactive steps to protect the Group: maintaining a prudent approach to risk management; managing our balance sheet with care; and continuing to invest in talent and technology in sustainable growth areas, while maintaining our focus on costs.\n\nBarclays demonstrated its sound footing in 2023 and continued to see solid income\n\n## Board Remuneration Committee\n\nBrian Gilvary\n\nChair, Board Remuneration Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 There were five scheduled meetings and one ad hoc meeting of the Committee in 2023.

Operating expenses for 2023 were \u00a316.9bn, a 1% increase on 2022, reflecting business growth, investment spend and inflation - delivering statutory profit before tax of \u00a36.6bn (2022: \u00a37.0bn), down 6%.\n\nThis included \u00a3927m of structural cost actions taken in the fourth quarter to help drive future returns, having reviewed the shape, efficiency and focus of our businesses. Excluding these costs, profit before tax was \u00a37.5bn (2022: \u00a37.7bn, excluding the Over-issuance of Securities) and RoTE was 10.6%, achieving our greater-than-10% target. Our primary frame of reference was financial outcomes on this basis 1 , to understand the underlying performance of the business separate from the costs associated with the decisions we made to shape its future. We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, within our target range of 13% to 14%. We will deliver increased capital distributions to shareholders, up c.37% on 2022, via a total dividend for the year of 8.0p per share and \u00a31.75bn of announced share buybacks - equivalent to a total payout of c.19.4p per share.\n\nAlthough income is down for some business areas, those reductions are from a starting point of strong 2022 performance for most business areas.

Investment Banking also maintained its sixth rank globally, despite the subdued dealmaking environment, and returned to first in the UK 4 , up from fourth in 2022. For Consumer, Cards and Payments, income was up 18%, reflecting the expansion and deepening of our client relationships including our latest partnership launch with Microsoft and Mastercard.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report (continued)\n\nThe Committee has maintained its focus on ensuring we reward performance that is sustainable. During 2023 the management team has been embedding a new operating standard - Consistently Excellent - which aims to transform the operational resilience of Barclays. Raising our operating standards and reducing the impact on financial performance of unexpected issues will strengthen our foundation to deliver sustainable performance. This was reflected in our objective setting, performance assessment and reward processes for senior colleagues for 2023, and in our recognition platform for all colleagues, and will be embedded more deeply and widely during 2024. Striving to achieve a consistently excellent standard is becoming part of our culture, and initial feedback suggests our work to equip all colleagues with the right skills to achieve this resonates as a way of driving long-term success.\n\n## Colleague remuneration\n\nAlongside rewarding sustainable performance, our Fair Pay Agenda continues to underpin all our remuneration decisions - ensuring we are paying colleagues fairly for the work they do and recognising the contributions of all, within the resources available to us. This is especially pertinent given the challenges colleagues continue to face - particularly those who are lower-paid, given higherthan-normal increases in the cost of living over recent years. You can read more in the 'Wider workforce remuneration' section on page 204 and in our sixth annual Fair Pay Report published alongside this Annual Report. We have also published our pay gap figures for employees in the UK and in Ireland.\n\nPaying at least a living wage to all our colleagues is a central element of our Fair Pay Agenda. We continue to ensure we meet or exceed living wage benchmarks in every jurisdiction in which our employees are based. In the UK our employees already received more than the Living Wage Foundation's benchmarks, and we are further increasing our minimum UK full-time equivalent salary to \u00a324,000. We continue to meet or exceed Fair Wage Network living wage benchmarks in all other countries.\n\nWe have continued our work to be simpler, more transparent and more consistent in how we pay our more-junior colleagues. For more junior roles in Barclays UK and the support functions in the UK, we publish starting salaries by role - providing\n\ntransparency for job candidates and existing staff alike. From 2023, the performance rating of each individual across this population consistently drives their annual bonus outcome as a percentage of their salary. In previous years a range of different approaches were used and the annual bonus outcomes for many of these roles were discretionary.\n\nIn setting this year's incentive pool we considered Barclays' financial and nonfinancial performance, and the performance of the individual businesses that make up the Group, in both absolute and relative terms. We considered each business's contribution to the achievement of our strategic targets and its importance to our future success. The Committee also wanted to recognise the resilience across our operating businesses, delivered against a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty, as well as the support our colleagues provided to customers and clients. Taking all of this into account, the Committee has approved a Group incentive pool for 2023 performance of \u00a31,745m (2022: \u00a31,790m), down 3% compared to the final incentive pool for 2022, which included a c.\u00a3500m reduction for risk and control issues that came to light during 2022. Risk and conduct adjustments to the 2023 incentive pool are materially less than those for 2022, so the incentive pool before risk adjustments each year fell by c.15% from 2023 to 2022.\n\nThis level of incentive funding for 2023 reflects the lower year-on-year financial outcomes in some business areas, while also enabling us to reward colleagues for the performance delivered - recognising the progress made towards our strategic priorities and our ambition to be consistently excellent in our operations. We also considered the competitive market for hiring and retaining the talent we need to achieve those priorities in the future. In doing so, we weighed the views and expectations of you as shareholders, of our customers and clients, of our colleagues, and of our stakeholders in wider society. Consistent with our Fair Pay Agenda, we have chosen to protect the incentive outcomes for our more junior colleagues - so, in business areas where incentive spend was down year on year, more senior colleagues experienced greater reductions in annual bonus awards. As always, a significant portion of the pool will be delivered in shares, most of which will be deferred over a number of years.\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nGroup income\n\n\u00a325,378m\n\n2022: \u00a324,956m\n\nGroup profit before tax\n\n\u00a36,557m\n\n2022: \u00a37,012m\n\nGroup profit before impairment (excluding adjusting items) 1\n\n\u00a39,365m\n\n2022: \u00a38,906m\n\nGroup profit before tax (excluding adjusting items) 1\n\n\u00a37,484m\n\n2022: \u00a37,686m\n\nGroup RoTE (excluding adjusting items)\n\n1 10.6% 2022: 11.6%\n\nGroup cost: income ratio (excluding adjusting items) 1\n\n63%\n\n2022: 64%\n\nGroup CET1 ratio\n\n13.8%\n\n2022: 13.9%\n\nGroup compensation to income ratio\n\n34.4%\n\n2022: 33.5%\n\nGroup incentive pool\n\n\u00a31,745m\n\n2022: \u00a31,790m\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 Adjusting items: Q423 structural cost actions in 2023 and the impact of the Over-issuance of Securities in 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report (continued)\n\n## Executive Director remuneration\n\n## Determining Executive Directors' pay outcomes\n\nThe Committee considered the Executive Directors' annual bonus outcomes in the context of the Group's performance and the performance of each Executive Director during 2023.\n\nThe 2023 annual bonus outcome for C.S. Venkatakrishnan (known as Venkat) was 53.3% of maximum, and for Anna Cross was 54.3% of maximum (2022: 75.4% for both). Profit before tax provided a 21.1% outcome out of a possible 50%, and the cost: income ratio provided a 2.7% outcome out of a possible 10%. Performance against the strategic nonfinancial measures was good, which resulted in a 16.5% outcome out of a of the Executive Directors against their personal objectives was also assessed and taken into account (13.0% for Venkat and\n\npossible 25% and the performance of each 14.0% for Anna out of a possible 15%).\n\nBefore finalising those outcomes, the Committee reflected on their appropriateness. We reviewed the underlying financial health of the Group, which is strong and well-capitalised. We considered the bonus outcomes in the context of those for the wider workforce, ensuring suitable alignment both this year and over a multi-year period, and also compared to historical outcomes for the Executive Directors in the context of performance each year. We concluded that the outcomes are appropriate in the context of the performance achieved and that no further discretionary adjustment was warranted.\n\nNeither Venkat nor Anna Cross participated in the 2021-2023 LTIP cycle, as neither was an Executive Director at the time those awards were granted. The Committee did, however, assess performance against the measures for this LTIP cycle to determine the vesting outcome for the previous Group Finance Director, who is the sole remaining participant. This was 53.2% of the maximum, as outlined later in this report.\n\nThe Committee decided to grant awards under the 2024-2026 LTIP cycle with a face value at grant of 140% of Fixed Pay for Venkat and 134% of Fixed Pay for Anna Cross, reflecting the personal contribution made by each to a solid 2023 performance - and to provide each with a significant incentive award subject to forward-looking performance conditions during 2024 to 2026.\n\n## The Executive Directors' pay in 2024\n\nThe Committee carefully considered the performance measures for the Executive Directors' 2024 annual bonus and the 2024-2026 LTIP, and updated elements of both the financial and non-financial measures in each plan to better reflect the revised targets set out under 'Our strategy' from page 11, and our long-term climate strategy.\n\nFor the 2024 annual bonus, a total operating expenses measure replaces cost: income ratio - reflecting the continued importance of cost discipline while providing a more focused and simpler measure of cost control within the year. Other financial measures and weightings in the bonus are unchanged.\n\nFor the 2024-2026 LTIP we have increased slightly the weighting of RoTE, from 25% to 30%, given the focus on improving RoTE within the Group's 2026 targets. This is accommodated via a small reduction to the weighting of the relative total shareholder return measure from 25% to 20%. All other financial measures in the LTIP remain unchanged from the previous year's award, including the continued use of cost: income ratio as a longer-term cost measure.\n\nWe also reviewed the non-financial measures for both the 2024 annual bonus and 2024-2026 LTIP, to ensure they reflect the Group's shorter- and longerterm priorities. Our commitment to align our financing with the goals and timelines of the Paris Climate Agreement has been and remains a key component of our climate strategy. Many of our climate and sustainability targets are longer term, including through to 2050, and progress towards these is expected to be nonlinear. As such, we have retained the Climate & sustainability category within the Strategic non-financial assessment for the annual bonus and LTIP, but increased its weighting in the LTIP from 10% to 15% accommodating this by reducing the weighting of the LTIP risk-related measures (which this year also incorporate assessment of operational excellence) from 10% to 5%.\n\nAt the same time the ways we approach and monitor risk, and ensure a high standard of operational performance, are fundamental to delivering sustainable performance every year. To reflect our focus on this across Barclays, we have included a Risk & operational excellence category within the Strategic non-financial element of the 2024 annual bonus, with a weighting of 10% - accommodated via a slight reduction in the weighting of other Strategic non-financial bonus measures. The Climate & sustainability, Customers & clients, and Colleagues categories are each weighted 5%.\n\nThe Committee will continue to review the measures and weightings for the Executive Directors' incentives each year, to ensure they appropriately support the delivery of our strategy and reflect our priorities.\n\nIn early 2024, the Committee reviewed the level of Fixed Pay for Venkat and Anna Cross, in the same way and at the same time as fixed pay was reviewed for the wider workforce. The Committee increased Fixed Pay by 2.5% for both Venkat and Anna, resulting in Fixed Pay of \u00a32,947,000 and \u00a31,845,000 respectively, effective from 1 March 2024. These percentage increases are significantly lower than the average across the wider workforce, in particular for other UK employees within the scope of the 2024 UK pay deal with the union Unite - with a 5.55% budget for salary increases for junior employees and a 3.75% budget for other union-recognised employees. Even following these Fixed Pay increases, the total compensation opportunity for each Executive Director remains well behind the median opportunity for equivalent roles across our international banking peer group.\n\n## Shareholder alignment\n\nOf the total variable pay awards to Venkat and Anna Cross in respect of 2023 performance (2023 annual bonus plus 2024-2026 LTIP), 96% and 94% respectively will be in shares that must be retained for a period of between one and eight years from grant - aligning the Executive Directors' interests with those of our shareholders. Both Venkat and Anna Cross already have significant shareholdings.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report (continued)\n\n## Group Chair and Non-Executive Director fees\n\nThe Committee periodically reviews the Group Chair's fee, and the Directors' Remuneration Policy allows for increases of up to 20% during the policy's three-year term. The Committee last increased the Group Chair's fee with effect from 1 January 2023, having considered the fee in the context of the Chair fees paid across our international banking peer group - with a particular focus on the UK banks, given the regional differences in both the role and pay for non-executive directors including chairs. Prior to that, this fee had remained at the same level since 2015. Early in 2024, the Committee approved a 2% increase in the Group Chair's fee, from \u00a3840,000 to \u00a3856,800, effective 1 January 2024. Each year \u00a3100,000 of the fee will continue to be used to purchase Barclays shares that will be retained on the Group Chair's behalf until he retires from the Board. No other changes were made to the Group Chair's remuneration arrangements or benefits.\n\nIn January 2024 the Board reviewed the other Non-Executive Directors' fees, which were also last increased with effect from 1 January 2023, and approved 2% increases to those fees effective 1 January 2024 (with the relevant NonExecutive Directors having recused themselves from those discussions).\n\n## Update in respect of Jes Staley's remuneration\n\nAs outlined in the 2021 Annual Report, Jes Staley stepped down from the role of Group Chief Executive on\n\n31 October 2021 and his unvested awards were suspended pending further developments in respect of the regulatory and legal proceedings related to the FCA and PRA investigation regarding Mr Staley.\n\nIn October 2023, the FCA issued a Decision Notice in relation to Mr Staley.\n\nThe Committee considered the detailed findings in this Decision Notice and concluded that Mr Staley should be ineligible for or forfeit a number of his awards, including the bonus award in respect of the 2021 performance year, all of his unvested LTIP awards - both those for which the performance had already been assessed and those still subject to performance conditions - and his other unvested deferred bonus awards from earlier years. The total value of the lapsed LTIP awards and forfeited deferred bonus awards at that time was \u00a317.8m.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nAs we move into 2024, the Committee maintains its commitment to rewarding sustainable performance.\n\nWe will use our remuneration policies and practices to incentivise the Executive Directors and the management team to deliver our three year plan, improving operational and financial performance, and improving shareholder returns.\n\nWe will support the management team to use performance management and pay:\n\n- - to align the wider workforce to those same priorities\n- - to reinforce the importance of good conduct, strong controls and risk management and\n- - to support Barclays' Purpose, Values and Mindset, and our ambition to achieve a standard of being consistently excellent.\n\nWe will continue to engage with our shareholders and other stakeholders on pay and will be meeting with our largest shareholders to discuss our pay outcomes for 2023.\n\nBeyond this, we will maintain focus on our Fair Pay Agenda, continuing to support our colleagues and ensuring the way we pay our people supports the long-term health and success of the Group.\n\n## Brian Gilvary\n\nChair, Board Remuneration Committee February 2024\n\n## Removal of the regulatory requirement to operate a 2:1 'bonus cap'\n\nWith effect from 31 October 2023, the PRA and FCA removed the UK regulatory requirement for certain banks, including Barclays, to apply a maximum 1:1 ratio of variable to fixed remuneration for employees who are deemed to have a material risk impact on their firm - known as Material Risk Takers (MRTs) - or up to a 2:1 ratio if shareholders approve the adoption of that higher maximum. Our shareholders approved the adoption of a 2:1 maximum ratio for Barclays MRTs around the time that these regulations first came into effect. Going forward, such banks - including Barclays - will be permitted to set their maximum variable pay ratios to be greater than 2:1.\n\nAs the new regulations were published close to the end of 2023, the Committee determined that the 2:1 cap would continue to apply in Barclays for the 2023 performance year. The Committee will consider this further in respect of 2024 and future years.\n\nA relatively small number of our employees are potentially impacted by this regulatory change. Our Executive Directors' maximum variable pay opportunity is governed by the Directors' Remuneration Policy that shareholders approved at our 2023 AGM, and therefore is unchanged by these new regulations. The Directors' Remuneration Policy will continue to apply until a new policy is approved by shareholders. No new Directors' Remuneration Policy is proposed for 2024.",

This means attracting and retaining an appropriate range of talent to deliver against our strategy, and paying the right amount for that talent.\n\nAlign pay with investor and other stakeholder interests\n\nRemuneration should be designed with appropriate consideration of the views, rights and interests of stakeholders. This means listening to our shareholders, other investors, regulators, government, customers and employees and ensuring their views are appropriately represented in remuneration decision-making.\n\nReward sustainable performance\n\nSustainable performance means making a positive and enduring difference to investors, customers and communities, delivering good customer outcomes, taking pride in leaving things better than we found them and playing a valuable role in society.\n\nSupport Barclays' Values and culture\n\nResults must be achieved in a manner consistent with our Values.

Differences in policy implementation between seniority levels reflect our remuneration philosophy. For example, the balance between fixed and variable pay is shifted toward fixed pay for employees in more-junior roles and towards variable pay for those in more-senior roles. A large proportion of variable pay for senior employees, or the majority of variable pay and half of Fixed Pay for the Executive Directors, is delivered in shares over multiple years - aligning their interests more closely with those of shareholders - whereas pay is primarily in cash for more-junior employees. Aligned with our Fair Pay Agenda, UK employer pension contributions are also higher for our junior employees.\n\nThe table below provides a summary of remuneration arrangements for the wider workforce and the Executive Directors.\n\n| Element                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | How Executive Director policy aligns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed pay                               | Junior employees Senior employees Reflects the individual's role, skills and experience and is reviewed annually.

At year-end, colleagues are assessed separately on the 'what' and the 'how' of their performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis assessment is reflected in colleague performance ratings and bonus outcomes.\n\nFor 2023, our aspiration to be a consistently excellent organisation was reflected in performance management for senior colleagues - and will be embedded more deeply and widely during 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details see our Fair Pay Report 2023 at: home.barclays/annualreport\n\n## Engaging with stakeholders on remuneration\n\nWe seek to consider the views of all of our stakeholders in remuneration decision-making, including colleagues, investors and regulators.\n\n## Colleagues\n\nWe engage with colleagues to understand their views through our Your View surveys, union and works council engagements, and townhalls. We also engage with colleagues through our Employee Resource Groups, webcasts, workshops and events.\n\nOur ongoing engagement with the union Unite in the UK covers a range of topics, such as fair pay and the increasing cost of living, and this is another opportunity for the views of colleagues to inform decision-making. For information on our 2024 pay deal with Unite see 'Salary budget for 2024', below.\n\nWe publish information to explain to colleagues how the Group's performance and pay approach aligns to the Fair Pay Agenda, and to help them understand the employee benefits Barclays provides - so they can make the most of what is on offer. To communicate pay in a clear way, each colleague receives a Compensation Profile detailing their fixed pay and incentives for the previous year and their fixed pay for the following year.\n\n## Fixed pay decisions for 2024\n\n## Living wage employer\n\nWe continue to ensure that we at least meet the living wage benchmarks for each location, and are an accredited Living Wage employer in the UK.\n\n## Salary budget for 2024\n\nWe targeted our salary increase budgets so there are higher increases for the most junior colleagues. In the UK, with the union Unite, we have agreed a salary increase budget of 5.55% for our junior employees and 3.75% for other union-recognised employees. For junior employees in India and the US salary increase budgets are 8% and 3.25% respectively.\n\nThe percentage Fixed Pay increases for the Executive Directors are below the average percentage increases for the wider workforce; the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director will each receive a 2.5% increase in Fixed Pay.\n\n## Investors\n\nWe recognise that remuneration is an area of particular interest to some shareholders. We listen to their views and take these into account when setting remuneration or considering changes to remuneration policies. Accordingly, the Group Chair or Remuneration Committee Chair hold meetings each year with major shareholders and representative groups to understand their views, accompanied by senior Barclays employees. In 2023, we discussed our remuneration policies and our 2022 pay outcomes with representatives of some of our institutional shareholders and proxy voting agencies.\n\nThis kind of engagement helps inform the Committee's work and contributes directly to the decisions it makes in relation to Executive Directors' remuneration. For example, shareholder views were a key consideration in the Committee's decision to increase the weighting of the Climate & sustainability category from 10% to 15% for the 2024-2026 LTIP cycle.\n\n## Other stakeholders\n\nEach year, the Barclays Internal Audit or Chief Controls Office teams review our remuneration policies and how we've operated our remuneration processes, to provide assurance to the management team and the Committee that we are compliant with regulatory requirements.\n\nWhenever regulations on remuneration are changed, we review our remuneration policies and practices to ensure they are compliant and make changes if necessary.\n\nIn 2023 we continued to engage with our regulators to ensure we understand their perspectives, and to explain our performance, pay priorities and decision-making. We took their views into consideration when making our remuneration decisions for 2023, and continue to ensure we have ongoing regulatory dialogue on remuneration.\n\n## Exceeding the living wage in key locations\n\nWe pay at least the living wage in all locations. Below are our minimum hourly rates from 1 March 2024 for the UK, USA and India, where 90% of employees are based.\n\n\u00a313.19 UK 2023: \u00a312.23\n\n$22.50\n\nUSA 2023: $22.50\n\n## Pay transparency\n\nWe have continued to simplify our pay approach for junior colleagues, making it easier for them to understand how their pay is set and managed.\n\nPay levels and annual salary increases for our most junior roles in Barclays UK and support functions in the UK are based on role type, and starting salaries are published.\n\n\u20b91 50.00\n\nIndia 2023: R143.00\n\nAnnual bonus approaches for those populations have also been harmonised. Previously, bonus outcomes were fully discretionary for many of these roles. From 2023, annual bonus outcomes are a set percentage of salary, differentiated by each employee's performance rating.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report (continued)\n\n## Incentive pool and annual bonus outcomes for 2023\n\n## Determining the Group incentive pool\n\nIn determining the 2023 Group incentive pool, the Committee considered:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's financial and non-financial performance during 2023 (both absolute and relative)\n- \u00b7 The performance of individual businesses within the Group and their contributions to our strategic targets and vision\n- \u00b7 The Group's capital position and current and future risks\n- \u00b7 The need to reward strong performers appropriately, as well as recognising colleagues who have exemplified the Barclays Values and Mindset\n- \u00b7 Compensation market data and expected market trends, to maintain competitiveness where performance warrants.\n\nThe Committee used its judgement to establish the right balance between annual bonus outcomes that reflect the performance of the Group and managing the Group's cost base, while supporting its ability to attract, retain and reward colleagues who will drive the delivery of the Group's strategy and sustainable growth for shareholders in the future, in line with our remuneration philosophy.\n\nOn that basis, the Committee approved a Group incentive pool for 2023 performance of \u00a31,745m (2022: \u00a31,790m), down 3% compared to the final incentive pool for 2022, which itself incorporated a c.\u00a3500m reduction for risk and control issues that came to light during 2022. The risk and conduct adjustments to the 2023 incentive pool are materially less than those for 2022, so the incentive pool before risk adjustments each year fell by c.15% from 2023 to 2022 - as seen in the chart on the right.\n\n## The Group incentive pool and Group Chief Executive bonus outcomes\n\nThe incentive approach for our Executive Directors is significantly more structured than for other employees, as required by institutional shareholders for directors of UK-listed companies. This more-structured approach, with a need for direct alignment to financial performance metrics, leads to greater year-onyear volatility in incentive outcomes - both up and down - for the Executive Directors compared to other employees.\n\nFor 2023, like every year, the Committee considered the Executive Director bonus outcomes in the context of the bonus outcomes for the wider workforce, ensuring appropriate alignment both this year and over a multi-year period. It also reviewed the historical outcomes for the Executive Directors in the context of performance each year and concluded they were appropriate in the context of the performance achieved.\n\nConsistent with our Fair Pay Agenda, incentive outcomes for junior employees are largely protected, so, in business areas where incentive spend was down year on year, more senior colleagues experienced greater reductions in annual bonus awards.\n\n## Group incentive pool and Group Chief Executive bonus outcomes over the years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\nGroup incentive pool (\u00a3m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\nGroup Chief Executive bonus outcome (% of maximum)\n\nRisk and conduct adjustments (\u00a3m)\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 Figures exclude the following adjusting items (pre-tax for profit and post-tax for RoTE): 2023: Q423 structural cost actions (\u00a3927m pre-tax and \u00a3739m post-tax); 2022: impact of Over-issuance of Securities (\u00a3674m pre-tax and \u00a3552m post-tax); 2021: impact of Over-issuance of Securities (\u00a3220m pre-tax and \u00a3170m post-tax); 2020: litigation and conduct (\u00a3153m pre-tax and \u00a3112m post-tax); 2019: litigation and conduct (\u00a31,849m pre-tax and \u00a31,733m posttax); 2018:  litigation and conduct (\u00a32,207m pre-tax and \u00a32,136m post-tax).\n- 2 2018 Group compensation to income ratio excludes \u00a3140m relating to GMP charge post-retirement benefits.\n\n## Annual percentage change in remuneration of Directors and employees\n\n- \u00b7 The annual percentage change in fixed pay earned in 2023, compared to 2022, is 3% for the Group Chief Executive and 9% for the median UK employee reflecting the Fixed Pay and salary increases awarded in early 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull details and supporting narrative\n\nSee page 223\n\n## Group Chief Executive pay ratio: 83:1\n\n- \u00b7 Our Group Chief Executive median pay ratio for 2023 is down in comparison to 2022 (101:1) .\n- \u00b7 This is due to a decrease in the CEO single total figure for remuneration from 2022 to 2023 and an increase in median total pay of UK employees over the same period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull details and supporting narrative\n\nSee page 222\n\n<!-- image -->",

The purpose of these provisions is to discourage excessive risk-taking and inappropriate behaviours.\n\nThe malus provisions enable the Committee to reduce the amount of unvested bonus or LTIP (including to nil) prior to vesting in specified circumstances, including but not limited to:\n\n- - The individual in question deliberately misleading Barclays, the market and/or shareholders in relation to the financial performance of the Barclays Group\n- - The individual causing harm to Barclays' reputation or where his/her actions have amounted to misconduct, incompetence or negligence\n- - A material restatement of the financial statements of the Barclays Group or any subsidiary, or the Group or any business unit suffering a material downturn in its financial performance\n- - A material failure of risk management in the Barclays Group\n- - A significant deterioration in the financial health of the Barclays Group.\n\nThe clawback provisions enable amounts to be recovered after they have vested, for a period in line with applicable regulations currently seven years from grant (which can be extended to up to 10 years in circumstances where a relevant investigation is ongoing at the end of the initial seven-year period), in circumstance where:\n\n- - The individual in question's actions or omissions have amounted to misbehaviour or material error, and/or\n- - Barclays or the relevant business unit has suffered a material failure of risk management.\n\nIn addition to individual adjustments, the Committee considers and makes collective adjustments to the incentive pool for risk and conduct events. The Committee also adjusts the incentive pool to take account of an assessment of future risks, including conduct, non-financial factors that can support the delivery of a strong risk management, control and conduct culture, and other factors including reputation and impact on customers, markets and other stakeholders. The Committee is supported in its consideration of this by the Board Risk Committee. For 2023, the total impact of risk and conduct-related collective adjustments is a reduction of c.\u00a3185m (2022: c.\u00a3500m).\n\n## Discretion\n\nIn addition to the various operational discretions the Committee can exercise in the performance of its duties (including those discretions set out in the Company's share plan rules), the Committee reserves the right to make either minor or administrative amendments to the Directors' Remuneration Policy to benefit its operation or to make more material amendments in light of new laws, regulations and/or regulatory guidance. The Committee would only exercise this right if it believed it was in the best interests of the Company, and where it is not possible, practicable or proportionate to seek or await shareholder approval at the next AGM.\n\nIn relation to the Executive Directors' annual bonus, the Committee has discretion to determine the appropriate performance conditions applying each year - provided that financial factors will normally guide at least 60% of the bonus opportunity.\n\nAlthough the Committee takes a structured approach to considering the level of annual bonus outcome for the Executive Directors each year, any bonus award is discretionary and the Committee has discretion to award any amount from zero to the maximum value.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report (continued)\n\nIn relation to the LTIP, the Committee again has discretion to determine the appropriate performance conditions - provided that financial measures will normally be at least 70% of the total opportunity. In exceptional circumstances the Committee has discretion to amend performance targets, measures or the number of shares under awards, if circumstances occur that cause the Committee to consider such adjustment to be reasonable. The Committee also has the discretion to reduce the vesting of any award, including to nil, if it deems the outcome inconsistent with the performance delivered.\n\nFor 2023, the Committee did not exercise discretion to adjust the variable pay outcomes as outlined on page 208.\n\n## Performance measures and targets\n\n## Measures\n\nThe performance measures and targets are set annually by the Committee to align with our strategic priorities, ensuring the measures support delivery of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe Committee selects financial performance measures that are fundamental to delivery against the Group's strategy and are considered to be the most important financial measures used by the Executive Directors and the Board to oversee the direction of the business. The non-financial performance measures are chosen to represent key indicators of the success of our strategy, and to provide a balanced view of our performance during the period, which are robustly monitored and reported on to the management team and the Board.\n\n## Targets\n\nTargets for both the annual bonus and LTIP are calibrated to be stretching but achievable, and are aligned with creating value for shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nIn respect of the annual bonus, the financial measures and weightings are disclosed at the start of the relevant performance year. The Committee considers the specific annual bonus targets to be commercially sensitive, and that it would be detrimental to disclose the targets at the start of the relevant performance year. On that basis, the targets and performance against those targets are disclosed at the end of the relevant performance year, in that year's Annual Report on Directors' remuneration, provided that commercial sensitivity is no longer an issue at that time.\n\nIn respect of the LTIP, the financial measures, weightings and targets are disclosed in the Remuneration report published immediately before the awards are granted - which is shortly after at the start of the relevant performance period.\n\nThe Committee selects non-financial performance measures that support the delivery of our strategy and reflect our priorities over the next year or over a multi-year period.\n\n## ESG and remuneration\n\nThe Committee reviews the Executive Directors' incentive measures each year to ensure they continue to support the delivery of our strategic priorities, including ESG priorities.\n\nThe Executive Directors' annual bonus and LTIP have included Climate & sustainability measures for over a decade. The Committee aligns these measures each year with the Group's evolving climate and sustainability ambitions, metrics and targets. Most of our climate-related measures and targets are longer term, including those relating to financing the transition and financed emissions, and progress towards these targets is expected to be variable and non-linear. This is reflected in a higher weighting of Climate & sustainability measures in the LTIP, compared to the annual bonus, as follows:\n\n- - For the 2024-2026 LTIP, 15% of the total opportunity will be determined based on performance measures relating to Climate & sustainability, measuring progress against each of the three pillars of our climate strategy - including our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050 and our commitment to align our financing with the goals and timelines of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n- - For the 2024 annual bonus, 5% of the total opportunity will be determined based on Climate & sustainability measures.\n\nA further 5% of each of the 2024 bonus and the 2024-2026 LTIP will be determined on Colleagues measures, including diversity, inclusion and engagement. Risk & operational excellence measures are weighted at 10% in the 2024 bonus and 5% in the 2024-2026 LTIP, as the management of risk underpins delivery against our strategy and is a key part of the governance of the Group. Outcomes will be determined based on an assessment of performance against a range of measures of our risk culture, operational precision and controls.\n\nIn recent years, the weighting of the Climate & sustainability category in both the LTIP and annual bonus was equal, at 10%. As described earlier, for this year's forward-looking incentives the Committee increased the weighting to 15% in the 2024-2026 LTIP and decreased it to 5% in the 2024 annual bonus. Given the higher maximum opportunity under the LTIP compared to  the annual bonus, these changes equate to an increase in the total value of remuneration that will be determined based on climaterelated measures.",

Venkatakrishnan, the benefits figure also includes the cost to the Company of providing him with relocation support during 2023. This is in line with the Directors' Remuneration Policy and includes immigration assistance, home search support in London, and temporary accommodation in London (which ended on 31 October 2023). Those costs came to c.\u00a3148,000, including the cost to Barclays of paying the income tax and social security resulting from the provision of that relocation support. As referenced in the 2021 Remuneration report, temporary accommodation in London was provided to him for a period of up to two years, following his appointment in November 2021 as Group Chief Executive.",

Performance against each Executive Director's Personal objectives (15% weighting) for 2023 was assessed on an individual basis.\n\nThe outcome for each of the Financial measures was determined on a straight-line basis, between the outcome for threshold performance - which was nil for the profit before tax measure or 20% for the cost: income ratio measure - and 100% for achievement of maximum performance.

Venkatakrishnan and Anna Cross that equates to \u00a31,425,000, and \u00a3879,000 respectively. The Committee reflected on the appropriateness of these outcomes for the 2023 annual bonus, in the context of the performance achieved against the Financial measures, Strategic nonfinancial measures and Personal objectives. The Committee considered the underlying financial health of the Group, which is strong and well-capitalised, and more holistically the performance and contribution of each Executive Director during 2023. The bonus outcomes were considered in the context of those for the wider workforce - ensuring appropriate alignment both this year and over a multi-year period - and also by comparing to historical outcomes for the Executive Directors in the context of performance each year. The Committee believes that the overall 2023 bonus outcomes above are aligned appropriately with stakeholder considerations and with the performance achieved. Based on this, the Committee concluded that no discretionary adjustment was warranted.\n\nIn line with the Directors' Remuneration Policy, and due to the regulations prohibiting dividend equivalents being paid on unvested deferred share awards, the number of shares awarded to each Executive Director under the Share Value Plan (the Group's main employee share plan for granting deferred bonus shares to employees) will be calculated using the share price at the date of award, discounted to reflect the absence of dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period. The valuation will be aligned to IFRS 2, with the market expectations of dividends during the deferral period being assessed by an independent adviser.\n\nThe table below details how the 2023 annual bonus award for each Executive Director will be delivered, along with the face value of the 2024-2026 LTIP award that will be granted alongside the deferred elements of the bonus. This shows the percentage that is in Barclays shares for the annual bonus, and also for variable pay overall (the annual bonus and LTIP combined). Of the annual bonus award for C.S. Venkatakrishnan, 86% will be delivered in Barclays shares, and 77% for Anna Cross. Including the 2024-2026 LTIP awards, a total of 96% of C.S. Venkatakrishnan's 2023 variable pay will be in Barclays shares, and 94% for Anna Cross.\n\n|                      |   Upfront cash bonus \u00a3000 |   Upfront bonus  shares \u00a3000 | Deferred bonus  shares  \u00a3000   | Total annual bonus \u00a3000   | Percentage of bonus  in shares   | 2024-2026 LTIP award \u00a3000   | Percentage of 2023  variable pay in shares   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| C.S.

All shares (both the upfront bonus shares and the deferred bonus shares) are also subject to a one-year holding period from the point of vesting. All of the 2023 variable pay is subject to clawback provisions, which allow the Committee to recover amounts that have been paid in certain circumstances, and the deferred elements are subject to malus provisions, which enable the Committee to delay or reduce the vesting of unvested amounts (including reducing to nil) in certain circumstances.\n\nFurther detail follows on the assessment of the Strategic non-financial measures, and performance against Personal objectives where applicable.\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

Based on Anna Cross's strong performance against both her individual and shared personal objectives, and her strong leadership through 2023, the Committee assessed that an outcome of 14% out of a maximum of 15% was appropriate.\n\n## 5) Vesting of the 2021-2023 LTIP cycle for the current Executive Directors\n\nNo LTIP awards were granted to C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Anna Cross in 2021 as they were not Executive Directors at that time.\n\n## Vesting of the 2021-2023 LTIP cycle for other participants\n\nFormer Group Finance Director Tushar Morzaria is the only remaining participant in the 2021-2023 LTIP cycle, having been granted an award in March 2021 while he still served as an Executive Director.\n\nThe Committee assessed performance against the performance conditions for that LTIP award, based on performance over the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023, with straight-line vesting applied between the threshold and maximum targets shown for the financial measures. The Committee determined that 53.2% of the award will vest, as detailed in the table that follows. Before finalising the vesting, the Committee considered whether this outcome was appropriate in the context of the performance achieved, and concluded that it was - and that no further discretionary adjustment was warranted.\n\nThe vesting portion of the award will be released in five equal annual tranches, starting from March 2024. After release, each tranche of shares is subject to an additional 12-month holding period.\n\nThe value that Tushar Morzaria is expected to receive from the vesting of this award is \u00a31,174,634, estimated (as this 2023 Annual Report will be finalised prior to the vesting date) using the Q4 2023 average share price of \u00a31.4374 (which includes 18% share price depreciation since the date of grant). The performance achieved against the performance targets is shown in the table that follows.",

The international banking peer group used by the Committee when considering the Executive Directors' pay therefore includes other large universal banks from continental Europe, and the large US universal and investment banks. Around half of the peer group are USbased, as these are among the most relevant comparators given their business mix and also form part of the peer group used internally when comparing the Group's performance. Barclays actively competes with those US-based peers for talent, which is reflected in several current and former Executive Directors having been recruited into Barclays from those firms. The Committee also recognises that some of those peers are larger than Barclays, and that market pay levels for executive directors of US companies are often higher than those of UK companies. To help maintain balance, the international banking peer group also includes the larger UK-listed banks most comparable to Barclays.\n\nAn annual review of the Executive Directors' Fixed Pay, in the same way and at the same time as for the wider workforce, is a feature of the Directors' Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in 2023. In February 2024 the Committee reviewed the Fixed Pay for each Executive Director as part of the year-end pay review process for colleagues across the Group. The Committee considered the maximum total compensation opportunity of each Executive Director, driven by their respective levels of Fixed Pay, and noted that in each case the total compensation opportunity is materially less than the median of that offered for comparable roles in our international banking peer group. The Committee considered this relative market positioning in the context of the robust performance and significant personal contribution made by each of the Executive Directors, and determined that Fixed Pay would be increased by 2.5% for both C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Anna Cross - to \u00a32,947,000 and  \u00a31,845,000 respectively, effective 1 March 2024. The Committee noted that these are lower percentage increases than the average fixed pay increase for the wider workforce, and in particular for UK employees within the scope of the 2024 UK pay deal with the union Unite - with a 5.55% budget for salary increases for junior UK employees and a 3.75% budget for other union-recognised employees. To align the Executive Directors' interests with those of shareholders, half of Fixed Pay for each Executive Director is delivered in shares, which are granted quarterly and released in instalments over five years. The other half of their Fixed Pay is delivered in cash, paid monthly via payroll in the same way as salary for other employees.\n\nThe following charts compare each Executive Director's maximum total compensation opportunity for 2024 against the equivalent opportunity across international banking peers. This shows that, even after these Fixed Pay increases, the maximum total compensation opportunity is significantly behind international banking peers, falling between the market lower quartile and median for C.S. Venkatakrishnan and slightly below lower quartile for Anna Cross.\n\nThe charts also show a comparison of the maximum total compensation opportunity of each Executive Director with the equivalent roles at the companies that make up the FTSE 30 (i.e. the 30 largest FTSE 100 constituents by market capitalisation). This shows that the Executive Directors' maximum total compensation opportunity is more competitive, but not inappropriate, compared to the FTSE 30 group. The Committee noted that it would be unlikely for the Group to fill either of the Executive Director roles by recruiting from the other FTSE 30 companies, recognising the necessity for candidates for these roles to have the right breadth and depth of banking knowledge and experience - particularly given Barclays' mix of businesses, as outlined above. However, this comparison is provided alongside the international banking peer group to provide additional UK context.\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

Those reductions accommodate the introduction of a Risk & operational excellence measure, weighted at 10% - reflecting the focus on risk, control and operational excellence.\n\nThe other measures were largely unchanged. Performance measures and weightings are shown below:\n\n## Note\n\n| Performance measure                                                                                                                                                                  | Weighting                                                                                                                                                                            | Metrics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial measures                                                                                                                                                                   | Financial measures                                                                                                                                                                   | Financial measures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Profit before tax (excluding  material items) 1                                                                                                                                      | 50%                                                                                                                                                                                  | A performance target range has been set for this financial measure, which will be disclosed in the next  Remuneration report.

Venkatakrishnan and Anna Cross with face values at grant equal to 140% and 134% of Fixed Pay respectively - which will be based on Fixed Pay before applying the 1 March 2024 increases outlined earlier in this Remuneration report. Those maximum award multiples are in line with those for 2023. These share-based awards ensure alignment with future performance over the three-year assessment period, as well as share price alignment over the long release period (up to eight years from initial date of grant).\n\nFor the 2024-2026 LTIP, changes were made to the financial and non-financial performance measures, compared to the 2023-2025 LTIP cycle granted early in 2023. Within the Financial measures, the weighting of RoTE was increased slightly, from 25% to 30%, given that improving RoTE is a key part of the Group's priorities and revised targets, as set out in the 'Our strategy' section from page 11. This was accommodated via a small reduction to the weighting of relative total shareholder return from 25% to 20%. The RoTE measure is based on RoTE performance achieved in 2026, aligned with the Group's revised targets. This is underpinned by a requirement based on average RoTE across the performance period, to ensure an appropriate level of RoTE is maintained throughout.\n\nWithin the Strategic non-financial measures, the Climate & sustainability weighting is increased from 10% to 15%. To accommodate this, the weighting of the risk-related measure - which this year also incorporates assessment of operational excellence - is reduced from 10% to 5%. The other measures are largely unchanged.\n\nThe Group's Climate & sustainability targets are longer term, through to 2050, and progress towards these targets is expected to be variable and non-linear - hence the increased weighting of Climate & sustainability in the 2024-2026 LTIP and reduced weighting in the 2024 annual bonus.",

Venkatakrishnan and Jes Staley, for their respective periods of service as Group Chief Executive in 2021. Jes Staley was ineligible for an annual bonus in respect of 2021 after he stepped down as Group Chief Executive.\n- 2 The 2020 and 2019 ratios reflect the disclosed 2020 and 2019 single total figures for remuneration for Jes Staley and have not been restated for the decision made by the Committee in 2023 that Jes Staley's unvested bonus and LTIP awards should be forfeited, as outlined earlier in the report.\n\nThe Directors' Remuneration Report regulations provide three options that companies may use to calculate total pay for the employees at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile. Option A was selected as this is the most robust methodology, calculating total pay for all employees on the same basis that the single total figure for remuneration is calculated for Executive Directors. Total pay for each employee includes earned fixed pay, which is made up of salary, any role-based pay and relevant allowances, annual incentives awarded for the 2023 calendar year, and an estimate of pension and benefits for 2023 (based on what new UK hires at each corporate grade currently receive). Other elements of pay such as overtime and shift allowances have been excluded. Calculations use full-time equivalent pay data taken from our HR systems for all UK employees, for each year using the employee population on 31 December 2023.\n\nTotal pay and fixed pay for the UK employees at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile are set out in the table below .\n\n|      | 25th percentile   | 25th percentile   | Median    | Median    | 75th percentile   | 75th percentile   |\n|------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|      | Total pay         | Fixed pay         | Total pay | Fixed pay | Total pay         | Fixed pay         |\n| 2023 | \u00a338,194           | \u00a331,897           | \u00a355,801   | \u00a345,230   | \u00a395,341           | \u00a375,583           |\n| 2022 | \u00a333,711           | \u00a328,300           | \u00a351,493   | \u00a341,608   | \u00a389,911           | \u00a371,071           |\n| 2021 | \u00a331,404           | \u00a326,035           | \u00a348,253   | \u00a339,461   | \u00a385,407           | \u00a367,408           |\n| 2020 | \u00a329,380           | \u00a324,706           | \u00a344,631   | \u00a337,460   | \u00a379,324           | \u00a364,272           |\n| 2019 | \u00a327,875           | \u00a323,348           | \u00a342,362   | \u00a335,158   | \u00a377,488           | \u00a362,263           |\n\nThe Group Chief Executive pay ratios for 2023 are lower than those for 2022, primarily driven by the lower 2023 annual bonus for C.S. Venkatakrishnan as outlined in the 2023 annual bonus outcomes section of this Remuneration report. Higher-than-normal employee salary increases in early 2023 as part of that year's UK pay deal, which were weighted towards more-junior employees, also contributed to the lower pay ratios for 2023.\n\nBarclays' remuneration philosophy is set out earlier in this report, and all remuneration decisions for the Executive Directors and the wider workforce are made within this framework. The Group Chief Executive pay ratios are the outcomes of all of these decisions, which are explained in more detail in the Committee Chair's annual statement. To ensure Executive Director remuneration outcomes are commensurate with those of the wider workforce, each year, when considering whether a discretionary adjustment should be made to the Executive Directors' incentive outcomes, the Committee specifically considers whether the bonus and LTIP outcomes for the Executive Directors appropriately reflect the Group's performance and the remuneration outcomes for the wider workforce.\n\nIt should be noted that the ratios for 2024 are expected to increase, all other things being equal, as it will be the first year in which C.S. Venkatakrishnan is a participant in the LTIP cycle due to vest and be included in the single total figure for remuneration. C.S. Venkatakrishnan's single total remuneration figure for 2023 does not include any LTIP value as he was not an Executive Director at 3\n\n- the time of the relevant LTIP grant .\n\n## Note:\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

Venkatakrishnan was appointed as Group Chief Executive with effect from 1 November 2021. His remuneration figures for 2021 are annualised to a full-year equivalent for the purpose of this comparison. The value of his benefits includes the cost to the Group of providing him with relocation support, including immigration assistance, home search support in London, and payments (which ended on 31 October 2023) for temporary accommodation in London. No percentage change figures can be calculated for 2020/21 as he did not receive any remuneration in respect of services provided as an Executive Director in 2020.\n- 2 Anna Cross was appointed as Group Finance Director with effect from 23 April 2022. Her remuneration figures for 2022 are annualised to a full-year equivalent for the purpose of this comparison. No percentage change figures can be calculated for 2021/22 as she did not receive any remuneration in respect of services provided as an Executive Director in 2021.\n- 3 The Barclays PLC comparison is included because this is a statutory requirement, though Barclays PLC employs only a very small number of Head Office employees (51 in 2023).\n- 4 Jes Staley's bonus figures reflect the disclosed figures and have not been restated for the decision made by the Committee in 2023 that Jes Staley should be ineligible for 2021 bonus and should forfeit his unvested bonus awards, as outlined earlier in this Remuneration report.\n\nFor C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Anna Cross, the 2022 to 2023 Fixed Pay changes reflect the 3.4% and 4.3% increases agreed respectively for each, effective 1 March 2023. The annual bonus outcome for C.S. Venkatakrishnan is down 27% and the outcome for Anna Cross is down 25% (on a full-time equivalent basis) - the 2023 annual bonus outcomes section of this Remuneration report provides more information. The reduction in the value of benefits for C.S. Venkatakrishnan in 2023 primarily reflects his temporary accommodation in London ending during the year and some relocation-related benefits costs in 2022 that were not repeated in 2023.\n\nFor UK employees across the Group, the 9% increase in median fixed pay primarily reflects higher-than-normal salary increases in early 2023 as part of that year's UK pay deal. The 5% decrease in median bonus in respect of 2023 performance reflects the change in pay structure during 2023 to simplify pay for junior employees in Barclays UK and support functions in the UK. For some employees, a portion of previous bonus opportunity was transferred into fixed pay - leading to lower 2023 bonus outcomes for those employees. The 11% increase in benefits is largely due to increased life assurance and private medical insurance costs.\n\nBarclays PLC only employs a very small number of Head Office employees (51 in 2023), and there is frequent movement of employees between Barclays PLC and other entities within the Barclays Group. For comparison purposes the Barclays PLC figures are therefore based only on the 40 individuals who were employed by Barclays PLC in both years.",

Additional information has been provided in the notes that follow where 2022/2023 percentage changes in fees, which excludes benefits, were greater than 10%.\n- 2 Fees for the Group Chairman and Non-Executive Director roles on the Board and Board Committees of Barclays PLC were increased by 5%, with effect from 1 January 2023. This excluded the Board Sustainability Committee, which was established on 23 March 2023.\n- 3 Mohamed A. El-Erian joined the Board Nominations Committee with effect from 1 September 2022 and received pro-rata fees for that year. For 2023, the full-year fees were paid, therefore increasing the fees paid from 2022 to 2023.\n- 4 Dawn Fitzpatrick joined the Board Sustainability Committee with effect from 23 March 2023 and received pro-rata fees for that year, therefore increasing the fees paid from 2022 to 2023.\n- 5 Mary Francis was appointed the BBPLC Consumer Duty Champion with effect from 10 November 2022 and received pro-rata fees for that year. For 2023, full-year fees for that role were paid. She  also joined the Board Sustainability Committee with effect from 23 March 2023 and received pro-rata fees for that year, therefore increasing the fees paid from 2022 to 2023.\n- 6 The increase in fees paid from 2022 to 2023 for Diane Schueneman was primarily driven by an increase in fees for her role as Chair of Barclays Execution Services Limited and as a NonExecutive Director of Barclays US LLC.\n- 7 Julia Wilson joined the Board Nominations Committee and Board Risk Committee with effect from 1 September 2022 and received pro-rata fees for that year. For 2023, the full-year fees for that role were paid. She also joined the Board Sustainability Committee with effect from 23 March 2023, the Barclays Bank PLC Board with effect from 1 April 2023, and the Board Remuneration Committee with effect from 1 July 2023. She was appointed Chair of the Board Audit Committee with effect from 1 April 2023 and Chair of the Barclays Capital Securities Limited Board with effect from 24 April 2023, and received pro-rata fees for that year - therefore increasing the fees paid from 2022 to 2023.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\nA year-on-year comparison of Group compensation costs and of distributions to shareholders is shown below.

All Barclays employees, including the Executive Directors, are prohibited from investment activities that may create conflicts of interest, and in particular from using personal hedging strategies to undermine the risk alignment effects embedded in remuneration, or any other hedging in respect of Barclays securities.

Venkatakrishnan and Anna Cross, in each case using the Q4 2023 average Barclays ordinary share price of \u00a31.4374.\n\nFor C.S. Venkatakrishnan, the shareholding requirement is 233% of year-end Fixed Pay and for Anna Cross it is 224% of year-end Fixed Pay. C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Anna Cross have five years from their respective dates of appointment as Executive Directors to meet this requirement. Barclays shares held beneficially by each Executive Director count towards the shareholding requirement, as well as unvested shares that are not subject to performance conditions (net of estimated tax and social security).\n\nUnvested shares that are still subject to performance conditions do not count towards the shareholding requirements, but contribute to aligning the Executive Directors' interests with those of shareholders through share price exposure - and are therefore shown below after deduction of estimated income tax and social security withholding. For the unvested shares subject to performance conditions, the proportion that is ultimately released may range from 0% to 100% depending on the achievement of the performance measures for each award, and on continued employment in accordance with the relevant plan rules and the Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n\nExecutive Directors are issued a shareholding statement twice yearly, informing them of the shareholding requirement and the level of shareholding they are required to meet and maintain. After an Executive Director has stepped down, the shareholding requirement is monitored and maintained through self-certification, to the extent it is not met via shares held within the Group's employee share plans and nominee accounts.\n\n## C.S.

The role of the Committee, as set out in the Terms of Reference, is to:\n\n- \u00b7 Set the overarching principles and parameters of remuneration policy across the Group\n- \u00b7 Consider and approve the remuneration arrangements of (i) the Group Chair, (ii) the Executive Directors, (iii) members of the Barclays Group Executive Committee and any other senior executives specified by the Committee from time to time, and (iv) all other Group employees whose total annual compensation is equal to or exceeds an amount determined by the Committee from time to time\n- \u00b7 Exercise oversight of remuneration issues (including retirement benefits).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference are available at home.barclays/\n\nwho-we-are/our-governance/board-committees\n\n## Advisers to the Committee\n\nThe Committee appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as its independent adviser in October 2017. The Committee considered the advice provided by PwC to the Committee during the year and was satisfied that the advice is independent and objective. PwC is a signatory to the voluntary code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. PwC was paid \u00a3142,000 (excluding VAT) in fees for its advice to the Committee in 2023 relating to the remuneration of the Directors (either exclusively or along with other employees within the Committee's Terms of Reference). In addition to advising the Committee, PwC provided unrelated consulting advice to the Group in respect of strategic advice on business, regulation, risk and controls, operational models and cost, taxation, technology, pensions, HR and sustainability issues.\n\nThroughout 2023, Willis Towers Watson (WTW) provided the Committee with market data on compensation, as context when considering incentive levels and remuneration packages. WTW was paid \u00a378,500 (excluding VAT) in fees for these services. In addition to the services provided to the Committee, WTW also provides market data on compensation for other roles below Board level, pensions and benefits advice and brokerage services to the Barclays Group, and administration services to a number of the Group's pension funds.\n\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Committee also considered the views of the Group Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, the Group Human Resources Director and the Group Reward and Performance Director. The Group Finance Director and the Group Chief Risk Officer provided regular updates on Group and business financial performance and risk profiles respectively. The Head of Corporate Communications attended when requested, to advise on reward communications and disclosures. The Group General, Counsel or other representatives from the Legal function, and the Company Secretary advised on legal and governance-related matters. No Barclays employee or Director participated in decisions of the Committee relating to his or her own remuneration. No other advisers provided services to the Committee in the year.\n\n## Committee effectiveness in 2023\n\nThe results of the Committee effectiveness review for 2023 confirm the Committee is operating effectively. It is considered to be well constituted and chaired, providing an effective and appropriate level of constructive challenge and oversight of the areas within its remit, including in respect of areas of judgement and discretion. The review highlights that the Committee is considered to have the right level of skills and experience, and is of an appropriate size, having benefited from the addition of new members during the year. Feedback indicates that the Committee is considered to operate at the right level of debate, and confirms that the allocation of time between agenda items in Committee meetings is appropriate, with sufficient time for discussion and challenge.\n\nThe Committee's interaction with the Board, Board Committees and senior management is considered effective, noting the strong level of support provided to the Committee by senior management, and that sufficient time is allocated at Board meetings for the Chair to report to the Board on the work of the Committee. The Committee's interaction with the BBPLC and BBUKPLC Board Remuneration Committees was also considered effective, and operates in line with regulatory requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

These covered matters such as progress against our climate strategy, progress against targets and target setting, and stakeholder engagement. Outside of formal Board briefings, the Group Head of Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility also engaged with Board members on matters relating to the Group's climate strategy. Please see the Key Board activities section on page 153 for further detail about what the Board considered in relation to climate and sustainability matters in 2023.\n\nThe Board is supported in its work by its Committees, each of which has its own Committee terms of reference setting out its remit and decision-making powers. The Chairs of each of the Board Committees provide a report on the work of their Committee at every scheduled Board meeting.\n\n## Board Sustainability Committee\n\nDuring 2023, the Board Sustainability Committee met four times. It reviewed significant climate and sustainability updates and proposals prior to Board consideration and received regular progress updates from management in relation to the Group's climate and sustainability strategy, as well as internal and external briefings on climate and\n\nsustainability matters. Please refer to page 180 for further detail on the work of the Board Sustainability Committee.\n\n## Board Risk Committee\n\nDuring 2023, the Board Risk Committee received quarterly reports from the businesses (including the Corporate and Investment Bank and Barclays UK) on their climate strategy and also received an update from the Head of Climate Risk. The Committee received a teach-in from the Risk function, providing an overview of how climate change was driving financial and operational risks, the materiality of their impact and how Barclays was managing them through the Climate Principal Risk Framework. The Committee also received three Climate risk dashboards during the year, updating the Committee with key Climate risk metrics. Please refer to page 174 for further detail on the work of the Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Board Audit Committee\n\nThe Board Audit Committee provides oversight of the climate and sustainability disclosures within the Group's narrative reporting, receiving input also from the Board Sustainability Committee on those disclosures.

These committees are mandated and form part of Barclays' formal governance architecture. They are convened to oversee a specific attribute of the Barclays control framework. Each committee is itself governed by Terms of Reference that lay out the duties, decision-making authority and escalation route of any material issues.\n\nThe executive management committees receive regular briefings on matters including climate change. Both risks and opportunities are considered by management. Climate-related risks are assessed and escalated as appropriate through the various risk forums. In 2023 the Group Sustainability Committee was established as a dedicated forum to identify and discuss climate-related matters across the Group with a specific mandate to review and propose amendments to the Group Climate strategy prior to consideration by Group ExCo.\n\n## Group Executive Committee (Group ExCo)\n\nThroughout 2023 Group ExCo has been provided with regular updates on our climate strategy, including progress on our commitments, stakeholder engagement and expectations, and target-setting.\n\nThe Group Head of PPCR is a member of Group ExCo and is accountable for ensuring the Group's societal purpose is present in strategic decision-making at the highest levels in the organisation. The Group Head of PPCR, and their team, regularly updates Group ExCo on a range of Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility matters, covering key government and regulatory policy, regulator engagement and ESG matters, including climate. In particular, the Group Head of PPCR provided updates on the Climate strategy including proposed amendments to the oil and gas policy and the establishment of new targets for aviation, agriculture and commercial real estate. Updates were also provided on a range of other matters, such as greenwashing, deforestation and biodiversity.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer is a member of Group ExCo and is accountable for the approach to managing climate-related\n\nfinancial and operational risks to Barclays; this is implemented within the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF).\n\nDuring 2023, Group ExCo established the Group Sustainability Committee to advise and provide recommendations on a broad range of sustainability issues as further described in the Climate and Sustainability Governance section of this report. Group ExCo was presented with updates on the proposed policy for upstream oil & gas financing.\n\nCapturing the opportunity as we transition towards a low-carbon economy was identified as a key strategic growth pillar for Barclays in 2022 and informed the setting of a $1trn Sustainable and Transition Financing target by the end of 2030. In 2023, a Group sustainable finance strategy was developed by the new CIB Global Head of Sustainable Finance and the BUK Head of Social Purpose & Sustainable Finance, setting out areas of strategic focus for the group in delivering the $1trn target. The strategy was presented to Group ExCo and Group Board.\n\nAll submissions to the Barclays PLC Board on Climate Strategy and climate-related matters are reviewed either by Group ExCo or the relevant Group ExCo member in advance.\n\n## Executive Remuneration\n\nAnnual bonus outcomes and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) award outcomes for the Executive Directors of Barclays PLC are assessed against a framework of measures set by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the performance period for each award. A proportion of both annual bonus and LTIP is driven by nonfinancial performance measures, including measures relating to climate and sustainability.\n\nThe weighting of the Climate and sustainability category is 15% in the 2024-2026 LTIP and 5% in the 2024 annual bonus. The climate-related measures reflect our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, including our commitment to align our financing with the goals and timelines of the Paris Climate Agreement. The measures include progress towards our Sustainable and Transition Financing target, reducing financed emissions and operational emissions, and supporting our communities.\n\nFurther details can be found in our Remuneration report from page 191 .\n\n## Group Sustainability Committee (GSC)\n\nThe Group Sustainability Committee (GSC), a sub-committee of Group ExCo, is chaired by the Group Head of PPCR with senior representation from the Group Head of Sustainability, Head of Sustainable Finance  for CIB and Head of Social Purpose and Sustainable Finance for Barclays UK, as well as members representing key functions across the Group.\n\nThe GSC is responsible for recommending the overall Group sustainability strategy for approval by Group ExCo, and ensuring alignment of business unit climate strategies to the overall strategy. The GSC is also responsible for determining, agreeing or recommending position statements, frameworks, targets, relevant disclosures and advocacy areas necessary to support strategy delivery and agreeing the strategic change priorities to support overall sustainability strategy.\n\n## Group Risk Committee (GRC)\n\nThe GRC is the designated forum to review and recommend, where necessary, submissions to the BRC. The GRC is the most senior risk executive body, and it monitors Principal Risks and key topics material to Barclays such as climate change. In 2023, in relation to climate, the GRC reviewed:\n\n- \u00b7 key regulatory, global policy and geopolitical themes and management action proposed and taken\n- \u00b7 physical and transition risk metrics, including portfolio alignment progress against net zero sector targets and mitigation plans\n- \u00b7 the Climate Risk Framework and Climate Risk Appetite constraints\n- \u00b7 scenario theme, severity and results of the climate stress test and internal stress test, including implications on stress loss limits\n\nIn relation to Principal Risks, the GRC undertakes the following:\n\n- \u00b7 review and monitor the risk profile of material nature for each Principal Risk\n- \u00b7 approve for consideration by Barclays PLC Board and BBPLC Board Risk Committee the Risk Appetite Statement for each Principal Risk\n- \u00b7 annually review and approve the Principal Risk Framework for consideration by the Barclays PLC Board and BBPLC Board Risk Committee.\n\nThe GRC receives escalations from the Climate Risk Committee, noting none were received in 2023",

This supports the longevity of our business and also enhances our ability to serve our clients and support them in improving their own sustainability practices and disclosures.\n\n## Managing environmental and social risks\n\nEnvironmental and social risks are governed and managed through our Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF), setting our strategic approach for risk management by defining standards, objectives and responsibilities for all areas of Barclays. The ERMF is complemented by a number of other frameworks, policies and standards, all of which are aligned to individual Principal Risks.\n\nOur Climate Change Statement sets out our current restrictions on business appetite and includes restrictions in respect of certain sensitive energy subsectors (thermal coal mining, coal-fired power generation, mountain-top coal removal, upstream oil & gas and unconventional oil & gas including oil sands, Arctic oil & gas, hydraulic fracturing ('fracking'), Amazon oil & gas, ultra-deep water and extra heavy oil), as well as referencing new enhanced due diligence requirements for biomass which will be introduced during 2024.\n\nWe have also established positions on Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, World Heritage and Ramsar Wetlands and on the Defence and Security sector. In addition, we have developed internal standards for each of these which reflect these positions in more detail.\n\nThese standards, which sit under the management of Reputation risk in the ERMF, determine our approach to climate change and relevant sensitive sectors and are considered as part of our existing transaction origination, review and approval process.\n\n## Enhanced Due Diligence\n\nOur standards currently include an enhanced due diligence approach for certain clients operating in the following energy sub-sectors covered by our Climate Change Statement: thermal coal mining, coal-fired power generation, mountain-top coal removal, oil sands, Arctic oil & gas and hydraulic fracturing ('fracking') and clients in-scope of our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands and Defence and Security standards where a similar approach is taken. This approach will be extended to cover the additional sectors brought into scope of the updated Climate Change Statement.\n\nAll clients in-scope of the above mentioned  standards must be assessed annually via a detailed Sustainability enhanced due diligence questionnaire, which is used to evaluate their performance on a range of environmental and social issues and may be supplemented by a review of client policies / procedures, further client engagement and adverse media checks as appropriate. This annual review either generates an Environmental and Social Impact (ESI) risk rating (low, medium, high), or in the case of Defence and Security an assessment against risk appetite, which in turn determines whether further review and client engagement may be required throughout the year.\n\nHigh and certain medium ESI rated clients would require further risk assessment prior to execution of transactions with those clients.\n\nWe undertook 593 (2022:597) reviews in 2023, being a combination of Sustainability annual due diligence reviews and individual transaction reviews. Environmental risk reviews are captured within the businessas-usual credit process and are therefore no longer included within this number.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nAs part of our management of environmental and social risks, we may require further client engagement in relation to the specific environmental and social risks that we have identified as part of our enhanced due diligence process.\n\nWe have used this engagement as an opportunity to gain a more detailed understanding of the risks and challenges that the client is facing and to better understand any climate transition plan that they may have.\n\n## Escalation and decision-making\n\nWhere client relationships or transactions are assessed as higher-risk (high or medium ESI rating) or outside appetite (in the case of Defence and Security) following a Sustainability enhanced due diligence review, they are then considered for escalation to the appropriate business unit review committee (e.g. BBplc Transaction Review Committee) for consideration and a decision on whether to proceed if transaction related. Business unit review committees comprise of Business management and representatives from the control functions, including Reputation risk.\n\nShould the front office business team or the Sustainability and ESG team believe the issues are sufficiently material, these clients/relationships would be escalated to the Group Reputation Risk Committee (GRRC) for more senior consideration and decision.\n\nGRRC includes representation from the Group Executive Committee.\n\nThese Committees may make the following determinations:\n\n- \u00b7 approve the transaction or relationship\n- \u00b7 reject the transaction or relationship\n- \u00b7 approve the transaction or relationship, subject to prescribed modifications\n- \u00b7 escalate the review of the transaction or relationship to the Barclays Group CEO.",

Over the past several years, Barclays has sought to reduce the size of its supply chain while at the same time creating opportunities for diverse suppliers 3 which encompass micro, small or medium-sized enterprises and diverse-owned 4 businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see further details on our requirements of external suppliers at: home.barclays/who-we-are/ our-suppliers/our-requirements-of-externalsuppliers/\n\n## Highlights\n\nGlobal spend with micro, small and medium-sized enterprises\n\nand diverse-owned suppliers\n\n8.5% (2022: 8.5%)\n\n93% Prompt payment rate (2022: 93%)\n\n## Third party operational and reputational risk management\n\nBarclays Directors, via management, must effectively manage, monitor and mitigate risks in our supply chain. We expect our Third Party Service Providers (TPSP) to make responsible decisions that, where relevant, take our stakeholders' needs into account in both the short and long term.\n\nBarclays expects the TPSPs to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards within the geographies in which they operate. Barclays' standard approach 5 to new TPSP on-boarding and renewal begins by assessing the services that are being provided and ascertaining the level of risk. TPSPs that are assessed as being above a low risk of exposure from a business risk perspective (at the point of onboarding and on an ongoing basis) are subject to\n\nBarclays' Supplier Control obligations (SCOs). TPSPs to whom the SCOs apply become managed TPSPs and are subject to ongoing management and controls assurance during the term of service. Prior to contractual agreement and service go live, these TPSPs are required to complete a pre-contractual questionnaire which captures their adherence to the SCOs and Barclays' TPSP Code of Conduct (TPSP CoC). The TPSP CoC encourages our TPSPs to adopt our approach to doing business and details our expectations for matters including environmental management, human rights, diversity and inclusion and also for living the Barclays Values.\n\nManaged TPSPs are subject to controls assurance on an annual basis to assess whether the controls required of them under the SCOs are maintained and operating effectively. They are also asked to complete an annual self-certification against the individual topics contained within the TPSP CoC. Where TPSPs are unable to meet our expectations under the TPSP CoC and SCOs, the issue will be escalated and we will look for options to manage the risk, which may include additional oversight, heightened Barclays controls or electing not to do business with the TPSP. The TPSP CoC and SCOs are published on the Barclays public website for all new and existing suppliers to view and are refreshed periodically.\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Includes non-addressable spend and One Time Vendors (OTV).\n- 2 92% by invoice value\n- 3 Spending between Barclays and diverse suppliers is considered first-tier spending. Spending between Barclays' first-tier suppliers that can trace subcontracted spend with diverse suppliers on Barclays-specific work is considered second-tier direct spending.\n- 4 For Barclays, diverse suppliers are defined as either size diverse (small and medium sized enterprises) or ownership diverse (majority owned, controlled and operated by protected class groups, such as women, ethnic minorities, LGBT+, persons with disabilities, military veterans and for-profit social enterprises)\n- 5 We do have relationships with financial institutions and market counterparties which, because of the nature of the services being provided (such as international account holding services), are not subject to our usual TPSP on-boarding procedures and which are therefore not subject to the TPSP CoC.\n\n+\n\nmeasure prompt payment globally by calculating the percentage of TPSP spend paid within 45 days following invoice date.\n\nThe measurement applies against all invoices by value over a three-month rolling average period for all entities where invoices are managed centrally. At the end of 2023, we achieved 93% on-time payment to our TPSPs compared to 93% at the end of 2022, exceeding our public commitment to pay 85% of TPSPs on time (by invoice value).\n\nThe need to promptly pay our diverse TPSPs became even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Barclays established a process to expedite the payments for diverse TPSPs at this critical time. This process remained in place during 2023.\n\nBarclays is proud to be a signatory of the Prompt Payment Code in the UK and we also work closely with the Small Business Commissioner and other organisations, including Good Business Pays, to educate the public on late payments and the impact they can have on businesses and business owners, and to raise the social conscience of larger businesses who do not pay on time.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in our supply chain\n\nBarclays believes that diversity across our supply chain expands our ability to attract and harness innovative solutions in the market that complement our own capabilities, while simultaneously creating value for customers and clients, and economic opportunities for wider, underrepresented segments of society. This is why we launched our first Global Supplier Diversity (GSD) initiative, now celebrating 10 years of impact since 2013. The GSD initiative aims to position Barclays as a leader in providing inclusive procurement opportunities and driving economic impact to diverse businesses - diverse in size, ownership make-up or mission.\n\nAs part of our GSD initiative in 2023, 8.5% of our global addressable spend 1 was placed with small and medium-sized enterprises and diverse-owned\n\nbusinesses as measured by first- and second-tier direct spending. First-tier suppliers are contracted directly by Barclays and second-tier direct suppliers are subcontractors to first-tier suppliers on Barclays-specific work. Ownershipdiverse businesses are majority owned, controlled and operated by protected class groups, such as women, ethnic minorities, LGBT+, persons with disabilities, military veterans and for-profit social enterprises. In 2023, we added a new\n\nPlease see further details on our climate change initiatives in our supply chain within our Achieving net zero operations section from page 73 within the Climate and\n\nSustainability report.\n\n## Payment on time\n\nPrompt payment is critical to the cash flow of every business, and especially to smaller businesses within the supply chain as cash flow issues are a major contributor to business failure. We aim to pay our TPSPs within clearly defined terms, and to help ensure there is a proper process for dealing with any issues that may arise. We",

Though a small segment of our diverse supplier spend, we will recognise and account for spend with businesses that are driven primarily by a social mission where they do not already qualify as small or ownership-diverse.\n\nIn support of the GSD initiative, Barclays is a corporate member of, and plays an important role with, several of the most prominent domestic and international diverse supplier certification organisations including National Minority Supplier Development Council (nmsdc.org), Minority Supplier Development UK (msduk.org.uk), Women's Business Enterprise National Council (wbenc.org), WeConnect International (weconnectinternational.org), National LGBTQ Chamber of Commerce (nglcc.org), OutBritain (outbritain.co.uk), National Veteran Owned Businesses Association (NaVoba.org) and Disability:IN (disabilityIn.org).\n\nIn 2021, we pledged to double our spend with Black and women-owned businesses by 2025, with 2020 as the baseline year, and to grow overall spend with SMEs and diverse-owned businesses to 10% of Barclays annual global addressable spend. As of 2023, we are tracking to plan to double spend with Black and womenowned businesses by 2025 and to meet the overall 10% diverse supplier spend goal.\n\nAs we institutionalise DEI across our supply chain, the aim is for service providers, which make up 70% of our addressable spend to have a diversity and inclusion policy or standard in place by 2025. We are continuing to engage and assess our suppliers and will report against our progress in the future.\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 Addressable spend is defined as external costs incurred by Barclays in the normal course of business where Procurement has influence over where the spend is placed. It excludes costs such as regulatory fines or charges, exchange fees, taxation, employee expenses or litigation costs, property rent.\n\n## Modern slavery in our supply chain\n\nBarclays is committed to trying to identify and seeking to address modern slavery risks in our supply chain.\n\nRegardless of the industry or geography in which our Third Party Service Providers (TPSP) operate, we require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We describe our standard process of TPSP onboarding and renewal in the \"Third Party operational and reputational risk management\" section above.\n\nTPSPs that are assessed as being above a low risk of exposure from a business risk perspective become managed TPSPs and are requested to complete an annual selfattestation against topics contained within our TPSP Code of Conduct (TPSP CoC).\n\nThe TPSP CoC identifies our expectations with regards to respecting human rights through areas such as occupational health and safety, freely chosen employment, avoidance of child labour and practices which could lead to exploitation of workers, freedom of religion and belief in the workplace, freedom of association and collective bargaining, zero tolerance for discrimination, harassment and abuse, accessible grievance and whistleblowing mechanisms. These expectations (which relate to human rights topics) are an important part of our efforts to meet our responsibility to respect human rights.\n\nWe continue to strengthen the way we identify and assess modern slavery and we describe the ways we aim to do this in our Modern Slavery Statement.\n\nWe are continuing to work with our TPSPs to support our ambition that those making up 70% of our addressable spend 1 will have a modern slavery policy or standard in place by 2025.\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 Addressable spend is defined as external costs incurred by Barclays in the normal course of business where Procurement has influence over where the spend is placed. It excludes costs such as regulatory fines or charges, exchange fees, taxation, employee expenses or litigation costs, property rent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Human rights\n\nBarclays continues to take action to enhance and further embed our approach to respecting human rights.\n\nDuring 2023 we worked towards two important milestones for our human rights work.\n\nWe completed a saliency assessment of human rights risks in our Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) financing portfolio to guide our next steps in enhancing the CIB approach to managing human rights risks.\n\nInsights from the saliency assessment informed updates to Barclays' Statement on Human Rights, which we published alongside this Annual Report. The Statement seeks to reflect our evolving approach to human rights and align with the relevant normative frameworks, in particular the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).\n\nThe Statement reiterates our commitment to respecting human rights as defined in the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (ILO Declaration). Our approach is guided by the UNGPs and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct. It also incorporates our Focus Areas for Progress, which set out our plans to enhance our approach to respecting human rights.\n\nIn addition, during 2023 we continued our efforts to monitor issues and developments globally that may present new or elevated human rights risks and worked to evaluate our potential involvement and consider our responsibilities to seek to address, these risks.\n\nWe also continued to embed human rights considerations into our position statements and related enhanced due diligence approach. For example, in our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities Statement we have introduced a requirement for in-scope clients to have a policy commitment to respect human rights across their operations and supply chain and the expectation that they undertake human rights due diligence across their operations and supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Engagement took place through a series of focused discussions, mostly facilitated by Shift.\n\nOur internal engagement included a series of workshops with colleagues from a range of functions including Sustainability, Risk, Compliance, Legal and the business and across the US, UK and APAC, followed by deep dive interviews with some of these colleagues.\n\nThe insights gathered during this proactive engagement, complemented by insights from previous relevant engagement with CSOs, as well as desk-based research by the Barclays Social Policy team and Shift, informed the identification of a long list of human rights impacts.\n\nThese impacts were then prioritised, through consideration of the relative severity of the impacts on people and their likelihood of occurrence, to produce a shortlist.

For example, sea level rise and extreme weather can threaten the  rights to housing, to adequate standard of living, to food and water; and predicted  increases in disease impact right to health. The transition from fossil fuels to low  carbon energy is not without its own risks and challenges, climate change  mitigation activities can contribute to impacts such as job losses and energy  scarcity for communities who depend on fossil fuels. The development of clean  energy sources can also have human rights impacts including exploitative land  and labour practices as well as impact vulnerable communities like Indigenous  Peoples. |\n| Indigenous  Peoples                                            | International law guarantees the rights of Indigenous Peoples, including traditional  lands, cultural preservation, livelihoods, knowledge,  security and their right to give  or withhold their consent for any action that would affect their lands, territories or  rights (Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)).Indigenous Peoples' rights are  increasingly being threatened, particularly in relation to the activities of certain  sectors such as extractive, energy, and agriculture. The transition to renewable  energy could exacerbate these impacts; recent research suggests that over half  of energy transition metals and minerals projects are located on or near  1                                                                    |\n| Land      Rights                                               | Business practices such as community relocation and resettlements are not  uncommon in certain sectors, such as mining and agriculture, and can impact a  range of human rights, including the right to adequate housing, food, water,  health, education, and decent work. Resistance and protest against resettlement  or other potential infringements of land-related rights by human rights defenders  and local communities could also expose people to risk of additional adverse  impacts such as suppression of freedom of association, detention or even                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Modern  Slavery                                                | An estimated 50 million people were living in situations of modern slavery on any  given day in 2021, according to the latest Global Estimates of Modern Slavery 2 .

Our aim is to continue to identify the salient human rights impacts we may be connected to through our operations and value chain. We aim to initiate further saliency assessments, incorporating engagement with appropriate stakeholders.\n\n## Identify salient issues beyond CIB\n\n- \u00b7 Extend saliency assessment to other areas of the bank, looking to engage with internal and external stakeholders\n\nEnhance sustainability policies and EDD to reflect salient issues for CIB\n\n- \u00b7 Review existing sustainability policies and EDDs and work to integrate salient issues\n- \u00b7 Evolve our approach to engaging with clients when responding to salient issues\n\nSupport a transition to a low-carbon economy which accounts for the social risks as well as the opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 Work to consider just transition in our Transition Plan and Client Transition Framework\n- \u00b7 Continue engagement to help shape the way just transition is defined and implemented in practice\n\n## Policies and enhanced due diligence\n\nOur aim is to enhance our existing position statements and associated enhanced due diligence processes to better reflect the salient human rights issues identified through our assessment of CIB. Additionally, in response to analysis of our exposure to salient issues through our CIB financing portfolio, we may consider the development of additional position statements. To build on our risk identification and assessment, we aim to develop a pilot for engaging with clients in response to the salient risks identified.\n\n## Just transition\n\nBarclays seeks to support a just transition which accounts for the potential social risks as well as opportunities of the energy transition and seeks effective dialogue with relevant stakeholders.\n\nWe have taken steps to pilot the approach to just transition in our Client Transition Framework, and will consider the findings of the pilot in our engagement with clients. We also intend to include social considerations as we develop our transition plan.\n\nWe believe that industry engagement is essential to advance our collective understanding and strategy to ensure a just transition.

We are endeavouring to support customers during these challenging times, and during 2023 have continued to focus on four key areas:\n\n- 1.using data analytics to determine which customers are in need of support and the appropriate type of support;\n- 2.engaging those customers impacted to increase awareness of products, tools and support available;\n- 3.understanding customers' needs and developing solutions to provide greater support; and\n- 4.ensuring colleagues have, and are aware of, the financial health tools to enable them to support customers.\n- To better support financially vulnerable customers, we have enhanced our Barclays' tools, training, support and systems, continuing to improve our ongoing support when customers need us the most.\n\nIn July 2023 Barclays implemented support measures following the introduction of the Mortgage Charter by HMT. These measures provided residential mortgage customers, who are up to date with their payments, with a range of support options which included:\n\n- \u00b7 The ability to apply to extend the term of their mortgage to reduce their monthly payment amount .\n- \u00b7 Apply to switch their mortgage from repayment to interest only for a period of 6 months to temporarily reduce their monthly payment amount.\n\nBarclays continued a nationwide engagement campaign into 2023, providing practical support and guidance to the cost of living crisis. Launching at the end of 2022 and reaching across 254 local and national commercial radio stations; in print across 12 major national dailies and 26 major regional titles. In Q1/Q2 2023, the campaign extended with additional AV campaign across TV, cinema and VOD reaching 99% of our core audience with practical support and guidance.\n\nWe delivered content targeted to the needs of our most vulnerable audiences with content across video, social media and owned channels.\n\nIn the second half of the year, we launched new content marketing activity in collaboration with influencers to engage consumers around topics of everyday money management, travel and remortgaging. Guiding people on how to make money work better for them through the rising pressures of inflation, with this activity targeted at both low financial wellbeing and broader audiences.

These customer engagement strategies are bank-initiated and largely focused around proactive communications, based on sets of customer behavioural triggers, whilst we also support customers who initiate contact with us.\n\nOur primary focus is to support customers whose account behaviours are showing signs of possible early financial difficulty, and look to help customers maintain or regain control of their finances.\n\n+\n\nFurther details can be found on page 39 in  relation to  Consumer  Duty  within  the  Strategic  Report    in Part 1 of the Annual Report\n\n## Access to banking\n\nCustomers are looking for more convenient, simpler ways to bank that fit their lives, including banking digitally: our mobile app has over 11.0 million active users. We are continuing to help deliver these solutions at pace.\n\nAlongside our investment in technology enabling digital customers to access tools and products whenever they need them, we're aiming to transform the role of physical locations across the UK to ensure non digitally engaged customers can still access banking. We are working with other banks, the Post Office and LINK, to keep Barclays at the heart of the community.\n\nWe have launched our own initiatives, including a cashback without purchase service and Barclays Local - the largest network of alternative branch formats in the UK, with a presence in over 300 locations.\n\nAlongside these changes, we are investing in multi-skilled training for our colleagues so they are better able to serve customers in ways that meet their needs today as well as breaking down internal barriers to enable quicker resolution of customer queries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on mobile banking vans and how to book an appointment can be found at: events.uk.barclays/barclaysvan/\n\n## Economic crime and scams\n\nWe take our responsibility to protect our customers' money very seriously and are proud to have one of the lowest scam rates and highest reimbursement rates in the industry. This is due to our continued investment in robust security systems and our established programme to educate customers and prevent them from falling victim to scams.\n\nWe have a dedicated Fraud and Scams hub on the Barclays website, which hosts a variety of content and resources to help the public learn how to keep themselves safe.\n\nAdditionally, for each of the 50 million+ payments our UK customers make every month, our fraud detection systems and machine learning models determine in less than a second if it is likely to be a fraudster rather than the customer, or if our customer appears at risk of being scammed. If the transaction seems risky, the customer is presented with additional checks prior to the payment being released.",

The Barclays Money Management Hub gives us the ability to provide proactive money management information directly to customers, giving them a better grasp on their spending behaviours and steps they can take to improve their financial wellbeing and provide customers greater control over\n\ntheir finances.\n\nWe also have a range of early intervention strategies which aim to support customers whose account behaviours may be showing signs of lacking financial resilience. These strategies largely focus on proactive communication with the customer, based on sets of customer behavioural triggers, and look to support customers to help them maintain or regain control of their finances. Where customers engage with these contact strategies, our BFA colleagues provide broad money management advice and, where appropriate, may suggest a range of solutions to manage their financial situation. This suite of solutions includes forbearance and non-forbearance options.\n\n## Gambling\n\nBarclays understands that gambling and financial difficulty can often go hand in hand and that customers may sometimes find it hard to ask for help. We have dedicated training available for colleagues to help them understand and support customers impacted by problematic gambling. Our Specialist Colleagues are available to help customers in complex situations and sign post where needed to external support charities and organisations.\n\n+\n\nFurther details can be found at:\n\nbarclays.co.uk/gambling-support/\n\n## Domestic abuse\n\nTo support customers impacted by domestic abuse, we have partnered with Refuge, a national charity providing specialist support for women and their children experiencing domestic abuse.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis enables us to direct those impacted by domestic abuse to expert advice and assist survivors with the opening of bank accounts and gaining access to banking services in situations where they may not have the requisite documentation.

Our programme of work to enhance the customer experience across all of our channels, including physical locations and online remains front of mind.

They are available to support colleagues and customers in complex and heightened vulnerable circumstances.\n\n## Accessibility & Vulnerability (A&V) Indicators Platform\n\nOver 2023 we have enhanced our Accessibility & Vulnerability framework, giving colleagues within Barclays the ability to record disclosed customer vulnerability on our systems. This allows us to provide customers with the correct level of service based on their particular needs and/or adjustments. We have focused on improving the colleague journey to include support on soft skills, internal & external sign posting and escalations to specialist teams. This ensures colleagues have the best available support in the moment when dealing with customers in vulnerable circumstances.\n\n## Training for colleagues\n\nOver 20,000 Barclays UK colleagues completed the mandatory Customers in Vulnerable Circumstances annual elearning modules. The training improves awareness and understanding of vulnerability for our frontline and head office colleagues.\n\nWe also this year launched 'Threat to Life' training materials for our colleagues to help further support colleagues when liaising with customers who are suicidal. In addition we rolled out new induction training to equip new colleagues with how to identify and support customers who may be vulnerable or going through a life event.\n\n## Barclays UK Performance Framework\n\nWithin Barclays UK, the Performance Framework is in place to ensure a sustainable commercial performance. The framework looks to mitigate the risks of inappropriate practices, such as ensuring there is no undue pressure on colleagues to sell products, which can result in misselling.\n\nAlongside the Performance Framework we have introduced Performance Standards to set clear expectations, identify development opportunities, and deliver sustainable performance for our customers and clients.\n\n## Basic current account\n\nSince 2015, we have been offering our basic current account to individuals who may not be eligible for a standard account access to banking, including over the counter services, access to ATMs, and digital banking and free text alerts to manage finances. There were over 650,000 Barclays basic current accounts open at the end of 2023.\n\nAccess to a transactional bank account enables consumers to benefit from bill reductions through paying by direct debit and access to cheaper goods and services on the internet, to help them along their financial journey. If their circumstances change, customers on the basic current account are able to apply for a standard Barclays current account at any time. Periodically we also review accounts to upgrade customers from Basic Current Account to Barclays Bank Account where eligible.\n\n## Number of basic current accounts\n\n(#)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Barclays mortgages and first-time buyers\n\n2023 has been a year of change in the mortgages market. There were eight successive increases in the Bank of England Base Rate, which led to significant increases in the cost of borrowing for mortgage customers. Our commitment has remained to support customers through this period. In late 2022 we changed our policy for customers reaching the end of their fixed rate period, to allow them to rate switch earlier, helping over 200,000 customers in 2023 secure a new product up to 180 days in advance when their existing rate is ending. The Mortgage Charter mandated participating banks to implement 180 day switching in June 2023, by which time we had already been live with the 180 day switching for over eight months.\n\nDespite the challenges with the market in 2023, we still helped almost 22,000 firsttime buyers get onto the property ladder. We have continued to support customers buying their first home with 95% loan-tovalue mortgages through the UK Government Mortgage Guarantee Scheme, and Barclays Family Springboard Mortgage.\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nThe Mortgage Guarantee Scheme offers 95% LTV mortgages which are backed by a UK Government guarantee. Customers can apply for the scheme with a minimum deposit of 5% of the property purchase price, and it is available for first-time buyers and those looking to make their next move on the property ladder.\n\n## Financial inclusion in our US consumer business\n\nThe Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is a US federal law designed to encourage financial institutions to help meet the needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including low and moderateincome neighbourhoods. Barclays meets the CRA requirement by supporting and investing in local Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), smallmedium businesses and non-profits.\n\nThe success of CDFIs, small-medium businesses and non-profits are key to a thriving community. Barclays has predefined goals with specific performance targets that we must meet each year in order to be considered in compliance with CRA guidelines. Barclays has met its CRA goals for 2023, evidencing that we are continuing to invest in the communities where we live, work and serve.\n\nBarclays Bank Delaware (BBDE) is committed to fair and equitable treatment of all prospective and existing customers without regard to race, sex, colour, national origin, religion, age, marital status, disability, sexual orientation, military status, gender identity, familial status, Limited English Proficiency, receipt of public assistance income, and good faith exercise of rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.\n\nWe believe Barclays' core Values of Respect, Integrity, Service, Excellence, and Stewardship reflect our commitment to fair lending and fair treatment principles and practices. We strive to develop longterm relationships by providing products and services that meet prospective and existing customer needs, avoid causing prospective and existing customer detriment or harm, and place our prospective and existing customers' interests at the heart of our strategy, planning, and decision-making processes.",

We know that trust is earned by repeatedly doing the right thing. We believe the best way to build that trust is to invest in our culture and support our people in the choices they make every day, with guidance and policies that help them do this.\n\nThat starts with our Purpose, Values and Mindset, and is locked into our organisation through The Barclays Way, the touchstone for everyone in Barclays on the standard of conduct we expect, setting an unequivocal tone from the top about who we are and what we stand for.\n\nThe Barclays Way was launched in 2013, replacing a number of existing codes of conduct with a single document. Endorsed by our Chairman, it governs our way of working across our business globally and constitutes a reference point covering all aspects of colleagues' working relationships, specifically but not exclusively with other Barclays employees, customers and clients, governments, regulators, business partners, suppliers, competitors and the broader community.\n\nIt is aligned to the Code of Professional Conduct, published by the Chartered Banker Professional Standards Board, which sets out the ethical and professional attitudes and behaviours expected of bankers. Barclays subscribes to this code and is committed to embedding its broad principles into our business.\n\nThe Barclays Way includes information and guidance on how employees are expected to behave and take personal accountability for making decisions. We apply a range of criteria, over and above financial considerations, aimed at building a sustainable, strong and profitable business for the long term and adding value to our business relationships and the broader communities in which we live and work. We provide guidance across all key stakeholder groups, including servicing our customers and clients, promoting respect, diversity and performance in the workplace and maintaining strong governance, robust controls and strict ethical standards.\n\n'In challenging times such as these, it is more important than ever that we conduct ourselves in the right way. The Barclays Way sets out the standards of behaviour we should all aspire to in our professional lives. It is a guiding light for everyone in Barclays, helping us to make the right decisions every day.'\n\nThe Barclays Way also includes advice and guidance on speaking up and raising Barclays, and for the safety and wellbeing of our customers, clients and colleagues, that we encourage a culture that supports speaking up when things aren't as they should be. All colleagues are required to\n\nconcerns. It is important for the success of undertake training on The Barclays Way. We know that our success over the long term is based not just on how well we run the organisation commercially, but also on how well we manage it to protect the environment, support positive social progress and make responsible, wellgoverned decisions. We are focused on the areas where we can have the greatest long-term impact: making growth 'green', sustainable and inclusive; managing the environmental and social impacts of our business; running a responsible business; and investing in our communities.\n\n## Employee survey results\n\n%\n\n\"I believe that my team and I do a good job of role modelling the Values every day\"\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n% of colleagues completing mandatory training on The Barclays Way\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n99%\n\nThe Barclays Way Code of Conduct is available at: home.barclays/citizenship/the-way-we-do-business/ code-of-conduct/\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

However, where they do not feel comfortable using these avenues, the Raising Concerns process is available.\n\nThe Raising Concerns team carefully assess concerns and refer them to the most appropriate team for review and, where appropriate, investigation. All concerns are taken seriously and managed sensitively and confidentially. Details about the Raising Concerns reporting channels are available both internally and externally.\n\nOne of the channels to which concerns may be referred is the whistleblowing programme. Information about the whistleblowing programme is provided to colleagues globally, including through annual mandatory training.\n\nWhistleblowing relates to concerns which fall within the wider public interest. This may include a breach of our policies or procedures, breaches of law and regulation or other behaviour that harms or is likely to harm the reputation or financial wellbeing of the Group.\n\nConcerns assessed by Raising Concerns as whistleblowing are directed to a dedicated impartial team within the Compliance function. All whistleblowing concerns are taken seriously, and controls are in place to protect the confidentiality and identity of whistleblowers.\n\nBarclays has a zero-tolerance approach to retaliation against any whistleblower or any individual who has provided information as part of an investigation. Any act of retaliation by a colleague may result in disciplinary action, including dismissal.\n\nIn 2023, the whistleblowing team received a total of 67 whistleblowing concerns including 19 retaliation concerns.\n\n25% of whistleblowing concerns closed in 2023 were found to have some level of substantiation and other issues were identified in a further 38% of concerns.\n\nNone of the retaliation concerns closed in 2023 were substantiated.\n\nIn addition, 54 actions arising from concerns raised in 2023 were implemented to address issues identified during the course of investigation concerns .

This includes taxes paid of \u00a32,505m which represent a cost to us, and taxes collected on behalf of governments of \u00a33,394m.\n\nBarclays was ranked as the sixth-largest UK taxpayer, in terms of taxes paid, in the most recent PwC Total Tax Contribution survey of the One Hundred Group ('100 Group'). The 100 Group represents members of the FTSE 100 along with several large UK private companies. Over the last decade we have paid over \u00a314bn of taxes in the UK alone.\n\n## Approach to tax\n\nBarclays' Purpose is to deploy finance responsibly to support people and businesses, acting with empathy and integrity, championing innovation and sustainability, for the common good and the long term. Our approach to taxation, also known as our tax strategy, is aligned with this Purpose as well as our Values of Respect, Integrity, Service, Excellence and Stewardship.\n\n## Our approach to tax has three core objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 responsible approach to tax,\n- \u00b7 effective interaction with tax authorities and\n- \u00b7 transparency in relation to our tax affairs.\n\nWe manage our tax affairs in accordance with our Tax Principles, Tax Code of Conduct and HMRC's Code of Practice on Taxation for Banks and aim to file our returns on time and pay the correct amount of tax. We make clear disclosures to tax authorities and we are committed to only dealing with customer and client assets that have been appropriately declared to the relevant tax authority.\n\nWe are also committed to being a leader in tax transparency. We have published details of the taxes we pay by country and our approach to tax since 2013, and have chosen to expand our external publications such as the Country Snapshot.\n\nOur Country Snapshot is publicly available, it sets out our approach to tax in detail, including our Tax Principles, and is reviewed and approved annually by the Barclays PLC Board.\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nreview\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key highlights from our approach to tax include:\n\n- \u00b7 we follow clear Tax Principles that we have published.

We are transparent in both the disclosure of our tax affairs to tax authorities as well as our tax reporting to other stakeholders, and\n- \u00b7 we aim to comply with all of our tax obligations in the territories in which we operate and where there is uncertainty we may seek external tax advice in order to help ensure our tax filings are appropriate.\n\n## Tax governance, control and risk management\n\nAs a Global Systemically Important Bank, our Group-wide risk and governance procedures are subject to continuous review and scrutiny. More details on our approach to tax governance, control and risk management can be found in our Country Snapshot, the key highlights of which include:\n\n- \u00b7 our Board has ultimate responsibility for tax matters and the Board Audit Committee oversees our approach to tax,\n- \u00b7 at Barclays, risks are identified and managed through our ERMF, which supports the business in its aim to embed effective risk management and a strong risk management culture. Under the ERMF all risks, including tax risk, are managed in accordance with a 'three lines of defence' model,\n- \u00b7 as part of the 'first line of defence' the tax department identifies and manages tax risk by developing appropriate policies, standards and controls to apply across our organisation.

Endemic economic crime can threaten laws, democratic processes and basic human freedoms, impoverishing states and distorting free trade and competition.\n\nBarclays recognises that financial crime has an adverse effect on individuals and communities wherever it occurs. Endemic financial crime can threaten laws, democratic processes, and basic human freedoms, impoverishing states and distorting free trade and competition.\n\nBarclays is committed to conducting its global activities with integrity and respecting its regulatory, ethical, and social responsibilities to:\n\n- a. Protect employees, customers, and others with whom we do business, and\n- a. Support governments, regulators, and law enforcement in wider financial crime prevention.\n\nBarclays does not tolerate any deliberate breach of financial crime laws and regulations that apply to our business and the transactions we undertake.\n\nWe have adopted a holistic approach to financial crime risk management and have one group-wide Financial Crime Policy. The Financial Crime Policy applies to all businesses, legal entities and employees. It is designed to ensure that Barclays has adequate systems, procedures, and controls in place to manage the risk of being used to facilitate financial crime and to manage the legal, regulatory, and reputational risks associated with financial crime. Employees are made aware that failure to comply with the Financial Crime Policy may give rise to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n\nThe Financial Crime Policy sets control obligations to manage four key risks: antibribery & corruption (ABC); anti-money laundering & counter-terrorist financing (AML); anti-tax evasion facilitation (ATEF) and sanctions, including proliferation financing. This combined approach allows us to identify and manage relevant synergies and connections between these risks .\n\n## Anti-Bribery & Corruption\n\nBribery and corruption constitutes of:\n\n- a. improperly obtaining or retaining business; and/or\n- b. improperly securing a business or personal advantage; and/or\n- c. inducing another person to perform their role in breach of an expectation of good faith, impartiality or trust.\n\nBarclays and its employees are prohibited from engaging in or facilitating any form of bribery and corruption (giving and receiving, directly or indirectly). The Financial Crime Policy contains the minimum risk-based control requirements that all our businesses, legal entities and employees must follow. The Financial Crime Policy is designed to ensure that Barclays' employees know how to identify and manage the legal, regulatory and reputational risks associated with all forms of bribery and corruption.\n\n## Anti-Money Laundering\n\nMoney laundering has been identified as major threats to the international financial services community and therefore to Barclays. The Barclays Financial Crime Policy includes the requirement for Barclays businesses and legal entities to have adequate systems, procedures, and controls in place to manage the risk of Barclays being used to facilitate money laundering. The requirements of UK legislation apply to Barclays globally. As a transatlantic bank, the Financial Crime Policy also takes into account EU and US anti-money laundering requirements, as well as guidance issued by bodies such as the Wolfsberg Group and the European Banking Authority.\n\n## Anti-Tax Evasion Facilitation\n\nTax evasion is a financial crime and a predicate offence to money laundering in the UK and many other countries in which we operate. Barclays takes a zerotolerance approach to deliberate facilitation of tax evasion in any country and has procedures in place to prevent it. We also expect the same from our employees and third parties providing services for or on our behalf. Barclays is committed to:\n\n- a. dealing only with customers who have appropriately declared their assets to the relevant tax authorities; and\n- b. preventing tax evasion facilitation by our employees or third parties acting for or on our behalf.\n\n## Sanctions\n\nSanctions are restrictions on activity with targeted countries, regions, governments, entities, individuals and industries that are imposed by bodies such as the European Union, the United Nations, groups of countries, or individual countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. In order to protect its reputation and other legitimate business interests, in certain circumstances Barclays sanctions risk appetite may be stricter than its legal obligations.\n\nThe Financial Crime Policy is designed to ensure that Barclays and its employees know how to identify and manage the risks associated with sanctions, including the risk that activity is undertaken through Barclays in breach of sanctions regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details of the Barclays approach to Financial Crime compliance and prevention, please see our Financial Crime Compliance Statement in the ESG Resource Hub at home.barclays/esg-resourcehub/reporting-and-disclosures/\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nreview\n\nFinancial statements\n\n<!-- image -->",

H&S policies are owned by three risk Horizontals - Premises, People and Physical Security. Each Horizontal manages specific hazards through the Group policies and standards, with quantitative targets set through key indicators (KIs) and control environment characteristics (CECs). A program of internal control testing ensures that our KIs and CECs continue to perform satisfactorily, and that any opportunity for improvement identified can be acted upon. Performance is reported on at the Group Health & Safety Forum which oversees effective management of health and safety across Barclays.\n\nBarclays has in place global risk assessments which identify the hazards and control measures needed to reduce risks to as low as reasonably practicable, these are underpinned by local regulatory requirements and procedures. The global risk assessments are published on the H&S intranet site.\n\n| Measure                                 | Q1 2023   | Q2 2023   | Q3 2023   | Q4 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Number of High or Exceptional Accidents | 0         | 0         | 0         | 0         |\n| Lost Time Incidents (per 100 employees) | 0.023     | 0.02      | 0.024     | 0.025     |\n| % Completion Mandatory Training         | 99.9 %    | 99.9 %    | 99.9 %    | 99.9 %    |\n\nBarclays suppliers are subject to a supplier risk evaluation during onboarding, a minimum of annually thereafter and when they notify of a change in service delivery. In addition, they will complete an annual control obligation review.\n\nThe Barclays H&S team, who operate globally, provide support, competent advice and assurance where required.\n\nThere is a programme of H&S assurance and technical risk assessments to ensure the hazard and risk controls remain relevant and to identify emerging themes and trends.\n\nOnsite monitoring is undertaken across our portfolio by the Barclays H&S team, supported by the customer care leads for retail sites or by our building facilities management partners for corporate sites. Working with the Chief Security Office (CSO), there are processes and procedures in place to cover terrorism, disasters, fire and other emergency evacuations. These are tested on a programme schedule as required by the risk assessment or local regulatory requirements.\n\nBarclays has an incident reporting system to ensure incidents are recorded and investigated appropriately. Review of incident data is completed by each region to identify themes and trends, which are then reviewed at the Group H&S Forum and lessons learned shared. Incidents are reported and escalated as required by local regulatory statute and as per Barclays' risk framework for risk issues and events.\n\nInformation and knowledge is available through our H&S safety intranet, which provides key information on the hazard register, risk assessments, training and templates (for personal emergency evacuation plans, Display Screen Equipment (DSE) assessments, manual handling, occupational stress assessments, lone working assessments etc).\n\nBarclays operates a reward and recognition scheme where colleagues are recognised for improving our risk controls and supporting our health and safety management system.\n\nThe Health and Safety Risk Management Framework over view is as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                             | Health and Safety Forum                                                                                | Health and Safety Forum                                                        | Health and Safety Forum   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Leadership                                                                                                  | Statement of Commitment for Health and Safety                                                          | Statement of Commitment for Health and Safety                                  |                           |\n| H&S Data                                                                                                    | Data: Performance against commitment                                                                   | Data: Performance against commitment                                           |                           |\n| Horizontal                                                                                                  | Premises People                                                                                        | Physical Security                                                              |                           |\n| Harm to people through physical injury  (excluding injuries caused by Physical  Security related incidents) | Harm to people related to mental health  or mismanagement of employees  impacting personal welfare L.3 | Physical security incidents resulting in  harm to staff or external parties L3 | Risks                     |\n| Health and Safety (Premises & Infrastructure) Policy                                                        | People Risk   Health & Wellbeing Policy                                                                | Group Physical Security Policy                                                 | Policies                  |\n| Health and Safety   (Premises & Infrastructure) Standard                                                    | People Risk   Health & Wellbeing Standard                                                              | Group Physical Security Standard                                               | Standards                 |\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

While these may vary in detail, generally they reflect internationally recognised privacy principles found in the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\nWe strive to operate in accordance with these standards and recognise that respect for privacy rights is a key element of good corporate governance and social responsibility. We strive to be transparent about our use of personal information when delivering our products and services and acknowledge the responsibility we have for safeguarding privacy.\n\nAs Barclays increasingly adopts digital solutions to deliver next-generation consumer financial services, we appreciate our clients, customers and others may wish to understand how this may impact the use of their personal information. A globally applicable Barclays Data Privacy Standard sets out what is expected of all Barclays businesses and functions when collecting, using and sharing personal information.\n\nTo promote clear accountability, the Standard includes the requirement for each business to appoint an accountable executive who has ultimate responsibility for the processing of personal data within that business. An agreed assurance programme measures compliance with the Data Privacy Standard. Barclays colleagues must complete annual privacy training which is reviewed and refreshed each year, with additional tailored training provided as necessary. The Group Data Protection Officer (DPO) reports on data privacy issues to the highest level of management.\n\nThrough customer and employee privacy notices, we endeavour to explain clearly and openly how and why we use personal information and the legal grounds we rely on. When we receive complaints we seek to address them fairly. Several jurisdictions also provide individuals with specific rights, such as the right to have access to or request deletion of their personal information.\n\nBarclays provides a public mailbox and secure channels via its website to enable individuals to make their privacy requests and receive responses from a dedicated team.\n\nBarclays requires its suppliers to comply with data protection and privacy laws, regulations and standards relevant to the jurisdictions in which they operate and relevant to any transferred personal data. Our requirements are set out and managed through the Barclays Supplier Control Obligations, available online, which look to provide assurance that all new and existing suppliers commit to ensuring personal data shared with them is safeguarded and respected throughout the supply chain.\n\n## Data security\n\nBarclays deploys automated controls to protect its sensitive information and the data that has been entrusted to us by customers and clients, in line with our standards, taking into account findings from internal and external reviews of our controls. As Barclays accelerates the migration of digital services to the cloud, we apply the same design principles that underpin our existing control environment. We have controls and monitoring in place designed to secure cloud-hosted data and maintain its integrity.\n\nBarclays seeks to protect the security of data we share with third parties, including by conducting remote and on-site inspections with certain suppliers to review their controls against contractual obligations and industry standards. A Third Party Service Provider Framework is in place which sets out control requirements for business units to manage the operational, reputational, conduct and legal risks to Barclays through its supply chain.\n\nAs we have transitioned to a more hybrid working model, we have educated colleagues on cybersecurity risks in order to help minimise the risk of data exploitation or leakage.\n\n## Data resilience\n\nBarclays' CSO operates key controls that mitigate cybersecurity-related risks. CSO focuses on understanding internal and external threats and delivering on our capabilities to counteract them.\n\nAs part of our efforts to continuously review and improve our response and recovery plans in preparation for evolving threats, Barclays works with industry bodies to learn from risk events in other organisations. Our teams use intelligence to create plausible cybersecurity and data compromise scenarios which we simulate to help us focus on continuous improvement.",

        "page_content": "## ESG Governance (continued)\n\n## Operational resilience\n\nCustomers and clients have increased expectations for us to be 'Always On', and the interconnectivity of the financial sector means the stability and resilience of our systems, workforce and the continued provision of third-party services, all of which have a direct impact on the quality of our service.\n\nResilience and Security is a focus for the board. Barclays continues to invest in a multi-year resilience programme which is focused on our ability to recover from 'severe but plausible' scenarios which could cause detriment to our customers and clients and the broader financial market. To enable this, we define Groupwide business services and their interdependencies across the Group, including technology, third-party services and our workforce, and develop the recovery plans and business response plans for disruption events, such as cyber or data integrity disruptions. We review and validate these recovery plans through regular testing which supports our aim to reduce the volume and impact of operational incidents year on year. We also conduct regular assurance on third parties to assess their capability, as defined by our contractual Information & Cyber Security Supplier Control Obligations.\n\nResilience and security is the responsibility of everyone within the Group. All permanent employees are required to complete mandatory training on these topics at regular intervals across the year.\n\n+\n\nPlease refer to pages 178 for details of Barclays PLC Board Risk Committee oversight relating to operational resilience.\n\nPlease refer to the 'Material existing and emerging risks' section in our Risk review on pages 266 to 267 for further details on cyberattacks, data management and information protection. Please refer to the 'Supervision and regulation' section in our Risk review on pages 370 for further details on our regulatory approach to managing such risks.\n\n## Chief Security Office\n\nBarclays' CSO exists to keep the bank, its customers, clients, and colleagues safe and secure, and to maintain the resilience of our operations. CSO supports Barclays' business to operate in a protected and secure environment, and actively promotes the culture that security is everyone's responsibility.\n\nThe Chief Security Officer for the Group heads Barclays' CSO and reports up through the Chief Operating Officer, who sits on the Group Executive Committee. The Group CISO reports directly to the Chief Security Officer and is supported by a team of CISOs for individual business units and jurisdictions, as well as other teams of cybersecurity experts and analysts. Barclays' Group Chief Security Officer combines 10 years of law enforcement experience with over 20 years of experience serving in senior leadership roles managing security at global financial institutions. The Group CISO and supporting leadership team collectively have advanced degrees and senior level experience managing security risks in a variety of sectors, including those that represent critical national infrastructure, such as telecommunications and peer financial institutions. They are supported by analysts and subject matter experts in a variety of specialisations, such as intelligence, penetration testing, cyberforensic investigations, security engineering, and vulnerability\n\nmanagement.\n\nCSO leadership manages Barclays' cybersecurity activities and is accountable for the day-to-day monitoring of residual risk, identification of gaps, oversight of remedial actions and implementation of strategy. As described below, the Chief Security Officer and CISO for the Group provide updates to the Board and Board Risk Committee about cybersecurity risks facing the Group.\n\nWithin its oversight of Operational risk as a Principal Risk, the Board Risk Committee is responsible for oversight of risks arising from cybersecurity threats. As part of this oversight, the Board Risk Committee receives periodic updates from Barclays' Chief Security Officer or CISO for the Group on cybersecurity matters. In 2023, such updates addressed topics that included the shifting cybersecurity threat landscape, measurement of Barclays' risk and control posture, cybersecurity incident trends and Barclays' response, Barclays' ability to recover from a material cyberattack scenario, third party control and assurance monitoring, privileged access to Barclays' systems, regulatory developments, and Barclays' technology and resource investment strategy.\n\nBarclays assesses its cybersecurity activities against the industry-recognised National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) security maturity framework, and we periodically engage external security consultants to conduct independent benchmarking assessments. In 2023, findings from such an assessment conducted in late 2022 were briefed to the Board and Board Risk Committee.\n\nBarclays' CSO partners with third-party security providers throughout the Group's cybersecurity activities, including for cyber recovery, penetration testing, software vulnerability scanning, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack prevention, phishing simulations, third-party risk management, incident response, intelligence, fraud prevention, and industry benchmarking.",

        "page_content": "## ESG Governance (continued)\n\nUnder Barclays' Enterprise Risk Management Framework, there is an Information and Cyber Security Policy supported by ten Standards which define the minimum requirements for cybersecurity matters across the entire Barclays Group. These Standards cover the following topics: Cryptography, Network Security, Security Configuration, Data Loss Prevention, Vulnerability Management, Data Security, Incident Response & Threat Intelligence, Threat Management, Governance, and Identity & Access Management.\n\nAn important part of Barclays' cybersecurity environment is its Joint Operations Centres (JOCs), which operate 24x7x365 from three globally strategic locations, linking CSO's security professionals and incident response managers with control functions and business unit representatives. The JOCs deliver security responsiveness by uniting core security functions and providing a central information and coordination point for security incident management.\n\nTo manage security risk related to our third-party suppliers, many of which perform critical services for Barclays and handle sensitive Barclays data, we have a set of contractual Information & Cyber Security Supplier Control Obligations that are based off of the requirements of our internal standards. We conduct assurance over our third and fourth parties against those obligations through a dedicated External Cyber Assurance & Monitoring team (ECAM) and a set of control indicators.\n\nThis is achieved through our own assurance capabilities and use of a third party assurance utility. Activity is structured on a risk-based approach that prioritises suppliers that underpin our most important business services.\n\nIdentified issues are managed formally, but we also engage proactively with third-party suppliers to help them strengthen their security and resilience posture. To recognise the changing risk presented by third-party suppliers, which are increasingly targeted by threat actors, we regularly alert third-party suppliers where we anticipate that they may be more vulnerable and should take preventative action.\n\nNotwithstanding such third-party risk management efforts, Barclays does not have direct control over the cybersecurity of the systems of its third parties, limiting the Group's ability to effectively protect and defend against certain threats.\n\n## Certifications\n\nBarclays holds three ISO27001 certifications (i.e., the international standard on how to manage information security), Cyber Essentials / Cyber Essentials Plus Certification, and has a UK certification for Digital Banking.\n\n## Reporting phishing\n\nCSO performs a number of key activities related to identifying, investigating, responding to and containing phishing / malicious email incidents. CSO has embedded an operational process that provides education and awareness content via email to colleagues who click a malicious link or attachment in a phishing email, with escalating training exercises and management interventions for repeated instances. To report suspected phishing to Barclays' JOC for further investigation, colleagues have a tool integrated into their email account, and colleagues receive feedback on whether the reported email was suspect or genuine. CSO also runs monthly phishing simulations to understand colleagues' susceptibility to real attacks, using the analysis to refine education and training.\n\n## Training\n\nBarclays has adopted a 65-day window for mandatory training completion to allow colleagues sufficient time to complete training. The consequence of noncompletion is a breach which can lead to disciplinary action and impact compensation.\n\nThe 65-day window covers many different colleague situations, including new joiners, returners from sick leave or parental leave and internal movers. Some of these situations are required by law to have a reasonable adjustment time to enable the successful completion of training. This process is managed by Barclays HR and Compliance.",

This helps define the level of risk we are willing to undertake in our business\n- \u25aa risk management and segregation of duties: The ERMF defines a Three Lines of Defence model\n- \u25aa roles and responsibilities for key risk management and governance: The accountabilities of the Group CEO, Group CRO and other senior managers, as well as an overview of Barclays PLC committees.\n\nThe ERMF is complemented by frameworks, policies and standards which are mainly aligned to individual principal risks:\n\n- \u25aa frameworks cover high level principles guiding the management of principal risks, and set out details of which policies\n\nare needed, and high level governance arrangements\n\n- \u25aa policies set out the control objectives and  high level requirements to address the key principles articulated in their associated frameworks. Policies state 'what' those within scope are required to do\n- \u25aa standards set out the detail of the control requirements to ensure the control objectives set by the policies are met.\n\n## Segregation of duties - the 'Three Lines of Defence' model\n\nThe ERMF sets out a clear lines of defence model. All colleagues are responsible for understanding and managing risks within the context of their individual roles and responsibilities, as set out below.\n\n- \u25aa The first line comprises all employees engaged in the revenue-generating and client-facing areas of the Group and all associated support functions, including Finance, Operations, Treasury and Human Resources. The first line is responsible for identifying and managing the risks in which they are engaged, operating within applicable limits, and escalating risk events or issues as appropriate. Employees in the first line have primary responsibility for their risks and their activities are subject to oversight from the relevant parts of the second and third lines.\n- \u25aa The second line is comprised of the Risk and Compliance functions. The role of the second line is to establish the limits, rules and constraints, and the frameworks, policies and standards under which all activities shall be performed, consistent with the risk appetite of the Group, and to oversee the performance of the Group against these limits, rules and constraints. Controls for first line activities will ordinarily be established by the control officers operating within the control framework of the firm. These will remain subject to oversight by the second line.\n- \u25aa The third line of defence is Internal Audit, who are responsible for providing independent assurance over the effectiveness of governance, risk management and controls over current, systemic and evolving risks.\n- \u25aa The Legal function provides support to all areas of the bank and is not formally part of any of the three lines of defence, The Legal function is responsible for proactively identifying, communicating and providing legal advice on applicable laws, rules and regulations. Except in relation to the legal advice it provides or procures, it is subject to second line oversight with respect to its own operational and compliance risks, as well as with respect to the legal risk to which the bank is exposed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Risk management (continued)\n\n## Principal risks\n\nThe ERMF identifies nine principal risks namely: credit risk, market risk, treasury and capital risk, climate risk, operational risk, model risk, compliance risk, reputation risk and legal risk. Note that \"compliance risk\" replaced \"conduct risk\" in 2023 with an expanded definition. See page 269 for more information.\n\nEach of the principal risks is overseen by an accountable executive within the Group who is responsible for overseeing and/or assigning responsibilities for the framework, policies and standards that set out associated responsibilities and expectations and detail the related requirements around risk management. In addition, certain risks span across more than one principal risk.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nRisk appetite is defined as the level of risk which the Group is prepared to accept in carrying out its activities. It provides a basis for ongoing dialogue between management and Board with respect to the Group's current and evolving risk profile, allowing strategic and financial decisions to be made on an informed basis.\n\nRisk appetite is approved by the Barclays PLC Board in aggregate and disseminated across legal entities and businesses, supported by limits to enable and control specific exposures and activities that have material concentration risk implications.\n\n## Risk committees\n\nBarclays various risk committees consider risk matters relevant to their business, and escalate as required to the Group Risk Committee (GRC), whose Chair, in turn, escalates to the Barclays PLC Board Risk Committees and the Barclays PLC Board.\n\nIn addition to setting the risk appetite of the Group, the Board is responsible for approving the ERMF, and reviewing reputation risk matters. It receives regular information on the risk profile of the Group, and has ultimate responsibility for risk appetite and capital plans.\n\nFurther, there are two Board-level committees which oversee the application of the ERMF and implementation of key aspects, the Barclays PLC Board Risk Committee (BRC) and the Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee (BAC). Additionally, the Barclays PLC Board Remuneration Committee oversee pay practices focusing on aligning pay to sustainable performance.\n\n- \u00b7 The Barclays PLC Board Risk Committee (BRC): the BRC monitors the Group's risk profile against the agreed appetite. Where actual performance differs from expectations, the actions taken by management are reviewed to ascertain that the BRC is comfortable with them. The BRC also reviews certain key risk methodologies, the effectiveness of risk management, and the Group's risk profile, including the material issues affecting each business portfolio and forward risk trends. The committee also commissions in-depth analysis of significant risk topics, which are presented by the Group CRO or senior risk managers.\n- \u00b7 The Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee (BAC): the BAC receives regular reports on the effectiveness of internal control systems, quarterly reports on material control issues of significance, quarterly papers on accounting judgements (including impairment), and a quarterly review of the adequacy of impairment allowances.\n- \u00b7 The Barclays PLC Board Remuneration Committee (RemCo): the RemCo receives proposals on ex-ante and expost risk adjustments to variable remuneration based on risk management performance including events, issues and the wider risk profile. These inputs are considered in the setting of performance incentives.\n\nThe terms of reference and additional details on membership and activities for each of the principal Board committees are available from the corporate governance section of the Barclays website at: home.barclays/who-we-are/ our-governance/board-committees/\n\nThe GRC is the most senior executive body responsible for reviewing and monitoring the risk profile of the Group. This includes coverage of all principal risks, and any other material risks, to which the Group is exposed. The GRC reviews and recommends the proposed risk appetite and relative limits to the BRC. The committee covers all business units and legal entities of the Group and incorporates specific coverage of Barclays Bank Group.\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\n## Barclays' risk culture\n\nRisk culture can be defined as the norms, attitudes and behaviours related to risk awareness, risk taking and risk management. This is reflected in how the Group identifies, escalates and manages risk matters.\n\nBarclays is committed to maintaining a robust risk culture in which:\n\n- \u00b7 management expect, model and reward the right behaviours from a risk and control perspective\n- \u00b7 colleagues identify, manage and escalate risk and control matters, and meet their responsibilities around risk management.\n\nThe Group CEO works with the Executive Management to embed a strong risk culture within the firm, with particular regard to the identification, escalation and management of risk matters, in accordance with the ERMF. This is supported by our Purpose, Values and Mindset, as well by as by setting a standard of consistent excellence. Specifically, all employees regardless of their positions, functions or locations must play their part in the Group's risk management. Employees are required to be familiar with risk management policies which are relevant to their responsibilities, know how to escalate actual or potential risk issues, and have a role-appropriate level of awareness of the risk management process as defined by the ERMF.\n\n## Our Code of Conduct - the Barclays Way\n\nGlobally, all colleagues must attest to the 'Barclays Way', our Code of Conduct, and comply with all frameworks, policies and standards applicable to their roles. The Code of Conduct outlines the Purpose, Values and Mindset which govern our 'Barclays Way' of working across our business globally. It constitutes a reference point covering all aspects of colleagues' working relationships, and provides guidance on working with other Barclays employees, customers and clients, governments and regulators, business partners, suppliers, competitors and the broader community.

Material risks are those to which senior management pay particular attention and which could cause the delivery of the Group's strategy, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects to differ materially from expectations. Emerging risks are those which have unknown components, the impact of which could crystallise over a longer time period. In addition, certain other factors beyond the Group's control, including escalation of global conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics and similar events, although not detailed below, could have a similar impact on the Group.\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks potentially impacting more than one principal risk\n\n## i) Business conditions, general economy and geopolitical issues\n\nThe Group's operations are subject to changes in global and local economic and market conditions, as well as geopolitical developments, which may have a material impact on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nA deterioration in global or local economic and market conditions may result in (among other things): (i) deteriorating business, consumer or investor confidence and lower levels of investment and productivity growth, which in turn may lead to lower customer and client activity, including lower demand for borrowing; (ii) higher default rates, delinquencies, writeoffs and impairment charges as borrowers struggle with their debt commitments; (iii) subdued asset prices, which may impact the value of collateral held by the Group and require the Group and its customers to post additional collateral in order to satisfy margin calls; (iv) mark-to-market losses in trading portfolios resulting from changes in factors such as credit ratings, share prices and solvency of counterparties; and (v) revisions to calculated ECLs leading to increases in impairment allowances. In addition, the Group's ability to borrow from other financial institutions or raise funding from external investors may be affected by deteriorating economic conditions and market disruption. Geopolitical events can also cause financial instability and affect economic growth.\n\n## In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 Global GDP growth in 2023 was severely hampered by inflationary pressures resulting from: (i) restricted labour markets, industrial disputes, and upward pressure on employment costs; (ii) high energy prices intensified by the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; and (iii) resilient consumer spending, particularly on services, funded by drawing household savings. High inflation has led to the on-going 'cost of living' pressures in much of the world, including in the UK.\n- \u00b7 In response to persistent inflation, 2023 saw central banks continue to tighten monetary policy through raising interest rates and exercising quantitative tightening. While markets are forecasting that rates are at or near their cycle peak and inflation has begun to ease back (albeit remaining well above central banks' targets), economies in which the Group operates are vulnerable to recession risk in 2024. Such risk is heightened by the turbulent geopolitical outlook and volatile market conditions with these factors acting as a drag on potential global economic growth. Higher mortgage rates, rising taxes, elevated bond yields, depleted household savings, higher corporate insolvencies, and rising unemployment have potentially negative implications for the Group's performance, including increased impairment allowances.\n- \u00b7 The loss of 'the presumption of compliance' is widely reported to have raised costs for UK customers exporting to the European Union (EU) which, together with the risk of regulatory divergence between the UK and the EU, could adversely impact both the Group's EU and UK operations.\n- \u00b7 Further, any trading disruption between the EU and the UK may have a significant impact on economic activity in the EU and the UK which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n- \u00b7 Unstable economic conditions could result in (among other things):\n- - a deeper slowdown in the UK and/or one or more member states of the EU in which the Group operates, with lower growth, higher unemployment and a greater fall in property prices, which could lead to increased impairments in relation to a number of the Group's portfolios (including, but not limited to, the UK mortgage portfolio, unsecured lending portfolio\n\n- (including credit cards) and commercial real estate exposures).\n- - increased market volatility (in particular in currencies and interest rates), which could impact the Group's trading book positions and affect the underlying value of assets in the banking book and securities held by the Group for liquidity purposes. In addition, depositor perceptions of banking fragility as seen in certain institutions in 2023 could increase the severity and velocity of deposit outflows, impacting the Group's liquidity position;\n- - a credit rating downgrade for one or more members of the Group (either directly or indirectly as a result of a downgrade in the UK sovereign credit ratings), which could significantly increase the Group's cost of funding and/or reduce its access to funding, widen credit spreads and have a material adverse impact on the Group's interest margins and liquidity position and/or\n- - a market-wide widening of credit spreads or reduced investor appetite for the Group's debt securities, which could negatively impact the Group's cost of and/or access to funding.\n- \u00b7 A significant proportion of the Group's portfolio is located in the US, including a major credit card portfolio and a range of corporate and investment banking exposures. Political instability and/or increased polarisation ahead of the 2024 elections together with the possibility of significant changes in US policy in certain sectors may negatively impact the Group's associated portfolios. Stress in the US economy, weakening GDP and associated exchange rate fluctuations, heightened political and/or trade tensions (such as between the US and China), and increased unemployment could lead to higher levels of impairment, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and profitability.\n- \u00b7 An escalation in geopolitical tensions or increased use of protectionist measures (such as the US and China implementing reciprocal trade tariffs and/or outright export bans on specific products and/or in specific sectors) may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business in the affected regions.\n- \u00b7 In China, a significant global economy, the property market slump, shrinking exports, and weakened currency (and resulting capital outflows) have caused",

The high levels of debt, particularly in the property sector, remain a concern given the high leverage multiples, despite government and regulatory action. Any property shock risks contaminating the financial sector and precipitating a wider banking crisis. A shift away from market-based reforms towards state led initiatives to stimulate the economy could damage private-sector confidence and economic growth.\n\n- \u00b7 High US interest rates and a potential global slow-down in demand for natural resources, means an economic deterioration in emerging markets still remains a risk. This could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results from operations if these stresses lead to higher impairment charges from a deterioration in sovereign or corporate creditworthiness.\n- \u00b7 New strains of COVID-19 (or reduced vaccine efficacy) could impact the Group's ability to conduct business in the jurisdictions in which it operates through disruptions to: (i)) infrastructure and supply chains, (ii) business processes and technology services provided by third parties and (iii), the availability of staff due to illness. These interruptions to business may be detrimental to customers (who may seek reimbursement from the Group for costs and losses incurred as a result of such interruptions), and result in potential litigation costs (including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions), as well as reputational damage. It may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described herein (with consequential impairment charge volatility) or may pose other risks which are not presently known to the Group or not currently expected to be significant to the Group's profitability, capital and liquidity.\n\nAny and all such events mentioned above could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects, liquidity, capital position and credit ratings (including potential credit rating agency changes of outlooks or ratings), as well as on the Group's customers, employees and suppliers.\n\n## ii) The impact of interest rate changes on the Group's profitability\n\nChanges to interest rates are significant for the Group, especially given the uncertainty as to the size and frequency of such\n\nchanges, particularly in the Group's main markets of the UK, the US and the EU.\n\nInterest rate rises result in higher funding costs either due to higher refinancing costs or due to deposit balance mix changes as customers prefer higher rate deposits. Interest rate rises however could positively impact the Group's profitability as retail and corporate business net interest income increases due to margin decompression, as observed for the interest rate rises in 2023. However, increases in interest rates, if larger or more frequent than expected, could lead to generally weaker than expected growth, reduced business confidence and higher unemployment. This, combined with the impact interest rate rises may have on the affordability of loan arrangements for borrowers (especially when combined with inflationary pressures), could cause stress in the lending portfolio and underwriting activity of the Group. This could result in higher credit losses driving increased impairment charges which would most notably impact retail unsecured portfolios and wholesale non-investment grade lending and could have a material effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nInterest rate cuts may affect, and put pressure on, the Group's net interest margins (the difference between its lending income and borrowing costs) and could adversely affect the profitability and prospects of the Group.\n\nIn addition, changes in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the value of the securities held in the Group's liquid asset portfolio. Consequently, this could create more volatility than expected through the Group's fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) reserve and could adversely affect the profitability and prospects of the Group.\n\n## iii) Competition in the banking and financial services industry\n\nThe Group operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to significant changes as a result of regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, prevailing market environment and changes to economic conditions. The Group expects that competition in the financial services industry will continue to be intense and may have a material adverse effect on the Group's future business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nNew competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge.\n\nTechnological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products such as electronic securities trading, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies, such as blockchain (used in cryptocurrency systems) and 'buy now pay later' lending, both of which are currently subject to lower levels of regulatory oversight compared to many activities undertaken by banks. Furthermore, the introduction of central bank digital currencies could have significant impact on the banking system and the role of commercial banks by disrupting the current provision of banking products and services. This disruption could allow new competitors, some previously hindered by banking regulation (such as certain FinTechs), to provide customers with access to banking facilities and increase the disintermediation of banking services.\n\nNew technologies and changing consumer behaviour have previously required, and could continue to require, the Group to incur additional costs to modify or adapt its products or make additional capital investments in its businesses to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies.\n\nOngoing or increased competition and/or disintermediation of banking services may put pressure on the pricing of the Group's products and services, which could reduce the Group's revenues and profitability, or may cause the Group to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products such as deposits, bank accounts and mortgage lending. This competition may be on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and/or price. These factors may be exacerbated by further industry wide initiatives to address access to banking. The failure of any of the Group's businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, underperformance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, branch closures, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect the Group's ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce the Group's\n\nrevenues.",

Many regulatory changes that are relevant to the Group's business may have an effect beyond the country in which they are enacted, either because the Group's regulators deliberately enact regulation with extraterritorial effect or its global operations mean that the Group gives effect to local laws and regulations on a wider basis.\n\nIn recent years, regulators and governments have focused on reforming both the prudential regulation of the financial services industry and the ways in which the business of financial services is conducted. Measures taken include enhanced capital, liquidity and funding requirements, the structural separation or prohibition of certain activities by banks, changes in the operation of capital markets activities, the introduction of tax levies and transaction taxes, changes in compensation practices and more detailed requirements on how business is conducted and customers are treated. The governments and regulators in the UK, the US, the EU or elsewhere may intervene further in relation to areas of industry risk already identified, or in new areas, which could adversely affect the Group.\n\nCurrent and anticipated areas of particular focus for the Group's regulators, where regulatory changes could have a material effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, capital position, and reputation, include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 the increasing focus by regulators, international bodies, organisations and unions on how institutions conduct business, particularly with regard to the delivery of fair outcomes for customers, promoting effective competition in the interests of consumers and ensuring the orderly and transparent operation of global financial markets, including the new Consumer Duty in the UK and measures resulting from ongoing thematic reviews into the workings of the retail, small and medium enterprises and wholesale banking sectors and the provision of financial advice to consumers;\n- \u00b7 the implementation of any conduct measures as a result of regulators' focus on organisational culture, employee behaviour and whistleblowing;\n- \u00b7 the demise of certain benchmark interest rates and the transition to new risk-free reference rates (as discussed further under 'v) Impact of benchmark interest rate reforms on the Group' below);\n- \u00b7 reviews of regulatory frameworks applicable to the wholesale financial markets, including reforms and other changes to conduct of business, listing, securitisation and derivatives related requirements;\n- \u00b7 the focus globally on technology adoption and digital delivery, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI), digital assets and digital money (including central bank digital currencies), financial technology risks, payments and related infrastructure, operational resilience, and cybersecurity.

These reforms have resulted in significant changes to the methodology and operation of certain benchmarks and indices, the adoption of alternative riskfree reference rates (RFRs), the discontinuation of certain benchmarks, and the introduction of implementing legislation and regulations. Specifically, certain London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) tenors either ceased at the end of 2021 or became permanently unrepresentative, with synthetic 3-month GBP LIBOR ceasing to be published at the end March 2024 and synthetic 1-, 3- and 6-month USD LIBOR settings intended to cease being published at the end of September 2024. Notwithstanding these developments, given the unpredictable consequences of benchmark reform, any of these developments could have an adverse impact on market participants, including the Group, in respect of any financial instruments linked to, or referencing, any of these benchmarks.\n\nUncertainty associated with such potential changes, including the availability and/or suitability of alternative RFRs, the participation of customers and third party market participants in the transition process, challenges with respect to required documentation changes, and the impact of legislation to deal with certain legacy contracts that cannot convert into or add fall-back RFRs before cessation of the benchmark they reference, may adversely affect a broad range of transactions (including any securities, loans and derivatives which use an affected benchmark to determine an amount payable which are included in the Group's financial assets and liabilities) that use these benchmarks and indices, and present a number of risks for the Group, including but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Compliance risk: in undertaking actions to transition away from using certain benchmarks to new alternative RFRs, the Group faces conduct risks. These may lead to customer complaints, regulatory sanctions or reputational impact if the Group is considered to be (among other things): (i) undertaking market activities that are manipulative or create a false or misleading impression; (ii) misusing sensitive information or not identifying or appropriately managing and mitigating conflicts of interest; (iii) providing customers with inadequate advice, misleading information, unsuitable products or unacceptable service; (iv) not taking a consistent approach to remediation for customers in similar circumstances; (v) unduly delaying the communication and migration activities in relation to client exposures, leaving them insufficient time to prepare; or (vi) colluding or inappropriately sharing information with competitors.\n- \u00b7 Litigation risk: members of the Group may face legal proceedings, regulatory investigations and/or other actions or proceedings regarding (among other things): (i) the conduct risks identified above, (ii) the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in contracts and securities linked to a relevant benchmark, and (iii) the Group's preparation and readiness for the replacement of benchmarks which have ceased or will shortly cease to be published with alternative RFRs.\n- \u00b7 Financial risk: the valuation of certain of the Group's financial assets and liabilities may change. Moreover, transitioning to alternative RFRs may impact the ability of members of the Group to calculate and model amounts receivable by them on certain financial assets and determine the amounts payable on certain financial liabilities (such as debt securities issued by them) because certain alternative RFRs (such as the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)) are look-back rates, which means that the amount of interest payable is only known after the period has finished because it is calculated by reference to observed historical rates. In contrast, forwardlooking term rates (such as LIBOR) allow borrowers to calculate at the start of any interest period exactly how much is payable at the end of such interest period. This may have a material adverse effect on the Group's cash flows.\n- \u00b7 Pricing risk: changes to existing benchmarks and indices, discontinuation of any benchmarks or index and transition to alternative RFRs may impact the pricing mechanisms used by the Group on certain transactions.\n- \u00b7 Operational risk: changes to existing benchmarks and indices, the discontinuation of any benchmark or index and transition to alternative RFRs may require changes to the Group's IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure, operational processes, and controls. In addition, if any benchmark or index is no longer available to calculate amounts payable, the Group may incur expenses in amending documentation for new and existing transactions and/or effecting the transition from the original benchmark or index to a new one.\n- \u00b7 Accounting risk: an inability to apply hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 could lead to increased volatility in the Group's financial results and performance.\n\nAny of these factors may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation.",

Accordingly, effective management of transformation projects is required to successfully deliver the Group's strategic priorities, involving delivering both on externally driven programmes, as well as key business initiatives to deliver revenue growth, product enhancement and operational efficiency outcomes. The magnitude, complexity and, at times, concurrent demands of the projects required to meet these priorities can result in heightened execution risk.\n\nThe ability to execute the Group's strategy may be limited by operational capacity and the increasing complexity of the regulatory environment in which the Group operates. In addition, whilst the Group continues to pursue cost management initiatives, they may not be as effective as expected and cost saving targets may not be met.\n\nThe failure to successfully deliver or achieve any of the expected benefits of these strategic initiatives and/or the failure to meet customer and stakeholder expectations could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition, customer outcomes, prospects and reputation.\n\n## vii) Holding company structure of Barclays PLC and its dependency on distributions from its subsidiaries\n\nBarclays PLC is a holding company and its principal sources of income are, and are expected to continue to be, distributions (in the form of dividends and interest payments) from operating subsidiaries which also hold the principal assets of the Group. As a separate legal entity, Barclays PLC relies on such distributions in order to be able to meet its obligations as they fall due (including its payment obligations with respect to its debt securities) and to create distributable reserves for capital distributions (such as dividends to ordinary shareholders and share buybacks).\n\nThe ability of Barclays PLC's subsidiaries to pay dividends and interest and Barclays PLC's ability to receive such distributions from its investments in its subsidiaries and other entities will be subject not only to the financial performance of such subsidiaries and entities and prevailing macroeconomic conditions but also to applicable local laws, capital regulations (including internal MREL requirements) and other restrictions (including restrictions imposed by governments and/or regulators, which limit management's flexibility in managing the business and taking action in relation to capital distributions and capital allocation). These laws and restrictions could limit the payment of dividends and distributions to Barclays PLC by its subsidiaries and any other entities in which it holds an investment from time to time, which could restrict Barclays PLC's ability to meet its obligations and/or to make capital distributions (such as dividends to ordinary shareholders and share buybacks).\n\n## viii) Application of resolution measures and stabilisation powers under the UK Banking Act\n\nUnder the UK Banking Act 2009, as amended (Banking Act), substantial powers are granted to the Bank of England (or, in certain circumstances, HM Treasury), in consultation with the PRA, the FCA and HM Treasury, as appropriate, as part of the UK's special resolution regime (SRR). These powers enable the relevant UK resolution authority to implement resolution measures and stabilisation options with respect to a UK bank or investment firm and certain of its affiliates (currently including Barclays PLC) (each, a relevant entity) in circumstances in which the relevant UK resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met.\n\nThe SRR consists of five stabilisation options: (i) private sector transfer of all or part of the business or shares of the relevant entity; (ii) transfer of all or part of the business of the relevant entity to a 'bridge bank' established by the Bank of England; (iii) transfer to an asset management vehicle wholly or partly owned by the Bank of England; (iv) the cancellation, transfer or dilution of the relevant entities' equity (including Barclays PLC's ordinary share capital) and writedown or conversion of the relevant entity's capital instruments and liabilities (the bailin tool); and (v) temporary public ownership (i.e. nationalisation).\n\nIn addition, the relevant UK resolution authority may, in certain circumstances, in accordance with the Banking Act require the permanent write-down or conversion into equity of any outstanding Tier 1 capital instruments, Tier 2 capital instruments and internal MREL prior to, or together with, the exercise of any stabilisation option. Any such action could result in the dilution, transfer or cancellation of Barclays PLC's ordinary share capital, restrict Barclays PLC's ability to meet its obligations and/or to pay dividends to ordinary shareholders.\n\nShareholders should assume that, in a resolution situation, public financial support will only be available to a relevant entity as a last resort after the relevant UK resolution authorities have assessed and used, to the maximum extent practicable, the resolution tools, including the bail-in tool (the Bank of England's preferred approach for the resolution of the Group is a bail-in strategy with a single point of entry at Barclays PLC). The exercise of any of such powers under the Banking Act or any suggestion of any such exercise could materially adversely affect the value of Barclays PLC ordinary shares and could lead to shareholders losing some or all of their investment.\n\nThe 'no creditor worse off' safeguard within the Banking Act requires that no shareholder or creditor must be left worse off from the use of resolution powers than they would have been if the relevant entity entered insolvent liquidation. Whilst shareholders may be entitled to compensation where there is determined to have been a shortfall following a valuation, there can be no assurance that shareholders would recover any such compensation promptly or that such compensation will be equivalent to the full losses incurred in resolution.\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks impacting individual principal risks\n\n## i) Climate risk\n\nClimate risk is the impact on Financial (Credit, Market, Treasury & Capital) and Operational Risks arising from climate change through physical risks and risks associated with transitioning to a lower carbon economy.\n\nThe effects of climate change may be highly significant in their breadth and magnitude and could affect a large number of firms operating in different sectors and geographies, leading to potential downstream effects to the financial system.",

        "page_content": "Risk\n\nreview\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks (continued)\n\nThere is potential direct impact on banks and other financial institutions through their operations, as well as indirectly through customers and clients. Given this context and to support the Group's ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, Climate Risk is a Principal Risk under Barclays' ERMF.\n\nScientific research suggests that physical risks arising due to climate change such as acute events (e.g. cyclone, hurricanes and floods) and chronic events (longer term shifts in climate patterns) may occur in increasing frequency and severity, Potential tipping points can cause unprecedented damage to particular geographies. Some regions are expected to be more severely affected than others if they are more exposed and/or more vulnerable to certain events.\n\nThe potential impact of physical risk events on the economy may include lower GDP growth, higher unemployment, shortage of raw materials and products due to supply chain disruptions and significant changes in asset prices. These factors could subsequently impact business model and profitability of Barclays and its clients. Damage to the properties and operations of the Group's clients could decrease their production capacity, increase operating costs, affect insurability and decrease value of those properties. This in turn would lead to a decline in the creditworthiness of clients, which may result in higher defaults, delinquencies, write-offs and impairment charges in the Group's portfolios. Physical hazards may also impact the creditworthiness of the sovereigns of countries in which they occur. The deterioration in the credit ratings of sovereign bonds could affect their access to capital and their eligibility for inclusion in banks' liquidity buffers. These hazards may also impact the value of investments which the Group holds.\n\nA transition to a low-carbon economy requires policy and regulatory changes, new national or regional commitments, new technological innovations and changes to supply and demand systems within industries. The transition to a lowcarbon economy may also trigger changes in consumer behaviour and market sentiment. These changes may result in increased costs and reduced demand for the products and services of a company including early retirement and impairment of assets, or decreased revenue and profitability.\n\nThe Group's clients that are more susceptible and exposed to these changes may face financial difficulties which in turn may impact their creditworthiness. In addition, impacts to the creditworthiness of the Group's clients, customers and counterparties (particularly in high carbon sectors), can also arise a result of climaterelated legal actions or investigations, where outcomes of such actions have material financial impacts. This in turn can increase credit risk within group portfolios (for further details on credit risk, refer to ii) Credit Risk on page 263). Both transition and physical risk drivers may lead to increased price volatility and repricing of market instruments, which in turn may impact the value of market instruments held by the Group.\n\nThe Group's own premises may also suffer physical damage due to weather events leading to increased costs for the Group. As the economy transitions to a lower carbon economy, financial institutions also face significant and rapid developments in stakeholder expectations, policy, law and regulation, which could impact lending activities and the risks associated with lending portfolios as well as asset values. Failure to adequately embed climate risk management into the risk framework may have a material and adverse impact on the Barclays' brand, competitiveness, profitability, capital requirements, cost of funding, financial condition and ability to expand its business.\n\nIn March 2020, the Group announced its ambition to become a net zero bank by 2050 and its commitment to align all of its financing activities with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement. In order to reach these ambitions and targets, and any other climate-related ambitions or targets the Group may commit to in future, the Group will continue to incorporate climate considerations into its strategy, business model, the products and services it provides to customers and its financial and non-financial risk management processes. These include processes to measure and manage the various financial and non-financial risks the Group faces as a result of climate change.\n\nThe Group also needs to ensure that its strategy and business model adapt to changing national and international standards, industry and scientific practices, regulatory requirements and market expectations regarding climate change, which remain under continuous development.\n\nThere remains a possibility that these standards, practices, requirements and expectations could change in a manner that substantially increases the cost or effort for the Group to achieve such ambitions and targets. In addition, the Group's ambitions and targets may prove more challenging to achieve due to changing circumstances and external factors which are beyond the Group's control, including geopolitical issues, energy security, energy poverty and other considerations such as a just transition to a low-carbon economy. This may be exacerbated if the Group chooses or is required to accelerate its climate-related ambitions or targets as a result of (among other things) international regulatory developments or stakeholder expectations in the UK, the US, the EU or other markets.\n\nAchieving Barclays' climate-related ambitions and targets will also depend on a number of factors outside the Group's control, including reliable forecasts of hazards from the physical climate models and availability of data/models to measure/assess climate impact on clients. The pathway to net zero is uncertain, complex and dependent on progress in various areas such as advances in lowcarbon technologies, collective action by clients to meet their own net zero goals, and supportive public policies in markets where Barclays operates. If there is a lack of progress in the aforementioned areas, Barclays may fail to achieve its climaterelated ambitions and targets, and this could have a material adverse effect on Barclays' business, operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the potential legal risk from failing to achieve our climate-related ambitions and targets, refer to page 270.\n\n## ii) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss to the Group from the failure of clients, customers or counterparties, including sovereigns, to fully honour their obligations to members of the Group, including the whole and timely payment of principal, interest, collateral, and other receivables. Credit risk is impacted by a number of factors outside the Group's control, including wider economic conditions.",

        "page_content": "Risk\n\nreview\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks (continued)\n\n## a) Impairment\n\nImpairment is calculated in line with the requirements of IFRS9. Loss allowances, based on ECLs, are measured on a forward-looking basis using a broad range of financial metrics and application of complex judgements. Accordingly, impairment charges are potentially volatile and may not successfully predict actual credit losses, particularly under stressed conditions. Failure by the Group to accurately estimate credit losses through ECLs could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details, refer to Note 8.\n\n## b) Specific portfolios, sectors and concentrations\n\nThe Group is subject to risks arising from changes in credit quality and recovery rates for loans and advances due from borrowers and counterparties. Additionally, the Group is subject to a concentration of those risks where it has significant exposures to borrowers and counterparties in specific sectors, or to particular types of borrowers and counterparties. Any deterioration in the credit quality of such borrowers and counterparties could lead to lower recoverability from loans and advances, and higher impairment charges. Accordingly, any of the following areas of uncertainty could have a material adverse impact on the Group's business, results of operations,  financial condition, and prospects:\n\n- \u00b7 Consumer affordability: this remains a key area of focus, particularly in unsecured lending, as cost of living pressures persist. Macroeconomic factors, such as unemployment, high interest rates or broader inflationary pressures, which impact a customer's ability to service debt payments, could lead to increased arrears in both unsecured and secured products.\n- \u00b7 UK Retail, Hospitality and Leisure: despite holding up reasonably well during most of 2023, continuing cost of living pressures, falling consumer confidence, or other macroeconomic factors adversely affecting consumers could trigger a contraction in demand which, together with rising business costs and, for UK retail, a structural shift to online shopping, would add pressure to sectors heavily reliant on consumer discretionary spending during 2024. This represents a potential risk in the Group's UK corporate portfolio as a higher probability of default exists for retailers,\n\nhospitality providers and their landlords while these pressures remain.\n\n- \u00b7 Real Estate: UK property represents a significant portion of the Group's overall retail and corporate credit exposure, and the Group remains at risk of increased impairment from a material fall in property prices. During 2023 rising mortgage interest rates and increasing economic concerns have reduced both housing market activity and customer borrowing capacity, resulting in modest house price declines year on year. These challenging market conditions are likely to continue in 2024 as the effect of higher interest rates continues to feed through to disposable incomes, especially in London and the South East of the UK where the Group has a high exposure. Additionally, as mortgages roll off existing rates onto new higher rates, there is a risk of increased borrower defaults. This could put further downward pressure on property prices and, in turn, impact the Group's impairment and capital position. Furthermore, certain segments of the housing market could be subject to specific valuation impacts (for example, certain properties within the Group's residential loan portfolio may be subject to remediation activities relating to fire safety standards). The Group's corporate exposure is conservatively positioned with low LTVs but remains vulnerable to a deteriorating economic environment, and moderate stress has been experienced in the Group's (predominantly) US office commercial real estate exposure during 2023. As structural shifts in working patterns, such as the normalisation of 'hybrid' working, mature, the Group remains exposed to further stress. Landlords serving business tenants whose income is based on discretionary consumer spending are also at risk from reduced rent collection.\n- \u00b7 Leveraged Finance Underwriting:the Group takes on non-investment grade underwriting exposures, including single name risk, particularly in the US and the UK. The subdued investor appetite in the underwriting market during 2023 exposed the Group to extended underwriting periods and negative movements in marks, which could deteriorate further and result in losses for the Group (and higher capital charges) if market conditions remain challenging during 2024 and exposures remain on book for further extended periods.\n- \u00b7 Oil & Gas sector: high market energy prices during 2023 have helped restore balance sheet strength to companies operating in this sector. However, in the longer term, costs associated with the transition towards renewable sources of energy may place greater financial demands on oil and gas companies.\n- \u00b7 Air Travel: the sector returned to profit in 2023 as lower margin (tourist) demand for air travel recovered to pre-pandemic levels. That said, there remains a heightened risk to the revenue streams of the Group's clients and, consequentially, their ability to service debt obligation. These risks stem from the structural decline in higher margin business travel, consolidation within the European airline market, reputational damage and/or costs associated with the emerging 'fake parts' scandal, volatile oil prices, increasingly extreme weather patterns and concerns about the impact of air travel on climate change.\n- \u00b7 Information Technology sector: while dominated by well-known US firms, many companies struggle to monetise their product offerings and face increasing reputational risk particularly as regulatory scrutiny increases. Given the nature of their activities, the Group's clients in this sector face heightened risk from data security breaches and ransomware and/or cyber attacks as well as from the malicious use of Artificial Intelligence, all of which could negatively impact their ability to service debt obligations.\n\nThe Group also has large individual exposures to single name counterparties (such as brokers, central clearing houses, dealers, banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients) in both its lending and trading activities, including derivative trades. The default of one such counterparty could cause contagion across clients involved in similar activities and/or adversely impact asset values should margin calls necessitate rapid asset disposals by that counterparty to raise liquidity. In addition, where such counterparty risk has been mitigated by taking collateral, credit risk may remain high if the collateral held cannot be monetised or has to be liquidated at prices which are insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure.\n\nAny such defaults could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results due to, for example, increased credit losses and higher impairment charges.\n\nImpact to the creditworthiness of the Group's clients, customers and",

A disruptive adjustment to higher or lower interest rate levels and deteriorating trade and geopolitical tensions could heighten market risks for the Group's portfolios.\n\nIn addition, the Group's trading business could be vulnerable were there to be prolonged period of elevated asset price volatility, particularly if it adversely affects market liquidity. Such a scenario could impact the Group's ability to execute client trades and may also result in lower client flow-driven income and/or market-based losses on its existing portfolio of assets. These can include higher hedging costs from rebalancing risks that need to be managed dynamically as market levels and their associated volatilities change.\n\nChanges in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to market risk, refer to the market risk management and market risk performance sections.\n\n## iv) Treasury and capital risk\n\nThere are three primary types of treasury and capital risk faced by the Group:\n\n## a) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its contractual or contingent obligations or that it does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to support its assets. This could cause the Group to fail to meet regulatory and/or internal liquidity requirements, make\n\nrepayments of principal or interest  as they fall due or to support day-to-day business activities. Key liquidity risks that the Group faces include:\n\n- \u00b7 Stability of the Group's deposit funding profile: deposits which are payable on demand or at short notice could be adversely affected by the Group failing to preserve the current level of customer and investor confidence or as a result of competition in the banking industry.\n- \u00b7 Ongoing access to wholesale funding: the Group regularly accesses the money and capital markets to provide shortterm and long-term unsecured and secured funding to support its operations. A loss of counterparty confidence, or adverse market conditions (such as the recent rises in interest rates) could lead to a reduction in the tenor, or an increase in the costs, of the Group's unsecured and secured wholesale funding or affect the Group's access to such funding.\n- \u00b7 Impacts of market volatility: adverse market conditions, with increased volatility in asset prices could: (i) negatively impact the Group's liquidity position through increased derivative margin requirements and/or wider haircuts when monetising liquidity pool securities; and (ii) make it more difficult for the Group to execute secured financing transactions.\n- \u00b7 Intraday liquidity usage: increased collateral requirements for payments and securities settlement systems could negatively impact the Group's liquidity position, as cash and liquid assets required for intraday purposes are unavailable to meet other outflows.\n- \u00b7 Off-balance sheet commitments: deterioration in economic and market conditions could cause customers to draw on off-balance sheet commitments provided to them, for example revolving credit facilities, negatively affecting the Group's liquidity position.\n- \u00b7 Credit rating changes and impact on funding costs: any reductions in a credit rating (in particular, any downgrade below investment grade) may affect the Group's access to money or capital markets and/or the terms on which the Group is able to obtain market funding (for example, this could lead to increased costs of funding and wider credit spreads, the triggering of additional collateral or other requirements in derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements, or\n\nlimits on the range of counterparties who are willing to enter into transactions with the Group).\n\n## b) Capital risk\n\nCapital risk is the risk that the Group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its normal business activities and to meet its regulatory capital requirements under normal operating environments and stressed conditions (both actual and as defined for internal planning or regulatory stress testing purposes). This also includes the risk from the Group's pension plans. Key capital risks that the Group faces include:\n\n- \u00b7 Failure to meet prudential capital requirements: this could lead to the Group being unable to support some or all of its business activities, a failure to pass regulatory stress tests, increased cost of funding due to deterioration in investor appetite or credit ratings and restrictions on distributions (including in respect of its shares and/or additional tier 1 instruments), leading to an inability to comply with the Group's distribution policy and/or the need to take additional measures to strengthen the Group's capital or leverage position.\n- \u00b7 Adverse changes in FX rates impacting capital ratios: the Group has capital resources, risk weighted assets and leverage exposures denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely impact the sterling equivalent value of these items. As a result, the Group's regulatory capital ratios are sensitive to foreign currency movements. Failure to appropriately manage the Group's balance sheet to take account of foreign currency movements could result in an adverse impact on the Group's regulatory capital and leverage ratios.\n- \u00b7 Adverse movements in the pension fund: adverse movements in pension assets and liabilities for defined benefit pension schemes could result in deficits on a technical provision and/or IAS 19 accounting basis. This could lead to the Group making substantial additional contributions to its pension plans and/or a deterioration in its capital position. The market value of pension fund assets might decline or investment returns might reduce. Under IAS 19, the liabilities discount rate is derived from the yields of high-quality corporate bonds. Therefore, the valuation of the Group's defined benefits schemes would be adversely affected by a prolonged fall in the discount rate due to a persistent low interest rate and/or",

Inflation is another significant risk driver to the pension fund as the liabilities are adversely impacted by an increase in long-term inflation expectations.\n\n## c) Interest rate risk in the banking book\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is the risk that the Group is exposed to capital or income volatility because of a mismatch between the interest rate exposures of its (non-traded) assets and liabilities. The Group's hedging programmes for interest rate risk in the banking book rely on behavioural assumptions and, as a result, the effectiveness of the hedging strategy cannot be guaranteed. A potential mismatch in the balance or duration of the hedging assumptions could lead to earnings deterioration if there are interest rate movements which are not adequately hedged. A decline in interest rates may also compress net interest margin on retail and corporate portfolios. In addition, the Group's liquid asset portfolio is exposed to potential capital and/or income volatility due to movements in market rates and prices which may have a material adverse effect on the capital position of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to treasury and capital risk, refer to the treasury and capital risk management and treasury and capital risk performance sections.\n\n## v) Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss to the Group from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or due to external events where the root cause is not due to credit or market risks. Examples include:\n\n## a) Operational resilience\n\nThe Group functions in a highly competitive market, with customers and clients that expect consistent and smooth business processes. The loss of or disruption to business processing is a material inherent risk within the Group and across the financial services industry, whether arising through failures in the Group's technology systems, cyber and/or data integrity disruptions, unavailability of a Group site, closure of real estate services provided through its retail branch network, or unavailability of personnel or services supplied by third parties, and there are particular challenges with recovering from a major cyberattack. Failure to build resilience and recovery capabilities into business processes, or into the services on which the Group's business processes depend, may result in significant customer detriment, costs to reimburse losses incurred by the Group's customers and clients, and reputational damage.\n\nCyberattacks continue to be a global threat inherent across all industries, with the number and severity of attacks continuing to rise. The financial sector remains a primary target for cybercriminals, hostile nation states, opportunists and hacktivists. The Group, like other financial institutions, experiences numerous attempts to compromise its cybersecurity protections. In 2023, cybersecurity incidents experienced by Barclays included distributed denial of service (DDoS), phishing, credential stuffing, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Group cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks. Malicious actors, who are increasingly sophisticated in their methods, tactics, techniques and procedures, seek to steal money, gain unauthorised access to, destroy or manipulate data, and disrupt operations. Further, some of their attacks may not be recognised or discovered until launched or after initial entry into the environment, such as novel or zero-day attacks that are launched before patches are available and defences can be readied. Other attacks may take advantage of the window during which patching or the deployment of other defences is underway, but not yet complete. Malicious actors are also increasingly developing methods to avoid prevention, detection and alerting capabilities, including employing counterforensic tactics making response activities more difficult. Cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources and target the Group in numerous ways, including attacks on networks, systems, applications or devices used by the Group or parties such as service providers and other suppliers, counterparties, employees, contractors, customers or clients, presenting the Group with a vast and complex defence perimeter. Moreover, the Group does not have direct control over the cybersecurity of the systems of its clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers and suppliers, limiting the Group's ability to effectively protect and defend against certain threats Some of the Group's third-party service providers and suppliers have experienced successful attempts to compromise their cybersecurity. These have included ransomware attacks that have disrupted the service providers' or suppliers' operations and, in some cases, have had impacts on the Group's operations. Such cyberattacks are likely to continue.\n\nA failure in the Group's adherence to its cybersecurity policies, procedures or controls, employee malfeasance, and\n\nhuman, governance or technological error could also compromise the Group's ability to successfully prevent and defend against cyberattacks. Furthermore, certain legacy technologies that are at or approaching end-of-life may not be able to maintain acceptable levels of security. The Group has experienced cybersecurity incidents and near-misses in the past, and it is inevitable that additional incidents will occur in the future. Cybersecurity risks are expected to increase, due to factors such as the increasing demand across the industry and customer expectations for continued expansion of services delivered over the Internet; increasing reliance on Internet-based products, applications and data storage; the onset of AI, which may be used to facilitate increasingly sophisticated attacks; and changes in ways of working by the Group's employees, contractors, and third party service providers and suppliers and their subcontractors as a long-term consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bad actors have taken advantage of remote working practices and modified customer behaviours, exploiting the situation in novel ways that may elude defences. Additionally, geopolitical turmoil may serve to increase the risk of a cyberattack that could impact Barclays directly, or indirectly through its critical suppliers or national infrastructure. In recent years, the Group has faced a heightened risk of cyberattack as a result of the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.\n\nCommon types of cyberattacks include deployment of malware to obtain covert access to systems and data; ransomware attacks that render systems and data unavailable through encryption and attempts to leverage business interruption or stolen data for extortion; novel or zeroday exploits; denial of service and distributed denial of service attacks; infiltration via business email compromise; social engineering, including phishing, vishing and smishing; automated attacks using botnets; third-party customer, vendor, service provider and supplier account takeover; malicious activity facilitated by an insider; and credential validation or stuffing attacks using login and password pairs from unrelated breaches. A successful cyberattack of any type has the potential to cause serious harm to the Group or its clients and customers, including exposure to potential contractual liability, claims, litigation, regulatory or other government action, loss of existing or potential customers, damage to the Group's brand and reputation, and other financial loss.

A successful cyberattack may, therefore, result in significant regulatory fines on the Group. In addition, any new regulatory measures introduced to mitigate these risks are likely to result in increased technology and compliance costs for the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to cyberattacks, see the operational risk performance section. For further details on cybersecurity regulation applicable to the Group, refer to the Supervision and regulation section.\n\n## c) New and emergent technology\n\nTechnology is fundamental to the Group's business and the financial services industry. Technological advancements present opportunities to develop new and innovative ways of doing business across the Group, with new solutions being developed both in-house and in association with third party companies. For example, payment services and securities, futures and options trading are increasingly occurring electronically, both on the Group's own systems and through other alternative systems, and becoming automated. Whilst increased use of electronic payment and trading systems and direct electronic access to trading markets could significantly reduce the Group's cost base, it may, conversely, reduce the commissions, fees and margins made by the Group on these transactions which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The rapid development in AI is another area the Group is monitoring closely. This includes the identification of potential use cases for responsible adoption of AI in the Group's own operations as well as managing the threats third party usage of AI may pose, including with respect to cybersecurity and fraud.\n\nIntroducing new forms of technology, however, has the potential to increase inherent risk. Failure to evaluate, actively manage and closely monitor risk during all phases of business development and implementation could introduce new vulnerabilities and security flaws and have a material adverse effect on the Group's\n\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## d) External fraud\n\nThe nature of fraud is wide-ranging and continues to evolve, as criminals seek opportunities to target the Group's business activities and exploit changes in customer behaviour and product and channel use (such as the increased use of digital products and enhanced online services) or exploit new products. Fraud attacks can be very sophisticated and are often orchestrated by organised crime groups who use various techniques to target customers and clients directly to obtain confidential or personal information that can be used to commit fraud. The UK market has also seen significant growth in 'scams' where the Group takes increased levels of liability as part of a voluntary code to provide additional safeguards to customers and clients who are tricked into making payments to fraudsters. The impact from fraud can lead to customer detriment, financial losses (including the reimbursement of losses incurred by customers), loss of business, missed business opportunities and reputational damage, all of which could have a material adverse impact on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## e) Data management and information protection\n\nThe Group holds and processes large volumes of data, including personal information, financial data and other confidential information, and the Group's businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of data, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the General Data Protection Regulation as it applies in the EU and the UK). This data could relate to: (i) the Group's clients, customers,  prospective clients and customers and their employees; (ii) clients and customers of the Group's clients and customers and their employees;(iii) the Group's suppliers, counterparties and other external parties, and their employees; and (iv) the Group's employees and prospective employees.\n\nThe international nature of both the Group's business and its IT infrastructure also means that data and personal information may be available in countries other than those from where the information originated. Accordingly, the Group must ensure that its collection, use, transfer and storage of data, including personal information, complies with all applicable laws and regulations in all\n\nrelevant jurisdictions, which could: (i) increase the Group's compliance and operating costs; (ii) impact the development of new products or services or the offering of existing products or services; (iii) affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers; (iv) demand significant oversight by the Group's management; and (v) require the Group to review some elements of the structure of its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Group's measures to safeguard data, including personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could expose the Group to the risk of loss or unavailability of data or data integrity issues and/or cause the Group to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce the Group's revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by the Group to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to potential contractual liability, claims, litigation, regulatory or other government action (including significant regulatory fines) and require changes to certain operations or practices which could also inhibit the Group's development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers. Any of these events could damage the Group's reputation, subject the Group to material fines or other monetary penalties, make the Group liable for the payment of compensatory damages, divert management's time and attention, lead to enhanced regulatory oversight and otherwise materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on data protection regulation applicable to the Group, refer to the supervision and regulation section.\n\n## f) Algorithmic trading\n\nIn some areas of the investment banking business, trading algorithms are used to price and risk manage client and principal transactions. An algorithmic error could result in erroneous or duplicated transactions, a system outage, or impact the Group's pricing abilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation.\n\n## g) Processing errors\n\nThe Group's businesses are highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are",

        "page_content": "Risk\n\nreview\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks (continued)\n\nhighly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. As the Group's customer base and geographical reach expand and the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of transactions, especially electronic transactions (as well as the requirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and exchanges) increase, developing, maintaining and upgrading operational systems and infrastructure becomes more challenging. The risk of systems or human error in connection with such transactions increases with these developments, as well as the potential consequences of such errors due to the speed and volume of transactions involved and the potential difficulty associated with discovering errors quickly enough to limit the resulting consequences. Furthermore, events that are wholly or partially beyond the Group's control, such as a spike in transaction volume, could adversely affect the Group's ability to process transactions or provide banking and payment services.\n\nProcessing errors could result in the Group, among other things: (i) failing to provide information, services and liquidity to clients and counterparties in a timely manner; (ii) failing to settle and/or confirm transactions; (iii) causing funds transfers, capital markets trades and/or other transactions to be executed erroneously, illegally or with unintended consequences; and (iv) adversely affecting financial, trading or currency markets. Any of these events could materially disadvantage the Group's customers, clients and counterparties (including them suffering financial loss) and/or result in a loss of confidence in the Group which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Any of these events could also lead to breaches of laws, rules or regulations and, hence, regulatory enforcement actions, which could result in significant financial loss, imposition of additional capital requirements, enhanced regulatory supervision and reputational damage.\n\n## h) Supplier exposure\n\nThe Group depends on suppliers for the provision of many of its services and the development of technology. Whilst the Group depends on suppliers, it remains fully accountable to its customers and clients for risks arising from the actions of suppliers and may not be able to recover from its suppliers any amounts paid to customers and clients for losses suffered by them. The dependency on suppliers and sub-contracting of outsourced services\n\nintroduces concentration risk where the failure of specific suppliers could have an impact on the Group's ability to continue to provide material services to its customers.\n\nFailure to adequately manage supplier risk could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## i) Estimates and judgements relating to critical accounting policies and regulatory disclosures\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies and judgements to be made in accordance with IFRS. Regulatory returns and capital disclosures are prepared in accordance with the relevant capital reporting requirements and also require assumptions and estimates to be made. The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements and regulatory returns and disclosures, include credit impairment provisions, taxes, fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, pensions and post-retirement benefits, the calculation of RWAs and capital, and provisions including conduct and legal, competition and regulatory matters (please refer to the notes to the audited financial statements for further details). There is a risk that if the judgement exercised, or the estimates or assumptions used, subsequently turn out to be incorrect or are altered as a result of subsequent feedback from the Group's regulators, this could result in material losses to the Group, beyond what was anticipated or provided for, including as a result of changes to treatments in regulatory returns and capital disclosures. If capital requirements are not met as the result of changes in interpretation, compliance with the Group's distribution policy could be impacted and/or additional measures may be required to strengthen the Group's capital or leverage position, which may also lead to the Group's inability to achieve stated targets. Further development of accounting standards and regulatory interpretations could also materially impact the Group's results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## j) Tax risk\n\nThe Group is required to comply with the domestic and international tax laws and practice of all countries in which it has business operations. There is a risk that the Group could suffer losses due to additional tax charges, other financial costs or reputational damage as a result of failing to comply with such laws and practice (including where the Group's interpretation of such laws differs from the interpretation of tax authorities), or by failing to manage its tax affairs in an appropriate manner, with much of this risk attributable to the international structure of the Group. In addition, the introduction of new international tax regimes, increasing tax authority focus on reporting and disclosure requirements around the world as well as the digitisation of the administration of tax have the potential to increase the Group's tax compliance obligations further.\n\nIn 2023, the UK Government enacted legislation on the OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Pillar Two Framework introducing a global minimum tax rate of 15%.\n\nThe UK's Pillar Two rules apply for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023 which will increase the Group's tax compliance obligations. In the USA, the corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statements income introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act became effective on 1 January 2023. These new tax regimes require systems and process changes that introduce potential additional operational risks.\n\n## k) Ability to hire and retain appropriately qualified employees\n\nAs a regulated financial institution, the Group requires diversified and specialist skilled colleagues. The Group's ability to attract, develop and retain a diverse mix of talent is key to the delivery of its core business activity and strategy. This is impacted by a range of external and internal factors, such as macroeconomic factors, labour and immigration policy in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, industry-wide headcount reductions in particular sectors, regulatory limits on compensation for senior executives and the potential effects on employee engagement and wellbeing from long-term periods of working remotely. Failure to attract or prevent the departure of appropriately qualified and skilled employees could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, this may result in",

The Group relies on models to support a broad range of business and risk management activities, including informing business decisions and strategies, measuring and limiting risk, valuing exposures (including the calculation of impairment), conducting stress testing, calculating RWAs and assessing capital adequacy, supporting new business acceptance, risk and reward evaluation, managing client assets, and meeting reporting requirements.\n\nModels are, by their nature, imperfect representations of reality and have some degree of uncertainty because they rely on assumptions and inputs, and so are subject to intrinsic uncertainty, errors and inappropriate use affecting the accuracy of their outputs. This may be exacerbated when dealing with unprecedented scenarios, as was the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the lack of reliable historical reference points and data. For instance, the quality of the data used in models across the Group has a material impact on the accuracy and completeness of its risk and financial metrics. Model uncertainty, errors and inappropriate use may result in (among other things) the Group making inappropriate business decisions and/or inaccuracies or errors in the Group's risk management and regulatory reporting processes. This could result in significant financial loss, imposition of additional capital requirements, enhanced regulatory supervision and reputational damage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further details on the Group's approach\n\nto model risk, refer to the model risk management and model risk performance sections.\n\n## vii) Compliance risk\n\nCompliance risk is the risk of poor outcomes for, or harm to, customers, clients and markets, arising from the delivery of the Group's products and services (conduct risk) and the risk to Barclays, its clients, customers or markets from a failure to comply with the laws, rules and regulations (LRR) applicable to the\n\nfirm. This risk could manifest itself in a variety of ways, including:\n\n## a) Market conduct\n\nThe Group's businesses are exposed to risk from potential non-compliance with its policies and standards (which incorporates regulatory requirements set by law and our regulators) and instances of wilful and negligent misconduct by employees, all of which could result in potential customer and client detriment, enforcement action (including regulatory fines and/or sanctions), increased operation and compliance costs, redress or remediation or reputational damage which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition and prospects. Examples of employee misconduct which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business include: (i) improperly selling or marketing the Group's products and services; (ii) engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorised trading; or (iii) misappropriating confidential or proprietary information belonging to the Group, its customers or third parties.\n\nThese risks may be exacerbated in circumstances where the Group is unable to rely on physical oversight and supervision of employees, noting the move to a hybrid working model for many colleagues.\n\n## b) Customer protection\n\nThe Group must ensure that its customers, particularly those that are vulnerable, are able to make well-informed decisions on how best to use the Group's financial services and understand the protection available to them if something goes wrong. Poor customer outcomes can result from the failure to: (i) communicate fairly and clearly with customers; (ii) provide services in a timely and fair manner; (iii) handle and protect customer data appropriately; and (iv) undertake appropriate activity to address customer detriment, including the adherence to regulatory and legal requirements on complaint handling. The Group is at risk of financial loss and reputational damage as a result also a risk of regulatory censure or enforcement action. In July 2023, the FCA's new Consumer Duty came into force for new and existing products or services that are open to sale or renewal. It will apply to closed products and services from 31 July 2024. The duty sets higher expectations for the standard of care that firms provide to retail customers and impacts all aspects of Barclays' retail businesses, including every retail customer journey, product and service as well as our relationships with\n\npartners, suppliers and third parties. This\n\nhas resulted in significant implementation costs and there will also be higher ongoing costs for the industry as a result of extensive monitoring and evidential requirements.\n\n## c) Product design and review risk\n\nProducts and services must meet the needs of clients, customers, markets and the Group throughout their life cycle, However, there is a risk that the design and review of the Group's products and services fail to reasonably consider and address potential or actual negative outcomes for customers, which may result in customer detriment, enforcement action (including regulatory fines and/or sanctions), redress and remediation and reputational damage. Both the design and review of products and services are a key area of focus for regulators and the Group.\n\n## d) Financial crime\n\nThe Group may be adversely affected if it fails to effectively mitigate the risk that third parties or its employees facilitate, or that its products and services are used to facilitate, financial crime (money laundering, terrorist financing, breaches of economic and financial sanctions, bribery and corruption, and the facilitation of tax evasion). UK and US regulations covering financial institutions continue to focus on combating financial crime. Failure to comply may lead to enforcement or other action by the Group's regulators, including severe penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, prospects and reputation.\n\n## e) Conflicts of interest\n\nIdentifying and managing conflicts of interest is fundamental to the conduct of the Group's business, relationships with customers and clients, and the markets in which the Group operates. Understanding the Conflicts of Interest that impact or potentially impact the Group enables them to be identified, managed and mitigated appropriately. Even if there is no evidence of improper actions, a conflict of interest can create an appearance of impropriety that undermines confidence in the Group and its employees. If the Group does not identify and manage conflicts of interest (business or personal) appropriately, it could have an adverse effect on the Group's business, customers and the markets within which it operates.\n\n## f) Regulatory focus on culture and accountability\n\nRegulators around the world continue to emphasise the importance of culture and personal accountability and enforce the adoption of adequate internal reporting and whistleblowing procedures to help to",

The requirements and expectations of the UK Senior Managers Regime, Certification Regime and Conduct Rules reinforce additional accountabilities for individuals across the Group, with an increased focus on governance and rigour, with similar requirements also introduced in other jurisdictions globally. Failure to meet these requirements and expectations may lead to regulatory sanctions, both for the individuals and the Group.\n\n## g) Laws, rules and regulations\n\nBarclays is subject to range of laws, rules and regulations across the world. A failure to comply with these may have an adverse effect on the Barclays Bank Group's business, customers and the markets within which it operates and could result in reputational damage, penalties, damages or fines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further details on the Group's approach to\n\ncompliance risk, refer to the compliance risk management and compliance risk performance sections.\n\n## viii) Reputation risk\n\nReputation risk is the risk that an action, transaction, investment, event, decision or business relationship will reduce trust in the Group's integrity and/or competence.\n\nAny material lapse in standards of integrity, compliance, customer service or operating efficiency may represent a potential reputation risk. Stakeholder expectations constantly evolve, and so reputation risk is dynamic and varies between geographical regions, groups and individuals. A risk arising in one business area can have an adverse effect upon the Group's overall reputation and any one transaction, investment or event (in the perception of key stakeholders) can reduce trust in the Group's integrity and competence. The Group's association with sensitive topics and sectors has been, and in some instances continues to be, an area of concern for stakeholders, including: (i) the financing of, and investments in, businesses which operate in sectors that are sensitive because of their relative carbon intensity or local environmental impact; (ii) potential association with human rights violations (including combating modern slavery) in the Group's operations or supply chain and by clients and customers; and (iii) the financing of businesses which manufacture and export military and riot control goods and services.\n\nReputation risk could also arise from negative public opinion about the actual, or perceived, manner in which the Group (including its employees, clients and other associations) conducts its business activities, or the Group's financial performance, as well as actual or perceived practices in banking and the financial services industry generally.\n\nModern technologies, in particular, online social media channels and other broadcast tools that facilitate communication with large audiences in short time frames and with minimal costs, may significantly enhance and accelerate the distribution and effect of damaging information and allegations. Negative public opinion may adversely affect the Group's ability to retain and attract customers, in particular, corporate and retail depositors, and to retain and motivate staff, and could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Claims of potential greenwashing arising from sustainability-related statements made by Barclays may also give rise to reputation risk.\n\nIn addition to the above, reputation risk has the potential to arise from operational issues or conduct matters which cause detriment to customers, clients, market integrity, effective competition or the Group (refer to 'v) Operational risk' above).\n\n+\n\n## For further details on the Group's approach\n\nto reputation risk, refer to the reputation risk management and reputation risk performance sections.\n\n## ix) Legal risk and legal, competition and regulatory matters\n\nThe Group conducts activities in a highly regulated global market which exposes it and its employees to legal risk arising from: (i) the multitude of laws, rules and regulations that apply to the businesses it operates, which are highly dynamic, may vary between jurisdictions and/or conflict, and may be unclear in their application to particular circumstances especially in new and emerging areas; and (ii) the diversified and evolving nature of the Group's businesses and business practices. In each case, this exposes the Group and its employees to the risk of loss or the imposition of penalties, damages or fines from the failure of members of the Group to meet applicable laws, rules, regulations or contractual requirements or to assert or defend their intellectual property rights. Legal risk may arise in relation to any number of the material existing and emerging risks identified above.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA breach of applicable laws, rules and/or regulations by the Group or its employees could result in criminal prosecution, regulatory censure, potentially significant fines and other sanctions in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Where clients, customers or other third parties are harmed by the Group's conduct, this may also give rise to civil legal proceedings, including class actions. Other legal disputes may also arise between the Group and third parties relating to matters such as breaches or enforcement of legal rights or obligations arising under contracts, statutes or common law. Adverse findings in any such matters may result in the Group being liable to third parties or may result in the Group's rights not being enforced or not being enforced in the manner intended or desired by the\n\nGroup.\n\nDetails of legal, competition and regulatory matters to which the Group is currently exposed are set out in Note 25. In addition to matters specifically described in Note 25, the Group is engaged in various other legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThe Group is also subject to requests for information, investigations and other reviews (including skilled person reviews) by regulators, governmental and other public bodies. These may be in connection with business activities in which the Group is, or has been, engaged, or areas of particular regulatory focus, such as financial crime, money laundering or terrorist financing. The Group may also (from time to time) be subject to claims and/or legal proceedings and other investigations relating to financial and nonfinancial disclosures made by members of the Group (including, but not limited to, regulatory capital and liquidity reporting and ESG disclosures). Additionally, due to the increasing number of new climate and sustainability-related laws and regulations, growing demand from investors and customers for sustainable products and services, and regulatory and NGO scrutiny, financial institutions, including the Group, may through their business activities face increasing litigation, conduct, enforcement and contract liability risks related to climate change, environmental degradation and other social, governance and sustainability-related issues, including greenwashing risk.",

Furthermore, there is a risk that shareholders, campaign groups, customers and other interest groups could seek to take legal action (including under \"soft law\" mechanisms) against the Group for financing or contributing to climate change and environmental degradation or because the Group's response to climate change or other ESG factors is perceived to be ineffective, insufficient or inappropriate.\n\nThe outcome of legal, competition and regulatory matters, both those to which the Group is currently exposed and any others which may arise in the future, is difficult to predict (and any provision made in the Group's financial statements relating to those matters may not be sufficient to cover actual losses).\n\nIn connection with such matters, the Group may incur significant expense, regardless of the ultimate outcome, and any such matters could expose the Group to any of the following outcomes: substantial monetary damages, settlements and/or fines; remediation of affected customers and clients; other penalties and injunctive relief; additional litigation; criminal prosecution; the loss of any existing agreed protection from prosecution; regulatory restrictions on the Group's business operations including the withdrawal of authorisations; increased regulatory compliance requirements or changes to laws or regulations; suspension of operations; public reprimands or censure; loss of significant assets or business; a negative effect on the Group's reputation; loss of confidence by investors, counterparties, clients and/or customers; risk of credit rating agency downgrades; potential negative impact on the availability and/or cost of funding and liquidity; and/or dismissal or resignation of key individuals.

Physical risks can also be driven by longer term shifts in climate patterns (chronic risks) arising from sustained higher temperatures that may cause rises in sea levels, rising mean temperatures and more frequent/ severe weather events.\n- \u00b7 Transition risks: The transition to a lower carbon economy is likely to involve significant and rapid policy, regulatory and legal changes, as evolving technology and markets adapt to a changing climate and associated impacts.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Group has developed a Climate Risk Framework (CRF) for financial and operational risks stemming from climate change. This enables Barclays to foster a systematic and consistent approach for managing climate risk across the firm. The key principle underpinning this framework is that climate risk is recognised as a driver of other existing financial (Credit, Market, Treasury and Capital) and non financial (including Operational and Reputational) risks, and not treated as a standalone risk type. The CRF is supported by policies, standards and other relevant documents which contain control objectives that must be met.\n\nThe CRF :\n\n- \u00b7 Defines climate risk\n- \u00b7 Establishes principles for the identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting of climate risk\n- \u00b7 Outlines the process for establishing climate risk appetite\n- \u00b7 Summarises the impact of climate risk on other principal financial and operational risk types\n- \u00b7 Outlines roles and responsibilities applicable to the Climate Risk Framework\n\nThe Climate Risk Policy sets objectives for the management of climate risks and establishes key principles for quantifying and reporting, including escalations required to senior stakeholders up to and including the Board Risk Committee (BRC). The Framework and Policy are applicable for Barclays' business activities, with a focus on lending, advisory, sales and trading, capital markets and investments.\n\nClimate risk may also drive non-financial risks such as reputational risk, which continue to be managed under the respective risk frameworks.\n\nTo support the embedment of the Principal Risk, in 2023 the Group delivered the following with three overarching objectives:\n\n- 1. Enhance and improve risk appetite and associated controls for climate risk\n- 2. Develop a plan for refining modelling and scenario analysis capabilities\n- 3. Expand BlueTrack\u2122, which now covers nine segments comprising of Energy, Power, Cement, Steel, Automotive Manufacturing, UK Housing, Commercial Real Estate, Agriculture and Aviation\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Group Head of Climate Risk is the Principal Risk owner accountable for the management and oversight of the climate risk profile. The Group Head of Climate Risk reports directly to Group CRO.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the BRC reviews and approves the Group's approach to managing climate risk.\n\nThe Group Risk Committee (GRC) is the most senior executive body responsible for reviewing and challenging risk practices for climate.\n\nTo support the oversight of Barclays' climate risk profile, a Climate Risk Committee (CRC) has been established as a sub-committee of the GRC. The Group Head of Climate risk is the Chair of the CRC. Any material issues are escalated by the CRC to the GRC, and the GRC subsequently escalates to the BRC as appropriate.\n\nA Climate Risk control environment has been established in alignment with the Barclays' Control Framework. A Climate Risk Control Forum (CRCF) was established in 2022 to oversee implementation and operation of the Barclays Control Framework, including reviewing risk events, policy and issues management. Climate risk assurance groups were also established and are responsible for performing climate risk specific reviews to support the embedding of the Climate Risk Framework and Policy.\n\nEntity Heads of Climate Risk have been appointed across key Barclays legal entities, namely Barclays Bank UK (BBUK) PLC, Barclays Bank (BB) PLC, Barclays Bank Ireland (BBI) PLC, and the US Intermediate Holding Company (US IHC).\n\nBroader sustainability matters and reputation risk associated with climate change are coordinated by the Group Sustainability and ESG Team, led by the Group Head of Sustainability.\n\n|            | Enterprise Risk Framework (ERMF)                          | Enterprise Risk Framework (ERMF)                                            |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Governance | Climate Risk Framework (CRF)                              | Reputation Risk Management  Framework (RRMF)                                |\n|            | Board Risk Committee (BRC)                                | Board Sustainability  Committee (BSC)                                       |\n| Risk       | Credit, market, treasury &  capital and operational risks | Sustainability matters and  reputation risk associated with  climate change |\n| Ownership  | Group Risk Committee (GRC)                                | Group Sustainability  Committee (GSC)                                       |\n|            | Group Chief Risk Officer                                  | Head of Public Policy and  Corporate Responsibility                         |\n|            | Group Head of Climate Risk                                | Group Head of Sustainability                                                |\n\nRisk\n\nreview",

In accordance with the risk appetite policy and tolerance standards, Barclays has established a climate risk appetite at the Group level, comprising of qualitative risk appetite statements and quantitative constraints. This is reviewed and revised (where applicable) annually and formally approved by the Board.\n\nIn 2023, Barclays has enhanced its approach for the quantification of climate risk appetite by implementing additional limits and controls, including around the expected financed emissions target (BlueTrack) pathways. The progress against these targets is monitored on a regular basis whilst acknowledging the challenges and external dependencies to reduce financed emissions. The Group continues to regularly review its risk appetite and enhance risk metrics including expansion of risk limits for priority sectors.\n\n## Risk identification\n\nPhysical and transition risk drivers can lead to adverse financial impacts through various transmission channels. Transmission channels are causal chains that explain how climate risk drivers impact firms such as Barclays either directly through their own operations and infrastructure or indirectly through their financing and investment activities as described earlier in the \"Climate-related Risks\" section on page 67. The diagram below illustrates these dynamics.\n\nThe potential impact of physical risk events at the macro level may include lower GDP growth, higher unemployment and significant changes in the availability and prices of products or commodities. At the micro level, damage to properties and operations of Barclays's clients could lead to increasing costs and possible decline in revenues, which in turn might impact their ability to repay the loans. Thus through these transmission channels, risks for Barclays may materialise in its traditional risk categories such as credit risk, market risk, treasury and capital risk, operational risk and reputational risk. The impact of climate risk drivers may be significant and widespread, affecting companies, households and the general economy leading to potential financial system contagion.\n\n## Climate risks\n\n## Economic transmission channels\n\n## Financial risks\n\n## Transition risks\n\n- \u00b7 Policy and legal (e.g. carbon tax, litigation actions)\n- \u00b7 Reputation (e.g. stakeholder concern, change in consumer preferences)\n- \u00b7 Technology (e.g. substitute technologies, emissions capture)\n- \u00b7 Market (e.g. change in market sentiment, uncertainty in market signals)\n\n## Physical risks\n\n- \u00b7 Chronic (e.g. temperature, precipitation, agricultural productivity, sea levels)\n- \u00b7 Acute (e.g. heatwaves, floods, cyclones\n- and wildfires)\n\n## Micro\n\nAffecting individual businesses and households\n\n## Businesses\n\n- \u00b7 Property damage and business disruption from severe weather\n- \u00b7 Stranded assets and new capital expenditure due to transition\n- \u00b7 Changing demand and costs\n- \u00b7 Legal liability (from failure to mitigate or adapt)\n\n## Households\n\n- \u00b7 Loss of income (from weather disruption and health impacts, labour market frictions)\n- \u00b7 Property damage (from severe weather) or restrictions (from lowcarbon policies) increasing costs and affecting valuations\n\n## Macro\n\nAggregate impacts on the macroeconomy\n\n- \u00b7 Capital depreciation and increased investment\n- \u00b7 Shifts in prices (from structural changes, supply shocks)\n- \u00b7 Productivity changes (from severe heat, diversion of investment to mitigation and adaptation, higher risk aversion)\n- \u00b7 Labour market frictions (from physical and transition risks)\n- \u00b7 Socioeconomic changes (from changing consumption patterns, migration, conflict)\n- \u00b7 Other impacts on international trade, government revenues, fiscal space, output, interest rates and exchange rates.\n\n## Climate and economy feedback effects\n\n## Economy and financial system feedback effects\n\nAdapted from Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), September 2022 and in consideration of transmission channels relevant to Barclays.\n\n## Credit risk\n\n- \u00b7 Defaults by businesses and households\n- \u00b7 Collateral depreciation\n\n## Market risk\n\n- \u00b7 Repricing of equities, fixed income, commodities etc.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\n- \u00b7 Increased costs to comply with regulatory requirements\n\n## Operational risk\n\n- \u00b7 Supply chain disruption\n- \u00b7 Forced facility closure\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\n- \u00b7 Increased demand for liquidity\n- \u00b7 Refinancing risk\n\nFinancial statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial system contagion",

Reduction in financial asset values can potentially lead to abrupt price adjustments,  resulting in market risk losses where climate risk is not priced into the asset value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Treasury & capital risk | Severe physical events could trigger a sharp increase in demand for liquidity for financial firms, corporates and  households. Reduction in banks' access to stable sources of funding or withdrawal of deposits due to climate risk drivers  may negatively impact banks' liquidity positions. Deterioration of clients' risk profile due to climate risk drivers may also  lead to higher capital requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Operational risk        | Acute physical risk events may cause damage to banks' essential infrastructure and disrupt operations leading to higher  operational risks. Banks rely on a complex network of supplier and service providers. Climate change can disrupt supply  chains by affecting the availability of goods and services leading to delays or interruptions in critical operations.  Increasingly stringent climate and sustainability-related laws and regulations and the pace at which the regulations are  implemented means that banks, through their business activities, may face increasing litigation and other claims if they  are perceived to have contributed to or failed to prevent climate change or environmental damage, including by  financing client activities. |\n| Reputation risk         | Banks may face reputational risks related to climate change in various ways, as the public and stakeholders increasingly  expect banks to demonstrate their commitment to environmental sustainability. Banks that are perceived as not  adequately addressing climate risks may face reputational damage. Additionally, banks can be accused of greenwashing  if the information disclosed is misleading or if they are not able to meet their climate goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\nBarclays has developed an internal climate risk identification process to identify and assess the potential impact of climate risk as a driver of other principal risks. Drivers of climate risk are identified and collated through quarterly horizon scanning exercises, following which information is disseminated to relevant principal risk teams. Following review by principal risk teams, the relevant information feeds into the Climate Risk Register. The Climate Risk Register is maintained as per the ERMF and is integrated into the Group Risk Register.\n\nThe Group Risk Register contains all material risks that may impact forwardlooking business plans across key legal entities (Barclays PLC, BBUK PLC, BBI PLC) and business units (BUK and BI). Quantitative (typically based on stress testing) or qualitative assessments are performed to quantify the impact of material risks on capital or liquidity positions of legal entities/business units. Following this assessment, each material risk is mapped to key drivers along with the risk ratings (which are derived based on magnitude of impact and materiality thresholds). The Group Risk Register is refreshed on at least an annual basis and is subsequently used to support strategic planning, scenario design, sensitivity analysis and capital adequacy assessments.\n\nBarclays has also developed processes to identify sectors, sovereigns and US States which other Principal Risks must prioritise for assessment of climate risks. Within these processes, the Group analyses and assesses the sensitivity and vulnerability of different industry sectors and geographies (including sovereigns and US states) to various physical and transition risk drivers and categorise them into different risk buckets. Following this assessment, the industry sectors and geographies that are highly exposed to climate risks are deemed to be of elevated risk. These assessments are regularly reviewed and benchmarked against external studies and research and incorporate inputs from the subject matter experts.\n\nThe outcomes of the above mentioned processes namely the Climate Risk Register, elevated sector and geography (including sovereigns and US states) assessments and underlying exposures, form the basis of Barclays' approach and priorities for further granular assessment. Details on exposures to elevated sectors are on pages 284 to 287.\n\nIn the UK Mortgages portfolio, segments that are vulnerable to subsidence and flood risk have been identified. Additionally, Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings have been identified for portfolios that are particularly vulnerable to transition\n\nrisk. Methodology and breakdown of subsidence risk and flood risk bands in the portfolio is available on page 288.\n\nAdditionally, through individual client assessments and scenario analysis exercises, Barclays identifies portfolios that are more vulnerable to climaterelated risks.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nThe emissions resulting from the activities of customers and clients to whom financing is provided is measured using Barclays' bespoke tool BlueTrack\u2122. Currently, BlueTrack\u2122 covers nine segments comprising of Energy, Power, Cement, Steel, Automotive Manufacturing, UK Housing, Commercial Real Estate, Agriculture and Aviation. Details on the BlueTrack\u2122 methodology\n\nand targets are on pages 86 to 99.\n\nFurthermore, Barclays has developed the Client Transition Framework (CTF) to evaluate clients' progress as they transition to a low-carbon business model. Using BlueTrack\u2122 data and public disclosures, the framework evaluates both qualitative and quantitative components to assess transition trajectories against Barclays' targets and benchmarks. This allows the Group to prioritise engagement with clients based on their CTF scores. Details on the CTF methodology are on page 90.",

For example, the power sector review incorporated analysis of carbon intensity, transition plans and the results of a bespoke power utilities scenario analysis (such as the effect of carbon pricing on client financial performance).\n\nFurthermore, Barclays has industryspecific risk management processes where appropriate. Granular asset-level assessment is performed in the oil and gas portfolio, prioritising the assessment of clients that are non-investment grade and operating in the upstream and midstream sub-sectors. Taking into account factors such as breakeven costs, geological concerns, infrastructure constraints and regulatory/geopolitical uncertainty, Barclays has subsequently classified clients and their assets into tiers from 1 to 3, with tier 3 considered the riskiest. Asset tiering and assessment for these clients are reviewed at least annually.\n\nFor Credit Risk, Barclays continues to embed climate risk assessment into credit assessment, annual review and transaction approval processes to ensure that climate-related risks are considered for Wholesale Credit and Retail customers in elevated risk sectors.\n\nAt a client level, the Climate Lens questionnaire is used to evaluate physical, transition and environmental risks associated with firms operating in elevated risk sectors. Each question is rated as Low, Moderate or High based on the client's exposure and vulnerability to various climate and environmental risk factors. Climate Lens is currently being redeveloped with the aim of making it more quantitative and improving its integration within the credit processes.\n\nFor Market Risk, the impact of climate change is measured by applying stress scenarios that stress the core risks susceptible to climate change over long and short-term horizons to individual risk factors. This process is conducted every quarter. The pattern of stress losses arising from the stress scenario is used to estimate and set ongoing limits, consistent with the Board-approved maximum stress loss capacity for Market risk, under which Barclays monitors and controls Market risk arising from climate change.\n\nFor Treasury and Capital Risk, Barclays' conducts Group-wide climate stress tests to understand and assess the potential impact on Barclays' capital position. Climate risk considerations have also been incorporated into the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For Liquidity Risk, Barclays identifies and assesses potential vulnerabilities of certain industries and asset classes that may deteriorate under a climate stress scenario, and subsequently impact funding and liquidity ratios. Climate risk considerations have also been incorporated into the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). For Pension Risk, key risk indicators based on the impact of physical and transition risk drivers on the pension fund have been defined. These are reviewed and monitored on a quarterly basis.\n\nFor operational risk, climate-related risks continue to be assessed as part of existing business-as-usual operational risk processes. This includes working with Premises and Operational Recovery Planning teams to evaluate and respond to climate-related impacts and regulatory requirements Climate factors have been integrated into Structured Scenario Assessments, which capture extreme but plausible operational tail risks. As part of the assessment in 2023, climate risk has been included in the building destruction scenario (physical risks) and greenwashing-related scenarios (transition risks).\n\nFor reputational risk, the primary responsibility for identifying and managing reputation risk and adherence sits with the front line business and support functions where the risk arises. The Enhanced Due Diligence process and other relevant processes in these business units facilitate the assessment of climate-related reputational risk - details on this are on page 236, while details on oversight and management are embedded with the Barclays governance framework on pages 231 to 232.\n\nAcross Barclays' portfolios, scenario analysis continues to form a key part of the Group's approach to assessing and quantifying the impact of climate change. Details on the progress and outcomes of our scenario analysis and stress testing exercises are available on pages 131 to 136.\n\n## Risk monitoring  and reporting\n\nIn addition to the climate risk appetite, Barclays has integrated climate risk considerations into policies, standards and lending guidelines. Consistent with our net zero ambition and taking into account considerations of all relevant business factors, policies have been introduced to progressively curtail or prohibit financing of certain activities in sensitive sectors, including upstream oil and gas, thermal coal mining and coal-fired power generation, Arctic oil and gas, oil sands, hydraulic fracturing (fracking), Amazon oil and gas, extra heavy oil and ultra-deep water. These policies are reviewed regularly and updated with respect to external developments. Details on restrictive policies are on page 100. Mandate and scale (M&S) exposure controls translate risk appetite into a detailed series of limits to control day-today risk taking. Barclays has implemented climate-aware limits and controls for priority sectors, including based on, BlueTrack\u2122 measures of emissions intensity and the Client Transition Framework. For the UK retail portfolio, physical and transition risk mandates are in place for the UK Mortgages and Business\n\nBanking Agriculture portfolios.\n\nQuantitative and qualitative information are presented and reviewed at the CRC. A Group-level climate risk dashboard is presented to BRC on a quarterly basis, which is used to inform progress against sector targets, current exposure to portfolios with high physical and transition risks, concentrations and climate risk trends. The climate dashboard periodically includes outputs and learnings from internal stress test and regulatory exercises and external developments based on horizon scanning.\n\nLegal entity specific climate risk dashboards for monitoring and reviewing climate-sensitive exposures have been developed and presented to appropriate committees. Where Climate Risk limits are subject to ongoing monitoring, they will be reported at the appropriate Principal Risk Committees and CRC.\n\nBarclays continues to enhance and sophisticate our risk management capabilities with our increased knowledge and ability to quantify and manage climaterelated risks.",

As part of the pilot programme, we worked with an external expert to test the draft TNFD framework, including the proposed risk assessment process (LEAP FI), on our agriculture and food portfolio in Europe, with a focus on UK farming.\n\nAs reported last year, this involved assessing our clients' locations in terms of production and sales and applying a number of different 2030 scenarios to the portfolio. During 2023, we used the results of the pilot to inform the management of naturerelated risks identified during the assessment. For example, the results informed the development of new questions for the Client Transition Tool (CTT) for UK farmers, which are due to be incorporated in 2024. This will help identify clients that may need support in managing their naturerelated risks alongside decarbonisation actions, and to inform our client engagement proposition. See page 94 for more details on our work with the UK farming sector.\n\nFurther, in recognition of naturerelated impacts identified in the agricultural value chain, we updated our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities Statement, which included strengthening our existing restrictions and introducing additional new restrictions on clients operating in agricultural commodity sectors exposed to significant deforestation risk. See page 100 for details.\n\n## Credit risk management (audited)\n\nThe risk of loss to the Group from the failure of clients, customers or counterparties, including sovereigns, to fully honour their obligations to the Group, including the whole and timely payment of principal, interest, collateral and other receivables.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe credit risk that the Group faces arises from wholesale and retail loans and advances together with the counterparty\n\ncredit risk arising from derivative contracts with clients; trading activities, including:\n\n- \u00b7 debt securities, settlement balances with market counterparties, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) assets and reverse repurchase loans.\n\nCredit risk management objectives are to:\n\n- \u00b7 maintain a framework of controls to oversee credit risk\n- \u00b7 identify, assess and measure credit risk clearly and accurately across the Group and within each separate business, from the level of individual facilities up to the total portfolio\n- \u00b7 control and plan credit risk taking in line with external stakeholder expectations, including risk return objectives, and avoiding undesirable concentrations\n- \u00b7 monitor credit risk and adherence to agreed controls.\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe first line of defence has primary responsibility for managing credit risk within the risk appetite and limits set by the Risk function, supported by a defined set of policies, standards and controls. In the entities, business risk committees (attended by the first line) monitor and review the credit risk profile of each business unit where the most material issues are escalated to the Retail Credit Risk Management Committee, Wholesale Credit Risk Management Committee and Group Risk Committee.\n\nWholesale and retail portfolios are managed separately to reflect the differing nature of the assets; wholesale balances tend to be larger and are managed on an individual basis, while retail balances are greater in number but lesser in value and are, therefore, managed in aggregated segments.\n\nThe responsibilities of the credit risk management teams in the businesses, the sanctioning team and other shared services include: sanctioning new credit agreements (principally wholesale); setting strategies for approval of transactions (principally retail); setting risk appetite; monitoring risk against limits and other parameters; maintaining robust processes, data gathering, quality, storage and reporting methods for effective credit risk management; performing effective turnaround and workout scenarios for wholesale portfolios via dedicated restructuring and recoveries teams; maintaining robust collections and recovery processes/units for retail portfolios; and review and validation of credit risk measurement models.\n\nThe credit risk management teams in each legal entity are accountable to the relevant Legal Entity CRO, who reports to the Group CRO.\n\nFor wholesale portfolios, credit risk managers are organised in sanctioning teams by geography, industry and/or product. In wholesale portfolios, credit risk approval is undertaken by experienced credit risk professionals operating within a clearly defined delegated authority framework, with only the most senior credit officers assigned the higher levels of delegated authority. The largest credit exposures, which are outside the Risk Sanctioning Unit or Risk Distribution Committee authority, require the support of a legal entity Senior Credit Officer. For exposures in excess of the legal entity Senior Credit Officer's authority, approval by Group Senior Credit Officer/Board Risk Committee is also required. The Group Credit Risk Committee, attended by legal entity Senior Credit Officers, provides a formal mechanism for the Group Senior Credit Officer to exercise the highest level of credit authority over the most material Group single name exposures.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation\n\nThe Group employs a range of techniques and strategies to actively mitigate credit risks. These can broadly be divided into three types:\n\n- \u00b7 netting and set-off\n- \u00b7 collateral\n- \u00b7 risk transfer.\n\n## Netting and set-off\n\nCredit risk exposures can be reduced by applying netting and set-off. For derivative transactions, the Group's normal practice is, on a legal entity basis, to enter into standard master agreements with counterparties (e.g. ISDAs). These master agreements typically allow for netting of credit risk exposure to a counterparty resulting from derivative transactions against the obligations to the counterparty in the event of default, and so produce a lower net credit exposure. These agreements may also reduce settlement exposure (e.g. for foreign exchange transactions) by allowing payments on the same day in the same currency to be setoff against one another.",

        "page_content": "Risk\n\nreview\n\n## Principal risk management (continued)\n\n## Collateral\n\nThe Group has the ability to call on collateral in the event of default of the counterparty, comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 home loans: a fixed charge over residential property in the form of houses, flats and other dwellings\n- \u00b7 wholesale lending: a fixed charge over commercial property and other physical assets, in various forms\n- \u00b7 other retail lending: includes charges over other physical assets; second lien charges over residential property; and finance lease receivables\n- \u00b7 derivatives: the Group also often seeks to enter into a margin agreement (e.g. Credit Support Annex) with counterparties with which the Group has master netting agreements in place. These annexes to master agreements provide a mechanism for further reducing credit risk, whereby collateral (margin) is posted on a regular basis (typically daily) to collateralise the mark to market exposure of a derivative portfolio measured on a net basis\n- \u00b7 reverse repurchase agreements: collateral typically comprises highly liquid securities which have been legally transferred to the Group subject to an agreement to return them for a fixed price\n- \u00b7 financial guarantees and similar offbalance sheet commitments: cash collateral may be held against these arrangements.\n\n## Risk transfer\n\nA range of instruments including guarantees, credit insurance, credit derivatives and securitisation can be used to transfer credit risk from one counterparty to another. These mitigate credit risk in three main ways:\n\n- \u00b7 if the risk is transferred to a counterparty which is more creditworthy than the original counterparty, then overall credit risk is reduced\n- \u00b7 where recourse to the first counterparty remains, both counterparties must default before a loss materialises. This is less likely than the default of either counterparty individually so credit risk is reduced.\n- \u00b7 first loss exposures across pools of credit risk can be hedged via synthetic securitisation structures, typically via CLN (credit lending notes) issuance. As these are fully funded upfront they provide for a direct reduction in credit risk exposure on referenced pools.\n- + Detailed policies are in place to appropriately recognise and record credit risk mitigation. For more information, refer to pages 131 to 134 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited).\n\n## Governance and oversight of ECLs under IFRS 9\n\nThe Group's organisational structure and internal governance processes oversee the estimation of ECL across several areas, including: i) setting requirements in policy, including key assumptions and the application of key judgements; ii) the design and execution of models; and iii) review of ECL results.\n\ni) Impairment policy requirements are set and reviewed regularly, at a minimum annually, to maintain adherence to accounting standards. Key judgements inherent in policy, including the estimated life of revolving credit facilities and the quantitative criteria for assessing the significant increase in credit risk (SICR), are separately supported by analytical study. In particular, the quantitative thresholds used for assessing SICR are subject to a number of internal validation criteria, particularly in retail portfolios where thresholds decrease as the origination Probability of Default (PD) of each facility increases. Key policy requirements are also aligned to the Group's credit risk management strategy and practices, for example, wholesale customers that are risk managed on an individual basis are assessed for ECL on an individual basis upon entering Stage 3; furthermore, key internal risk management indicators of high risk are used to set SICR policy, for example, retail customers identified as high risk account management are automatically deemed to have met the SICR criteria.\n\nii) ECL is estimated in line with internal policy requirements using models which are validated by a qualified independent party to the model development area, the Independent Validation Unit (IVU), before first use and on a regular basis, at a minimum every three years. Each model is designated an owner who is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 model maintenance: monitoring of model performance including backtesting by comparing predicted ECL versus flow into stage 3 and coverage ratios; proposing material changes for independent IVU approval; and recalibrating model parameters on more timely data\n- \u00b7 proposing post-model adjustments (PMA) to address model weaknesses or to account for situations where known or expected risk factors and information have not been considered in the modelling process. All PMAs relating to model deficiencies, regardless of value are approved by IVU for a set time period. PMAs representing Expert Judgement are validated by Risk, as the second line of defence and approved for a set time period. The most material PMAs are also approved by the CRO.\n\nModels must also assess ECL across a range of future economic conditions. These economic scenarios are generated via an independent model and ultimately set by the Senior Scenario Review Committee. Economic scenarios are regenerated at a minimum twice annually but more frequently if deemed appropriate, and also to align with the Group's medium term planning exercise. Each model used in the estimation of ECL, including key inputs, are governed by a series of internal controls, which include the validation of completeness and accuracy of data in golden source systems, documented data transformations and documented lineage of data transfers between systems.\n\niii) The Group Impairment Committee, formed of members from both Finance and Risk and attended by both the Group Finance Director and the Group CRO, is responsible for overseeing impairment policy and practice across the Group and will approve impairment results. Reported results and key messages are communicated to the BAC, which has an oversight role and provides challenge of key assumptions, including the basis of the scenarios adopted. Impairment results are then factored into management decision making, including but not limited to, business planning, risk appetite setting and portfolio management.",

Upon execution of a trade with a client, the Group will look to hedge against the risk of the trade moving in an adverse direction. Mismatches between client transactions and hedges result in market risk due to changes in asset prices, volatility or correlations.\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nMarket risk in the businesses resides primarily in Barclays International and Treasury. These businesses have the mandate to assume market risk. The front office and Treasury trading desks are responsible for managing market risk on a day-to-day basis, where they are required to understand and adhere to all limits applicable to their businesses. The Market Risk team supports the trading desks with the day-to-day limit management of market risk exposures through governance processes which are outlined in supporting market risk policies and standards.\n\nMarket risk oversight and challenge is provided by business committees and Group committees, including the Market Risk Committee (MRC).\n\nThe objectives of market risk management are to:\n\n- \u00b7 identify, understand and control market risk by robust measurement, limit setting, reporting and oversight\n- \u00b7 facilitate business growth within a controlled and transparent risk management framework\n- \u00b7 control market risk in the businesses according to the allocated appetite.\n\nTo meet the above objectives, a governance structure is in place to manage these risks consistent with the ERMF.\n\nThe BRC recommends market risk appetite to the Board for their approval. The Market Risk Principal Risk Lead (PR Lead) is responsible for the Market Risk Control Framework and, under delegated authority from the Group CRO, agrees with the business CROs a limit framework within the context of the approved market risk appetite.\n\nThe Market Risk Committee (MRC) reviews and makes recommendations concerning the group-wide market risk profile. This includes overseeing the operation of the Market Risk Framework and associated policies and standards, monitoring market and regulatory changes, and reviewing limit utilisation levels . The committee is chaired by the PR Lead and attendees include the business heads of market risk and business aligned market risk managers.\n\nIn addition to MRC, the Corporate and Investment Bank Risk Committee ('CIBRC') is the main forum in which market risk exposures are discussed and reviewed with senior business heads. The Committee is chaired by the CRO of Barclays International and meets weekly, covering current market events, notable market risk exposures, and key risk topics. New business initiatives are generally socialised at CIBRC before any changes to risk appetite or associated limits are considered in other governance committees.\n\nThe head of each business is accountable for all market risks associated with its activities, while the head of the market risk team covering each business is responsible for implementing the risk control framework for market risk.\n\nFor more information on market risk management, refer to the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited).\n\n## Management value at risk (VaR)\n\nVaR is an estimate of the potential loss arising from unfavourable market movements if the current positions were to be held unchanged for one business day. For internal market risk management purposes, a historical simulation methodology with a one-year equally weighted historical period, at the 95% confidence level is used for all trading books and some banking books.\n\nLimits are applied at the total level as well as by risk factor type, which are then cascaded down to particular trading desks and businesses by the market risk management function.\n\n## Treasury and capital risk management\n\nThis comprises:\n\nLiquidity risk: The risk that the Group is unable to meet its contractual or contingent obligations or that it does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to support its assets.\n\nCapital risk: The risk that the Group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its normal business activities and to meet its regulatory capital requirements under normal operating environments and stressed conditions (both actual and as defined for internal planning or regulatory testing purposes). This also includes the risk from the Group's pension plans.\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book: The risk that the Group is exposed to capital or income volatility because of a mismatch between the interest rate exposures of its (non-traded) assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Treasury function manages treasury and capital risk exposure on a day-to-day basis with the Group Treasury Committee acting as the principal management body. The Treasury and Capital Risk function is responsible for oversight and provides insight into key capital, liquidity, interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) and pension risk management activities.\n\n## Liquidity risk management (audited)\n\n## Overview\n\nThe efficient management of liquidity is essential to the Group in order to retain the confidence of the financial markets and maintain the sustainability of the business. Treasury and Capital Risk have created a framework to manage all liquidity risk exposures under both normal and stressed conditions. The framework is designed to maintain liquidity resources that are sufficient in amount, quality and funding tenor profile to remain within the liquidity risk appetite as expressed by the Barclays PLC Board. The liquidity risk appetite is monitored against both internal and regulatory liquidity metrics.",

The Treasury and Capital Risk Committee monitors and reviews the liquidity risk profile and control environment, providing second line oversight of the management of liquidity risk. The BRC reviews the risk profile, and reviews liquidity risk appetite at least annually and the impact of stress scenarios on the Group funding plan/ forecast in order to agree the Group's projected funding abilities.\n\n## Capital risk management (audited)\n\n## Overview\n\nCapital risk is managed through ongoing monitoring and management of the capital and leverage position, regular stress testing and a robust capital governance framework. The objectives of the framework are to maintain adequate capital for the Group and legal entities to withstand the impact of the risks that may arise under normal and stressed conditions, and maintain adequate capital to cover current and forecast business needs and associated risks to provide a viable and sustainable business offering.\n\nThe Group  aims to prudently manage its overall leverage position (including risk of excessive leverage) by utilising plausible stress scenarios, reviewing and deploying management actions in response to deteriorating economic and commercial positions.  In order to manage contingent leverage risk, the Group considers the context from which the business consumption arises, the impact of client utilisation on leverage and the available actions to manage.\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nTreasury has the primary responsibility for managing and monitoring capital adequacy. The Treasury and Capital Risk function provides oversight of capital risk. Production of the Barclays PLC Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) is the responsibility of Treasury.\n\nCapital risk management is underpinned by a control framework and policy. The capital management strategy, outlined in the Group and legal entity capital plans, is developed in alignment with the control framework and policy for capital risk, and is implemented consistently in order to deliver on the Group's objectives.\n\nThe Board approves the Group capital plan, internal stress tests and results of regulatory stress tests, and the Group recovery plan. The Group Treasury Committee is responsible for monitoring and managing capital risk in line with the Group's capital management objectives, capital plan and risk frameworks. The Treasury and Capital Risk Committee monitors and reviews the capital risk profile and control environment, providing second line oversight of the management of capital risk. The BRC reviews the risk profile, and reviews risk appetite at least annually and the impact of stress scenarios on the Group capital plan/forecast in order to agree the Group's projected capital adequacy.\n\nLocal management assures compliance with an entity's minimum regulatory capital requirements by reporting to local Asset and Liability Committees (ALCOs) with oversight by the Group Treasury Committee, as required. In 2023, Barclays complied with all regulatory minimum capital requirements. Contingent leverage risk is managed by; i) setting comprehensive leverage (and RWA) targets for each business as part of the Treasury capital management process, taking into account adherence to early warning indicators and maintain a healthy leverage ratio, and; ii) Monitoring execution of actions taken to course-correct as necessary.\n\nThe Group maintains a number of defined benefit pension schemes for past and current employees. The ability of schemes to meet pension payments is achieved with investments and contributions.\n\nPension risk arises because the market value of pension fund assets might decline; investment returns might reduce; or the estimated value of pension liabilities might increase. The Group monitors the pension risks arising from its defined benefit pension schemes and works with the relevant pension fund's trustees to address shortfalls. In these circumstances, the Group could be required or might choose to make extra contributions to the pension fund. The Group's main defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants in 2012.\n\n## Interest rate risk in the banking book management (IRRBB) Overview\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is driven by customer deposit taking and lending activities, investments in the liquid asset portfolio and funding activities. As per the Group's policy to remain within the defined risk appetite, hedging strategies are executed to mitigate the various IRRBB risks that result from these activities. However, the Group remains susceptible to interest rate risk and other non-traded market risks from the following key sources:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest rate and repricing risk: the risk that net interest income could be adversely impacted by a change in interest rates, differences in the timing of interest rate changes between assets and liabilities, and other constraints on interest rate changes as per product terms and conditions.\n- \u00b7 Customer behavioural risk: the risk that net interest income could be adversely impacted by the discretion that customers and counterparties may have in respect of being able to vary from their contractual obligations with Barclays. This risk is often referred to by industry regulators as 'embedded option risk'.\n- \u00b7 Investment risks in the liquid asset portfolio: the risk that the fair value of assets held in the liquid asset portfolio and associated risk management portfolios could be adversely impacted by market volatility, creating volatility in capital directly.",

The GRC and Treasury and Capital Risk Committee monitors and reviews the IRRBB risk profile and control environment, providing second line oversight of the management of IRRBB. The BRC reviews the interest rate risk profile, including review of the risk appetite at least annually and the impact of stress scenarios on the interest rate risk of the Group's banking books.\n\nIn addition, the Group's IRRBB policy sets out the processes and key controls required to identify all IRRBB risks arising from banking book operations, to monitor the risk exposures via a set of metrics with a frequency in line with the risk management horizon, and to manage these risks within agreed risk appetite and limits.\n\n## Model risk management\n\nThe potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Bank uses models to support a broad range of activities, including informing business decisions and strategies, measuring and limiting risk, valuing exposures, conducting stress testing, assessing capital adequacy, managing client assets, and meeting reporting requirements.\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Barclays Group has a dedicated Model Risk Management ('MRM') function that consists of six teams:\n\n(i) Independent Validation Unit ('IVU'), responsible for model validation and approval;\n\n(ii) Group Model Risk Governance, responsible for model risk governance, controls and reporting, as well as providing oversight for compliance of the Model Owner community with the Model Risk Framework;\n\n(iii) Framework team, responsible for the Model Risk Policy and associated standards;\n\n(iv) Infrastructure Delivery and Oversight, responsible for the delivery of model inventory including associated data quality & reporting and oversight of Quantitative Processes;\n\n(v) COO, responsible for strategy, communications and business management; and\n\n(vi) Model Risk Measurement and Quantification ('MRMQ'), responsible for the design of the framework and methodology to measure and, where possible, quantify model risk. It is also responsible for the strategic Validation Centre of Excellence ('VCoE'), which is an independent quality assurance function within MRM with the mandate to review and challenge validation outcomes. VCoE is aligned to the Group Model Risk Governance team.\n\nThe Group Model Risk Committee is MRM's primary risk committee and a subcommittee of the Group Risk Committee. It is convened with senior executives in the first and second line of defence to oversee the model risk profile and risk appetite.\n\nThe Model Risk Framework is defined and implemented through Model Risk Policy and Standards that prescribe the Barclays Group-wide, end-to-end requirements for the identification, measurement and management of model risk, covering model documentation, development, testing, monitoring, annual review, independent validation and approval, change and reporting processes.\n\nThe function reports to the Barclays Group CRO and operates a global framework. Implementation of best practice standards is a central objective of the Barclays Group.\n\nThe key model risk management activities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Correctly identifying models across all relevant areas of the Bank and recording models in the Barclays Group Models Database ('GMD'), the Barclays Groupwide model inventory.\n- \u00b7 Enforcing that every model has a model owner who is accountable for the model. The model owner must sign off models prior to submission to the Independent Validation Unit (IVU) for validation and ensure that the model presented to IVU is and remains fit for purpose.\n- \u00b7 Overseeing that every model is subject to validation and approval by IVU, prior to use and on a continual basis.\n- \u00b7 Defining the model risk appetite in terms of risk tolerance, and qualitative metrics which are used to track and report on model risk.\n\n## Operational risk management\n\nThe risk of loss to the Group from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or due to external events (for example, fraud) where the root cause is not due to credit or market risks.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe management of operational risk has three key objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 deliver and oversee an operational risk capability owned and used by business leaders to enable sound risk decisions over the long term\n- \u00b7 provide the frameworks, policies and standards to enable management to meet their risk management responsibilities while the second line of defence provides robust, independent, and effective oversight and challenge\n- \u00b7 deliver a consistent and aggregated measurement of operational risk that will provide clear and relevant insights, so that the right management actions can be taken to keep the operational risk profile consistent with the Group's strategy, the stated risk appetite and stakeholder needs.\n\nThe Group operates within a system of internal controls that enables business to be transacted and risk taken without exposing it to unacceptable potential losses or reputational damages.\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe prime responsibility for the management of operational risk and the compliance with control requirements rests within the business and functional units where the risk arises. The operational risk profile and control environment is reviewed by management through business risk committees and control committees. Operational risk issues escalated from these meetings are considered through the second line of defence review meetings. Depending on their nature, the outputs of these meetings are presented to the Operational Risk Profile Forum, the Operational Risk Committee, the BRC or the BAC. In addition, specific reports are prepared by Operational Risk on a regular basis for the GRC and the BRC.",

The reports include a profile of the material risks that may threaten the achievement of their objectives and the effectiveness of key controls, operational risk events and a review of scenarios.\n\nThe Group Head of Operational Risk is responsible for establishing, owning and maintaining an appropriate group-wide Operational Risk Framework and for overseeing the portfolio of operational risk across the Group.\n\nThe Operational Risk function acts in a second line of defence capacity, and is responsible for defining and overseeing the implementation of the framework and monitoring the Group's operational risk profile, including risk-based review  and challenge. The Operational Risk function alerts management when risk levels exceed acceptable tolerance in order to drive timely decision- making and actions by the first line of defence.\n\n## Operational risk categories\n\nOperational risks are grouped into risk categories to support effective risk management, measurement and reporting. These comprise: Data Management Risk; Financial Reporting Risk; Fraud Risk; Information Security Risk; Operational Recovery Planning Risk; Payments Process Risk; People Risk; Premises Risk; Physical Security Risk; Change Delivery Management Risk; Supplier Risk; Tax Risk; Technology Risk; and Transaction Operations Risk.\n\nIn addition to the above, operational risk encompasses risks associated with compliance with Group Resolution Planning Prudential regulatory requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor definitions of the Group's Operational Risk Categories and connected risks, refer to the management of operational risk section in the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023.\n\n## Compliance Risk management\n\nThe risk of poor outcomes for, or harm to, customers, clients and markets, arising from the delivery of the Group's products and services (conduct risk), and the risk to Barclays, its clients, customers or markets from a failure to comply with the laws, rules and regulations (LRR) applicable to the firm.\n\n## Overview\n\nCompliance risk incorporates market integrity, customer protection, financial crime, product design and review, and the newly created laws, rules and regulation risks. Barclays has no appetite to operate its business other than in full accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, in order to deliver good outcomes for / avoid harm to customers, clients and markets. Barclays will act in good faith; seeking to avoid causing foreseeable harm and to enable and support customers to pursue their financial objectives.\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Compliance Risk Management Framework (CRMF) outlines how the Group manages and measures its conduct risk profile. The Group Chief Compliance Officer is accountable for developing, maintaining and overseeing the CRMF. This includes defining and owning the relevant compliance risk policies which detail the control objectives, principles and other core requirements for the activities of the Group. It is the responsibility of the first line of defence to establish conduct related controls to manage its performance and assess conformance to these policies and controls. The responsibility for LRR risk management sits across various functions and business units, including Legal, Chief Controls Office, Risk and Compliance.\n\nSenior managers are accountable within their areas of responsibility for owning and managing compliance risk in accordance with the CRMF, as defined within their regulatory Statement of Responsibilities, and a dedicated team has been established in Compliance to oversee LRR risk management.\n\nCompliance as an independent second line function oversees that compliance risks are effectively identified, managed, monitored and escalated, and has a key role in helping Barclays achieve the right conduct outcomes and evolve a compliance-focused culture.\n\nThe governance of Compliance risk within the Group is fulfilled through management committees and forums operated by the first and second lines of defence with clear escalation and reporting lines to the Board. The Barclays Group and Barclays Bank Group Risk Committee and the Barclays Bank UK Group Risk Committee are the primary second line governance committees for the oversight of the Compliance Risk Profile. The risk committees' responsibilities include the identification and discussion of any emerging compliance risk exposures in the Barclays Group and Barclays Bank Group. A new sub-committee of the Group Risk Committee was established in August 2023 to provide oversight on LRR risk. This committee is chaired by the Group Chief Compliance Officer.\n\n## Compliance Risk\n\nBy effectively managing Compliance risks, we can continue to strengthen the culture of Barclays.\n\n## Culture and conduct\n\nWe believe the stronger our culture, the better the choices our people will make; and the stronger our business will be for all our stakeholders. While our culture helps us reduce the impact of poor conduct on our customers, we also do not intend to repeat the errors of the past.\n\nOur most senior leaders spend significant time setting the right tone at Barclays and our Purpose and Values are now deeply embedded in their messages. The Barclays Way sets out the standards and behaviour all employees must demonstrate and guides the execution of our business. We also strengthen our culture with clear and effective controls. We continue investing to enhance our controls to support our commitment to conducting all activities with integrity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor details of the Board's role in embedding our Culture, Purpose, Values and Mindset, please refer to page 154 of the Directors' Report.",

        "page_content": "## Principal risk management (continued)\n\n## The Barclays Mindset\n\nOur Mindset acts as an operating manual for how to get things done at Barclays. It focuses on three key elements that are core to our success - Empower, Challenge and Drive. Our research shows that when we demonstrate behaviours aligned to these three elements, outcomes are better, colleagues are more engaged and they are more likely to stay longer to build their career at Barclays .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details, see page 27 in the Strategic Report for more information on the Barclays Mindset.\n\n## Managing Compliance risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 179 in the Directors' report in addition to pages 269 and 361 in the risk review section for more information on how the Group defines, manages and mitigates Compliance risks.\n\n## Product design and review risk\n\nIt is important that the design of our products and services meets the needs of clients, customers and markets as well as being aligned with Barclays' policies. We do this by operating two processes, which together form our product design and review risk framework.\n\nWe have a process that supports the Group in the approval and implementation of New and Amended Products and Approval process (known as the NAPA Process, set out in the Barclays NAPA Policy and Standards).\n\nThis process outlines the requirements and risk assessment standards that must be met to help ensure that new and amended products and services are appropriately designed prior to their launch.\n\nIn addition we have a complementary process that reviews the existing portfolio of products and services throughout their lifecycle (known as the Product Review Process, set out in the Barclays Product Review Policy and Standard). This process considers information about the performance and operation of the product or service through a conduct lens.\n\nWherever a product or service is found to be outside appetite, the product or service owner must seek to ensure actions are taken to address it. These actions are validated by functional areas, including Legal and Compliance.\n\nAreas of Barclays that undertake Investment activity also operate additional product governance processes and controls, reflecting the higher risk of these more complex products and the importance of products and services meeting the needs of our Clients.\n\n+\n\nThe BPLC, BBPLC and BBUKPLC Board Risk Committees review, on behalf of their respective Boards, the management of Compliance risk and the Compliance risk profile for their respective entities.\n\nPlease refer to the report of the BPLC Board Risk Committee on pages 174 and 179 and the reports of the BBPLC and BBUKPLC Board Risk Committees within the BBPLC and BBUKPLC 2023 Annual Reports available at home.barclays/investor-relations/reportsand-events/annual-reports/ for more information.\n\n## Customer communications\n\nIt is important that our engagement with our customers is open and honest and that we treat them fairly to avoid foreseeable harm and to make sure they are not exploited or misled. Barclays continues to take steps to ensure that our customers' needs and priorities are understood before making recommendations and that the communications we provide allow informed decisions to be made. We work to achieve this through a number of controls which focus on ensuring our customers receive clear information in order to understand the risks and benefits of the products we offer. For example:\n\n- \u00b7 communications are sufficient, targeted and distributed to recipients whom Barclays knows or reasonably believes may stand to benefit from the communication, and are communicated in a manner and style that will be understood by the average recipient (or likely recipient),\n- \u00b7 communications are withdrawn from further circulation when they are no longer accurate or fit for purpose, and\n- \u00b7 customers do not receive inadequate advice, misleading information, unsuitable products or unacceptable service.\n\nOur processes include a review of relevant communications which are supported by the Compliance and Legal functions to help ensure we meet both internal customer engagement standards and we are compliant with external regulations. Furthermore annual mandatory training is completed by marketing colleagues. The training covers key customer and brand standards along with the role and key policies set by external regulators e.g. regulatory requirements may require communications to be provided that are accessible to customers, or provide customers with the option to 'opt out'.\n\n## Remediation and redress\n\nBarclays recognises that customer detriment may occur as a result of our error, actions or inactions, and that we must undertake appropriate activity designed to ensure our customers are put back in the position they would have been in had the issue not occurred.\n\nRemediation can be proactive, where we have identified the issue ourselves (for example through identifying a pattern in customer complaints), or reactive, where identified by a third party such as a regulator of Barclays.\n\nWhere it is appropriate, Barclays works to ensure the operation of consistent principles for remediation which includes timely notification to the relevant regulatory bodies.\n\n## Reputation Risk management\n\nThe risk that an action, transaction, investment, event, decision, or business relationship will reduce trust in the Group's integrity and/or competence.\n\n## Overview\n\nA reduction of trust in the Group's integrity and competence may reduce the attractiveness of the Group to stakeholders and could lead to negative publicity, loss of revenue, regulatory or legislative action, loss of existing and potential client business, reduced workforce morale and difficulties in recruiting talent. Ultimately it may destroy shareholder value.",

This results in a high level of inherent legal risk which the Group seeks to mitigate through the operation of a Group-wide legal risk management framework. This seeks to mitigate legal risk, including through the implementation of Group-wide legal risk policies requiring engagement of legal professionals in situations that have the potential for legal risk, identification and management of legal risks by those professionals, and escalation of legal risk as necessary. Legal Risk is also mitigated by the complementary requirements of the compliance risk management framework, including the responsibility of legal professionals to proactively identify, communicate and provide legal advice on applicable laws, rules and regulations. Notwithstanding these mitigating actions, the Group operates with a level of residual legal risk, for which the Group has limited tolerance.\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Group's businesses and functions have responsibility for identifying and escalating to the Legal Function legal risk in their areas, as well as responsibility for adherence to control requirements.\n\nThe Legal Function organisation and coverage model aligns legal expertise to businesses, functions, products, activities and geographic locations so that the Group receives legal advice and support from appropriate legal professionals, working in partnership proactively to identify, manage and escalate legal risks as necessary.\n\nThe senior management of the Legal Function oversees, challenges and monitors the legal risk profile and effectiveness of the legal risk control environment across the Group. The Legal Function provides support to all areas of the bank and is not formally part of any of the three lines of defence. Except in relation to the legal advice it provides or procures, the Legal Function is subject to oversight from the second line of defence with respect to its own operational and compliance risks, as well as with respect to the legal risk to which the bank is exposed.\n\nThe Group General Counsel is responsible for developing and maintaining a Groupwide legal risk management framework. This includes defining the relevant legal risk policies, producing the Group-wide risk appetite statement for legal risk, and oversight of the implementation of controls to manage and escalate legal risk.\n\nThe legal risk profile and control environment is reviewed by management through business risk committees and control committees. The Group Risk Committee is the most senior executive body responsible for reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of risk management across the Group.

These non-financial industries are grouped into four key areas: Energy; Transportation; Materials and Buildings; and Agriculture, Food, and Forest Products. Barclays' exposures to the industries within these groups are reported as carbon-related assets and can be found in the table on the following page.\n\n## Elevated risk sectors\n\nBased on portfolio level assessments (including for industry sectors) on climate risk, Barclays identifies and categorises sectors with heightened risk to climate change as elevated sectors. However, in each sector there are a range of vulnerabilities, meaning not all of our clients in these sectors have high emissions, and accordingly should not be interpreted as an indicator of relative carbon intensity. Residential Real Estate exposures are also included in this table. Barclays recognises Residential Real Estate portfolio as elevated risk, therefore on that basis they have been included in the table.

Notes\n\n- 1 The sectors have been represented  based on the standard nomenclature of economic activities (NACE codes) this year. These sector headings are consistent across our disclosures on credit risk concentration by industry for contractual maturity, staging and geography (page 320). The prior year comparatives have been represented in line with the updated sector headings.\n- 2 As industries decarbonise, sectors will increasingly include both carbon and non-carbon related activities e.g. Power Utilities will also include, in part, their generation capacity from renewable energy sources.\n- 3 Loans & advances includes debt securities at amortised cost amounting to \u00a356,789m (2022: \u00a345,487m) of which carbon related assets are \u00a32,906m (2022: \u00a33,482m). These carbon related assets comprises \u00a32,643m (2022: \u00a33,406m) in Material & Buildings, \u00a3238m (2022: \u00a374m) in Transport and storage and \u00a325m (2022: \u00a32m) in Energy and water.\n- 4 Loan commitments excludes the fair value exposures  of \u00a315,203m in 2023 (2022: \u00a313,471m).\n- 5 Diversified miners with minority interests in thermal coal mining are included in this category.",

As part of our efforts to calculate and disclose this metric, we have mapped the industry codes provided by TNFD to Barclays  Industry classifications.  The monitoring and reporting of our exposures to these TNFD identified nature priority sectors will continue to evolve in line with approaches taken to nature-related risk management and as the list of priority sectors set out in the TNFD Guidance for Financial Institutions is updated and as such, are subject to change in future.  Nature-related risks within a sector may vary substantially according to company and project.\n\n## Credit exposures to nature priority sectors 1, 2\n\n|                                                                                | (\u00a3m) Loan  2023    | (\u00a3m) Loan  2023   | (\u00a3m) Loan  2023   | (\u00a3m) 2022          | (\u00a3m) 2022          | (\u00a3m) 2022    | (\u00a3m) 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|-------------|\n|                                                                                | Loans & advances 3 | commitments 4     | Total             | Loans & advances 3 | Loan  commitments\u2074 | Total        | % change    |\n| Agriculture                                                                    | 3,597              | 914               | 4,511             | 3,762              | 822                | 4,584        | (2%)        |\n| Food, Bev and Tobacco                                                          | 962                | 5,705             | 6,667             | 908                | 6,111              | 7,019        | (5%)        |\n| Paper and Forest Products                                                      | 186                | 748               | 934               | 168                | 642                | 810          | 15%         |\n| Oil and Gas                                                                    | 2,256              | 12,402            | 14,658            | 2,750              | 11,913             | 14,663       | -%          |\n| Power Utilities                                                                | 948                | 13,049            | 13,997            | 2,481              | 13,318             | 15,799       | (11%)       |\n| Cement                                                                         | 161                | 381               | 542               | 222                | 160                | 382          | 42%         |\n| Chemicals                                                                      | 372                | 3,947             | 4,319             | 474                | 4,223              | 4,697        | (8%)        |\n| Construction & Materials                                                       | 452                | 641               | 1,093             | 802                | 752                | 1,554        | (30%)       |\n| Homebuilding and Property Development                                          | 3,272              | 2,247             | 5,519             | 3,521              | 2,126              | 5,647        | (2%)        |\n| Manufacturing -

Barclays has \u00a329,919m (2022: \u00a332,597m)  of Loans & Advances and Loan Commitments to Real Estate Management and Development, of which the majority is from real estate investment activity. As a result, this has been excluded from the Priority sector assets for Nature.\n- 3 Loans & advances includes debt securities at amortised cost amounting to \u00a356,789m (2022: \u00a345,487m) of which nature priority sector assets are \u00a32,906m (2022: \u00a33,482m). These nature priority sector assets comprises \u00a32,643m (2022: \u00a33,406m) in Material & Buildings, \u00a3238m (2022: \u00a374m) in Transport and storage and \u00a325m (2022: \u00a32m) in Energy and water.\n- 4 Loan commitments excludes the fair value exposures  of \u00a315,203m in 2023 (2022: \u00a313,471m).\n- 5 Diversified miners with minority interests in thermal coal mining are included in this category.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

We have provided the  breakdown of our 2022 and 2023 financing below. We have constructed this table based on the mapping of issuers' industry assignment in Dealogic data and Barclays' internal industry taxonomy called Barclays Industry Classification (BIC). Financing volumes are reported on a manager-proceeds basis including bonds, equities, loans and securitised bonds and no modifications have been made by Barclays. This data represents a third party view of our financing and is subject to Dealogic's league table methodology, which pro-rates volume across lead-managers. We are presenting the data in this format to support transparency and comparability but it should be noted that this data is subject to further analysis and methodological enhancements, before it is included in BlueTrack\u2122.\n\n## Carbon-related sectors in wholesale credit (Dealogic Industry Classification) 1, 2, 3\n\n|                                                                     | 31.12.2023 (\u00a3m)   | 31.12.2022 (\u00a3m)   | % Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|\n| Energy & Waters                                                     | 20,329            | 27,021            | (25) %     |\n| Power Utilities                                                     | 20,329            | 27,021            |            |\n| Manufacturing                                                       | 31,336            | 24,782            | 26 %       |\n| Automotive                                                          | 7,333             | 3,136             |            |\n| Cements                                                             | 279               | 162               |            |\n| Chemicals                                                           | 2,523             | 2,241             |            |\n| Food, Bev and Tobacco                                               | 6,991             | 4,310             |            |\n| Manufacturing -

Increased volatility in weather conditions, as a result of climate change, contributes to the acceleration of subsidence impacts. Some areas, particularly those with high concentrations of clay soil (i.e. London), are more susceptible to subsidence. This shrink-swell impact can cause localised property level impacts, resulting in impacts to the valuation of a property, or impacts to affordability through remediation costs and high insurance premiums.\n\nBarclays works with a third-party climate data provider to support climate risk data enhancements within the UK Mortgages portfolio. This includes the ability to map subsidence risk at a property level granularity. The subsidence risk scoring is based on soil properties, in particular the extent to which the soil will shrink under hot and dry weather conditions, as well as the predicted temperature and probability of extreme rainfall. These variables are combined with subsidence claims per postcode to generate a pseudo-quantitative score, where a property in class 9 is around nine times as likely as a property in class 1 to make a subsidence claim. A small proportion of the UK Mortgage portfolio is not mapped to a subsidence risk score (c.5.2%). This is due either to a lack of data coverage (i.e. the property is not covered by underlying maps), or a lack of certainty in address matching.\n\n| As at 30 September 2023   | As at 30 September 2023   | As at 30 September 2023   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Risk Band                 | Qualitative Risk  Score   | Volume %                  |\n| 0                         | No Subsidence Risk        | 0.01                      |\n| 1                         | High                      | 9.51                      |\n| 2                         | High                      | 35.96                     |\n| 3                         | High                      | 23.54                     |\n| 4                         |                           | 4.71                      |\n| 5                         | Moderate                  | 4.72                      |\n| 6                         |                           | 3.36                      |\n| 7                         |                           | 2.41                      |\n| 8                         |                           | 0                         |\n| 9                         |                           | 0.25                      |\n| 10                        |                           | 5.43                      |\n| 11                        |                           | 0                         |\n| 12                        |                           | 2.64                      |\n| 13                        | Very High                 | 0                         |\n| 14                        |                           | 0                         |\n| 15                        |                           | 2.26                      |\n| Missing                   | Missing                   | 5.2                       |\n\n## Note\n\nData collected from 3rd party source based on one quarter lag. 30 September 2023 closest available dataset.\n\n## Flood: Total Volume of stock (as % of total UK Mortgages portfolio) per risk band\n\nFlooding in the UK is forecast to increase over time, with the potential for this increase to accelerate if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced. The increased risk of flooding has the potential to impact the valuation of properties directly, as well as indirectly where a particular area becomes high risk and property demand falls. Remediation costs, high insurance premiums or potential lack of insurance coverage have the potential to impact affordability.\n\nBarclays works with a third-party climate data provider to support climate risk data enhancements within the UK Mortgages portfolio. This has enabled Barclays to move from postcode level to property level flood data granularity. Flood Risk bands are based on average annual loss,  generated using flood hazard frequency and flood depth from tidal, surface, pluvial and fluvial flooding and accounting for the mitigating impact of flood defences where these are present. Properties in the Moderate and High Risk bands are expected to face above average insurance costs given their elevated exposure to flood risk. Those within the Very High band are considered likely to be eligible for Flood Re (a subsidised flood insurance scheme).\n\n|           | As at 30 September 2023   |\n|-----------|---------------------------|\n| Risk Band | Volume %                  |\n| Very Low  | 7.6                       |\n| Low       | 1.8                       |\n| Moderate  | 1.6                       |\n| High      | 2.6                       |\n| Very High | 1.2                       |\n| Missing   | 3.9                       |\n\n## Note\n\nData collected from 3rd party source based on one quarter lag. 30 September 2023 closest available dataset.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

One of the levers to decarbonise the UK housing stock for the UK Government is to tighten energy efficiency requirements. It is anticipated that any tightening of minimum energy efficiency standards (MEES) will focus initially on buy-to-let properties. Buy-to-Let properties which are privately rented are currently required to have a minimum EPC rating of E. The transition risk identified has the potential to impact the valuation of properties directly, alongside impacting affordability as properties which fall under MEES may no longer be able to be rented out or the landlord may need to pay for retrofitting to be brought up to standard.\n\nEPC ratings range from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient). EPC ratings are used as the basis for assessing expected energy costs but do not give a precise picture of emission intensity. The UK Mortgages portfolio is mapped to the Government EPC Register. Properties may not feature on the Government EPC Register as some properties may have never been required to have an EPC rating (not been sold or rented out since 2007), their EPC rating may have expired (EPC ratings are valid for 10 years) or the property may be in Scotland or Northern Ireland (which use separate databases). Whilst Barclays' proportion of 'missing EPC ratings' has declined year on year, the issue of missing EPC ratings is prevalent across the industry.\n\n## EPC: Residential & Buy-to-let balances and volumes per EPC rating as at September 2023\n\n| EPC Rating   | Residential Balances (\u00a3m)   | Balance as % of  Residential Mortgages  portfolio   | Volume as % of  Residential Mortgages  portfolio   | Buy-to-Let Balances (\u00a3m)   | Balance as % of Buy-to- Let Mortgages portfolio   | Volume as % of Buy-to- Let Mortgages portfolio   |\n|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|              | \u00a3m                          | %                                                   | %                                                  | \u00a3m                         | %                                                 | %                                                |\n| A            | 487                         | 0.3                                                 | 0.2                                                | 20                         | 0.1                                               | 0.1                                              |\n| B            | 22,514                      | 15.8                                                | 14.3                                               | 2,144                      | 10.7                                              | 8.9                                              |\n| C            | 24,954                      | 17.5                                                | 16.6                                               | 5,781                      | 28.9                                              | 29.6                                             |\n| D            | 41,575                      | 29.3                                                | 26.4                                               | 6,842                      | 34.3                                              | 34.4                                             |\n| E            | 17,546                      | 12.3                                                | 10.2                                               | 1,991                      | 10.0                                              | 10.1                                             |\n| F            | 4,132                       | 2.9                                                 | 2.2                                                | 129                        | 0.6                                               | 0.7                                              |\n| G            | 780                         | 0.5                                                 | 0.4                                                | 31                         | 0.2                                               | 0.2                                              |\n| Missing      | 30,528                      | 21.4                                                | 29.7                                               | 3,033                      | 15.2                                              | 16.0                                             |\n| Total        | 142,516                     | 100                                                 | 100                                                | 19,971                     | 100                                               | 100                                              |\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 Data matching provided by 3rd party source based on one quarter lag, 30 September 2023 closest available dataset - EPC monitoring based on Sept-23 portfolio and Sept-23 Government EPC Register.

For off-balance sheet exposures certain contingent liabilities not subject to credit risk such as performance guarantees are excluded.\n\n## Task force on Disclosure about Expected Credit Losses (DECL)\n\nCredit risk disclosures have been enhanced to include DECL III recommendations for minimum product grouping and geographical breakdown for this period and prior period comparatives have been aligned.\n\n## Summary of performance in the period\n\n## Gross exposure\n\nGross loans and advances at amortised cost to customers and banks have remained broadly stable at \u00a3405bn, which includes increase in debt securities driven by Treasury investments and strategic acquisitions in Home Finance. This is offset by a reduction due to the German consumer finance business classified as assets held for sale and foreign exchange movements in Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) and US Cards portfolio.\n\n## Maximum exposure\n\nThe Group's net exposure to credit risk is broadly stable at \u00a31,030bn (2022: \u00a31,033bn). Overall, the extent to which the mitigation is held against its total exposure has decreased to 42% (2022: 44%) primarily due to decrease in derivative financial instruments (\u00a346bn) and reverse repurchase agreements (\u00a314bn), both of which are highly secured instruments.\n\n## Credit quality\n\nDelinquencies are broadly stable across the group with an increase observed in US cards, which was anticipated. A range of activities are in place to protect our existing defensive positioning against current macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nCorporate loans portfolio benefited from high-quality exposure and credit protection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- + Further analysis on the credit quality of assets is\n\npresented in the approach to management and representation of credit quality section.\n\n## Stage Decomposition\n\nA net decrease of \u00a33.2bn is observed in Stage 2 gross exposure driven by an improved GDP forecast and higher repayments in Corporate loans partially offset by an increase in retail lending following resumption of more regular spend activity and higher interest rates.\n\nStage 3 balances have increased to \u00a37.2bn (2022: \u00a37.1bn) driven by higher delinquencies in US cards partially offset by repayments in Business Banking.\n\n+ Refer to pages 305 to 306 for further details.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Scenario\n\nEconomic uncertainty continues, linked to higher interest rates and ongoing inflationary pressures in major economies. For Q423, macroeconomic scenarios have been refreshed and are designed around a broad range of economic outcomes. The Downside 2 (DS2) scenario has been aligned to Barclays 2023 Internal Stress Test (IST23) which is less severe in terms of GDP deterioration, resulting in increased DS2 weights.\n\n## ECL\n\nImpairment allowances on loans and advances at amortised cost including offbalance sheet has increased to \u00a36,252m (2022:\u00a36,175m) predominantly driven by increase in US cards partially offset by a reduction due to the German consumer finance business classified as assets held for sale. On-balance sheet coverage has remained strong and stable at 1.4%.\n\n## Charge\n\nCredit impairment charges were \u00a31,881m (2022: \u00a31,220m), reflecting an increase in delinquencies in US cards, which was anticipated, and led to higher coverage in CC&P.\n\n## Management Adjustments\n\nEconomic uncertainty adjustments have decreased to \u00a3198m (2022: \u00a3317m). The reduction is informed by the rebuild of certain impairment models which better capture the macroeconomic outlook. Furthermore, adjustments have been reassessed to capture affordability headwinds in UK retail lending.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer  to  the  Management  adjustment  to  models for  impairment  section  on page  307 for  further details.\n\n## Climate\n\nBarclays has performed a credit risk assessment of physical and transition risk due to climate change. This was delivered through a combination of a scenario approach and targeted reviews on specific portfolios identified as more susceptible to climate risk. The analysis did not result in a separately identifiable impairment charge for year end 2023 reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- + Further detail can be found in the Financial statements section in Note 8 Credit impairment charges/(releases). Description of terminology can be found in the glossary, available at home.barclays/annualreport.\n- + Refer to credit risk management section  for the details of governance, policies and procedures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Further detail on the Group's policies to each of these forms of credit enhancement is presented on pages 131 to 134 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited).\n\n## Collateral obtained\n\nWhere collateral has been obtained in the event of default, the Group does not, ordinarily, use such assets for its own operations and they are usually sold on a timely basis. The carrying value of assets held by the Group as at 31 December 2023, as a result of the enforcement of collateral, was \u00a36m (2022: \u00a331m).\n\n## Maximum exposure and effects of netting, collateral and risk transfer (audited)\n\n|                                                                   | Maximum  exposure      | Netting and  set-off   | Cash  collateral   | Non-cash  collateral   | Risk transfer   | Exposure net  of risk  mitigation   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2023                                            | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                 | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m              | \u00a3m                                  |\n| On-balance sheet:                                                 |                        |                        |                    |                        |                 |                                     |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                                | 224,634                | -

Also included are stage  allocation  of  debt  securities  and  off-balance  sheet  loan  commitments  and  financial  guarantee  contracts  by  gross  exposure, impairment allowance and coverage ratio as at 31 December 2023.\n\nImpairment allowance under IFRS 9 considers both the drawn and the undrawn counterparty exposure.

The \u00a3186m  of disposals reported within Retail credit cards include debt sales undertaken during the year. The \u00a3134m of disposals reported within Retail other include \u00a364m part sale of Wealth portfolio in Italy and \u00a370m of debt sales undertaken during the year.\n- 3 Refinements to models used for calculation reported within Retail credit cards include a \u00a388m movement in UK Cards, \u00a343m movement in US Cards and \u00a3(111)m movement in the German consumer finance business. These reflect model enhancements  made during the year. Barclays continually reviews the output of models to determine accuracy of the ECL calculation including review of model monitoring, external benchmarking and experience of model operation over an extended period of time. This helps to ensure that the models used continue to reflect the  risks inherent across the businesses.\n- 4 Transfers to assets held for sale reported within Retail credit cards and Retail other relate to the German consumer finance business.",

These reflect model enhancements made during the year. Barclays continually reviews the output of models to determine accuracy of the ECL calculation including review  of model monitoring, external benchmarking and experience of model operation over an extended period of time. This helps to ensure that the models used continue to reflect the risks inherent across the businesses.\n- 2 'Net drawdowns, repayments, net re-measurement and movements due to exposure and risk parameter changes' reported within Corporate loans also include assets of \u00a30.8bn derecognised due to payment received on defaulted loans from government guarantees issued under government's Bounce Back Loans Scheme.\n\n- 4 In 2023, gross write-offs amounted to \u00a31,168m (2022: \u00a31,620m) and post write-off recoveries amounted to \u00a344m (2022: \u00a364m). Net write-offs represent gross write-offs less post write-off recoveries and amounted to \u00a31,124m (2022: \u00a31,556m).\n- 5 Recoveries and reimbursements include \u00a329m for reimbursements expected to be received under the arrangement where Group has entered into financial guarantee contracts  which provide credit protection over certain assets with third parties and  cash recoveries of previously written off amounts of \u00a344m.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

These reflect model enhancements made during the year. Barclays continually reviews the output of models to determine accuracy of the ECL calculation including review of model monitoring, external benchmarking and experience of model operation over an extended period of time. This helps to ensure that the models used continue to reflect the  risks inherent across the businesses.\n- 2 The \u00a30.4bn of disposals reported within Retail credit cards  include a \u00a30.2bn sale of NFL portfolio within US Cards and \u00a30.2bn of debt sales undertaken during the year. The \u00a30.1bn disposals reported within Retail other include debt sales undertaken during the year.",

These reflect model enhancements made during the year. Barclays continually review the output of models to determine  accuracy of the ECL calculation including review of model monitoring, external benchmarking and experience of model operation over an extended period of time. This ensures that the models used continue to reflect the risks inherent across the businesses.\n- 2\n- 'Net drawdowns, repayments, net re-measurement and movements due to exposure and risk parameter changes' reported within  Corporate loans also include assets of \u00a31.3bn derecognised due to payment received on defaulted loans from government guarantees issued under government's Bounce Back Loans Scheme.\n- 3 The \u00a380m of disposals reported within Corporate loans relate to debt sales undertaken during the year.\n- 4 In 2022, gross write-offs amounted to \u00a31,620m. In Q422, \u00a3329m of balances with de minimis recovery expectations were written-off in line with policy in UK Cards and Unsecured Loans. Post write-off recoveries amounted to \u00a364m. Net write-offs represent gross write-offs less post write-off recoveries and amounted to \u00a31,556m.\n- 5 Recoveries and reimbursements include \u00a3199m for reimbursements expected to be received under the arrangement where Group has entered into financial  guarantees contracts which provide credit protection over certain assets with third parties and cash recoveries of previously written off amounts of \u00a364m.",

This is augmented by inclusion of accounts meeting the designated high risk criteria (including watchlist) for the portfolio under the qualitative test.\n\nA small number of other accounts (1.5% of impairment allowance and 2.2% of gross exposure) are included in Stage 2. These accounts are not otherwise identified by the quantitative or qualitative tests but are more than 30 days past due. The percentage triggered by these backstop criteria is a measure of the effectiveness of the Stage 2 criteria in identifying deterioration prior to delinquency.

An asset is considered credit impaired when one or more events occur that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset. This comprises assets defined as defaulted and other individually assessed exposures where imminent default or actual loss is identified.\n\n|                                         | Gross Exposure

As such there is a risk that the modelled output fails to capture the appropriate response to changes in macroeconomic variables including higher interest rates and continuing inflationary stress with modelled impairment provisions impacted by uncertainty.\n\nThis uncertainty continues to be captured in two ways. Firstly, customer uncertainty: the identification of customers and clients who may be more vulnerable to economic instability; and secondly, model uncertainty: to capture the impact from model limitations and sensitivities to specific macroeconomic parameters which are applied at a portfolio level.\n\nEconomic uncertainty adjustments have decreased from last year following the re-build of UK cards and certain CIB impairment models which better capture the macroeconomic outlook. Furthermore, adjustments have been reassessed to capture affordability headwinds in UK retail lending.\n\n## The balance as at 31 December 2023 is \u00a3198m (2022: \u00a3317m) and includes:\n\n## Customer and client uncertainty provisions of \u00a3166m (2022: \u00a3423m):\n\nUK retail lending includes adjustments applied to customers considered most vulnerable to affordability pressures.\n\n- \u00b7 Retail mortgages (UK) \u00a325m (2022: \u00a34m): The increase primarily reflects the risk of borrowers refinancing onto higher rates in the medium term.\n- \u00b7 Retail credit cards (UK) \u00a345m (2022: \u00a393m): The reduction reflects the re-build of UK cards impairment models which better capture sensitivity to movements in interest rates and inflation.\n- \u00b7 Retail other (UK) \u00a39m (2022: \u00a323m): The reduction reflects customer resilience to affordability headwinds.\n\nCorporate loans \u00a387m (2022: \u00a3301m): This includes an adjustment of \u00a371m in UK to reflect possible cross default risk on Barclays' lending in respect of clients who have taken bounce back loans and \u00a316m in Rest of the World (ROW) to provide for downside uncertainties on European Corporates reflecting recent changes in the macroeconomic outlook.\n\nThe reduction of \u00a3(214)m in UK and ROW is informed by retirement of an adjustment for high risk sectors following a granular credit risk assessment, and re-build of certain CIB impairment models which more appropriately capture downside risk.",

This was delivered through a combination of a scenario approach and targeted reviews on specific portfolios identified as more susceptible to climate risk. The analysis did not result in a separately identifiable impairment charge for year end 2023 reporting.\n\nScenario Approach: The climate stress test macroeconomic scenario was used in lieu of the production Downside 2 scenario to determine impact on the weighted average ECL output. The output of this analysis was not significant to warrant an additional climaterelated impairment charge.\n\nSpecific Approach: The approach reviewed portfolios previously identified from both internal and external stress tests as more susceptible to climate risks. In particular, the UK Mortgage portfolio was reviewed to determine the impact of a plausible change in regulation requiring landlords to upgrade properties to minimum EPC rating of C in the buy-to-let portfolio. In addition, within the Wholesale portfolio, certain elevated risk sectors (predominantly Oil & Gas, Automotive and Power sectors) were subject to a review that considered probability of default impact at a counterparty level determined by individual susceptibility to transition climate risks. The output of this review did not provide variances in ECL deemed sufficiently certain to warrant raising an additional climate-related charge in 2023.\n\nBarclays acknowledges that impairment could increase over time as risks become more tangible and impact consumers and clients through physical risks or via impacts from the transition to a low carbon economy. Therefore, Barclays continues to review credit risk outputs  to  determine  if  any  additional  physical  or  transition  climate  risks  are  identified  that  are  not  sufficiently  captured  via  model output.\n\nRefer to the Barclays resilience to climate scenarios on page 132 for further details.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

The Group uses a five-scenario model to calculate ECL. An external consensus forecast is assembled from key sources, including HM Treasury (short and medium term forecasts) and  Bloomberg (based on median of economic forecasts) which forms the Baseline scenario. In addition, two adverse scenarios (Downside 1 and Downside 2) and two favourable scenarios (Upside 1 and Upside 2) are derived, with associated probability weightings. The adverse scenarios are calibrated to a broadly similar severity to the Group's internal stress tests and stress scenarios provided by regulators whilst also considering IFRS 9 specific sensitivities and non-linearity. The favourable scenarios are designed to reflect plausible upside risks to the Baseline scenario which are broadly consistent with the economic narrative approved by the Senior Scenario Review Committee. All scenarios are regenerated at a minimum semi-annually. The scenarios include key economic variables, (including GDP, unemployment, House Price Index (HPI) and base rates in both the UK and US markets), and expanded variables using statistical models based on historical correlations. The upside and downside shocks are designed to evolve over a five-year stress horizon, with all five scenarios converging to a steady state after approximately seven years.\n\nScenarios used to calculate the Group's ECL charge were refreshed in Q423 with the Baseline scenario reflecting the latest consensus macroeconomic forecasts available at the time of the scenario refresh. In the Baseline scenario, whilst UK and US economies avoid a recession, GDP growth remains weak in the coming quarters and beyond as restrictive monetary policies, which impact economies with a lag, continue to restrain growth. Having peaked in 2022, consumer price inflation in key regions continues to ease over 2023 and 2024. The UK and US unemployment rates rise to 4.8% and 4.4% respectively over 2024 and then stabilise. With the significant decline in inflationary pressures, major central banks refrain from further interest rate increases. UK house prices continue to decline in 2024 before stabilising and resuming the upward trend from 2025. The housing market in the US remains more resilient, with house prices continuing to grow.\n\nIn the Downside 2 scenario, inflationary pressures are assumed to intensify again, mainly driven by strong wage growth. Central banks raise rates further, with the UK bank rate and the US federal fund rate each reaching 8.5% in Q324. High interest rates suddenly bring stress into the financial and non-financial system, causing joblessness to spike and triggering a housing markets crisis and central banks are forced cut interest rates aggressively. Falling demand reduces UK and US GDP and headline inflation drops to close to zero. In the Upside 2 scenario, tighter and more productive labour markets help to accelerate economic growth whilst keeping inflationary pressures under control. With inflation quickly returning to target, central banks lower interest rates, further stimulating aggregate demand and GDP growth.\n\nThe methodology for estimating scenario probability weights involves simulating a range of future paths for UK and US GDP using historical data with the five scenarios mapped against the distribution of these future paths. The median is centred around the Baseline with scenarios further from the Baseline attracting a lower weighting before the five weights are normalised to total 100%. The same scenarios used in the estimation of expected credit losses are also used to inform Barclays' internal planning. The impacts across the portfolios are different because of the sensitivities of each of the portfolios to specific macroeconomic variables, for example, mortgages are highly sensitive to house prices, credit cards and unsecured consumer loans are highly sensitive to unemployment. The increases in the Downside scenario weightings reflected a reduction in GDP stress severity in the Downside scenarios which brought the GDP of these scenarios closer to the Baseline. The increases in the Upside scenario weightings were driven by the improvement in actual GDP and the Baseline scenario, bringing the Baseline scenario closer to the Upside scenarios. For further details see page 314.\n\nThe economic uncertainty adjustments of \u00a30.2bn (2022: \u00a30.3bn) have been applied as overlays to the modelled ECL output. These adjustments consist of a customer and client uncertainty provision of \u00a30.2bn (2022: \u00a30.4bn) which has been applied to customers and clients considered most vulnerable to affordability pressures, and a model uncertainty adjustment of \u00a30.0bn (2022: \u00a3(0.1)bn). For further details see pages 307 to 309.\n\nThe tables below show the key macroeconomic variables used in the five scenarios (5 year annual paths), the probability weights applied to each scenario and the macroeconomic variables by scenario using 'specific bases' i.e. the most extreme position of each variable in the context of the scenario, for example, the highest unemployment for downside scenarios and the lowest unemployment for upside scenarios. 5-year average tables and movement over time graphs provide additional transparency. Annual paths show quarterly averages for the year (unemployment and base rate) or change in the year (GDP and HPI).\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

As a result, it is not possible to back solve the final reported weighted ECL from individual scenarios given balances may be assigned to a different stage dependent on the scenario.\n- 2 Model exposures and ECL reported within Retail credit cards and Retail other excludes the German consumer finance business which has now been classified as assets held for sale.\n- 3 Model exposures allocated to Stage 3 does not change in any of the scenarios as the transition criteria relies only on an observable evidence of default as at 31 December 2023 and not on macroeconomic scenario.\n- 4 Material corporate loan defaults are individually assessed across different recovery strategies. As a result, ECL of \u00a3401m is reported as an individually assessed impairment in the reconciliation table.\n\nThe use of five scenarios with associated weighting results in a total weighted ECL uplift from the Baseline ECL of 1.5%.\n\nRetail mortgages: Total weighted ECL of \u00a3383m represents a 4.6% increase over the Baseline ECL (\u00a3366m) with coverage ratios remaining steady across the Upside scenarios, Baseline and Downside 1 scenario. Under the Downside 2 scenario, total ECL increases to  \u00a3538m driven by a significant fall in UK HPI.\n\nRetail credit cards: Total weighted ECL of \u00a33,561m is broadly aligned to the Baseline ECL (\u00a33,542m). Total ECL increases to \u00a33,893m under the Downside 2 scenario, driven by an increase in UK and US unemployment rate.\n\nRetail other: Total weighted ECL of \u00a3212m is aligned to the Baseline ECL (\u00a3211m). Total ECL increases to \u00a3233m under the Downside 2 scenario, largely driven by an increase in UK unemployment rate.\n\nCorporate loans: Total weighted ECL of \u00a31,015m represents a 3.8% increase over the Baseline ECL (\u00a3978m). Total  ECL increases to \u00a31,438m under the Downside 2 scenario, driven by a decrease in UK and US GDP.",

As a result, it is not possible to back solve the final reported weighted ECL from individual scenarios given balances may be assigned to a different stage dependent on the scenario.\n\n- 3 Material corporate loan defaults are individually assessed across different recovery strategies. As a result, ECL of \u00a3434m is reported as an individually assessed impairment in the reconciliation table.",

The Group implements limits on concentrations in order to mitigate the risk.\n\nThe table below presents an industry credit risk concentration analysis of loans and advances at amortised cost net of impairment allowance including breakdown by geographical location of the counterparty or customers, impairment stage, maturity and an indicator of inclusion in carbon-related sectors. A further table is included with geography, impairment stage and maturity allocation of debt securities at amortised cost, off- balance sheet commitments and financial guarantees and contingent liabilities at amortised cost.\n\nFurther detail on the Group policies with regard to managing concentration risk is presented in the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited).\n\n## Credit risk

basis.\n\nFor loans that are not past due, these descriptions can be summarised as follows:\n\nStrong: there is a very high likelihood of the asset being recovered in full.\n\nSatisfactory: while there is a high likelihood that the asset will be recovered and therefore, of no cause for concern to the Group, the asset may not be collateralised, or may relate to unsecured retail facilities. At the lower end of this grade there are customers that are being more carefully monitored, for example, corporate customers which are indicating some evidence of deterioration, home loans with a high loan to value, and unsecured retail loans operating outside normal product guidelines.\n\nHigher risk: there is concern over the obligor's ability to make payments when due. However, these have not yet converted to actual delinquency. There may also be doubts over the value of collateral or security provided. However, the borrower or counterparty is continuing to make payments when due and is expected to settle all outstanding amounts of principal and interest.\n\nLoans that are past due are monitored closely, with impairment allowances raised as appropriate and in line with the Group's impairment policies.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nFor assets held at fair value, the carrying value on the balance sheet will include, among other things, the credit risk of the issuer. Most listed and some unlisted securities are rated by external rating agencies. The Group mainly uses external credit ratings provided by Standard & Poor's, Fitch or Moody's. Where such ratings are not available or are not current, the Group will use its own internal ratings for the securities.",

There is therefore no direct relationship between credit quality and IFRS 9 stage classification.\n\n## Credit risk profile by internal PD grade for retail mortgages (audited)\n\n|                        |                        |                        | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Allowance for ECL      | Allowance for ECL      | Allowance for ECL      | Allowance for ECL      | Net                    | Coverage               |\n|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                        | PD range               | Credit quality         | Stage 1                 | Stage 2                 | Stage 3                 | Total                   | Stage 1                | Stage 2                | Stage 3                | Total                  | exposure               | ratio                  |\n| Grading                | %                      | description            | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                     | %                      |\n| As at 31 December 2023 | As at 31 December 2023 | As at 31 December 2023 | As at 31 December 2023  | As at 31 December 2023  | As at 31 December 2023  | As at 31 December 2023  | As at 31 December 2023 | As at 31 December 2023 | As at 31 December 2023 | As at 31 December 2023 | As at 31 December 2023 | As at 31 December 2023 |\n| 1 -

(2022: 0.2%) respectively. Total exposure increased from \u00a39.9bn to \u00a310.4bn due to growth in spend and promotional balances.  Both the gross and net write off rates decreased by 2.3% driven by the impact of a strategy change in 2022 to align the point of charge off and write off in that year and lower charge off rates in 2023.\n\nUK personal loans: 30 and 90 day arrears rates have remained broadly stable at 1.5% (2022: 1.4%) and 0.6%  (2022: 0.6%) respectively. Both the gross and net write off rates decreased by 2.8%, driven by the impact of a strategy change in 2022 to align the point of charge off and write off in that year and by the impact of large bulk sales in 2022 which reduced the flow to write off in 2023.\n\nBarclays Partner Finance: 30 and 90 day arrears rates increased marginally to 0.6% (2022: 0.5%) and 0.3% (2022: 0.2%) respectively as the weighting of lower risk customers with larger balances reduced. Total exposure fell to \u00a32.3bn (2022: \u00a32.6bn) due to a strategic decision to reduce the number of active partner businesses. Annualised gross and net write off rates remained stable.\n\nUS cards: 30 and 90 day arrears rates increased to 2.9% (2022: 2.2%) and 1.5% (2022: 1.2%) respectively due to an anticipated higher flow into and through delinquency, as rates returned to pre-pandemic levels. Write off rates remained broadly stable at 2.3%.\n\nGerman consumer finance business: Gross exposure decreased 4% following business reprioritisation and discontinuation of Open Market loans originations. 30 and 90 day arrears rates remained stable and write-off rates increased due to the impact of accepting higher loan amount applications during 2022, which has since been discontinued.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

Impairment allowances increased to \u00a3210m (2022: \u00a3192m) with a range of new cases, partially offset by write offs. Barclays International accounted for 68% of wholesale forbearance with corporate cases representing 87% of these balances.\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Following a review of forbearance programmes across Barclays UK in 2023 which resulted in the identification of a segment of written off balances inflating the forbearance stock, UK cards 2022 balances have been updated to reflect a decrease of \u00a374m with a corresponding decrease in ECL of  \u00a32m.\n- 2 Following a review of forbearance programmes across Barclays UK in 2023 which resulted in 'Breathing Space', a 1-2-month cessation of interest and customer contact to allow businesses to talk to all creditors now being included within Business Banking for the first time, UK Business Banking 2022 balances have been updated to reflect an increase of \u00a3222m with a corresponding increase in ECL of \u00a311m.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

the forbearance stock, UK cards 2022 balances have been updated to reflect a decrease of \u00a374m with a corresponding decrease in ECL of  \u00a32m.\n\nUK home loans: Forbearance balances rose to \u00a3366m (2022: \u00a3263m) due to an increase in less-than-interest-only payment arrangements and concessionary interest rates given to support customers facing rising mortgage interest rates and increased affordability stress.\n\nUK cards : Balances on forbearance decreased to \u00a3215m (2022: \u00a3265m) due to increased outflow, against a stable forbearance inflow across 2023.\n\nUK personal loans : Balances on forbearance programmes decreased to \u00a346m (2022: \u00a359m), as inflow steadily reduced across 2023, flattening in Q423, and outflow remained stable.\n\nBarclays Partner Finance: Balances on forbearance remained stable and aligned to the total delinquent stock.\n\nUS cards: Forbearance balances increased to \u00a3290m (2022: \u00a3206m) reflecting an increase in new enrolments in 2023 in line with increased delinquency trends as more customers required assistance.\n\nGerman consumer finance business : Forbearance balances decreased to \u00a332m (2022: \u00a340m) due to lower customer demand and increased operational focus on early delinquency stages.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

Similarly, derivative liabilities would be \u00a3(223)bn (2022: \u00a3(264)bn) lower reflecting counterparty netting and collateral placed. In addition, non-cash collateral of \u00a310bn (2022: \u00a311bn) was held in respect of derivative assets. The Group received collateral from clients in support of over the counter derivative transactions. These transactions are generally undertaken under International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) agreements governed by either UK or New York law.\n\nThe table below sets out the fair value and notional amounts of OTC derivative instruments by type of collateral arrangement.\n\n| Derivatives by collateral arrangement      |                   |            |             | 2022              | 2022       | 2022        |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|\n|                                            | Notional contract | Fair value | Fair value  | Notional contract | Fair value | Fair value  |\n|                                            | amount            | Assets     | Liabilities | amount            | Assets     | Liabilities |\n|                                            | \u00a3m                | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m                | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m          |\n| Unilateral in favour of Barclays           |                   |            |             |                   |            |             |\n| Foreign exchange                           | 36,163            | 986        | (611)       | 37,149            | 1,130      | (677)       |\n| Interest rate                              | 15,950            | 161        | (51)        | 17,967            | 151        | (57)        |\n| Credit derivatives                         | 1,216             | 9          | (394)       | 823               | 26         | (224)       |\n| Equity and stock index                     | 478               | 15         | (45)        | 19                | 3          | (2)         |\n| Total unilateral in favour of Barclays     | 53,807            | 1,171      | (1,101)     | 55,958            | 1,310      | (960)       |\n| Unilateral in favour of counterparty       |                   |            |             |                   |            |             |\n| Foreign exchange                           | 18,365            | 595        | (484)       | 22,673            | 638        | (637)       |\n| Interest rate                              | 42,791            | 2,207      | (2,726)     | 61,158            | 2,270      | (2,752)     |\n| Credit derivatives                         | 716               | -          | -           | 144               | -          | -           |\n| Equity and stock index                     | 1,406             | 115        | (59)        | 492               | 96         | (26)        |\n| Total unilateral in favour of counterparty | 63,278            | 2,917      | (3,269)     | 84,467            | 3,004      | (3,415)     |\n| Bilateral arrangement                      |                   |            |             |                   |            |             |\n| Foreign exchange                           | 6,139,730         | 83,319     | (76,345)    | 5,381,723         | 102,077    | (95,377)    |\n| Interest rate                              | 19,202,160        | 100,071    | (86,135)    | 14,566,844        | 124,463    | (107,895)   |\n| Credit derivatives                         | 572,188           | 4,749      | (5,278)     | 582,943           | 3,635      | (3,790)     |\n| Equity and stock index                     | 433,737           | 13,390     | (19,890)    | 393,664           | 9,505      | (12,280)    |\n| Commodity derivatives                      | 4,431             | 43         | (2)         | 4,303             | 14         | (50)        |\n| Total bilateral arrangement                | 26,352,246        | 201,572    | (187,650)   | 20,929,477        | 239,694    | (219,392)   |\n| Uncollateralised derivatives               |                   |            |             |                   |            |             |\n| Foreign exchange                           | 372,404           | 4,102      | (5,324)     | 349,569           | 5,638      | (6,979)     |\n| Interest rate                              | 419,568           | 2,357      | (4,088)     | 287,026           | 3,119      | (6,864)     |\n| Credit derivatives                         | 13,352            | 178        | (333)       | 35,933            | 601        | (717)       |\n| Equity and stock index                     | 13,159            | 4,272      | (5,785)     | 16,101            | 3,075      | (4,416)     |\n| Commodity derivatives                      | 303               | 1          | (2)         | 108               | -          | (1)         |\n| Total uncollateralised derivatives         | 818,786           | 10,910     | (15,532)    | 688,737           | 12,433     | (18,977)    |\n| Total OTC derivative assets/(liabilities)  | 27,288,117        | 216,570    | (207,552)   | 21,758,639        | 256,441    | (242,744)   |\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

The market risk management section provides a description of management VaR.\n\n## Measures of market risk in the Group and accounting measures\n\nTraded market risk measures such as VaR and balance sheet exposure measures have fundamental differences:\n\n- \u00b7 balance sheet measures show accrualsbased balances or marked to market values as at the reporting date;\n- \u00b7 VaR measures also take account of current marked to market values, but in addition hedging effects between positions are considered;\n- \u00b7 market risk measures are expressed in terms of changes in value or volatilities as opposed to static values.\n\nFor these reasons, it is not possible to present direct reconciliations of traded market risk and accounting measures.\n\n## Summary of performance in the period\n\nAverage management VaR increased 17% to \u00a342m (2022: \u00a336m) and the range narrowed. The increase was driven by the impact of funded, fair value leverage loan exposure in Investment Banking since Q4 2022, partially offset by lower market volatility and credit spread levels in 2023 as geopolitical tensions eased, relative to 2022, inflation declined and the pace of interest rate rises moderated. Management VaR declined in 2023 from a high of \u00a373m in November 2022, driven by a reduction in the size of the funded, fair value leverage loan exposure in Investment Banking.\n\n## Traded market risk review\n\n## Review of management measures\n\nThe following disclosures provide details on management measures of market risk. Refer to the market risk management section of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited) for more detail on management measures and the differences when compared to regulatory measures.\n\nThe table below shows the total management VaR on a diversified basis by risk factor. Total management VaR includes all trading positions in CIB and Treasury and it is calculated with a one-day holding period, measured to a confidence level of 95%.\n\nLimits are applied against each risk factor VaR as well as total management VaR, which are then cascaded further by risk managers to each business.\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nreview\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

Historical correlations between losses are taken into account in making these assessments. The high and low VaR figures reported for each category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported as a whole. Consequently, a diversification effect balance for the high and low VaR figures would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the above table.\n\n## Group Management VaR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

The analysis is carried out by business unit and currency.\n\nThe Group measures some non-traded market risks, in particular prepayment, recruitment, and residual risk using an economic capital methodology.\n\nThe Group discloses the overall impact of a parallel shift in interest rates on other comprehensive income and cash flow hedges.\n\nThe Group measures the volatility of the value of the FVOCI instruments in the liquidity pool through non-traded market risk VaR.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nAll disclosures in this section are unaudited unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Group Liquidity Risk is managed within Treasury and Capital Risk framework and is designed to maintain liquidity resources that are sufficient in amount and quality, and a funding profile that is appropriate to meet the Group's Liquidity Risk Appetite and PRA Regulatory requirements. The liquidity risk framework is delivered via a combination of policy formation, review and governance, analysis, stress testing, limit setting and monitoring.\n\nThis section provides an analysis of the Group's: (i) summary of performance, (ii) liquidity risk stress testing, iii) liquidity regulation, iv) liquidity pool, (v) funding structure and funding relationships, (vi) credit ratings, and (vii) contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nFor further detail on liquidity risk governance and framework, refer to pages 172 to 174 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited).\n\n## Key metrics\n\nLiquidity Coverage  Ratio 1\n\n161%\n\nNet Stable Funding Ratio 2\n\n138%\n\n- 1 LCR represents average  of the last 12 spot month end ratios.\n- 2 NSFR represents average of the last four spot quarter end ratios.\n\n## Summary of performance\n\n|                                                         |   Page |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Net interest income sensitivity                         |    357 |\n| - by business unit                                      |    357 |\n| - by currency                                           |    358 |\n| Analysis of equity sensitivity                          |    358 |\n| Volatility of the FVOCI portfolio in the liquidity pool |    358 |\n\n## Liquidity risk stress testing\n\nThe liquidity pool at \u00a3298bn (December 2022: \u00a3318bn) reflects the Group's prudent approach to liquidity management. The Average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) remained well above the 100% regulatory requirement at 161% (December 2022: 156%), equivalent to a surplus of 118bn (December 2022: \u00a3114bn).\n\nThe decrease in the liquidity pool over the year was driven by a decrease in wholesale funding, a slight reduction in net deposits where a decrease in  Barclays UK deposits is largely offset by a growth in Corporate Bank deposits, and changes in business funding consumption. A decrease in net stress outflows led by an increase in the proportion of corporate deposits treated as operational led to an increase in the LCR ratio. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (average of last four quarter ends) was 138%, which represents a surplus of \u00a3167bn above the 100% regulatory requirement.\n\nDuring the year, the Group issued \u00a314.1bn of minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) instruments in a range of tenors and currencies.\n\nBarclays Bank PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term and medium-term markets and Barclays Bank UK PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term markets and maintain active secured funding programmes. This funding capacity enables the respective entities to maintain their stable and diversified funding bases.\n\nThe Group's reliance on short-term wholesale funding, as measured by the proportion of wholesale funding maturing in less than one year decreased year-onyear to 33% (December 2022: 39%).\n\nBarclays' Liquidity Risk is managed within the Principal Risk: Treasury and Capital Risk Framework.  Under this framework, the Group has established a liquidity risk appetite together with the appropriate limits for the management of the liquidity risk. This is the level of liquidity risk the Group chooses to take in pursuit of its business objectives and in meeting its regulatory obligations. The Group sets its internal liquidity risk appetite based on internal liquidity risk stress tests and, external regulatory requirements namely the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).\n\n## Internal Liquidity Stress Tests (ILST formally known as LRA)\n\nThe Internal Liquidity Risk Stress Test measures the potential contractual and contingent stress outflows under a range of internally defined stress scenarios, which are then used to determine the size of the liquidity pool that is immediately available to meet anticipated outflows should a stress occur.\n\nAs part of the ILST, the Group runs four liquidity stress scenarios, aligned to the PRA's prescribed stresses:\n\n- \u00b7 90 days market-wide stress event\n- \u00b7 30 days Barclays-specific stress event\n- \u00b7 30 days combined market-wide and Barclays-specific stress event\n- \u00b7 12 months market wide stress",

The LCR requirement takes into account the relative stability of different sources of funding and potential incremental funding requirements in a stress. The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of a bank's liquidity risk profile by holding sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) to survive an acute stress scenario lasting for 30 days. The NSFR has been developed to promote a sustainable and stable structure of assets and liabilities.\n\n340",

The ratio is defined as the Available Stable Funding (capital and certain liabilities which are defined as stable sources of funding) relative to the Required Stable Funding (a measure of assets on the balance sheet and certain off balance sheet exposures which may require longer term funding). The NSFR was 138% at December 2023 ( December 2022: 137%) (average of last four quarter ends) equivalent to a surplus of \u00a3167bn (2022: \u00a3155bn) above the regulatory requirement and demonstrates Barclays' stable balance sheet funding profile.\n\n| Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) 1   | 2023 \u00a3bn   | 2022 \u00a3bn   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Total Available Stable Funding      | 607        | 576        |\n| Total Required Stable Funding       | 440        | 421        |\n| Surplus                             | 167        | 155        |\n| Net Stable Funding Ratio            | 138 %      | 137 %      |\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 Average represents the last four spot quarter end ratios.\n\nAs part of the liquidity risk appetite, Barclays establishes minimum LCR, NSFR and internal liquidity stress test limits. The Group plans to maintain its surplus to the internal and regulatory requirements at an efficient level. Risks to market funding conditions, the Group's liquidity position and funding profile are assessed continuously, and actions are taken to manage the size of the liquidity pool and the funding profile as appropriate.\n\n## Liquidity pool\n\nThe Group liquidity pool as at 31 December 2023 was \u00a3298bn (2022: \u00a3318bn). In 2023, the month-end liquidity pool ranged from \u00a3298bn to \u00a3342bn (2022: \u00a3309bn to \u00a3359bn), and the month-end average balance was \u00a3328bn (2022: \u00a3331bn).

It also reflects differences in eligibility of assets between the LCR and Barclays' Liquidity Pool.\n- 2 Includes cash held at central banks and surplus cash at central banks related to payment schemes. Of which over 99% (2022: over 99%) was placed with the Bank of England, US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank.\n- 3 Of which over 80% (2022: over 79%) comprised UK, US, French, German, Japanese, Swiss and Dutch securities.",

In addition, the investment of the liquidity pool is monitored for concentration risk by issuer, currency and asset type. Given the returns generated by these highly liquid assets, the risk and reward profile is continuously managed.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, 59% (2022: 60%) of the liquidity pool was located in Barclays Bank PLC, 22% (2022: 25%) in Barclays Bank UK PLC and 11% (2022: 9%) in Barclays Bank Ireland PLC. The residual portion of the liquidity pool is held outside of these entities, predominantly in the US subsidiaries, to meet entity-specific stress outflows and local regulatory requirements. To the extent the use of this portion of the liquidity pool is restricted due to local regulatory requirements, it is assumed to be unavailable to the rest of the Group in calculating the LCR.\n\n## Contingent liquidity\n\nIn addition to the Group liquidity pool, the Group has access to other unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity. While these are not relied on in the Group's ILST, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity through their use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.\n\nIn a Barclays-specific, market-wide or combined liquidity stress, liquidity available via market sources could be severely disrupted. In circumstances where market liquidity is unavailable or available only at significantly elevated prices, the Group could generate liquidity via central bank facilities. To this end, as at 31 December 2023, the Group had \u00a372.5bn (December 2022: \u00a383.3bn) of assets positioned at various central banks.\n\nFor more detail on the Group's other unencumbered assets, see pages 197 to 201 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited).\n\n## Funding structure and funding relationships\n\nThe basis for sound liquidity risk management is a funding structure that reduces the probability of a liquidity stress leading to an inability to meet funding obligations as they fall due. The Group's overall funding strategy is to develop a diversified funding base (geographically, by type and by counterparty) and maintain access to a variety of alternative funding sources, to provide protection against unexpected fluctuations, while minimising the cost of funding.\n\nWithin this, the Group aims to align the sources and uses of funding. As such, retail and corporate loans and advances are largely funded by deposits in the relevant entities, with the surplus primarily funding the liquidity pool. The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by repurchase agreements. Derivative liabilities and assets are largely matched. A substantial proportion of balance sheet derivative positions qualify for counterparty netting and the remaining portions are largely offset when netted against cash collateral received and paid. Wholesale debt and equity is used to fund residual assets.\n\nThese funding relationships are summarised below:\n\n|                                                                                                    | 2023   | 2022   |                                                                                                 | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Assets                                                                                             | \u00a3bn    | \u00a3bn    | Liabilities                                                                                     | \u00a3bn    | \u00a3bn    |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost 1                                                             | 386    | 385    | Deposits at amortised cost                                                                      | 539    | 546    |\n| Group liquidity pool                                                                               | 298    | 318    | <1 Year wholesale funding                                                                       | 59     | 73     |\n|                                                                                                    |        |        | >1 Year wholesale funding                                                                       | 118    | 111    |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements, trading  portfolio assets, cash collateral and  settlement balances | 435    | 412    | Repurchase agreements, trading portfolio  liabilities, cash collateral and settlement  balances | 380    | 370    |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                                                   | 257    | 302    | Derivative financial instruments                                                                | 250    | 290    |\n| Other assets 2                                                                                     | 101    | 97     | Other liabilities                                                                               | 59     | 55     |\n|                                                                                                    |        |        | Equity                                                                                          | 72     | 69     |\n| Total assets                                                                                       | 1,477  | 1,514  | Total liabilities                                                                               | 1,477  | 1,514  |\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Adjusted for liquidity pool debt securities reported at amortised costs of \u00a318bn (December 2022: \u00a314bn).\n- 2 Other assets include fair value assets that are not part of reverse repurchase agreements or trading portfolio assets, and other asset categories.",

In addition to these customer deposits \u00a35.6bn (2022: \u00a35.7bn) of other liabilities are insured by other governments.\n\nContractually current accounts are repayable on demand and savings accounts at short notice. In practice, their observed maturity is typically longer than their contractual maturity. Similarly, repayment profiles of certain types of assets e.g. mortgages, overdrafts and credit card lending, differ from their contractual profiles. The Group therefore assesses the behavioural maturity of both customer assets and liabilities to identify structural balance sheet funding gaps. In doing so, it applies quantitative modelling and qualitative assessments which take into account historical experience, current customer composition, and macroeconomic projections.\n\nThe Group's broad base of customers, numerically and by depositor type, helps protect against unexpected fluctuations in balances and hence provides a stable funding base for the Group's operations and liquidity needs.\n\n## Wholesale funding\n\nBarclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group maintain access to a variety of sources of wholesale funds in major currencies, including those available from term investors across a variety of distribution channels and geographies, short-term funding markets and repo markets.\n\nBarclays Bank Group has direct access to US, European and Asian capital markets through its global investment banking operations and to long-term investors through its clients worldwide. Key sources of wholesale funding include money markets, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, medium term issuances (including structured notes) and securitisations.\n\nKey sources of wholesale funding for Barclays Bank UK Group include money markets, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, covered bonds and other securitisations.\n\nThe Group expects to continue issuing public wholesale debt from Barclays PLC (the Parent company), in order to maintain compliance with indicative MREL requirements and maintain a stable and diverse funding base by type, currency and market. During the year, the Group issued \u00a314.1bn of MREL instruments from Barclays PLC  in a range of different currencies and tenors.\n\nBarclays Bank PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term markets and maintain active medium-term notes programmes. Barclays Bank UK PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term markets and maintain active secured funding programmes. This funding capacity enables the respective entities to maintain their stable and diversified funding bases.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group's total wholesale funding outstanding (excluding repurchase agreements) was \u00a3176.8bn (2022: \u00a3184.0bn), of which \u00a319.0bn (2022: \u00a319.2bn) was secured funding and \u00a3157.8bn (2022: \u00a3164.8bn) unsecured funding. Unsecured funding includes \u00a369.2bn (2022: \u00a359.7bn) of privately placed senior unsecured notes issued through a variety of distribution channels including intermediaries and private banks.\n\nWholesale funding of \u00a358.6bn (2022: \u00a372.5bn) matures in less than one year, representing 33% (December 2022: 39%) of total wholesale funding outstanding. This includes \u00a318.7bn (2022: \u00a315.0bn) related to term funding 2 . Although not a requirement, the liquidity pool exceeded the wholesale funding maturing in less than one year by \u00a3239bn (2022: \u00a3246bn).\n\nBarclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group also support various central bank monetary initiatives, such as the Bank of England's Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME), and the European Central Bank's Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO). These are reported under 'repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing' on the balance sheet.\n\nIn 2023, Barclays repaid \u00a30.9bn of its TLTRO drawings, reducing its outstanding balance to \u00a30.5bn as at 31 December 2023. In addition, the total outstanding principal amount of TFSME remained at \u00a321.9bn at year end.",

These ratings assess the creditworthiness of the Group, its subsidiaries and its branches, and are based on reviews of a broad range of business and financial attributes including capital strength, profitability, funding, liquidity, asset quality, strategy and governance.\n\n| Credit ratings         |                   |             |           |\n|------------------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|\n| As at 31 December 2023 | Standard & Poor's | Moody's     | Fitch     |\n| Barclays Bank PLC      |                   |             |           |\n| Long term              | A+/Stable         | A1/Stable   | A+/Stable |\n| Short term             | A-1               | P-1         | F1        |\n| Barclays Bank UK PLC   |                   |             |           |\n| Long term              | A+/Stable         | A1/Stable   | A+/Stable |\n| Short term             | A-1               | P-1         | F1        |\n| Barclays PLC           |                   |             |           |\n| Long term              | BBB+/Stable       | Baa1/Stable | A/Stable  |\n| Short term             | A-2               | P-2         | F1        |\n\nIn March 2023, Moody's upgraded Barclays PLC's long-term rating by one notch to Baa1 and reverted the outlook to stable, reflecting Moody's expectation that the Group's earnings will be higher, more diversified and more sustainable than before, while asset risk will remain broadly stable and capital and liquidity will remain strong. This followed the review for upgrade that had been placed on Barclays PLC in December 2022. Moody's also revised Barclays Bank PLC's outlook to stable from negative, reflecting Moody's expectation that the Bank's capital and liquidity will remain strong and whilst profitability will reduce from the exceptional levels of the last couple of years for capital markets and investment banking, it will remain sound due to improving income from other businesses and lower litigation and conduct costs.\n\nIn May 2023, S&P upgraded all Barclays rated entities by one notch and reverted the outlooks to stable, reflecting S&P's view that Barclays PLC's diversified international banking franchise has performed well against a difficult economic and financial backdrop and S&P's expectation that Barclays PLC will generate solid earnings over the next 12-24 months, even as interest rates approach their peak. This action upgraded Barclays PLC's long-term rating to BBB+ and Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC's long-term ratings to A+.\n\nIn July 2023, Fitch affirmed all ratings for Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC.\n\nBarclays also solicits issuer ratings from R&I and the ratings of A for Barclays PLC and A+ for Barclays Bank PLC were affirmed in November 2023 with stable outlooks.\n\nA credit rating downgrade could result in outflows to meet collateral requirements on existing contracts. Outflows related to credit rating downgrades are included in the ILST stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against this risk. Credit ratings downgrades could also result in reduced funding capacity and increased funding costs.\n\nThe contractual collateral requirement following one- and two-notch long-term and associated short-term downgrades across all credit rating agencies, would result in outflows of \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn respectively, and are provided for in determining an appropriate liquidity pool size given the Group's liquidity risk appetite. These numbers do not assume any management or restructuring actions that could be taken to reduce posting requirements. These outflows do not include the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured funding, such as from money market funds, or loss of secured funding capacity. However, unsecured and secured funding stresses are included in the ILST stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against these risks.",

In practice, their behavioural maturity is typically longer than their contractual maturity, and therefore these deposits provide stable funding for the Group's operations and liquidity needs because of the broad base of customers, both numerically and by depositor type\n- \u00b7 loans to corporate and retail customers, which are included within loans and advances at amortised cost and financial assets at fair value, may be repaid earlier in line with terms and conditions of the contract\n- \u00b7 debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities, and financial liabilities designated at fair value, may include early redemption features.",

Maintenance of our capital resources is vital in order to meet the overall regulatory capital requirement, to withstand the impact of the risks that may arise under normal and stressed conditions, and maintain adequate capital to cover current and forecast business needs and associated risks to provide a viable and sustainable business offering.\n\nThis section provides an overview of the Group's: (i) CET1 capital, leverage and own funds and eligible liabilities requirements; (ii) capital resources; (iii) risk weighted assets (RWAs); (iv) leverage ratios and exposures; and (v) own funds and eligible liabilities.\n\nMore details on monitoring and managing capital risk may be found in the risk management sections of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited).\n\n## Key metrics\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio\n\n13.8%\n\nUK leverage ratio\n\n5.2%\n\nOwn funds and eligible liabilities ratio as a percentage of RWAs\n\n33.6%\n\n## Summary of performance in the period\n\nThe Group continues to be in excess of overall capital, leverage and MREL regulatory requirements.\n\nThe CET1 ratio decreased to 13.8% (December 2022: 13.9%) as RWAs increased by \u00a36.2bn to \u00a3342.7bn partially offset by an increase in CET1 capital of \u00a30.4bn to \u00a347.3bn\n\n- \u25aa c.125bps increase from 2023 attributable profit, including the c.25bps negative impact of structural cost actions, of which c.10bps are offset in other capital movements\n- \u25aa c.70bps decrease driven by returns to shareholders including the 8p per share total dividend and \u00a31.25bn of share buybacks announced with FY22 and H123 results\n- \u25aa c.10bps decrease from other capital movements, including the impact of regulatory change on 1 January 2023 relating to IFRS 9 transitional relief, the impact of the KMC acquisition, and movements in other regulatory capital deductions\n- \u25aa c.50bps decrease as a result of a \u00a313.2bn increase in RWAs excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily driven by higher CIB and CC&P RWAs\n- \u25aa An \u00a38.2bn decrease in RWAs as a result of foreign exchange movements was offset by a \u00a31.1bn decrease in CET1 capital due to a decrease in the currency translation reserve\n\nThe UK leverage ratio decreased to 5.2% (December 2022: 5.3%) primarily due to a \u00a338.3bn increase in leverage exposure to \u00a31,168.3bn, largely driven by an increase in trading portfolio assets within Global Markets\n\n## Minimum capital requirements\n\nThe Group's Overall Capital Requirement for CET1 increased to 12.0%, following the latest PRA Individual Capital Requirement (ICR) notice and comprises a 4.5% Pillar 1 minimum, a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB), a 1.5% Global Systemically Important Institution (G-SII) buffer, a 2.6% Pillar 2A requirement and a 0.9% Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB).\n\nThe Group's CCyB is based on the buffer rate applicable for each jurisdiction in which the Group has exposures. Following the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) announcement on 5 July 2022, the UK CCyB increased from 1% to 2% with effect from 5 July 2023. The buffer rates set by other national authorities for non-UK exposures are not currently material.\n\nThe Group's updated Pillar 2A requirement increased by 25bps to 4.6% of which at least 56.25% needs to be met with CET1 capital, equating to 2.6% of RWAs. The Pillar 2A requirement, based on a point in time assessment, has been set as a proportion of RWAs and is subject to at least annual review.\n\nThe Group's CET1 target ratio of 13-14% takes into account headroom above requirements which includes a confidential institution-specific PRA buffer. The Group remains above its minimum capital regulatory requirements including the PRA buffer.\n\n## Minimum leverage requirements\n\nThe Group is subject to a UK leverage ratio requirement of 4.1% as at 31 December 2023. This comprises the 3.25% minimum requirement, a G-SII additional leverage ratio buffer (G-SII ALRB) of 0.53% and a countercyclical leverage ratio buffer (CCLB) of 0.3%.\n\nThe Group is also required to disclose an average UK leverage ratio which is based on capital on the last day of each month in the quarter and an exposure measure for each day in the quarter.\n\n## Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities\n\nThe Group is required to meet the higher of: (i) two times the sum of 8% Pillar 1 and 4.6% Pillar 2A equating to 25.2% of RWAs; and (ii) 6.75% of leverage exposures. In addition, the higher of regulatory capital and leverage buffers apply. CET1 capital cannot be counted towards both MREL and the buffers, meaning that the buffers, including the above mentioned confidential institution-specific PRA buffer, will effectively be applied above MREL requirements.",

Changes in the GBP value of the net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, resulting in a movement in CET1 capital.\n\nThe Group's strategy is to minimise the volatility of the capital ratios caused by foreign exchange movements, by matching the CET1 capital movements to the revaluation of the Group's foreign currency RWA exposures.\n\n## Functional currency of operations (audited)\n\n|                  | Foreign currency  net investments \u00a3m   | Borrowings which  hedge the net  investments \u00a3m   | Derivatives which  hedge the net  investments \u00a3m   | Structural  currency  exposures pre- economic hedges \u00a3m   | Economic hedges \u00a3m   | Remaining  structural currency  exposures \u00a3m   |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| 31 December 2023 |                                        |                                                   |                                                    |                                                           |                      |                                                |\n| USD              | 26,524                                 | (7,308)                                           | (2,179)                                            | 17,037                                                    | (7,326)              | 9,711                                          |\n| EUR              | 9,868                                  | (5,603)                                           | -                                                  | 4,265                                                     | (276)                | 3,989                                          |\n| JPY              | 646                                    | (174)                                             | -                                                  | 472                                                       | -                    | 472                                            |\n| Other currencies | 3,329                                  | (72)                                              | (1,565)                                            | 1,692                                                     | (505)                | 1,187                                          |\n| Total            | 40,367                                 | (13,157)                                          | (3,744)                                            | 23,466                                                    | (8,107)              | 15,359                                         |\n| 31 December 2022 |                                        |                                                   |                                                    |                                                           |                      |                                                |\n| USD              | 27,441                                 | (7,363)                                           | (2,086)                                            | 17,992                                                    | (8,688)              | 9,304                                          |\n| EUR              | 9,776                                  | (5,461)                                           | (3)                                                | 4,312                                                     | (283)                | 4,029                                          |\n| JPY              | 689                                    | -                                                 | (197)                                              | 492                                                       | -                    | 492                                            |\n| Other currencies | 3,330                                  | -                                                 | (1,676)                                            | 1,654                                                     | (279)                | 1,375                                          |\n| Total            | 41,236                                 | (12,824)                                          | (3,962)                                            | 24,450                                                    | (9,250)              | 15,200                                         |\n\nEconomic hedges relate to exposures arising on foreign currency denominated preference share and AT1 instruments. These are accounted for at historical cost under IFRS and do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. The gain or loss arising from changes in the GBP value of these instruments is recognised on redemption in retained earnings.\n\nDuring 2023, total structural currency exposure net of hedging instruments increased by \u00a30.2bn to \u00a315.4bn (2022: \u00a315.2bn). Foreign currency net investments decreased by \u00a30.8bn to \u00a340.4bn (2022: \u00a341.2bn) driven predominantly by a \u00a30.9bn decrease in USD, offset by \u00a30.1bn increase in EUR. The hedges (excluding economic hedges) associated with these investments increased by \u00a30.1bn to \u00a316.9bn (2022: \u00a316.8bn).\n\n## Pension risk review\n\nThe UK Retirement Fund (UKRF) represents approximately 96% (2022: 96%) of the Group's total retirement benefit obligations globally. As such this risk review section focuses exclusively on the UKRF. The UKRF is closed to new entrants and there is no new final salary benefit being accrued. Existing active members accrue a combination of a cash balance benefit and a defined contribution element. Pension risk arises as the market value of the pension fund assets may decline, investment returns may reduce or the estimated value of the pension liabilities may increase.\n\nRefer to the Management of pension risk section in the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited) for more information on how pension risk is managed.\n\n## Assets\n\nThe Trustee Board of the UKRF defines its overall long-term investment strategy with investments across a broad range of asset classes. This results in a diversified mix of return seeking assets as well as liability matching assets to better match future pension obligations. The two largest  risks within the asset portfolio are credit spread and growth assets. The split of scheme assets is shown within Note 32 to the financial statements. The fair value of the UKRF assets was \u00a324.2bn as at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u00a324.7bn).",

On an IAS 19 basis these cash flows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term price inflation rate (RPI) and the discount rate (GBP AA corporate bond yield):\n\n- \u00b7 An increase in long-term expected inflation corresponds to an increase in liabilities;\n- \u00b7 A decrease in the discount rate corresponds to an increase in liabilities.\n\nPension risk is generated through the Group's defined benefit schemes and this risk is set to reduce over time as the main defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants. The chart below outlines the shape of the UKRF's liability cash flow profile as at 31 December 2023 that takes account of the future inflation indexing of payments to beneficiaries. The majority of the cash flows (approximately 96%) fall between 0 and 40 years, peaking between 11 and 20 years and reducing thereafter. The shape may vary depending on changes to inflation and longevity expectations and any members who elect to transfer out. Transfers out will bring forward the liability cash flows.\n\nFor more detail on the UKRF's financial and demographic assumptions, see Note 32 to the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graph above shows the evolution of the UKRF's net IAS 19 position over the last two years. During 2023 the decrease in the UKRF surplus was driven by assets underperforming the discount rate and lower corporate bond yields.\n\nRefer to Note 32 to the financial statements  for the sensitivity of the UKRF to changes in key assumptions.\n\n## Risk measurement\n\nIn line with Barclays' risk management framework the assets and liabilities of the UKRF are modelled within a VaR framework to show the volatility of the pension position at a total portfolio level. This enables the risks, diversification and liability matching characteristics of the UKRF obligations and investments to be adequately captured. VaR is measured and monitored on a monthly basis. Risks are reviewed and reported regularly at  the Pensions Executive Board. The VaR model takes into account the valuation of the liabilities on an IAS 19 basis (see Note 32 to the financial statements). The Trustee receives quarterly VaR measures on a funding basis.\n\nThe pension liability is also sensitive to post-retirement mortality assumptions which are reviewed regularly (See Note 32 to the financial statements). To mitigate part of this risk the UKRF has entered into longevity reinsurance contracts approximately three quarters of current pensioner liabilities.\n\nIn addition, the impact of pension risk to the Group is taken into account as part of the stress testing process. Stress testing is performed internally on at least an annual basis. The UKRF exposure is also included as part of regulatory stress tests.\n\nBarclays defined benefit pension schemes affects capital in two ways:\n\n- \u00b7 An IAS 19 deficit is treated as a liability on the Group's balance sheet. Movement in a deficit due to remeasurements, including actuarial losses, are recognised immediately through Other Comprehensive Income and as such reduces shareholders' equity and CET1 capital. An IAS 19 surplus is treated as an asset on the balance sheet and increases shareholders' equity; however, it is deducted for the purposes of determining CET1 capital.\n- \u00b7 In the Group's statutory balance sheet an IAS 19 surplus or deficit is partially offset by a deferred tax liability or asset respectively. These may or may not be recognised for calculating CET1 capital depending on the overall deferred tax position of the Group at the particular time.\n\nPension risk is taken into account in the Pillar 2A capital assessment undertaken by the PRA at least annually. The Pillar 2A requirement forms part of the overall capital requirement for the Group.",

The hedges  in place remove interest rate risk and smooth income over the medium term. The NII sensitivity for the Group at 31 December 2023 without hedging in place for +/-25bp rate shocks would be \u00a3184m/\u00a3(220)m respectively.\n\n## Net interest income sensitivity\n\nThe table below shows a sensitivity analysis on pre-tax net interest income for non-traded financial assets and liabilities, including the effect of any hedging.

However, movements in the cash flow hedge reserve and pensions remeasurement reserve recognised in FVOCI do not affect CET1 capital.\n\n## Volatility of the FVOCI portfolio in the liquidity pool\n\nChanges in value of FVOCI exposures flow directly through capital via the FVOCI reserve. The volatility of the value of the FVOCI investments in the liquidity pool is captured and managed through a value measure rather than an earning measure, i.e. non-traded market risk VaR.\n\nAlthough the underlying methodology to calculate the non-traded VaR is identical to the one used in traded management VaR, the two measures are not directly comparable. The non-traded VaR represents the volatility to capital driven by the FVOCI exposures. These exposures are in the banking book and do not meet the criteria for trading book treatment.\n\n## Analysis of volatility of the FVOCI portfolio in the liquidity pool\n\n|                                              | 2023    | 2023   | 2023   | 2022    | 2022   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|---------|--------|--------|\n|                                              | Average | High   | Low    | Average | High   | Low    |\n| For the year ended 31 December               | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m     |\n| Non-traded market value at risk (daily, 95%) | 76      | 90     | 61     | 48      | 62     | 35     |\n\nDaily Value at Risk has trended upwards in H1 2023 due to increase in time series volatility and addition in interest rate risk positioning.

The Operational Risk Framework is therefore focused on identifying operational risks, assessing them and managing them within the Group's approved risk appetite.\n\nThe Operational Risk principal risk comprises the following risks: Change Delivery Management Risk; Data Management Risk; Financial Reporting Risk; Fraud Risk; Information Security Risk; Operational Recovery Planning Risk; Payments Process Risk; People Risk; Physical Security Risk; Premises Risk; Risk Reporting; Supplier Risk; Tax Risk; Technology Risk and Transaction Operations Risk. The operational risk profile is also informed by a number of connected risks: Cybersecurity, Data, and Resilience. These themes represent threats to the Group that extend across multiple risk types, and therefore require an integrated risk management approach.\n\nFor definitions of these risks refer to pages 181 to 183 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023. To provide complete coverage of the potential adverse impacts on the Group arising from operational risk, the operational risk taxonomy extends beyond the risks listed above to cover operational risks associated with other principal risks too.\n\nThis section provides an analysis of the Group's operational risk profile, including events above the Group's reportable threshold, which have had a financial impact in 2023. The Group's operational risk profile is informed by bottom-up risk assessments undertaken by each business unit and top-down qualitative review for each risk type. Fraud, Transaction Operations, Information Security and Technology continue to be highlighted as key operational risk exposures.\n\nFor information on compliance risk events, see the compliance risk section.\n\n## Key metrics\n\n83%\n\nof the Group's net reportable operational risk events had a loss value of \u00a350,000 or less\n\n85%\n\nof events by number are due to External Fraud\n\n56%\n\nof losses are from events aligned to External Fraud\n\n40%\n\nof losses are from events aligned to Execution, Delivery and Process Management\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Summary of performance in the period\n\nDuring 2023, total operational risk losses 1 reduced to \u00a3141m (2022: \u00a3161m) while the number of recorded events for 2023 (2,914) remained broadly in line with the level for 2022 (2,964). The total operational risk losses for the year were mainly driven by events falling within the Execution, Delivery & Process Management and External Fraud categories, which tend to be high volume but low impact events.\n\n## Operational risk profile\n\nWithin operational risk, there are a large number of smaller value risk events. In 2023, 83% (2022: 84%) of the Group's reportable operational risk events by volume had a value of less than \u00a350,000 each. Cumulatively, events under this \u00a350,000 threshold accounted for only 33% (2022: 32%) of the Group's total net operational risk losses. A small proportion of operational risk events have a material impact on the financial results of the Group.",

A boundary event is an operational risk event that results in a credit risk impact. Due to the nature of risk events that keep evolving, prior year losses are updated.\n\nglyph<c=24,font=/GPSLMV+Effra-Light>glyph<c=25,font=/GPSLMV+Effra-Light>\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n- \u00b7 External Fraud remains the category with the highest frequency of events at 85% of total events in 2023 (2022: 86%). Impacts from events arising from External Fraud increased slightly in 2023 to \u00a379m (2022: \u00a376m) and accounted for 56% of total 2023 losses (2022: 47%). In this category, high volume, low value events are driven by transactional fraud often related to debit and credit card usage. Note: total External Fraud losses in 2023 including those from events with impact <\u00a310,000 amounted to \u00a3183m (2022: \u00a3190m).\n- \u00b7 Execution, Delivery and Process Management impacts decreased to \u00a356m (2022: \u00a383m) and accounted for 40% (2022: 52%) of total operational risk losses. The events in this category are typical of the banking industry as a whole where high volumes of transactions are processed on a daily basis, mapping mainly to Barclays Transaction Operations risk type. The overall frequency of events in this category remained stable at 14% of total events by volume (2022: 14%).\n\nInvestment continues to be made in improving the control environment across the Group. Specific areas of focus include new and enhanced fraud prevention systems and tools to combat the increasing level of fraud attempts being made whilst minimising disruption to genuine transactions. Fraud remains an industry wide threat and the Group continues to work closely with external partners on various prevention initiatives. Additionally, the Group continues to invest in its processing infrastructure to manage the risk of processing errors as well as ensuring scalability of operations.\n\nOperational Resilience remains a key area of focus for the Group, having been reinforced in recent years due to potential operational disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Group continues to strengthen its resilience approach across its most important business services to improve recoverability and assurance thereof by reviewing  scenarios based on current global climates.\n\nOperational risk associated with cybersecurity remains a top focus for the Group. The sophistication of threat actors continues to grow as noted by multiple external risk events observed throughout the year. Ransomware attacks across the global Barclays supplier base were observed and we worked closely with the affected suppliers to manage potential impacts to the Group and its clients and customers. The Group's cybersecurity events were managed within its risk tolerances, and cybersecurity incidents did not materially impact the Group's business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.

Focus on management of Compliance risk is ongoing and, alongside other relevant business and control management information, the Trading Entity Conduct Risk Dashboard is a key component of this.\n\nThe Group continues to review the role and impact of Compliance risk events and issues in remuneration decisions at both the individual and business level.\n\nIn 2023, the Group maintained focus on new and heightened inherent Compliance risks, including those relating to the cost of living crisis, the evolving threat landscape as related to financial crime, and challenges in ensuring customer and client data is handled appropriately. These risks continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\nA key area of focus has been the implementation and embedment of the FCA's new Consumer Duty, with rules for open products and services taking effect at the end July 2023.\n\nBusinesses have continued to assess the potential customer, client and market impacts of strategic change. As part of the 2023 medium-term planning process, material Compliance risks associated with strategic and financial plans were assessed.\n\nThroughout 2023, Compliance risks were raised by each business area for consideration by relevant Board level committees. These committees reviewed the risks raised and whether management's proposed actions were appropriate to mitigate the risks effectively.\n\nDuring 2023, laws, rules and regulation risk (LRR risk) was created as a new risk under the Compliance Principal Risk. LRR is intended to mitigate the risk of failing to identify applicable LRRs, and ensure appropriate steps are in place to monitor and oversee LRRs. Work is underway to implement processes to support the management and oversight of LRR Risk.\n\nThe Group continued to incur costs in relation to litigation and conduct matters, refer to Note 25 Legal, competition and regulatory matters and Note 23 Provisions for further details. Costs include customer redress and remediation, as well as fines and settlements. Resolution of these matters remains a necessary and important part of delivering the Group's strategy and an ongoing commitment to improve oversight of culture and conduct.\n\nTrading Entity Conduct Risk Dashboards, setting out key indicators in relation to conduct and financial crime risk, are provided to the respective Board Risk Committees and senior management. These continue to be evolved and enhanced to allow effective oversight and decision-making. Work is ongoing to enhance the Compliance Risk Control Environment in a timely and effective manner to ensure the Group operates within Risk Appetite. The tolerance adherence is assessed by the business areas through key indicators  and reported to the relevant Trading Entity Board Committees as part of the Conduct Risk Dashboard governance process.\n\nThe Group remains focused on the continuous improvements being made to manage risk effectively with an emphasis on enhancing governance and management information to identify risk at earlier stages.",

At a Group level throughout 2023, reputation risks and issues were overseen by the Board which reviews the processes and policies which Barclays identifies and manages reputation risk. Within the Barclays Bank UK Group and the Barclays Bank Group reputation risks and issues were overseen by the respective risk and Board risk committees. The top live and emerging reputation risks and issues within the Barclays Bank UK Group and the Barclays Bank Group are included within an over-arching quarterly report at the respective Board level.\n\nThe Board reviewed risks escalated by the businesses and considered whether management's proposed actions, for example attaching conditions to proposed client transactions or increased engagement with impacted stakeholders, were appropriate to mitigate the risks effectively. The Board also received regular updates with regard to key reputation risks and issues, including: Barclays' response to global conflicts; Barclays' association with sensitive sectors; access to banking; lending practices and the resilience of key Barclays systems and processes.\n\nThe Group continued to incur costs in relation to litigation and conduct matters, refer to Note 25 Legal, competition and regulatory matters and Note 23 Provisions for further details. Costs include customer redress and remediation, as well as fines and settlements. Resolution of these matters remains an ongoing commitment to improve oversight of culture and conduct and management of reputation risks.\n\nAs part of Barclays 2023 Medium Term Planning process, material reputation risks associated with strategic and financial plans were also assessed.\n\n## Legal risk\n\nThe Group remains committed to continuous improvements in managing legal risk effectively. During 2023, the Group-wide legal risk management framework was updated to complement and accommodate the introduction of changes to the compliance risk management framework, which includes the responsibility of the Legal Function to proactively identify, communicate and provide legal advice on applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n\nOther improvements during 2023 included a review and update of the supporting legal risk policies, standards and mandatory training, reinforced by ongoing engagement with and education of the Group's businesses and functions by Legal Function colleagues. Legal risk tolerances and legal risk appetite have also been reviewed.\n\nTolerances adherence is assessed through key indicators, which are also used to evaluate the legal risk profile and are reviewed, at least annually, through the relevant risk and control committees. Mandatory controls to manage legal risks are set out in the legal risk standards and are subject to ongoing monitoring. The implementation of changes to the compliance risk management framework referred to above (and described in more detail on page 361) also mitigate legal risk.",

These apply to business operations, impact financial returns and include capital, leverage and liquidity requirements, authorisation, registration and reporting requirements, restrictions on certain activities, and conduct of business regulations, amongst other applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nRegulatory developments in one or more jurisdictions may impact the Group globally. We focus particularly on UK, US and EU regulation in this Report due to the location of the Group's principal areas of business. Regulations elsewhere may also have a significant impact on the Group due to the location of its branches, subsidiaries and, in some cases, clients. For more information on the risks related to the supervision and regulation of the Group, including regulatory change, see the material existing and emerging risk entitled 'Regulatory Change agenda and impact on Business Model' in the Material existing and emerging risks section.\n\n## Supervision in the UK\n\nIn the UK, day-to-day regulation and supervision of the Group is divided between the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) (a division of the Bank of England (BoE)) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). In addition, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) of the BoE has influence on the prudential requirements that may be imposed on the banking system through its powers of direction and recommendation. Certain members of the Group are also subject to regulatory initiatives undertaken by the UK Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), as a participant in payment systems regulated by the PSR.\n\nBarclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC are both authorised with permission to accept deposits, amongst other things, and are subject to prudential supervision by the PRA and to conduct regulation and supervision by the FCA. The Barclays Bank Group is subject to prudential supervision on a solo-consolidated basis and the Barclays Bank UK Group is subject to prudential supervision on a group subconsolidated basis and on an individual basis. The Group as a whole is also subject to prudential supervision by the PRA on a group consolidated basis. Barclays PLC has been approved by the PRA as a financial holding company.\n\nBarclays Capital Securities Limited (BCSL) is authorised and subject to prudential supervision by the PRA as a PRAdesignated investment firm and subject to conduct regulation and supervision by the FCA. Barclays Execution Services Limited is an appointed representative of Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Bank UK PLC and Clydesdale Financial Services Limited.\n\nThe PRA's supervision of the Group is conducted through a variety of regulatory tools, including the collection of information by way of prudential returns or cross-firm reviews, reports obtained from skilled persons, information gathering, regular supervisory visits and regular meetings with the Group's management and directors to discuss issues such as strategy, governance, financial resilience, operational resilience, risk management, and recovery and resolution.\n\nFurther, the BoE, as the UK resolution authority, informs prudential requirements and sets requirements for the Group relating to resolution preparedness.\n\nThe FCA's supervision of the UK firms in the Group is carried out through a combination of proactive engagement meetings, regular supervisory visits, information gathering and regular meetings with management and directors to discuss issues such as customer strategy, fair treatment of customers, and financial crime controls, as well as crosssectoral reviews which analyse the different areas of the market and the risks that may lie ahead.\n\nThe FCA and the PRA also apply the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (the SMCR) which imposes a regulatory approval, individual accountability and fitness and propriety framework in respect of senior individuals within relevant firms.\n\nFCA supervision has focused on conduct risk and customer/client outcomes through implementation of the Consumer Duty (including product design and fair value), fraud and anti-money laundering controls, market operations, access to cash, fair treatment of vulnerable customers and payment account access and closures.\n\nPRA supervision has focused on financial and operational resilience, controls, credit risk management, systems and controls, climate risk and resolvability, where resolvability is reviewed in conjunction with the Resolution Directorate (a division of the BoE).\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nBoth the PRA and the FCA apply standards that generally either anticipate or go beyond requirements established by global or EU standards, whether in relation to capital, leverage and liquidity, resolvability and resolution or matters of conduct. The UK is in the process of reviewing and revising the EU legislation that was onshored into English law following the UK's departure from the EU. This process is ongoing, but based on current indications, potential areas of divergence in approach between the UK and the EU in existing areas of regulation appear moderate and are not expected to result in materially different standards of regulation. Divergence might become more marked in new areas of regulation, such as ESG and Digital. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (FSMA 2023) established a framework for the revocation of retained EU law relating to financial services, with HM Treasury intending to repeal retained EU legislative provisions subject to the transfer of its provisions to the UK regulators' rules where appropriate. The Government is not expected to revoke retained EU law relating to financial services unless the FCA and/or PRA have drafted and consulted on rules in the relevant areas, where it is appropriate that the provisions are replaced.  However, HM Treasury may specify parts of retained EU law where the regulators are exempt from such requirements, for example where they are restating retained EU law revoked through FSMA 2023 in their rulebooks without material changes or where they are replacing revoked retained EU law with material changes but the only material effect is to reduce a regulatory burden. Where changes also have other material effects, which may include impacts on the regulators' objectives, for example, the Government has indicated that it is appropriate to require the regulators to consult. The medium term outlook for the costs and impact of operating under the post-Brexit UK regime remains unclear as the regulatory landscape continues to develop. There is potential for an increase in regulatory implementation costs in the near term to adapt systems and controls.\n\n## Supervision in the EU\n\nThe Group's operations in Europe are authorised and regulated by a combination of its home regulators and host regulators in the European countries where the Group operates.",

Barclays Bank Ireland PLC's EU branches are supervised by the ECB and are also subject to direct supervision for local conduct purposes by national supervisory authorities in the EU jurisdictions where they are established. Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is subject to the requirements set by the Single Resolution Board (SRB) as the resolution authority of Barclays Bank Ireland PLC.  Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is also subject to supervision by the CBI as home state or competent authority under various EU financial services directives and regulations.\n\nThe Group provides the majority of its cross-border banking and investment services to EEA clients via Barclays Bank Ireland PLC. Additionally, Barclays Bank PLC and BCSL are authorised in certain EEA Member States to enable them to continue to conduct a limited range of activities without a presence, including accessing EEA trading venues and interdealer trading. Barclays Bank PLC also has a branch in Paris (to facilitate access to Target 2), which is regulated by the ACPR.\n\n## Supervision in the US\n\nBarclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and its New York branch, and Barclays Bank PLC's US subsidiaries are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework involving numerous statutes, rules and regulations in the US. For example, the Group's US activities and operations are subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), as well as additional supervision, requirements and restrictions imposed by other federal and state regulators and self-regulatory organisations (SROs). In some cases, US requirements may impose restrictions on the Group's global activities, in addition to its activities in the US.\n\nBarclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays US Holdings Limited (BUSHL), Barclays US LLC (BUSL), and Barclays Group US Inc. (BGUS) are regulated as bank holding companies (BHCs) by the FRB.\n\nBUSL is the Group's ultimate US holding company that holds substantially all of the Group's US subsidiaries (including Barclays Capital Inc. (BCI) and Barclays Bank Delaware). BUSL is subject to requirements in respect of capital adequacy, capital planning and stress testing, risk management and governance,\n\nliquidity, leverage limits, large exposure limits, restrictions on activities and financial regulatory reporting. Barclays Bank PLC's New York branch is also subject to enhanced prudential standards relating to, among other things, liquidity and risk management.\n\nBarclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BUSHL and BUSL have financial holding company (FHC) status under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. FHC status allows these entities to engage in a variety of financial and related activities, directly or through subsidiaries, including underwriting, dealing and market making in securities. Failure to maintain FHC status could result in increasingly stringent penalties and, ultimately, in the closure or cessation of certain operations in the US.\n\nIn addition to oversight by the FRB, Barclays Bank PLC's New York branch and many of the Group's subsidiaries are regulated by additional US authorities based on the location or activities of those entities. The New York branch of Barclays Bank PLC is subject to supervision and regulation by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS). Barclays Bank Delaware, a Delaware chartered bank, is subject to supervision and regulation by the Delaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the FRB and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The deposits of Barclays Bank Delaware are insured by the FDIC, up to applicable limits. Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BUSHL, BUSL, and BGUS are required to act as a source of strength for Barclays Bank Delaware. This could, among other things, require these entities to provide capital support to Barclays Bank Delaware if it fails to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements.\n\nThe Group's US securities broker/dealer and investment banking operations are conducted primarily through BCI, and are also subject to ongoing supervision and regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and other government agencies and SROs under US federal and state securities laws. BCI is also registered as a Futures Commission Merchant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), through which the Group conducts its US futures and options on futures business, including client clearing operations, which are subject to ongoing supervision and regulation by the CFTC, the National Futures Association and other SROs.\n\nUnder the US framework for regulating swaps and security-based swaps established under Title VII of the DoddFrank Act, the CFTC has regulatory authority over swaps, the SEC has regulatory authority over security-based swaps, and the  CFTC and SEC  jointly regulate mixed swaps (as such terms are defined in the relevant legislation). Accordingly, the Group's activities related to US swaps and security-based swaps are principally conducted by Barclays Bank PLC and are subject to ongoing supervision and regulation by the CFTC and the SEC, respectively. Barclays Bank PLC is provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and conditionally registered as a security-based swap dealer with the SEC. Barclays Bank PLC is also subject to the FRB swaps rules with respect to margin and capital requirements. In addition, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and is subject to the FRB swaps rules with respect to margin and capital.\n\n## Supervision in Asia Pacific\n\nThe Group's operations in Asia Pacific are supervised and regulated by a broad range of national banking and financial services regulators.\n\n## Prudential regulation\n\nCertain Basel III standards were implemented in EU law through the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV), as amended by CRR II and CRD V. These standards were retained in the UK regulatory framework via a series of onshoring instruments when the UK withdrew from the European Union. Beyond the minimum standards required by CRR, the PRA has expected the Group, in common with other major UK banks and building societies, to meet a 7% Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio at the level of the consolidated group since 1 January 2016. The 7% CET1 ratio is made up of a Pillar 1 minimum capital requirement of 4.5% CET1 and a capital conservation buffer which must be met entirely with CET1 capital.\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (GSIBs), such as the Barclays Group, are subject to a number of additional prudential requirements, including the requirement to hold additional lossabsorbing capacity and additional capital buffers above the level required by Basel III standards.",

        "page_content": "Risk\n\nreview\n\n## Supervision and regulation (continued)\n\nThe level of the G-SIB buffer is set by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) according to a bank's systemic importance and can range from 1% to 3.5% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs). The G-SIB buffer must be met with CET1 capital. In November 2023, the FSB published an update to its list of GSIBs, maintaining the 1.5% G-SIB buffer that applies to the Group.\n\nThe Group is subject to a 'combined buffer requirement' consisting of (i) a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of RWAs, and (ii) a countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB). The CCyB is based on rates determined by the regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which the Group maintains exposures. In the UK, the CCyB rate is set by the FPC and is currently 2%.\n\nThe PRA requires UK firms to hold additional capital to cover risks which the PRA assesses are not fully captured by the Pillar 1 capital requirement. The PRA sets this additional capital requirement (Pillar 2A) at least annually, derived from each firm's individual capital guidance. Under current PRA rules, the Pillar 2A requirement must be met with at least 56.25% CET1 capital and no more than 25% tier 2 capital. In addition, the capital that firms use to meet their minimum requirements (Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A) cannot be counted towards meeting the combined buffer requirement.\n\nThe PRA may also impose a confidential 'PRA buffer' to cover risks over a forward looking planning horizon, including with regard to firm-specific stresses or management and governance weaknesses. The PRA buffer must be met separately to the combined buffer requirement, and must be met fully with CET1 capital.\n\nAs part of its approach to ring fencing, the FPC established a framework to apply a firm-specific systemic risk buffer (SRB). The purpose of the SRB was to increase the capacity of ring-fenced bodies, such as Barclays Bank UK PLC, to absorb stress. With the implementation of CRD V, the Other Systemically Important Institutions Buffer (O-SII buffer) replaced the SRB. The O-SII buffer can be set between 0% and 3% and has to be met solely with CET1 capital. The O-SII buffer rate applicable to Barclays Bank UK PLC is currently set by the PRA at 1%.\n\nPreviously, total assets were used as the metric to determine O-SII buffer rates but the FPC announced in 2022 that this would change to the UK leverage exposure measure and that it would recalibrate the thresholds used to determine O-SII buffer rates to prevent an overall tightening or loosening of the framework relative to its pre-Covid level. The PRA's 2023 review of the O-SII buffer was based on end-2022 leverage exposure measures and maintained the O-SII buffer rate applicable to Barclays Bank UK PLC at 1% (applicable from January 2025). For future reviews, the average of firms' quarter-end leverage exposure measure over the year will be used to determine O-SII buffer rates, rather than the year-end value. In addition, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is identified as a O-SII by the CBI, which has imposed an OSII buffer on Barclays Bank Ireland PLC of 1%.\n\nOn 30 November 2022, the PRA published a consultation paper concerning the implementation of the remaining Basel III standards, which include a revised standardised approach for credit risk, the elimination of modelled approaches for certain credit risk exposure categories, a new standardised approach for operational risk, a new market risk approach and the implementation of an output floor requiring reported RWAs calculated under standardised and modelled approaches to be a minimum of 72.5% of fully standardised calculations. In December 2023 the PRA published its first collection of near-final policy proposals for implementing these measures, including those for market risk, operational risk and the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and counterparty credit risk. A further collection of policies, including those for credit risk and credit risk mitigation, are expected to be published by the PRA in Q2 2024. The implementation date for these standards has been extended to 1 July 2025. In June 2023, the EU reached a provisional agreement on the implementation of the remaining parts of the Basel III reforms. In December 2023, the preparatory bodies of the Council and Parliament endorsed this banking package. It consists of a legislative act to amend the Capital Requirements Directive (Directive 2013/36/EU), and a legislative act to amend the Capital Requirements Regulation (Regulation No (EU)2013/575) (referred to as CRR III and CRD VI, respectively). The relevant measures are scheduled to apply from January 2025 and mid-2025 respectively.\n\nIn the US,  the Barclays Bank Group (including BUSL) is subject to prudential requirements for large domestic US banking organisations, foreign banking organisations and their intermediate holding companies (IHCs) set by the FRB and other US regulatory agencies. BUSL is a 'Category III' IHC. BUSL (and Barclays Bank Delaware) is subject to reduced (calibrated at 85%) standardised liquidity requirements, including the liquidity coverage ratio and NSFR.\n\nBUSL is also subject to the FRB's rules regarding single counterparty credit limits (SCCL). The SCCL apply to the largest US BHCs and foreign banks' (including the Group's) US operations. The SCCL creates two separate limits for foreign banks, the first on combined US operations (CUSO) and the second on the US IHC (BUSL). The SCCL for BUSL, as a US BHC, requires that exposure to an unaffiliated counterparty of BUSL not exceed 25% of BUSL's tier 1 capital. With respect to the CUSO, the SCCL rule allows certification to the FRB that a foreign bank complies with comparable home country regulation.\n\nBarclays Bank PLC has complied with the CUSO requirement since 1 January 2022, with the first certification applicable for its Q1 2022 results.  To date, Barclays Bank PLC has not relied on home country certification.\n\nIn July 2023, the FRB and other US regulatory agencies proposed changes to the regulatory capital rules applicable to US banks, BHCs and IHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more (Large Banking Organizations). These changes are intended to be broadly consistent with revisions to Basel III finalised by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2017. The US proposal would end the use of internal models for credit risk, credit valuation adjustments, and operational risk, create an expanded risk-based credit capital approach in addition to retaining a modified version of the current standardised approach, and make changes to the modelling requirements for market risk. A Large Banking Organization would be required to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the expanded risk-based approach and the current standardised approach and would use the lower of the two. All capital buffer requirements would apply regardless of whether the expanded risk-based approach or the existing standardised approach produces the lower ratio. The proposal was subject to a public comment period which ended on 16 January 2024, and would not be effective until 1 July",

We are analysing the potential effects of the proposed changes, including the timing of implementation.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nThe Group and certain of its members are subject to supervisory stress testing exercises in a number of jurisdictions, designed to assess the resilience of banks to adverse economic or financial developments and ensure that they have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for the risks associated with their business profile. Assessment by regulators is on both a quantitative and qualitative basis, the latter focusing on such elements as data provision and stress testing capability, including model risk management and internal management processes and controls.\n\n## Recovery and Resolution\n\n## Stabilisation and resolution framework\n\nThe current UK framework for recovery and resolution was established by the Banking Act 2009, as amended. The EU framework was established by the 2014 Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), as amended by BRRD II.\n\nThe BoE, as the UK resolution authority, has the power to resolve a UK financial institution that is failing or likely to fail by exercising certain stabilisation tools, including (i) bail-in: the cancellation, transfer or dilution of a relevant entity's equity and write-down or conversion of the claims of a relevant entity's unsecured creditors (including holders of capital instruments) and conversion of those claims into equity as necessary to restore solvency; (ii) the transfer of all or part of a relevant entity's business to a private sector purchaser; and (iii) the transfer of all or part of a relevant entity's business to a 'bridge bank' controlled by the BoE. When exercising any of its stabilisation powers, the BoE must generally provide that shareholders bear first losses, followed by creditors in accordance with the priority of their claims in insolvency.\n\nIn order to enable the exercise of its stabilisation powers, the BoE may impose a temporary stay on the rights of creditors to terminate, accelerate or close out contracts, or override events of default or termination rights that might otherwise be invoked as a result of a resolution action and modify contractual arrangements in certain circumstances (including a variation of the terms of any securities). HM Treasury may also amend the law for the purpose of enabling it to use its powers\n\nunder this regime effectively, potentially with retrospective effect.\n\nIn addition and distinct from bail-in, the BoE has the power to permanently writedown, or convert into equity, tier 1 capital instruments, tier 2 capital instruments and internal eligible liabilities at the point of non-viability of an institution pursuant to broader resolution powers under the Banking Act.\n\nThe BoE's preferred approach for the resolution of the Group is a bail-in strategy with a single point of entry at Barclays PLC. Under such a strategy, Barclays PLC's subsidiaries would remain operational while Barclays PLC's capital instruments and eligible liabilities would be written down or converted to equity in order to recapitalise the Group and allow for the continued provision of services and operations throughout the resolution. The order in which the bail-in tool is applied reflects the hierarchy of capital instruments under applicable UK legislation and rules, and otherwise respecting the hierarchy of claims in an ordinary insolvency. Accordingly, the more subordinated the\n\nclaim, the more likely losses will be suffered by owners of the claim.\n\nThe PRA has made rules that require authorised firms to draw up recovery plans and resolution packs. Recovery plans are designed to outline credible actions that authorised firms could implement in the event of severe stress in order to restore their business to a stable and sustainable condition. The submission of resolution packs was suspended by the PRA in 2018 until further notice and replaced by annual resolution reporting. It continues to be suspended pending PRA assessment of areas of potential duplication between different reporting expectations. The Barclays Group, however, is required to provide the PRA with a recovery plan biennially, although the Group maintains and refreshes  this on an annual basis.\n\nRemoval of potential impediments to an orderly resolution of a banking group or one or more of its subsidiaries is considered as part of the BoE's resolution planning for each firm, and the BoE can require firms to make significant changes in order to enhance their resolvability. Under the BOE's Resolvability Assessment Framework (RAF) firms are required to have in place capabilities covering three resolvability outcomes: (i) adequate financial resources; (ii) being able to continue to do business through resolution and restructuring; and (iii) being able to communicate and co-ordinate within the firm and with authorities.\n\nBarclays Group's second self-assessment report on resolvability under the RAF was submitted to the PRA/BoE in 2023 and public disclosures by both Barclays Group and the PRA/BoE on the most recent report are due in June 2024. Updated reports and disclosures are required every two years. The BoE's assessment on the 2021 report, published in June 2022, concluded that there were no shortcomings, deficiencies or substantive impediments identified in the Group's resolution capabilities that could impede its ability to execute the preferred resolution strategy. In future, should any such issues be identified, the PRA/BoE could exercise its various powers to direct the Group to address the relevant issues.\n\nWhile regulators in many jurisdictions have indicated a preference for single point of entry resolution for the Group, additional resolution or bankruptcy provisions may apply to certain non-UK Group entities or branches.\n\nIn the US, BUSL is subject to the Orderly Liquidation Authority established by Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA), a regime for the orderly liquidation of systemically important financial institutions by the FDIC, as an alternative to proceedings under the US Bankruptcy Code. In addition, the licensing authorities of Barclays Bank PLC New York branch and of Barclays Bank Delaware have the authority to take possession of the business and property of the applicable branch or entity they license and/or to revoke or suspend such licence.\n\nIn the US, Title I of the DFA, as amended, and the implementing regulations issued by the FRB and the FDIC require each bank holding company with assets of $250bn or more, including those within the Group, to prepare and submit a plan for the orderly resolution of subsidiaries and operations in the event of future material financial distress or failure. The Group submitted a 'targeted plan' in December 2021. The agencies did not identify any shortcomings or deficiencies with the Group's 2021 US Resolution Plan. In August 2023, the FRB and FDIC proposed new guidance for triennial full filers (such as the Group) that would affect the content required to be included in the US Resolution Plan. The proposal generally represents an expansion of the current 165(d) resolution planning guidance the Group is subject to as a 'specified foreign banking organization.' The Group's next submission of the US Resolution Plan in respect of its US operations will be a 'full plan' due 31 March 2025, unless the FRB and FDIC provide a further extension.",

        "page_content": "Risk\n\nreview\n\n## Supervision and regulation (continued)\n\nBarclays Bank Ireland PLC is required by the ECB to submit a standalone BRRD compliant recovery plan on an annual basis. As a Significant Institution under direct ECB supervision, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC falls within the remit of the Single Resolution Board (SRB), as the resolution authority for the European Banking Union. Under the provisions of the BRRD and EU Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR), the SRB is required to determine the optimal resolution strategy for Barclays Bank Ireland PLC and, also, to prepare a resolution plan for the bank. The SRB undertakes this work within the context of the BoE's preferred resolution strategy of single point of entry with bail in at Barclays PLC. In order to carry out its mandate, the SRB collects detailed structural and other information from Barclays Bank Ireland PLC on a regular basis, as well as engaging with the bank to identify and address impediments to resolution. This work is done in coordination with the BoE, as the Group resolution authority. Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is required to meet the SRB's requirements for resolution as set out in the SRB's 'Expectations for Banks' document by 31 July 2024 (this deadline was extended by the SRB in October 2023 from the original deadline of 31 December 2023).\n\nIn April 2023, the EU Commission proposed certain reforms to strengthen the EU's bank crisis management and deposit insurance (CMDI) framework, including extending depositor protection to public entities and client money deposited in certain types of client funds. The EU legislative process remains ongoing. Provisional agreement was reached in December 2023 between the Council and the European Parliament on the treatment of internal MREL in bank resolution groups, referred to as the 'Daisy Chains' proposal (a confined part of the CMDI proposals). This treatment is expected to apply from the second half of 2024.\n\n## TLAC and MREL\n\nThe Group is under the supervision of the BoE, as the UK resolution authority, and is subject to a Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL), which includes a component reflecting the FSB's standards on total loss absorbency capacity (TLAC).\n\nSince 1 January 2022, G-SIBs with resolution entities incorporated in the UK have been required to meet an MREL equivalent to the higher of: (i) two times the sum of their Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A\n\nrequirements; or (ii) the higher of two times their leverage ratio requirement or 6.75% of leverage exposures. Internal MREL for operating subsidiaries is subject to a scalar in the 75-90% range of the external requirement that would apply to the subsidiary if it were a resolution entity. The starting point for the scalar is 90% for ring-fenced bank sub-groups.\n\nBarclays Bank Ireland PLC is subject to the SRB's MREL policy, as issued in May 2023, in respect of the internal MREL that it will be required to issue to the Group. The SRB's current calibration of internal MREL for non-resolution entities is expressed as two ratios that have to be met in parallel: (a) two times the sum of: (i) the firm's Pillar 1 requirement; and (ii) its Pillar 2 requirement; and (b) two times the leverage ratio requirement. The SRB's policy does not apply any scalar in respect of the internal MREL requirement. Under the SRB MREL policy, a bank specific adjustment can be applied by the SRB to MREL requirements. From 1 January 2024, a revised deduction regime will apply for the indirect subscription of instruments eligible for internal MREL to avoid the double-counting of MREL elements at the level of intermediate entities within a resolution group.\n\nIn the US, the FRB's TLAC rule includes provisions that require BUSL to have: (i) a specified outstanding amount of eligible long-term debt; (ii) a specified outstanding amount of TLAC (consisting of common and preferred equity regulatory capital plus eligible long-term debt); and (iii) a specified common equity buffer. In addition, the FRB's TLAC rule prohibits BUSL, for so long as the Group's overall resolution plan treats BUSL as a non-resolution entity, from issuing TLAC to entities other than those within the Group.\n\n## Bank Levy and FSCS\n\nThe BRRD established a requirement for EU member states to set up a pre-funded resolution financing arrangement with funding equal to 1% of covered deposits by 31 December 2024 to cover the costs of bank resolutions. The UK implemented this requirement by way of a tax on the balance sheets of banks known as the 'Bank Levy', which remains in place.\n\nIn addition, the UK has a statutory compensation fund called the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which is funded by way of annual levies on most authorised financial services firms.\n\n## Structural reform\n\nIn the UK, the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013 put in place a framework\n\nfor ring-fencing certain operations of large banks. Ring-fencing requires, among other things, the separation of the retail and smaller deposit-taking business activities of UK banks into a legally distinct, operationally separate and economically independent entity (a 'ring-fenced bank'), which is not permitted to undertake a range of activities. In 2023, HM Treasury issued a public call for evidence on aligning the ring-fencing and resolution regimes, amongst other things, and a consultation on reforms to the ring-fencing regime, including amendments to the thresholds above which the regime applies, permitting ring-fenced banks to establish branches and subsidiaries outside the UK or the EEA and the introduction of a transitional period for compliance with the ringfencing regime following mergers or acquisitions. HM Treasury plans to introduce legislation to implement these reforms in early 2024. The PRA consulted on complementary reforms to HM Treasury's proposals in 2023 and, separately, conducted a review of its ringfencing rules in compliance with its statutory duty under FSMA to do so every five years. The PRA announced in early 2024 that it intends to consult on targeted reforms to its ring-fencing rules as a result of its review, although the overall conclusion was that most of those rules are performing satisfactorily.\n\nUS regulation places further substantive limits on the activities that may be conducted by banks and holding companies, including foreign banking organisations such as the Group. The 'Volcker Rule', which was part of the DFA and which came into effect in the US in 2015, prohibits banking entities from undertaking certain proprietary trading activities and limits such entities' ability to sponsor or invest in certain private equity funds and hedge funds (in each case broadly defined). As required by the rule, the Group has developed and implemented an extensive compliance and monitoring programme addressing proprietary trading and covered fund activities (both inside and outside of the US).\n\n## Market infrastructure regulation\n\nIn recent years, regulators as well as global-standard setting bodies such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have focused on improving transparency and reducing risk in markets, particularly risks related to over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transactions. This focus has resulted in a variety of new regulations across the G20 countries and beyond that require or",

MiFID II is currently undergoing a review process in the EU as part of the EU's ongoing focus on the development of a stronger Capital Markets Union. In the UK, FSMA 2023 introduced reforms to remove certain requirements which were previously applicable to trading in wholesale markets and to promote investment in line with the Wholesale Markets Review. Other changes proposed by the review are being progressed by way of amendments to regulatory rules and guidance.\n\n## Regulation of benchmarks\n\nThe EU and UK Benchmarks Regulation apply to the administration, contribution and use of benchmarks within the EU and the UK, respectively. Financial institutions within the EU or the UK, as applicable, are prohibited from using benchmarks unless their administrators are authorised, registered or otherwise recognised in the EU or the UK, respectively. This prohibition does not currently apply in respect of third country benchmark administrators, as the prohibition on usage of such benchmarks will take effect from the end of 2025 (EU) and 2030 (UK). The FCA has also been working to phase out use of LIBOR, with all LIBOR panels now having ended. Synthetic versions of GBP and USD LIBOR have been made available only for a limited period of time for holders of legacy contracts. Global regulators in conjunction with the industry have developed and are continuing to develop alternative benchmarks and riskfree rate fallback arrangements, including updates to existing, as well as new, applicable legislation.\n\n## Regulation of the derivatives market\n\nThe European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) introduced requirements designed to improve transparency and reduce the risks associated with the derivatives market. EMIR has operational and financial impacts on the Group, including by imposing collateral requirements and a requirement to centrally clear certain OTC derivatives contracts on a broad range of market participants. Access to the clearing services of certain Central Counterparties\n\n(CCPs) used by Group entities is currently permitted under temporary equivalence and recognition regimes and decisions in the UK and EU. If not extended or made permanent, the EU's equivalence decision for UK Central Counterparties (CCPs), and exemption for certain intragroup transactions from the EMIR derivatives clearing and margin obligations, both due to expire at the end of June 2025, could also have operational and financial impacts on the Group, as could the removal of temporary recognition of non-UK CCPs by the UK. The EU has introduced two legislative proposals to amend EMIR which introduce, inter alia, changes to the intragroup transactions exemption making it easier to rely on the exemption, as well as aiming to reduce the concentration of exposures to systemically important thirdcountry central counterparties (in particular, UK Central Counterparties). The legislative process is ongoing.\n\nUS regulators have imposed similar rules as in the EU with respect to the mandatory on-venue trading and clearing of certain derivatives, and post-trade transparency, as well as in relation to the margining of OTC derivatives. In December 2017, the CFTC and the European Commission recognised the trading venues of each other's jurisdiction to allow market participants to comply with mandatory onvenue trading requirements while trading on certain venues recognised by the other jurisdiction. In December 2022, the CFTC extended temporary relief that would permit trading venues and market participants located in the UK to continue to rely on this mutual recognition framework following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.\n\nCertain participants in US swap markets are required to register with the CFTC as 'swap dealers' or 'major swap participants' and/or, with the SEC as 'security-based swap dealers' or 'major security-based swap participants'. Such registrants are subject to CFTC and/or SEC regulation and oversight. Barclays Bank PLC is provisionally registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and conditionally registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer. In addition, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is provisionally registered as a Swap Dealer with the CFTC.\n\nAccordingly, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC are both subject to CFTC rules on business conduct, record-keeping and reporting, and Barclays Bank PLC is subject to SEC rules on business conduct, record-keeping and reporting. However, since Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC are\n\nnon-US swap dealers, they are only subject to certain of the CFTC's requirements in respect of swap transactions with US persons and certain persons guaranteed by or affiliated with US persons. In addition, since Barclays Bank PLC is a non-US security-based swap dealer, it is only subject to certain of the SEC's requirements in respect of security-based swap transactions with US persons or which are arranged, negotiated, or executed by US personnel. Additionally, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC have elected to comply with certain CFTC/SEC requirements, as applicable, through 'substituted compliance' with EU/UK requirements pursuant to relevant determinations and related relief issued by the SEC and the CFTC, as applicable.\n\nBarclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC are subject to FRB rules on capital and margin.\n\nIn 2022, the SEC proposed new rules that would require any person with a securitybased swap position (aggregated across all affiliated persons) that exceeds any of the thresholds specified by the SEC to promptly report certain information by the next business day, including the identity of the reporting person and the securitybased swap position, as well as the ownership of securities positions related to the security-based swap position. Such reports would be available publicly. If adopted as proposed, this rule could increase the burden and cost to Barclays Bank PLC of utilising security-based swaps.\n\n## Other regulatory developments in the US\n\nIn 2023, the SEC finalised amendments to shorten the standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions in securities from two business days after the trade (T+2) to one business day after the trade (T+1), which requires significant changes to BCI's settlement procedures and practices, and  introduced new rules requiring market-wide improvements in the rate of same-day affirmations and on central matching service providers.\n\nOn 13 October 2023, the SEC adopted new rules to establish broad reporting requirements of the terms of securities loans to FINRA for public dissemination, and requiring FINRA to make publicly available certain information it receives regarding those lending transactions.\n\nOn 13 October 2023, the SEC adopted new rules requiring a wide range of firms to file monthly reports with the SEC for large short positions in equity securities on a",

These rule amendments could impose additional costs on the Group's Treasury securities trading activity.\n\nThe SEC has also put forth a number of other recent proposals that, if adopted, could have a significant impact on the Group's business and operations, including a series of market structure proposals which would have a significant impact on securities trading activity by BCI and other Group entities, as the SEC proposals would (a) impose a new SEC best execution obligation on securities broker-dealers, including BCI, (b) require that certain individual investor orders be exposed to auctions before they could be executed internally by certain trading centres, and (c) amend certain rules under Regulation NMS (National Market System) to adopt variable minimum pricing increments, reduce access fee caps for protected quotations, require that the amount of exchange fees and rebates be determinable at the time of execution, and update and expand to certain broker-dealers the disclosures required for order executions in NMS stocks, among other changes.\n\n## Other regulation\n\n## Consumer protection, culture, and diversity and inclusion\n\nIn July 2023, the FCA's new Consumer Duty came into force for new and existing products or services that are open to sale or renewal. It will apply to closed products and services from 31 July 2024. The duty sets higher expectations for the standard of care that firms provide to retail customers and impacts all aspects of\n\nBarclays' retail businesses, including every retail customer journey, product and service as well as our relationships with partners, suppliers and third parties. This has resulted in significant implementation costs and there will also be higher ongoing costs for the industry as a result of extensive monitoring and evidential requirements.\n\nOur regulators have enhanced their focus on the promotion of cultural values as a key area for banks. The UK regulators have also begun focusing on diversity and inclusion in financial services firms, with the PRA and FCA having published a consultation on the introduction of a new regulatory framework on diversity and inclusion in September 2023. The UK regulators expect to publish final rules on this issue in 2024.\n\nFSMA 2023 contains provisions mandating that the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) require the reimbursement of authorised push payment scams by payment service providers, including Barclays. This reimbursement requirement will be split 50:50 between the sending and receiving firms. Changes to the rules of the Faster Payments Scheme and a new Specific Direction issued by the PSR to require reimbursement will take effect in October 2024.\n\n## Data protection\n\nMost jurisdictions where the Group operates have adopted or are considering comprehensive laws concerning data protection and privacy. Regulations regarding data protection are increasing in number, as well as levels of enforcement, as manifested in increased amounts of fines and the severity of other penalties. We expect that personal privacy and data protection will continue to receive attention and focus from regulators, as well as public scrutiny and attention.\n\nThe EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the UK's General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) provide a framework of rights and duties designed to safeguard personal data and apply to the activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the UK, respectively. The extraterritorial effect of the GDPR and the UK GDPR means entities established outside the EU or the UK may fall within the GDPR or the UK GDPR's ambit when offering goods or services to EU/UK based customers or clients or conducting behavioural monitoring of individuals in the EU/UK. The Data Protection and Digital Information (No.2) Bill was introduced to the UK Parliament in March 2023, which if enacted\n\nwill bring some divergence between the EU GDPR and UK GDPR. The UK government has indicated that it expects the Bill to become law in mid-2024, although there is still some uncertainty on timing and content.\n\nThe data regime in China is likely to continue to evolve, governing the collection, processing and cross-border transfers of China-based individuals' personal data and related restricted data (e.g., macro/derived characteristics data which, if tampered with, divulged or destroyed, may endanger China's economic operation, social stability, national security - among other things having regard to the volume and granularity of the data). In India, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, may be implemented in phases during 2024 and beyond. Except under certain exemptions, its scope would include the processing of personal data in India and would extend to the profiling of, and offering goods and services to, India-based individuals outside of India. As the global data protection regulatory landscape develops, noncompliance with any such requirements and rules could lead to regulatory fines and other penalties.\n\nIn the US, Barclays Bank Delaware is subject to the US Federal Gramm-LeachBliley Act (GLBA) and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, which amended the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and came into effect on 1 January 2023 (CPRA). The GLBA limits the use and disclosure of non-public personal information to non-affiliated third parties, and requires financial institutions to provide written notice of their privacy policies and practices and implement certain information security policies and practices. Any violations of the GLBA could subject Barclays Bank Delaware to additional reporting requirements or regulatory investigation or audits by the financial regulators. More broadly, the Group's US operations are subject to the CPRA which applies to personal information that is not collected, processed, sold or disclosed subject to the GLBA. The CPRA requires applicable members of the Group to both provide California residents with additional disclosures regarding the collection, use and sharing of personal information and grant California residents access, deletion, correction and other rights, including the right to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information and the right to limit the processing of sensitive personal information to certain purposes. Any violations of the CPRA may be subject",

Bills proposed in the United States Congress and in the legislatures of various US states, if enacted, may have further impact on the data privacy practices of Barclays' US operations. In addition, all 50 states have laws including obligations to provide notification of security breaches of computer databases that contain personal information to affected individuals, state officers and others.\n\n## Cybersecurity and operational resilience\n\nRegulators globally continue to focus on cybersecurity risk management, organisational operational resilience and overall soundness across all financial services firms, with customer and market expectations of uninterrupted access to financial services remaining at an all-time high.\n\nThe regulatory focus has been further heightened by the increasing number of high-profile ransomware and other supply chain attacks seen across the industry in recent years and the growing reliance of financial services on Cloud and other third party service providers. This is evidenced by the continuing introduction of new laws and regulatory frameworks directed at enhancing resilience of both firms and their critical third party providers. A new UK framework introduced in March 2021 requires firms to be able to remain within impact tolerances set for their important business services, in severe but plausible disruption scenarios such as a cyber attack, by no later than 31 March 2025. FSMA 2023 introduced a new regime for designated critical third party providers, and in 2023 the FCA and PRA issued a consultation on proposed rules and guidance for supervising the resilience of critical third party providers.\n\nThe EU's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) entered into force in January 2023 and will apply in early 2025 (after a twoyear implementation period), introducing comprehensive and sector specific regulation on Information Communication Technologies (ICT) incident reporting, testing and third party risk management, and providing for direct oversight of critical third party providers servicing the EU financial services sector. The existing and anticipated requirements for increased controls will serve to improve industry standardisation and resilience capabilities,\n\nenhancing our ability to deliver services during periods of potential disruption. However, such measures are likely to result in increased technology and compliance costs for the Group.\n\nIn 2023, the SEC finalised disclosure rules regarding cybersecurity risk management, governance and incident reporting by USlisted companies, including foreign private issuers such as Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC. The new rules require foreign private issuers to annually disclose the policies and procedures relied upon to identify and manage cybersecurity risks, including risk management strategy and whether any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the issuer, its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC must annually describe Barclays' board of directors' oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats, the board committee responsible for the oversight of such risks, and the processes by which the board or such committee is informed thereof; and details of management's expertise and role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. If Barclays PLC or Barclays Bank PLC are required or determine to disclose material cybersecurity incidents under home country or stock exchange rules, they are required to also furnish this information with the SEC on the SEC's website, in accordance with their obligations as foreign private issuers.\n\nSimilarly, NYDFS amended its cybersecurity regulation applying to the New York Branch of Barclays Bank PLC. The NYDFS's amended cybersecurity regulation contains significant updates, including enhanced notification requirements, cybersecurity governance obligations, and requirements applicable to cybersecurity policies and procedures (e.g., encryption and multi-factor authentication, business continuity and incident response plans, and vulnerability management).\n\n## Regulatory initiatives on ESG disclosure\n\nThe EU Regulation on Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR) and related Delegated Regulations require financial market participants (FMPs) to disclose how they integrate environmental, social and governance factors in their investment decisions for certain financial products and to publish principal adverse impact statements. The SFDR applies to entities established in the EU and in-scope\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproducts marketed in the EU, regardless of the location of the entity. The SFDR is currently under review by the Commission. In addition, the EU Taxonomy Regulation provides for a general framework for the development of an EU-wide classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. It sets mandatory entity-level disclosure requirements for companies which fall under the scope of the EU Accounting Directive, in relation to eligibility and alignment of their business activities with the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The EU Taxonomy Regulation also imposes product level disclosure obligations for FMPs on the extent to which their financial products are Taxonomy aligned or not. The taxonomy, and with it the Taxonomy Regulation, is under review to include further sectors and, for example, social elements.\n\nThe EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive will introduce sustainability related reporting obligations for various entities, including EU banks and certain non-EU companies and banks (by virtue of having EU listings or significant business in the EU), with reporting to commence on a phased basis from the financial year 2024. Related technical sustainability reporting standards have been developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group.\n\nThe second EU Capital Requirements Regulation established, for certain large financial institutions, a Pillar 3 disclosure framework for information on environmental, social and governance risks, including physical risks and transition risks. Amendments proposed by the CRR III and CRD VI banking package will extend the scope of these disclosures and the emphasis on ESG. The ECB has made, and continues to regard, the supervision of the approach of institutions to ESG risk a priority.\n\nIn December 2023, the European Council and Parliament institutions reached political agreement on the Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence, which will require EU firms, and certain non-EU firms, including financial institutions, to carry out due diligence with regard to their own operations and companies in their upstream value chain, in order to identify and prevent, bring to an end or mitigate the adverse impact of their activities on human rights and the environment. Firms will also be required to establish a climate change transition plan. These obligations are expected to come into force on a phased basis from the second half of 2027, at the earliest.",

Currently, the new anti-greenwashing rule (and associated guidance) is due to apply from 31 May 2024, whilst the rest of the changes will take effect on a phased basis, beginning in the second half of 2024.  The UK Government has expressed its intention to consider how best to incorporate the Taskforce on Naturerelated Financial Disclosures framework for nature-related risk management and disclosures into UK legislation and to consult on introducing Transition Plan Taskforce Disclosure Framework (TPT Framework) related requirements for the UK's largest companies. The Government is also progressing plans to endorse UK Sustainability Disclosure Standards based on the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) sustainability reporting standards (IFRS S1 on general requirements for sustainability disclosures and IFRS S2 on climate disclosures) for use in the UK by July 2024.  The FCA plans to consult in 2024 on incorporating provisions relating to the ISSB standards and TPT Framework into its Handbook. Additionally, TCFD-aligned reporting requirements apply to UK publicly quoted companies, large private companies and LLPs (in addition to existing TCFD-related reporting requirements under the Listing Rules).\n\nIn the UK, the UK Government has confirmed its intention to develop a UK Green Taxonomy, and the Green Technical Advisory Group continues to publish advice and reports on the development of a Green Taxonomy. Reporting against the Taxonomy will form part of the UK's new Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR). Certain companies will be required to disclose which portion of their activities are Taxonomy-aligned. The structure of the Taxonomy is expected to draw on the EU approach and has six environmental objectives (climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control and protection and restoration of biodiversity).\n\nIn March 2022, the SEC proposed climate related-disclosure requirements for USlisted companies (which would include Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC) that would, among other things, require disclosure of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, with certain emissions disclosures subject to thirdparty attestation requirements; climaterelated scenario analysis (if the issuer conducts scenario analysis), together with qualitative and quantitative information about the hypothetical future climate scenarios used in its analysis; climate transition plans or climate-related targets or goals, along with disclosure of progress against any such plans, targets or goals; climate-related risks over the short-, medium- and long-term; qualitative and quantitative information regarding climate-related risks and historical impacts in audited financial statements; corporate governance of climate-related risks; and climate-related risk-management processes. In addition, bills proposed or adopted by the legislatures of certain US states may impose additional or stricter climate related-disclosure requirements on businesses operating in such US states. For example, in October 2023, California adopted the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (SB-253) and the Greenhouse Gases: Climate-Related Financial Risk bill (SB-261) which are expected to apply commencing in 2026. Barclays is monitoring such legislative developments and their impact on Barclays' US operations and reporting obligations.\n\n## Sanctions and financial crime\n\nThe UK Bribery Act 2010 introduced a new form of corporate criminal liability focused broadly on a company's failure to prevent bribery on its behalf. The Criminal Finances Act 2017 introduced new corporate criminal offences of failing to prevent the facilitation of UK and overseas tax evasion. In 2023, the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 became law. This creates a new offence of failing to prevent a person associated with the Group from committing fraud for the benefit of the Group. These pieces of legislation have broad application and in certain circumstances may have extraterritorial impact on entities, persons or activities located outside the UK, including Barclays PLC's subsidiaries outside the UK.\n\nThe UK Bribery Act requires the Group to have adequate procedures to prevent bribery which, due to the extraterritorial nature of the Act, makes this both complex and costly. Additionally, the Criminal Finances Act requires the Group to have reasonable procedures in place to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion by persons acting for, or on behalf of, the Group. The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act similarly requires the Group to have reasonable procedures in place to prevent a person associated with the Group from committing fraud.\n\nThe Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (the Sanctions Act) became law in the UK in 2018. Following the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the Sanctions Act allowed for the adoption of an autonomous UK sanctions regime which came into force in 2021, as well as a more flexible licensing regime post-Brexit. This regime applies within the UK and in relation to the conduct of all UK persons wherever they are in the world; it also applies to overseas branches of UK companies (including the Barclays Bank PLC New York branch).\n\nWithin the EU, there is a system of autonomous sanctions by which the European Council adopts a decision made by the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. The measures stated in the Council decision are either implemented at the EU level, by way of Regulation, or at a national level in Member States. Regulations are binding and directly effective throughout the EU. Each measure will specify the territorial scope of the relevant sanctions but these can apply broadly within the territory of any EU Member States and to EU nationals wherever they are located as well as to third country branches of EU companies. The EU enforces its antimoney laundering regime through the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (EU) 2015/849 and the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (EU) 2018/849 with further changes being proposed through the Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and a package of further reforms currently under discussion.",

In addition, the Group is subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits, among other things, corrupt payments to foreign government officials. It is also subject to various economic sanctions laws, regulations and executive orders administered by the US government, which prohibit or restrict some or all business activities and other dealings with or involving certain individuals, entities, groups, countries and territories.\n\nIn some cases, US state and federal regulations addressing sanctions, money laundering and other financial crimes may impact entities, persons or activities located or undertaken outside the US, including Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries. US government authorities have aggressively enforced these laws against financial institutions in recent years.\n\nAs a result of the conflict in Ukraine, there has been an increased regulatory focus on sanctions compliance in various jurisdictions, including the US, UK and EU.\n\nFailure of a financial institution to ensure compliance with such laws could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the institution.\n\nFinancial statements",

Cash collateral and settlement balances decreased by \u00a33.7bn to \u00a3108.9bn.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through the income statement decreased \u00a36.9bn to \u00a3206.7bn driven by increased secured lending being more than offset by trade optimisations.\n\n## Total liabilities\n\nTotal liabilities decreased \u00a338.8bn to \u00a31,405.6bn.\n\nDeposits  at amortised cost to banks and customers decreased \u00a37.0bn to \u00a3538.8bn driven by a reduction in customer deposits reflecting broader market trends in Barclays UK, partially offset by an increase in short-term money market deposits and growth in customer deposits in Barclays International.\n\nRepurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing at amortised cost increased \u00a314.5bn to \u00a341.6bn driven by increased secured borrowing.\n\nDebt securities in issue decreased \u00a316.1bn to \u00a396.8bn driven by maturities.\n\nDerivative financial instrument liabilities decreased \u00a339.6bn to \u00a3250.0bn driven by lower market volatility. Cash collateral and settlement balances decreased by \u00a32.8bn to \u00a394.1bn.\n\nTrading portfolio liabilities decreased \u00a314.3bn to \u00a358.7bn driven by decreases in equity securities as clients repositioned their demand.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value increased \u00a325.9bn to \u00a3297.5bn driven by increased repurchase agreements and prime brokerage deposits.\n\n## Total shareholders' equity\n\nTotal shareholders' equity increased \u00a32.6bn to \u00a371.9bn.\n\nOther equity instruments remained at \u00a313.3bn as the issuance of three AT1 instruments (\u00a31.50bn, $1.8bn and SGD400m) was offset by two redemptions (\u00a31.3bn and $2.5bn).  AT1 securities are perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities structured to qualify as AT1 instruments under prevailing capital rules applicable as at the relevant issue date.\n\nOther reserves increased by \u00a32.1bn, mainly due to an increase in the cash flow hedging reserve of \u00a33.5bn to \u00a33.7bn debit, as a result of fair value movements on interest rate swaps held for hedging purposes due to an decrease in major interest rate curves.  This was partially offset by an decrease in the currency translation reserve of \u00a31.1bn to \u00a33.7bn, driven by the appreciation of GBP against USD.\n\nRetained earnings increased \u00a30.9bn to \u00a353.7bn, mainly due to profits of \u00a34.3bn, offset by share repurchases of \u00a31.3bn and dividends of \u00a31.2bn.\n\nTangible net asset value per share  increased to 331p (December 2022: 295p) including: EPS of 27.7p, positive cash flow hedge reserve movements of 22p, and 8p from the reduction in share count following share buybacks of \u00a31.25bn completed in 2023. This was partially offset by an 8p reduction from dividends paid during 2023 and net negative other reserve movements.\n\nFinancial\n\nreview\n\nFinancial statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Net interest income  increased 9% to \u00a36,431m with a net interest margin of 3.13% (2022: 2.86%), as higher interest rates and associated structural hedge benefit outweighed mortgage margin pressure and adverse deposit dynamics reflecting wider market trends. Net fee, commission and other income decreased 15% to \u00a31,156m including the impact of the transfer of WM&I to CC&P.\n\n- \u00b7 Personal Banking income increased 4% to \u00a34,729m, driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by mortgage margin compression and movements in deposit volumes and mix resulting from cost of living pressures and customers searching for yield.\n- \u00b7 Barclaycard Consumer UK income decreased 12% to \u00a3964m as higher customer spend volumes were more than offset by lower interest earning lending balances following repayments and ongoing prudent risk management.\n- \u00b7 Business Banking income increased 16% to \u00a31,894m driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by lower government scheme lending as repayments continue and lower deposit volumes.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 2% to \u00a34,415m, including \u00a3168m impact from Q423 structural cost actions. Excluding the impact of Q423 structural cost actions, operating expenses decreased 2%, driven by the transfer of WM&I to CC&P partially offset by the impact of inflation and the acquisition of KMC. Ongoing efficiency savings continue to be reinvested, including in our transformation programme to support sustainable improvement to the cost: income ratio over the longer term.\n\nCredit impairment charges increased to \u00a3304m (2022: \u00a3286m), consistent with low delinquencies in UK cards and a high quality mortgage lending portfolio. UK cards 30 and 90 day arrears remained low at 0.9% (Q422: 0.9%) and 0.2% (Q422: 0.2%) respectively. The UK cards total coverage ratio was 6.8% (December 2022: 7.6%).\n\nLoans and advances to customers at amortised cost decreased by 1% to \u00a3202.8bn (December 2022: \u00a3205.1bn), primarily reflecting continued repayment of government scheme lending in Business Banking, subdued mortgage lending amid lower market demand, partially offset by the acquisition of KMC.\n\nCustomer deposits at amortised cost decreased 7% to \u00a3241.1bn (December 2022: \u00a3258.0bn). Primarily driven by reduced current account balances in Personal and Business Banking, reflecting broader market trends. The loan: deposit ratio increased to 92% (December 2022: 87%).\n\nRWAs increased to \u00a373.5bn (December 2022: \u00a373.1bn), primarily due to the acquisition of KMC, broadly offset by reduction across lending portfolios.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

Gross structural hedge contributions of \u00a33,623m (2022: \u00a32,196m) and net structural hedge contributions of \u00a3(8,209)m (2022: \u00a3(1,544)m) are included in Group net interest income. Gross structural hedge contributions represent the absolute interest income earned from the fixed receipts on the swaps in the structural hedge, while the net structural hedge contributions represent the net interest earned on the difference between the structural hedge rate and prevailing floating rates.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

Our opinion is unmodified\n\n## In our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements of Barclays PLC give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Parent Company's affairs as at 31 December 2023, and of the Group's and the Parent Company's profit for the year then ended;\n- \u00b7 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UKadopted international accounting standards as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006;\n- \u00b7 the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## What our opinion covers\n\nWe have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements of Barclays PLC for the year ended 31 December 2023 (FY23) included in the Annual Report and Accounts, which comprise:\n\n## Group (Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries)\n\n- \u00b7 Consolidated income statement\n- \u00b7 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income\n- \u00b7 Consolidated balance sheet\n- \u00b7 Consolidated statement of changes in equity\n- \u00b7 Consolidated cash flow statement\n- \u00b7 Notes 1 to 43 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the summary of material accounting policies\n\n## Parent Company (Barclays PLC)\n\n- \u00b7 Statement of comprehensive income\n- \u00b7 Balance sheet\n- \u00b7 Statement of changes in equity\n- \u00b7 Cash flow statement\n- \u00b7 Note 42 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the summary of material accounting policies\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ('ISAs (UK)') and applicable law.  Our responsibilities are described below.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.  Our audit opinion and matters included in this report are consistent with those discussed and included in our reporting to the Board Audit Committee ('BAC').\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\n## 2. Overview of our audit\n\n## Factors driving our view of risks\n\nFollowing our FY22 audit and considering developments affecting the Barclays PLC Group since then, we have updated our risk assessment.\n\nThe macro-economic environment continues to drive our risk assessment as general economic uncertainty has led to sustained affordability pressures associated with rising inflation and interest rates.\n\nThis economic uncertainty and change has brought both pressures and opportunities. The higher interest rate environment has provided an uplift to net interest income, and has driven increased competition for deposits.\n\nLower market volatility and reduced client activity have created a challenging environment within the Corporate and Investment Bank, resulting in lower income for FY23.\n\nAs part of our risk assessment, we have maintained our focus on future economic assumptions used by the Group in its key estimates both at the year end and, where relevant, on a forward-looking basis.\n\nOur risk assessment also considered instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations (including open enforcement actions against the Group) and specifically those that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements. We considered\n\nmanagement's assessment of how these occurred and their assessment of whether the risk could be more pervasive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Key Audit Matters                                                                                                       | Item   | Item   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Impairment allowance on  loans and advances at  amortised cost, including off- balance sheet elements of the  allowance | &      | 4.1    |\n| Valuation of financial  instruments held at fair value                                                                  | 1      | 4.2    |\n| Valuation of gross defined  benefit pension obligation in  respect of the UK retirement  fund ('UKRF')                  | 1      | 4.3    |\n| User access management                                                                                                  | 1      | 4.4    |\n| Recoverability of Parent  Company's investment  in subsidiaries                                                         | 1      | 4.5    |\n| Similar risk to FY22                                                                                                    | 1      |        |\n| Increased risk since FY22                                                                                               | &      |        |\n\n## Our use of specialists and innovation\n\nUsing the work of specialists and specific team members with expertise in a specialised area of accounting or\n\nauditing: We used our specialists and specific team members with expertise in a specialised area of accounting or auditing to assist us in various aspects of our audit.

        "page_content": "## KPMG LLP's independent auditor's report to the members of Barclays PLC (continued)\n\n## Incorporating unpredictability into our\n\naudit: A requirement of the auditing standards is that we undertake procedures which are deliberately unexpected and could not have reasonably been predicted by Barclays' management.  As an example, we update our criteria for selecting journals with a higher risk of management override each year so that the selection criteria do not become predictable. Outside of journals, for a selection of fair value financial instruments, we performed intramonth independent re-pricing to incorporate an element of unpredictability in our audit procedures.\n\nInnovation in the audit: Our audit is committed to driving innovation and the increased use of technology. In 2023 we have continued to deploy a large number of data and analytics tools across our audit. We have also continued to innovate our audit of valuation of financial instruments, by using the Digital Media Analytics tool to gather market news and data for key principal investments and leveraged finance exposures for consideration as part of our risk assessment procedures.\n\n## Board Audit Committee ('BAC') interaction\n\nDuring the year, the BAC met 11 times. KPMG are invited to attend all BAC meetings and are provided an opportunity to meet with the BAC in private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out communications with the BAC in section 4, including matters that required particular judgement for each.\n\nIn addition, our audit team includes a senior partner who has specific responsibility for ensuring audit quality (our 'Audit Quality Partner'). The Board Audit Committee met with the Audit Quality Partner twice in the year to receive a report on his assessment of audit quality. The Board Audit Committee also met with KPMG's Head of Audit Quality who provided an update on the initiatives KPMG is taking to sustain high levels of audit quality.\n\nThe matters included in the BAC Chair's report on page 166 are materially consistent with our observations of those meetings.\n\nIn addition, KPMG are invited to attend the Board Risk Committee meetings.\n\n## Our independence\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\nApart from the matters noted below, we have not performed any non-audit services during the year ended 31 December 2023 or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard. We have identified that a KPMG member firm has provided preparation of local financial statements services over the period 2018 to 2023. That member firm had no involvement in the group audit of Barclays PLC. The services, which have been terminated, were administrative in nature and did not involve any management decision-making or bookkeeping. The work was undertaken after the group audit opinion was signed by KPMG LLP for each of the related financial years and had no direct or indirect effect on Barclays PLC's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our professional judgment, we confirm that based on our assessment of the breach, our integrity and objectivity as auditor has not been compromised and we believe that an objective, reasonable and informed third party would conclude that the provision of these services would not impair our integrity or objectivity for any of the impacted financial years. The Board Audit Committee concurred with this view.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2017. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the seven financial years ended 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Group lead engagement partner is required to rotate after five years. This is the second set of UK Financial Statements that Stuart Crisp has signed and he will be required to rotate after the FY26 audit.\n\nThe average tenure of key audit partners who are responsible for component audits, as set out in section 7 below, is two years, with the shortest being their first year of involvement and longest being five years.\n\n| Total audit fee                               | \u00a364m             |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Other audit related fees                      | \u00a312m             |\n| Other services                                | \u00a32m              |\n| Date first appointed                          | 31 March 2017    |\n| Uninterrupted audit tenure                    | 7 years          |\n| Next financial period which requires a tender | 31 December 2027 |\n| Tenure of Group lead engagement partner       | 2 years          |\n| Average tenure of key audit partners          | 2 years          |",

For FY23, we adjusted PBT for items which do not represent the normal, continuing operations of the Group. As such, for FY23 we based our materiality on normalised profit before tax of \u00a37,484m, of which it represents 4.7% (FY22: 3.9%).\n\nMateriality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a3170m (2022: \u00a3100m), which is the component materiality for the parent company determined by the group audit engagement team. This is lower than the materiality we would otherwise have determined with reference to a benchmark of net assets of which it represents 0.3% (FY22: 0.2%).\n\n## Normalised profit before tax \u00a37,484m\n\n(2022 PBT: \u00a37,012m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group scope\n\n## (Item 7 below)\n\nWe have performed risk assessment and planning procedures to determine which of the Group's components are likely to include risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, the type of procedures to be performed at these components and the extent of involvement required from component auditors around the world for the purpose of our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe have also considered the extent to which the Group has established central hubs in shared service centre structures in India. The outputs from these hubs are included in the financial information of the reporting components and so the India operations are not considered to be a separate component.\n\nWe have performed certain audit procedures centrally across the Group, set out in more detail in Section 7. In addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\nWe consider the scope of our audit, as communicated to the Board Audit Committee, to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinion.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Coverage of Group financial statements\n\n## Group total income*\n\n- n 2023 Full scope audit\n- n 2023 Audit of account balances\n- n 2023 Specific audit procedures\n- n 2023 Other risk assessment procedures\n- n 2022 Full scope audit\n- n 2022 Audit of account balances\n- n 2022 Other risk assessment procedures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group total assets*\n\n- n 2023 Full scope audit\n- n 2023 Audit of account balances\n- n 2023 Specific audit procedures\n- n 2023 Other risk assessment procedures\n- n 2022 Full scope audit\n- n 2022 Audit of account balances\n- n 2022 Other risk assessment procedures\n\n## Note\n\n- * Percentage of Group total income and assets over which we performed full scope audit or audit of account balances\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## KPMG LLP's independent auditor's report to the members of Barclays PLC (continued)\n\n## The impact of climate change on our audit\n\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the potential impact of risks arising from climate change on the Group's business and its financial statements. The Group has set out its ambition under the Paris Accord to be a net zero bank by 2050. Further information is provided in the Group's Climate and Sustainability report, which has been incorporated into the 2023 Annual Report on pages 59 -129.\n\nClimate change risks, opportunities and the Group's own commitments and changing regulations could have a significant impact on the Group's business and operations. There is the possibility that climate change risks, both physical and transitional, could affect financial statement balances, through estimates such as credit risk and market risk. There is enhanced narrative in the Annual Report on climate matters.\n\nAs part of our audit we performed a risk assessment of the impact of climate change risk and the commitments made by the Group in respect of climate change on the financial statements and our audit approach. As a part of this we held discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment. In doing this we performed the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Understanding management's processes : we made enquiries to understand management's assessment of the potential impact of climate change risk on the Group's Annual Report and Accounts and the Group's preparedness for this. As a part of this we made enquiries to understand management's risk assessment process as it relates to possible effects of climate change on the Annual Report and Accounts including the way in which the accounting policies of the Group (including those relating to products with specific climate features) are updated to reflect climate change risks. We also read and discussed with management the quantitative analysis prepared by the Group to support its assessment of the impact of climate risk on credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Retail credit risk: we assessed how the Group considers the impact of physical risks on the valuation of mortgage collateral. Specifically, we performed data and analytic driven risk assessment procedures to understand the potential impact of flooding and subsidence on the valuation of mortgage collateral and made enquiries of management to understand how this is considered within their own collateral valuation process.\n- \u00b7 Corporate credit risk: we assessed how the Group considers the impact of climate risk on corporate counterparties through our individual loan assessments where, for performing counterparties, we assessed how climate change risk impacts certain counterparties within the commercial bank, including the impact on their credit rating as applicable. The focus of our procedures was on certain counterparties who operate in industries with greater exposure to climate risk - the energy, transportation, materials and buildings, agriculture, food and forest product sectors.\n- \u00b7 Market risk: as part of our risk assessment, we incorporated a consideration of the climate change impact on unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain financial instruments in elevated risk sectors including energy, metals and mining.\n- \u00b7 Annual report narrative: we made enquiries of management to understand the process by which climate related narrative is developed including the primary sources of data used and the governance process in place over the narrative. As a part of our risk assessment, we read the climate related information in the front half of the Annual Report and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOn the basis of the procedures performed above, we concluded that, while climate change posed a risk to the determination of asset values in the current year, the risk was not significant when we considered the nature of the assets and the relevant contractual terms.  As a result, there was no material impact from climate change on our key audit matters.\n\n## 3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease their operations, and they have concluded that the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position means that this is realistic.\n\nThey have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\n## Going concern\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group and Parent Company, the financial services industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to the business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and Parent Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and Parent Company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- \u00b7 the availability of funding and liquidity in the event of a market wide stress scenario; and\n- \u00b7 the impact on regulatory capital requirements in the event of an economic slowdown.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the availability of financial resources in the going concern period by comparing severe, but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial resources indicated by the Group's financial forecasts.\n\nOur procedures also included an assessment of whether the going concern disclosure in note 1 to the financial statements gives a complete and accurate description of the Directors' assessment of going concern.",

Key audit matters\n\n## What we mean\n\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on:\n\n- \u00b7 the overall audit strategy;\n- \u00b7 the allocation of resources in the audit; and\n- \u00b7 directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nWe include below the Key Audit Matters in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## 4.1 Impairment allowances on loans and advances at amortised cost, including off-balance sheet elements of the allowance\n\n| Financial Statement Elements                   | FY23   | FY22   | Our assessment of risk vs FY22                                                                           | Our results   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Impairment allowances on loans and advances    | \u00a36.3bn | \u00a36.2bn | &  Our assessment is that the risk has increased since FY22.                                             | FY23:         |\n| at amortised cost, including off-balance sheet |        |        | There is increased uncertainty arising from higher interest  rates and continued inflationary pressures. | Acceptable    |\n|                                                |        |        | There is increased uncertainty arising from higher interest  rates and continued inflationary pressures. | Acceptable    |\n\nDescription of the Key Audit Matter\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\n## Subjective estimate\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\nThe estimation of expected credit losses ('ECL') on financial instruments involves significant judgement and estimates. The key areas where we identified greater levels of management judgement and therefore increased levels of audit focus in the Group's estimation of ECL are:\n\n- \u00b7 Model estimations - Inherently judgemental modelling and assumptions are used to estimate ECL which involves determining Probability of Default ('PD'), Loss Given Default ('LGD'), and Exposure at Default ('EAD'). ECL may be inappropriate if certain models or underlying assumptions do not accurately predict defaults or recoveries over time, become out of line with wider industry experience, or fail to reflect the credit risk of financial assets. As a result, certain IFRS 9 models and model assumptions are the key drivers of complexity and uncertainty in the Group's calculation of the ECL estimate.\n- \u00b7 Economic scenarios - IFRS 9 requires the Group to measure ECL on an unbiased forward-looking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions. Significant management judgement is applied in determining the forward-looking economic scenarios used as an input to calculate ECL, the associated scenario probability weightings, and the key economic variables that drive the scenarios. There is also a high level of complexity of models used to derive the probability weightings.\n\nRisk assessment: We performed granular and detailed risk assessment procedures over the entirety of the loan and advances at amortised cost including off-balance sheet elements of the allowance within the Group's financial statements. As part of these risk assessment procedures, we identified the portfolios associated with a risk of material misstatement including those arising from significant judgements over the estimation of ECL either due to inputs, methods or assumptions.\n\nControls testing: We performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key systems, applications and controls used in the ECL processes. We tested the relevant manual, general IT and application controls over key systems used in the ECL process.\n\nKey aspects of our controls testing involved evaluating the design and implementation and testing the operating effectiveness of the key controls over the:\n\n- \u00b7 completeness and accuracy of the key inputs into the IFRS 9 impairment models;\n- \u00b7 application of the staging criteria;\n- \u00b7 model validation, implementation and monitoring;\n- \u00b7 completeness, authorisation and calculation of post model adjustments and management overlays;\n- \u00b7 selection and implementation of economic variables and the controls over the economic scenario selection and probabilities; and\n- \u00b7 credit reviews that determine customer risk ratings for a population of wholesale customers, including a risk-based selection.\n\nOur credit risk modelling expertise: We involved our own credit risk modellers who assisted in the following:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the Group's impairment methodologies for compliance with IFRS 9;\n- \u00b7 inspecting model code for the calculation of certain components of the ECL model to assess its consistency with the Group's model methodology;\n- \u00b7 evaluating whether model changes (including updated model code), for a selection of models which were changed or updated during the year, were appropriate by assessing the updated model methodology against the applicable accounting standard;\n- \u00b7 reperforming the calculation of certain adjustments to assess consistency with the qualitative adjustment methodologies;\n- \u00b7 assessing and reperforming, for a selection of models, the reasonableness of the model predictions by comparing them against actual results and evaluating the resulting differences;\n- \u00b7 evaluating the model output for a selection of models by inspecting the corresponding model functionality and independently implementing the model by rebuilding the model code and comparing our independent output with management's output; and\n- \u00b7 independently recalculating a selection of model assumptions using more recent data for certain portfolios. This is used to develop a range for ECL which is compared to management's point estimate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They represent approximately 6.1% of the ECL. These adjustments are inherently uncertain and significant management judgement is involved in identifying and estimating certain post model adjustments ('PMA's') and management overlays.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the impairment of loans and advances to customers including off-balance sheet elements of the allowance has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The credit risk sections of the financial statements (pages 291-335) disclose the sensitivities estimated by the Group.\n\n## Disclosure quality\n\nThe disclosures regarding the Group's application of IFRS 9 are key to explaining the key judgements and material inputs to the IFRS 9 ECL results.\n\n## Communications with the Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Board Audit Committee included:\n\n- \u00b7 The effectiveness of the control environment operating over the calculation of the ECL provisions;\n- \u00b7 The determination and utilisation of judgemental post model adjustments recognised;\n- \u00b7 Model monitoring results and adjustments made;\n- \u00b7 Management's economic forecast and associated scenario probability weights; and\n- \u00b7 The disclosures made to explain ECL, including explaining the resulting estimation uncertainty.\n\nOur economics expertise: We involved our own economic specialists who assisted us in:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing the reasonableness of the Group's methodology and models for determining the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings applied to them;\n- \u00b7 assessing key economic variables which included comparing samples of economic variables to external sources;\n- \u00b7 assessing the overall reasonableness of the economic forecasts by comparing the Group's forecasts to our own modelled forecasts; and\n- \u00b7 assessing the reasonableness of the Group's qualitative adjustments by challenging key economic assumptions applied in their calculation based on external sources.\n\nOther test of details: Key aspects of our testing in addition to those set out above involved:\n\n- \u00b7 sample testing over key inputs into the ECL calculations;\n- \u00b7 selecting a sample of post model adjustments, considering the size and complexity of management overlays, to assess the reasonableness of the adjustments by challenging key assumptions, inspecting the calculation methodology and tracing a sample of the data used back to source data;\n- \u00b7 assessing the completeness of post model adjustments identified based on our knowledge gained from other risk-assessment and substantive audit procedures; and\n- \u00b7 selecting a sample of credit reviews to assess the reasonableness of customer risk ratings by challenging key judgements and considering disconfirming or contradictory evidence.\n\nAssessing transparency: We assessed whether the disclosures appropriately disclose and address the uncertainty which exists when determining the ECL. In addition, we assessed whether the disclosure of the key judgements and assumptions was sufficiently clear.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:\n\n- \u00b7 The appropriateness of the model estimations and qualitative adjustments recorded to the model driven ECL calculations to reflect the current economic environment.\n\n## Our results\n\nBased on the risk identified and our procedures performed we considered the impairment allowances on loans and advances at amortised cost, including offbalance sheet elements and the related disclosures to be acceptable (2022 result: acceptable).\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Board Audit Committee Report on page 166 for details on how the Board Audit Committee considered impairment as an area of focus, page 431 for the accounting policy on accounting for the impairment of financial assets under IFRS 9, pages 291-335 for the credit risk disclosures, and page 431 for the financial disclosure note 8; Credit Impairment charges.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These financial instruments are classified as Level 3, with management having controls in place over the boundary between Level 2 and 3 positions. Our significant audit risk for the Level 3 portfolios is therefore primarily due to these unobservable inputs.\n\nIn addition, for the Level 2 portfolios, there may also be valuation complexity, specifically where valuation modelling techniques result in significant limitations or where there is greater uncertainty around the choice of an appropriate pricing methodology, and consequently more than one valuation methodology could be used for that product across the market.\n\nWe identified two areas of such complexity. The first a derivatives portfolio that we considered to be harder to value Level 2 due to an element of modelling complexity associated with the product, and the second the XVA adjustments made to uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivative valuations.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the subjective estimates in fair value measurement of Level 3 and harder-to-value Level 2 portfolios have a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements (note 17) disclose the sensitivity in Level 3 portfolios estimated by the Group.\n\n## Disclosure quality\n\nFor the Level 3 portfolios, the disclosures are key to explaining the valuation techniques, key judgements, assumptions and material inputs.\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\nRisk assessment: We performed granular and detailed risk assessment procedures throughout the audit period over the entirety of the balances within the Group's financial statements (i.e. all of the fair value financial instruments held by the Group). As part of these risk assessment procedures, we identified which portfolios and the associated valuation inputs have a risk of material misstatement including those arising from significant judgements over valuation either due to unobservable inputs or complex models.\n\nControl testing: We attended management's Valuation Committee throughout the year and observed discussion and challenge over valuation themes including items related to the valuation of certain harder-to-value financial instruments recorded at fair value.\n\nWe performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key systems, applications and controls used in the valuations processes. We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls relating specifically to these portfolios.\n\nKey aspects of our controls testing involved evaluating the design and implementation and testing the operating effectiveness of the key controls over:\n\n- \u00b7 independent price verification (IPV), performed by a control function, of key market pricing inputs, including completeness of positions and valuation inputs subject to the IPV control;\n- \u00b7 FVAs, including exit adjustments (to mark the portfolio to bid or offer prices), model shortcoming reserves to address model limitations and XVAs; and\n- \u00b7 the validation, completeness, implementation and usage of valuation models. This included controls over assessment of model limitations and assumptions.\n\nOur valuations expertise: We involved our own valuation professionals with specialised skills and knowledge, who assisted in the following:\n\n- \u00b7 independently re-pricing a selection of fair value financial instruments and challenging management on the valuations where they were outside our tolerance; and\n- \u00b7 challenging the appropriateness of significant models and methodologies used in calculating fair values, risk exposures and in calculating FVAs and XVAs, including comparison to industry practice.\n\nSeeking contradictory evidence: For a selection of collateral disputes identified through management's control where significant fair value differences were observable with the market participant on the other side of the trade, we challenged management's valuation by inspecting evidence of the investigation and resolution of the disputes. We also utilised collateral dispute data to identify fair value financial instruments with significant fair value differences against market counterparties and selected these to independently reprice.\n\nInspection of movements: We inspected trading revenue arising on level 3 positions to assess whether material day one gains or losses generated were in line with the accounting standards.\n\nHistorical comparison: We performed a retrospective review by inspecting significant gains and losses on a selection of new fair value financial instruments, position exits and restructurings throughout the audit period and evaluated whether these data points indicated elements of fair value not incorporated in the current valuation methodologies. We also inspected movements in unobservable inputs throughout the period to challenge whether any gain or loss generated was appropriate.\n\nAssessing transparency: For the Level 3 portfolios, we assessed the adequacy of the Group's financial statements disclosures in the context of the relevant accounting standards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our audit approach relies on the effectiveness of IT access management controls. Our audit procedures identified deficiencies in certain IT access controls for systems relevant to financial reporting. More specifically, previously identified control deficiencies remain open around monitoring of activities performed by privileged users on infrastructure components. Management has an ongoing programme to remediate the deficiencies. Since these deficiencies were open during the year, we performed additional procedures to respond to the risk of unauthorised changes to automated controls over financial reporting, such as an assessment of compensating controls implemented by management.\n\n## Communications with the Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting  to the Board Audit Committee included:\n\n- \u00b7 Our response to the Key Audit Matter.\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\nControl testing: We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of automated controls that support material balances in the financial statements. We also tested the design and operating effectiveness of the relevant preventative and detective general IT controls over user access management including:\n\n- \u00b7 authorising access rights for new joiners;\n- \u00b7 timely removal of user access rights;\n- \u00b7 logging and monitoring of user activities;\n- \u00b7 privileged user access management and monitoring;\n- \u00b7 developer access to transaction and balance information;\n- \u00b7 segregation of duties;\n- \u00b7 re-certification of user access rights; and\n- \u00b7 restricting access to make changes to systems and data.\n\nWe performed procedures to assess whether additional detective compensating controls operate at the required level of precision to support our assessed risk of unauthorised activities and we tested management's detective controls.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:\n\n- \u00b7 The Key Audit Matter relates to determining whether user access management controls were designed and implemented and operated effectively. Limited auditor judgement was required relative to the other Key Audit Matters which have been identified.\n\n## Our results\n\nBased on the risk identified and our procedures performed, we did not identify unauthorised user activities in the systems relevant to financial reporting which would have required us to significantly expand the extent of our planned detailed testing.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Barclays has estimated the recoverable amount using the future cash flows of the underlying business (the value in use ('VIU')).\n\nThe calculation of VIU is dependent on certain key assumptions around the future cash flows which have been forecasted using the Group's Medium-Term Plan ('MTP'), the discount rates and the terminal growth rates. These assumptions, which are judgemental, are derived from a combination of management estimates, market data and other information obtained from external sources.\n\nThese assumptions continued to be impacted by uncertainty in the wider economic environment. This has contributed to the complexity and subjectivity in the impairment assessment process, in addition to the complexities of the valuation of a Bank.\n\nDue to the materiality of the investment in subsidiaries in the context of the Parent Company financial statements, this is the area that had the greatest impact on the overall Parent Company audit.\n\n## Communications with the Barclays Board Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Board Audit Committee included:\n\n- \u00b7 Our audit response to the Key Audit Matter which included the use of specialists to challenge key aspects of management's impairment assessment and the range of reasonably possible alternatives for significant assumptions.\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\nControl testing: We performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key systems, applications and controls used in the process to assess the carrying value of the Parent Company's investment in subsidiaries. We tested the design and operating effectiveness of the key controls relating to the process. These included controls over the identification of indicators of impairment and review of the key assumptions in determining the value in use.\n\nTest of details: We compared the carrying amount of each subsidiary to its draft balance sheet to identify whether its net assets, being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of its carrying amount. We assessed for potential indicators that investments in subsidiaries might be impaired.\n\nBenchmarking assumptions: For the two largest subsidiaries (Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC) we compared key assumptions in the associated VIU calculations including those underlying certain estimated future cash flows, the discount rate and the terminal growth rate to externally derived data including analyst broker reports, peer bank data and projected economic growth.\n\nOur valuations expertise: We involved our own valuations specialists to assist us in the following:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the appropriateness of the discount rate used by independently developing discount rate ranges using external data sources and peer bank data; and\n- \u00b7 assessing whether the methodology over management's calculation of the VIU is compliant with the requirements of the accounting standard.\n\nOur business understanding: We used our business understanding to evaluate the reasonableness of certain key assumptions and considerations made when developing the Group's MTP estimated future cash flows.\n\nHistorical comparison: We performed a retrospective review by comparing the MTP from previous years to actual results to assess the Group's ability to accurately prepare cash flow forecasts at the individual subsidiary level.\n\nAssessing transparency We assessed whether the disclosures around the assessment of recoverability of the Parent Company's investment in subsidiaries adequately reflects key assumptions and sensitivities considering the level of risks inherent in the assessment of recoverable amount of the Parent Company's investment in subsidiaries.\n\nAreas of particular auditor judgement We identified the following as the areas of particular judgement:\n\n- \u00b7 We identified the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying the estimated future cash flows and appropriateness of the discount rate, which was used in the impairment assessment, as the areas of particular judgement.\n\n## Our results\n\nBased on our procedures performed, we consider the Parent Company's investment in subsidiaries balance to be acceptable (2022 result: acceptable).\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See page 503 for the accounting policy on the recoverability of the investment in subsidiaries and page 503 for the financial disclosure note 42; Barclays PLC (the Parent Company).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our ability to detect irregularities, and our response\n\n## Fraud - identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\n\n## Fraud risk assessment\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. In this risk assessment we considered the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Risk, Group Head of Compliance and Group Head of Legal and inspection of Barclays' internal ethics and compliance reporting summaries, including those concerning investigations and regulatory correspondence;\n- \u00b7 Enquiries of operational managers, internal audit, and the Board Audit Committee and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group's highlevel policies and procedures relating to:\n- \u00b7 detecting and responding to the risks of fraud as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and\n- \u00b7 the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud, including the appropriateness and impact of changes made to these controls to facilitate remote/hybrid working;\n- \u00b7 The Group's remuneration policies and key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels; and\n- \u00b7 Discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with banks, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved our forensic specialists to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group and Company, including consideration of fraudulent schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries.  The forensic specialists participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussions and were consulted as required where further guidance was necessary.\n\n## Fraud risk communication\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and we remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level.\n\n## Fraud risks and our procedures to address them\n\nWe identified four fraud risks which were communicated to component audit teams. The nature of these fraud risks is substantially unchanged from the prior year. The fraud risks we identified are set out below:\n\n- 1. IFRS 9 ECL: Judgemental qualitative adjustments made to the ECL provision\n- 2. Valuations - risk relating to unobservable pricing inputs used to price level 3 fair value instruments\n- 3. Existence and accuracy of unconfirmed over-the-counter bilateral derivatives\n- 4. The risk of management override of controls, common with all audits under ISAs (UK).\n\nAs required by auditing standards and taking into account our overall knowledge of the control environment, we performed procedures to address the above risks, the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgements. On this audit, we have not identified a significant risk of fraud related to revenue recognition for the Group as a whole. However, we have identified a fraud risk in relation to revenue recognition within some of the individual components.\n\nOur audit procedures included evaluating the design and implementation and operating effectiveness of relevant internal controls, assessing significant accounting estimates for bias, as well as substantive procedures to address the fraud risks.\n\nThese procedures also included identifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Incorporating unpredictability into our audit:\n\nA requirement of the auditing standards is that we undertake procedures which are deliberately unexpected and could not have reasonably been predicted by Barclays' management.\n\nAs an example, we update our criteria for selecting journals with a higher risk of management override for testing each year so that the selection criteria do not become predictable. Outside of journals, for a selection of fair value financial instruments, we performed intra-month independent re-pricing to incorporate an element of unpredictability in our audit procedures.\n\n## Link to key audit matters\n\nFurther details of the testing we perform over the identified fraud risks for ECL and fair value of financial instruments are included in the respective key audit matters sections 4.1 and 4.2 of this report, as the procedures relating to those estimates also address the risk of fraud.\n\n## Laws and regulations - identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements. For this risk assessment, matters considered include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 our general commercial and sector experience;\n- \u00b7 inquiries with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards);\n- \u00b7 inspection of the Group's key regulatory and legal correspondence;\n- \u00b7 inspection of the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 relevant discussions with the Group's external legal counsel;\n- \u00b7 relevant discussions with the Group's key regulatory supervisors including the Prudential Regulation Authority, Financial Conduct Authority, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Joint Supervisory Team; and\n- \u00b7 the Group's own assessment of the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations, and the internal controls established to mitigate these. This assessment was considered and approved by the Board.",

        "page_content": "## KPMG LLP's independent auditor's report to the members of Barclays PLC (continued)\n\nOur risk assessment also considered instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and enforcement actions against the Group during the year and specifically those that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nAs the Group operates in a highly regulated environment, our assessment of risks of material misstatement also considered the control environment, including the Group's higher-level procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.  Our assessment included inspection of key frameworks, policies and standards in place, understanding and evaluating the role of the compliance function in establishing these and monitoring compliance and testing of related controls around\n\nwhistleblowing and complaints.\n\n## Risk communication\n\nOur identified laws and regulations risks was communicated throughout our team and we remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at Group level.\n\n## Direct laws context and link to audit\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\nFirstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly impact the financial statements including:\n\n- \u00b7 financial reporting legislation (including related companies' legislation);\n- \u00b7 distributable profits legislation; and\n- \u00b7 taxation legislation (direct and indirect).\n\nWe assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\n## Most significant indirect law/ regulation areas\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines, remediation payments or litigation, or the loss of the Group's permission to operate in countries where the non-adherence to laws could prevent trading in such countries.\n\nWe identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect:\n\n- \u00b7 Specific aspects of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements\n- \u00b7 Other banking laws and regulations, including securities issuance law\n- \u00b7 Customer conduct rules\n- \u00b7 Money laundering\n- \u00b7 Sanctions list and financial crime\n- \u00b7 Market abuse regulations\n- \u00b7 Certain aspects of companies legislation recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group's activities.\n\nAuditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. If a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect\n\nthat breach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Audit response\n\nIn relation to the legal, competition and regulatory matters disclosed in note 25 we performed audit procedures which included making enquiries of Barclays' internal counsel and inspection of minutes of meetings and of regulatory correspondence. For a subset of these matters which we deemed to be more significant we also made enquiries of external counsel and obtained legal confirmations from Barclays' external counsel.\n\nIn respect of regulatory matters relating to conduct risk as disclosed in note 25 our procedures included inspection of regulatory correspondence, independent enquiry of the Group's main regulators and performing audit procedures to respond to risks of material misstatement identified in recognised conduct provisions.\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards.  For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.",

Our determination of materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## Materiality for the financial statements as a whole\n\n2023: \u00a3350m\n\n2022: \u00a3275m\n\nWhat we mean\n\nA quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit\n\n## Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied\n\nWe have determined overall materiality for the Barclays PLC Group to be \u00a3350m (FY22: \u00a3275m).\n\nWe determined that profit before tax (PBT) remains the key benchmark for the Barclays PLC Group. We selected PBT as the benchmark because it is the metric in the primary statements which best reflects the focus of the users of the financial statements. During FY23, Barclays PLC took actions that resulted in significant additional costs of \u00a3927m in Q4 as disclosed in note 7. These are one-off costs to help drive future returns. Given the nature of these costs, we normalised PBT by adding back these items because they do not represent the normal, continuing operations of the Group. As such, for FY23 we based our Group materiality on Group normalised PBT of \u00a37,484m (2022: \u00a37,012m).\n\nOur Group materiality of \u00a3350m (2022: \u00a3275m) was determined by applying a percentage to normalised PBT. When using a profit-related measure to determine overall materiality, KPMG's approach is to apply a percentage between 3% and 5% to the measure. In setting overall materiality, we applied a percentage of 4.7% (2022: 3.9%) of the benchmark.\n\nMateriality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a3170m (2022: \u00a3100m), which is the component materiality for the parent company determined by the group audit engagement team. This is lower than the materiality we would otherwise have determined with reference to a benchmark of net assets of which it represents 0.3% (FY22: 0.2%).\n\n## Performance materiality\n\n2023: \u00a3227m\n\n2022: \u00a3179m\n\n## What we mean\n\nOur procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce, to an acceptable level, the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied\n\nWe have considered performance materiality at a level of 65% (2022: 65%) of materiality for Barclays PLC Group's financial statements as a whole to be appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Parent Company performance materiality was set at \u00a3110m (FY22: \u00a365m) which equates to 65% (FY22: 65%) of materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality based on the level of control deficiencies during the prior period.\n\n## Audit misstatement posting threshold\n\n2023: \u00a317m\n\n2022: \u00a313m\n\nWhat we mean\n\nThis is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative point of view. We may become aware of differences below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller differences which are indicators of fraud.\n\nThis is also the amount above which all differences identified are communicated to Barclays PLC's Board Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for determining the audit misstatement reporting threshold and judgements applied\n\nThe audit misstatement posting threshold has been set at a level of 5% (2022: 5%) of materiality for Barclays PLC's Group financial statements.\n\nWe also report to the Audit Committee any other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nThe overall materiality for the Group financial statements of \u00a3350m (2022: \u00a3275m) compares as follows to the other main financial statement elements amounts.\n\n|                                   | Total Revenue   | Total Revenue   | Total Assets   | Total Assets   | Net Assets   | Net Assets   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                   | 2023            | 2022            | 2023           | 2022           | 2023         | 2022         |\n|                                   | \u00a325,378m        | \u00a324,956m        | \u00a31,477,487m    | \u00a31,513,699m    | \u00a371,864m     | \u00a369,260m     |\n| Group Materiality as % of caption | 1.38 %          | 1.10%           | 0.02 %         | 0.02%          | 0.49 %       | 0.40%        |",

The scope of our audit\n\n## Group scope\n\n## What we mean\n\nHow the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group.\n\nWe have subjected four (2022: four) of the Group's components to full scope audits for Group purposes. Our approach to scoping the four components was as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 For two components, Barclays Bank UK PLC and Barclays Execution Services Limited Solus, we directly instructed the component audit teams to conduct and report to us on full scope audits in 2023 and 2022;\n- \u00b7 The third component, Barclays PLC Solus was subject to a full scope audit by us in 2023 and 2022; and\n- \u00b7 The fourth component, Barclays Bank PLC sub-group, was subject to a full scope audit by us in 2023 and 2022, as detailed below.\n\nIn addition, the group has a large number of other components, and we performed specified, risk-focused audit procedures over some account balances selected from amongst those components. The components over which we performed work represented 0.19% (2022: 7.68%) of Barclays PLC Group's total income and 0.26% (2022: 0.24%) of the Group's total assets.\n\nWithin the Barclays Bank PLC sub-group we specified components as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Barclays Bank Solus to be subject to a full scope audit carried out by us in 2023 and 2022;\n- \u00b7 Barclays Bank Delaware and Barclays Capital Inc to be subject to a full scope audit as instructed by us in 2023 and 2022; and\n- \u00b7 Barclays Bank Ireland PLC and Barclays Capital Securities Limited to be subject to an audit of certain account balances as instructed by us in 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated in section 2 - Group scope.\n\nBarclays PLC has centralised certain Group-wide processes in a shared service centre in India, the outputs of which are included in the financial information of the reporting components it services and therefore it is not a separate reporting component. This service centre is subject to specified audit procedures, predominantly the testing of transaction processing, reconciliations and review controls. Additional procedures are performed at certain reporting components to address the audit risks not covered by the work performed by the shared service centre.\n\nThe Group audit team has also performed certain audit procedures on the following areas on behalf of relevant components:\n\n- \u00b7 Testing of IT systems and automated business controls; and\n- \u00b7 Operating expenses and Group recharges.\n\nThe Group team communicated the results of these procedures to the applicable component teams.\n\nIn addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\nWe were able to rely upon the Group's internal control over financial reporting in all areas of our audit, and where our controls testing supported this approach, which enabled us to reduce the scope of our substantive audit work.\n\n## Group audit team oversight\n\n## What we mean\n\nThe extent of the Group audit team's involvement in component audits.\n\nA hybrid communication and oversight strategy was implemented between the Group audit team and the components during the year.

Respective responsibilities\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 190, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\nThe Company is required to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared using the single electronic reporting format specified in the TD ESEF Regulation.  The auditor's report provides no assurance over whether the financial report has been prepared in accordance with that format.\n\n## 10. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and the terms of our engagement by the Company.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and the further matters we are required to state to them in accordance with the terms agreed with the Company, and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## Stuart Crisp\n\n(Senior Statutory Auditor) for and on behalf of KPMG LLP, Statutory Auditor\n\nChartered Accountants\n\n15 Canada Square\n\nLondon\n\nE14 5GL\n\n19 February 2024\n\n<!-- image -->",

If an accounting policy or a critical accounting estimate relates to a particular note, the accounting policy and/or critical accounting estimate is contained with the relevant note.\n\n## 1 Material accounting policies\n\n## 1. Reporting entity\n\nBarclays PLC is a public company limited by shares registered in England under company number 48839, having its registered office at 1 Churchill Place, London, E14 5HP.\n\nThese financial statements are prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries (the Group) under Section 399 of the Companies Act 2006. The Group is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail banking, credit cards, wholesale banking, investment banking, wealth management and investment management services. In addition, separate financial statements have been presented for the holding company.\n\n## 2. Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the separate financial statements of Barclays PLC, have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the separate financial statements of Barclays PLC, have also been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, as there are no applicable differences from IFRS as issued by the IASB for the periods presented.\n\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated and separate financial statements are set out below, and in the relevant notes to the financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied, with the exception of International Tax Reform-Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12), which is effective from 1 January 2023 and applies retrospectively; and the Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2), and Definition of an Accounting Estimate (Amendments to IAS 8) which were applied from 1 January 2023.\n\n## 3. Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair valuation of investment property, and particular financial instruments, to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies. These financial statements are stated in millions of Pounds Sterling (\u00a3m), the functional currency of Barclays PLC.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries (the Group) under Section 399 of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using IFRS. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Board is satisfied that the Group and the parent company have the resources to continue in business for a period of at least 12 months from approval of the financial statements.\n\nIn making this assessment, the Board has considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions and includes a review of a working capital report (WCR). The WCR is used by the Board to assess the future performance of the Group and that it has the resources in place that are required to meet its ongoing regulatory requirements. The assessment is based upon business plans which contain future projections of profitability taken from the Group's medium-term plan as well as projections of regulatory capital requirements and business funding needs. The WCR also includes an assessment of the impact of internally generated stress testing scenarios on the liquidity and capital requirement forecasts. The stress tests used were based upon an assessment of reasonably possible downside economic scenarios that the Group could experience.  Further details are set out in the Viability statement on page 54.\n\nThe WCR showed that the Group had sufficient capital and liquidity in place to support its future business requirements and remained above its regulatory minimum requirements in the stress scenarios. Accordingly, the Directors concluded that there was a reasonable expectation that the Group and parent company has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\n\n## 4. Accounting policies\n\nThe Group prepares financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The Group's material accounting policies relating to specific financial statement items, together with a description of the accounting estimates and judgements that were critical to preparing those items, are set out under the relevant notes. Accounting policies that affect the financial statements as a whole are set out below.\n\n## (i) Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays PLC and all its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which Barclays PLC has control. The Group has control over another entity when the Group has all of the following:\n\n1) power over the relevant activities of the investee, for example through voting or other rights\n\n- 2) exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and\n- 3) the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nAs the consolidated financial statements include partnerships where the Group member is a partner, advantage has been taken of the exemption under Regulation 7 of the Partnership (Accounts) Regulations 2008 with regard to preparing and filing of individual partnership financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nRisk\n\nreview\n\nFinancial statements\n\n422\n\n## Notes to the financial statements (continued)\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\nDetails of the principal subsidiaries are given in Note 33.\n\n## (ii) Foreign currency translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary balances are translated into Sterling at the period end exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses on such balances are taken to the income statement.\n\nThe Group's foreign operations (including subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches) based mainly outside the UK may have different functional currencies. The functional currency of an operation is the currency of the main economy to which it is exposed.\n\nPrior to consolidation (or equity accounting) the assets and liabilities of non-Sterling operations are translated at the period end exchange rate and items of income, expense and other comprehensive income are translated into Sterling at the rate on the date of the transactions. Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in currency translation reserves within equity. These are transferred to the income statement when the Group disposes of the entire interest in a foreign operation, when partial disposal results in the loss of control of an interest in a subsidiary, when an investment previously accounted for using the equity method is accounted for as a financial asset, or on the disposal of a foreign operation within a branch.\n\n## (iii) Financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Recognition\n\nThe Group recognises financial assets and liabilities when it becomes a party to the terms of the contract. Trade date or settlement date accounting is applied depending on the classification of the financial asset.\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nFinancial assets are classified on the basis of two criteria:\n\n- i) the business model within which financial assets are managed, and\n- ii) their contractual cash flow characteristics (whether the cash flows represent 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI)).\n\nThe Group assesses the business model criteria at a portfolio level. Information that is considered in determining the applicable business model includes (i) policies and objectives for the relevant portfolio, (ii) how the performance and risks of the portfolio are managed, evaluated and reported to management, and (iii) the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, sales expectation for future periods, and the reasons for such sales.\n\nThe contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets are assessed with reference to whether the cash flows represent SPPI. Terms that could change the contractual cash flows so that it would not meet the condition for SPPI are considered, including: (i) contingent and leverage features, (ii) non-recourse arrangements, (iii) features that could modify the time value of money, and (iv) Social, Environmental and Sustainability-linked features. Terms with de minimis impact do not preclude cash flows from representing SPPI.\n\nThe accounting policy for each type of financial asset or liability is included within the relevant note for the item. The Group's policies for determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities are set out in Note 17.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, from its balance sheet where (i) the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or (ii) the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have been transferred (usually by sale) and with them either (a) substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or (b) where neither substantially all the risks and reward have been transferred or retained, where control over the asset has been lost.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished. An exchange of an existing financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms - generally a difference of 10% or more in the present value of the cash flows or a substantive qualitative amendment - is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.\n\nIt may not be obvious whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of a transferred asset, or portion of an asset, have been transferred. It is often necessary to perform a quantitative analysis that compares the Group's exposure to variability in asset cash flows before the transfer with its retained exposure after the transfer. A cash flow analysis of this nature may require judgement. In particular, it is necessary to estimate the asset's expected future cash flows as well as potential variability around this expectation. The method of estimating expected future cash flows depends on the nature of the asset, with market and market-implied data used to the greatest extent possible. The potential variability around this expectation is typically determined by stressing underlying parameters to create reasonable alternative upside and downside scenarios. Probabilities are then assigned to each scenario. Stressed parameters may include default rates, loss severity, or prepayment rates.\n\n## Accounting for reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing\n\nReverse repurchase agreements (and stock borrowing or similar transactions) are a form of secured lending whereby the Group provides a loan or cash collateral in exchange for the transfer of collateral, generally in the form of marketable securities subject to an agreement to transfer the securities back at a fixed price in the future. Repurchase agreements are where the Group obtains such loans or cash collateral, in exchange for the transfer of collateral.\n\nThe Group purchases (a reverse repurchase agreement) or borrows securities subject to a commitment to resell or return them. The securities are not included in the balance sheet as the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership. Consideration paid (or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost, unless it is designated or mandatorily at fair value through profit and loss.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Consideration received (or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost, unless it is designated at fair value through profit and loss.\n\n## (iv) Issued debt and equity instruments\n\nIssued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities if the contractual arrangement results in the Group having an obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset, or a variable number of equity shares, to the holder of the instrument. If this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and the proceeds included in equity, net of transaction costs. Dividends and other returns to equity holders are recognised when paid or declared by the members at the Annual General Meeting and treated as a deduction from equity.\n\nWhere issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately. The fair value of the debt is estimated first and the balance of the proceeds is included within equity.\n\n## (v) Cash flow statement\n\nCash comprises cash on hand and balances at central banks. Cash equivalents comprise loans and advances to banks, cash collateral balances with central banks related to payment schemes and treasury and other eligible bills, all with original maturities of three months or less.\n\nInvestments in debt securities at amortised cost, presented within loans and advances on the balance sheet, are deemed to be investing activities for the purposes of the cash flow statement, except those instruments considered to be cash equivalents.\n\nDebt securities issued and redeemed are considered to be operating activities, except qualifying eligible liabilities that satisfy regulatory requirements for MREL instruments (or have previously satisfied these requirements since 2019 when they came into effect), which are considered to be financing activities.\n\n## 5. New and amended standards and interpretations\n\nThe accounting policies adopted  have been consistently applied, with the exception of the following:\n\n## International Tax Reform-Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12)\n\nOn 23 May 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 to provide a mandatory temporary exemption to the requirements to account for deferred taxes assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nThe amendments are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and the mandatory temporary exemption is applied retrospectively to prior periods.\n\nDisclosures related to the amendments are made in Note 9 on page 434.\n\n## Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2)\n\nThe amendments require entities to disclose their material rather than their significant accounting policies.  The Group adopted the amendments effective 1 January 2023.  Whilst these amendments do not change the Group's accounting policies, the Group has reviewed the accounting policy information disclosed in these financial statements against the new requirements.\n\nUnder the amendments, accounting policy information is material if, when considered together with other information included in an entity's financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.\n\n## Definition of an Accounting Estimate (Amendments to IAS 8)\n\nUnder the new definition, accounting estimates are clarified as monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. Where an entity's accounting policy requires an item to be measured at monetary amounts that cannot be observed directly, it should develop an accounting estimate to achieve this objective.  The amendments are effective 1 January 2023 and were  adopted on this date.\n\n## IFRS 17 - Insurance contracts\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. IFRS 17 has replaced IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that was issued in 2005. In June 2020, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 17, to include scope exclusion for certain credit card contracts and similar contracts that provide insurance coverage, the optional scope exclusion for loan contracts that transfer significant insurance risk, and the clarification that only financial guarantees issued are in scope of IFRS 9.\n\nIFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e. life, non-life, direct insurance and reinsurance), regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features. A few scope exceptions apply.\n\nIFRS 17 was effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 but the impact to the Group is not material.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Further clarifications include how lending conditions affect classification and classification of liabilities the entity will or may settle by issuing its own equity instruments.\n\nIn October 2022, the IASB also issued further amendments to IAS 1 to improve the information an entity provides when its right to defer settlement of a liability for at least 12 months is subject to compliance with covenants, and to respond to stakeholders' concerns about the classification of such a liability as current or non-current.\n\n## 6. Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the accounting policies. The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements are highlighted under the relevant note. Critical accounting estimates and judgements are disclosed in:\n\n- \u25aa Credit impairment charges on page 431\n- \u25aa Tax on page 435\n- \u25aa Fair value of financial instruments on page 449\n- \u25aa Goodwill and intangible assets on page 466\n- \u25aa Pensions and post-retirement benefit obligations on page 485\n- \u25aa Provisions including conduct and legal, competition and regulatory matters on page 468.\n\n## 7. Other disclosures\n\nTo improve transparency and ease of reference, by concentrating related information in one place, certain disclosures required under IFRS have been included within the Risk review section as follows:\n\n- \u25aa Credit risk on pages 276  to 277 and 291 to 335\n- \u25aa Market risk on page 278 and 336 to 337\n- \u25aa Treasury and Capital risk - liquidity on page 278 to 279 and 339 to 349\n- \u25aa Treasury and Capital risk - capital on page 279 and 350 to 356.\n\nThese disclosures are covered by the Audit opinion (included on pages 396 to 412) where referenced as audited.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Barclays UK transformed its business in 2021 and consolidated all Customer Care employees, who directly serve customers, into Barclays Execution Services to improve customer service and experience. Costs are recharged, while FTEs are reported within Head Office, as at 31 December 2021 10,700 FTEs were impacted by the move from Barclays UK to Head Office.\n\nBarclays PLC has announced on 20 February 2024 changes to the way that the business is being managed and it has published comparative financial information to reflect these changes to its segmental reporting which are effective from January 2024.\n\nFrom Q124, the Group will present its financial disclosures through the following new segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Barclays UK\n- \u00b7 Barclays UK Corporate Bank\n- \u00b7 Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management\n- \u00b7 Barclays Investment Bank\n- \u00b7 Barclays US Consumer Bank\n\nThe previously reported Head office will additionally include the held for sale German consumer finance business and the merchant acquiring component on the Payments business both previously reported within Barclays International as part of CC&P.\n\nConsidering the revised segmentation in January 2024, our assessment has not led to any further financial impacts. These changes do not affect legal entities nor do they impact the Group's previously reported consolidated financials.

To the extent these costs are attributed to customers that continuously carry an outstanding balance (revolvers) and incremental to the origination of credit card balances, they are capitalised and subsequently included within the calculation of the effective interest rate. They are amortised to interest income over the period of expected repayment of the originated balance. Costs attributed to customers that settle their outstanding balances each period (transactors) are deferred on the balance sheet as a cost of obtaining a contract and amortised to fee and commission expense over the life of the customer relationship (refer to Note 4). There are no other individual estimates involved in the calculation of effective interest rates that are material to the results or financial position.\n\n|                                               | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash and balances at central banks            | 10,262    | 2,916     | 184       |\n| Debt securities at amortised cost             | 2,337     | 1,251     | 177       |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost          | 14,742    | 12,125    | 9,363     |\n| Fair value through other comprehensive income | 4,907     | 1,963     | 550       |\n| Negative interest on liabilities              | 46        | 208       | 248       |\n| Other 1                                       | 2,781     | 633       | 718       |\n| Interest and similar income                   | 35,075    | 19,096    | 11,240    |\n| Deposits at amortised cost                    | (11,252)  | (3,573)   | (561)     |\n| Debt securities in issue                      | (6,344)   | (3,240)   | (1,340)   |\n| Subordinated liabilities                      | (866)     | (530)     | (507)     |\n| Negative interest on assets                   | (7)       | (208)     | (374)     |\n| Other 2                                       | (3,897)   | (973)     | (385)     |\n| Interest and similar expense                  | (22,366)  | (8,524)   | (3,167)   |\n| Net interest income                           | 12,709    | 10,572    | 8,073     |\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Other interest and similar income includes interest income from cash collaterals and reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending at amortised cost.\n- 2 Other interest and similar expense includes interest expense from cash collaterals and repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing at amortised cost.\n\nInterest and similar income presented above represents interest revenue calculated using the effective interest method.

Incremental costs are reported within fee and commission expense if they are directly attributable to generating identifiable fee and commission income. Where the contractual arrangements also result in the Group recognising financial instruments in scope of IFRS 9, such financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9 before applying the provisions of IFRS 15.\n\nFee and commission income is disaggregated below by fee types that reflect the nature of the services offered across the Group and operating segments, in accordance with IFRS 15. The below table includes a total for fees in scope of IFRS 15. Refer to Note 2 for more detailed information about operating segments.\n\n|                                             | 2023           | 2023                       | 2023           | 2023     |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|----------------|----------|\n|                                             | Barclays UK \u00a3m | Barclays  International \u00a3m | Head Office \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Fee type                                    |                |                            |                |          |\n| Transactional                               | 1,124          | 3,692                      | -

These include interchange and merchant fee income generated from credit and bank card usage. Transaction and processing fees are recognised at the point in time the transaction occurs or service is performed. Interchange and merchant fees are recognised upon settlement of the card transaction payment.\n\nThe Group incurs certain card-related costs including those related to cardholder reward programmes and payments to co-brand partners. Cardholder reward programme costs related to customers that settle their outstanding balance each period (transactors) are expensed when incurred and presented in fee and commission expense, while costs related to customers that continuously carry an outstanding balance (revolvers) are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable (refer to Note 3). Payments to partners for new cardholder account originations related to transactor accounts are deferred as costs to obtain a contract under IFRS 15, while costs related to revolver accounts are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable (refer to Note 3). Those costs deferred under IFRS 15 are capitalised and amortised over the estimated life of the customer relationship. Payments to co-brand partners based on revenue sharing to the extent the revenue share relates to \"revolvers\" are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable and to the extent  revenue share relates  to 'transactors'  it must be presented in fee and commission expense. Payments based on profitability are presented in fee and commission expense.\n\n## Advisory\n\nAdvisory fees are generated from wealth management services and investment banking advisory services related to mergers, acquisitions and financial restructurings. Wealth management advisory fees are earned over the period the services are provided and are generally recognised quarterly when the market value of client assets is determined. Investment banking advisory fees are recognised at the point in time when the services related to the transaction have been completed under the terms of the engagement. Investment banking advisory costs are recognised as incurred in fee and commission expense if direct and incremental to the advisory services or are otherwise recognised in operating expenses.\n\n## Brokerage and execution\n\nBrokerage and execution fees are earned for executing client transactions with various exchanges and over-the-counter markets and assisting clients in clearing transactions and facilitating foreign exchange transactions for spot/forward contracts. Brokerage and execution fees are recognised at the point in time the associated service has been completed which is generally the trade date of the transaction.\n\n## Underwriting and syndication\n\nUnderwriting and syndication fees are earned for the distribution of client equity or debt securities and the arrangement and administration of a loan syndication. This includes commitment fees to provide loan financing. Underwriting fees are generally recognised on trade date if there is no remaining contingency, such as the transaction being conditional on the closing of an acquisition or another transaction. Underwriting costs are deferred and recognised in fee and commission expense when the associated underwriting fees are recorded. Syndication fees are earned for arranging and administering a loan syndication; however, the associated fee may be subject to variability until the loan has been syndicated to other syndicate members or until other contingencies have been resolved and therefore the fee revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved.\n\nIncluded in the underwriting and syndication fees are loan commitment fees, when the drawdown is not probable. Such commitment fees are recognised over time through to the contractual maturity of the commitment.\n\n## Contract assets and contract liabilities\n\nThe Group had no material contract assets or contract liabilities as at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u00a3nil; 2021: \u00a3nil).\n\n## Impairment of fee receivables and contract assets\n\nDuring 2023, there have been no material impairments recognised in relation to fees receivable and contract assets (2022: \u00a3nil; 2021: \u00a3nil). Fees in relation to transactional business can be added to outstanding customer balances. These amounts may be subsequently impaired as part of the overall loans and advances balance.\n\n## Remaining performance obligations\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less or because the Group has a right to consideration that corresponds directly with the value of the service provided to the client or customer.\n\n## Costs incurred in obtaining or fulfilling a contract\n\nThe Group expects that incremental costs of obtaining a contract such as success fee and commission fees paid are recoverable and therefore capitalise such  contract  costs.  Capitalised contract costs net of amortisation as at 31 December 2023 are \u00a3217m (2022: \u00a3198m; 2021: \u00a3154m).\n\nCapitalised contract costs are amortised over the customer relationship period depending on the transfer of services to which the asset pertains. In 2023, the amount of amortisation was \u00a355m (2022: \u00a347m; 2021: \u00a336m) and there was no impairment loss recognised in connection with the capitalised contract costs (2022: \u00a3nil; 2021: \u00a3nil).\n\n<!-- image -->",

If the credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition (Stage 2), or if the financial instrument is credit impaired (Stage 3), an allowance (or provision) should be recognised for the lifetime ECLs.\n\nThe measurement of ECL is calculated using three main components: (i) probability of default (PD) (ii) loss given default (LGD) and (iii) the exposure at default (EAD).\n\nThe 12 month and lifetime ECLs are calculated by multiplying the respective PD, LGD and the EAD. The 12 month and lifetime PDs represent the PD occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively. The EAD represents the expected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default event together with any expected drawdowns of committed facilities. The LGD represents expected losses on the EAD given the event of default, taking into account, among other attributes, the mitigating effect of collateral value at the time it is expected to be realised and the time value of money.\n\nExpected credit loss measurement is based on the ability of borrowers to make payments as they fall due. The Group also considers sector-specific risks and whether additional adjustments are required in the measurement of ECL. Credit risk may be impacted by climate considerations for certain sectors, such as oil and gas.\n\nDetermining a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition:\n\nThe Group assesses when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred based on quantitative and qualitative assessments. The credit risk of an exposure is considered to have significantly increased when:\n\n## i) Quantitative test\n\nThe annualised lifetime PD has increased by more than an agreed threshold relative to the equivalent at origination.\n\nPD deterioration thresholds are defined as percentage increases, and are set at an origination score band and segment level to ensure the test appropriately captures significant increases in credit risk at all risk levels. Generally, thresholds are inversely correlated to the origination PD, i.e. as the origination PD increases, the threshold value reduces.\n\nThe assessment of the point at which a PD increase is deemed 'significant', is based upon analysis of the portfolio's risk profile against a common set of principles and performance metrics (consistent across both retail and wholesale businesses), incorporating expert credit judgement where appropriate. Application of quantitative PD floors does not represent the use of the low credit risk exemption as exposures can separately move into Stage 2 via the qualitative route described below.\n\nWholesale assets apply a 100% increase in PD and 0.2% PD floor to determine a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nRetail assets apply bespoke relative increase and absolute PD thresholds based on product type and origination PD. Thresholds are subject to maximums defined by Group policy and typically apply minimum relative thresholds of 50-100% and a maximum relative threshold of 400%.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

The definition and assessment of high risk includes as wide a range of information as reasonably available, such as industry and Group-wide customer level data, including but not limited to bureau scores and high consumer indebtedness index, wherever possible or relevant.\n\nWhilst the high risk populations applied for IFRS 9 impairment purposes are aligned with risk management processes, they are also regularly reviewed and validated to ensure that they capture any incremental segments where there is evidence of credit deterioration.\n\n## iii) Backstop criteria\n\nThis is relevant for accounts that are more than 30 calendar days past due. The 30 days past due criteria is a backstop rather than a primary driver of moving exposures into Stage 2.\n\nThe criteria for determining a significant increase in credit risk for assets with bullet repayments follows the same principle as all other assets, i.e. quantitative, qualitative and backstop tests are all applied.\n\nExposures will move back to Stage 1 once they no longer meet the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk. This means that, at a minimum all payments must be up-to-date, the PD deterioration test is no longer met, the account is no longer classified as high risk, and the customer has evidenced an ability to maintain future payments.\n\nExposures are only removed from Stage 3 and reassigned to Stage 2 once the original default trigger event no longer applies.\n\nExposures being removed from Stage 3 must no longer qualify as credit impaired, and:\n\n- a) the obligor will also have demonstrated consistently good payment behaviour over a 12-month period, by making all consecutive contractual payments due and, for forborne exposures, the relevant EBA defined probationary period has also been successfully completed or;\n\nb) (for non-forborne exposures) the performance conditions are defined and approved within an appropriately sanctioned restructure plan, including 12 months' payment history have been met.\n\nManagement overlays and other exceptions to model outputs are applied only if consistent with the objective of identifying significant increases in credit risk.\n\n## Forward-looking information\n\nThe measurement of ECL involves complexity and judgement, including estimation of PD, LGD, a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected lives (where contractual life is not appropriate), and estimation of EAD and assessing significant increases in credit risk.\n\nCredit losses are the expected cash shortfalls from what is contractually due over the expected life of the financial instrument, discounted at the original effective interest rate (EIR). ECLs are the unbiased probability-weighted credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and considering future economic conditions.\n\nRefer to the Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis section on page 311 for further details.\n\n## Definition of default, credit impaired assets, write-offs, and interest income recognition\n\nThe definition of default for the purpose of determining ECLs, and for internal credit risk management purposes, has been aligned to the Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default, to maintain a consistent approach with IFRS 9 and associated regulatory guidance. The Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default considers indicators that the debtor is unlikely to pay, includes exposures in forbearance and is no later than when the exposure is more than 90 days past due. When exposures are identified as credit impaired at the time when they are purchased or originated, interest income is calculated on the carrying value net of the impairment allowance.\n\nAn asset is considered credit impaired when one or more events occur that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset. This comprises assets defined as defaulted and other individually assessed exposures where imminent default or actual loss is identified.\n\nUncollectable loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Group's internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoverable amounts have been collected. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement. The timing and extent of write-offs may involve some element of subjective judgement. Nevertheless, a write-off will often be prompted by a specific event, such as the inception of insolvency proceedings or other formal recovery action, which makes it possible to establish that some or the entire advance is beyond realistic prospect of recovery.\n\n## Accounting for purchased financial guarantee contracts\n\nThe Group may enter into a financial guarantee contract which requires the issuer of such contract to reimburse the Group for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. For these separate financial guarantee contracts, the Group recognises a reimbursement asset aligned with the recognition of the underlying\n\n<!-- image -->",

This assessment considers both the change in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as the change in overall instrument risk profile. In respect of payment holidays granted to borrowers which are not due to forbearance, if the revised cash flows on a present value basis (based on the original EIR) are not substantially different from the original cash flows, the loan is not considered to be substantially modified.\n\nWhere terms are substantially different, the existing loan will be derecognised and a new loan will be recognised at fair value, with any difference in valuation recognised immediately within the income statement, subject to observability criteria.\n\nWhere terms are not substantially different, the loan carrying value will be adjusted to reflect the present value of modified cash flows discounted at the original EIR, with any resulting gain or loss recognised immediately within the income statement as a modification gain or loss.\n\n## Expected life\n\nLifetime ECLs must be measured over the expected life. This is restricted to the maximum contractual life and takes into account expected prepayment, extension, call and similar options. The exceptions are certain revolving financial instruments, such as credit cards and bank overdrafts, that include both a drawn and an undrawn component where the entity's contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the entity's exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. For revolving facilities, expected life is analytically derived to reflect the behavioural life of the asset, i.e. the full period over which the business expects to be exposed to credit risk. Behavioural life is typically based upon historical analysis of the average time to default, closure or withdrawal of facility. Where data is insufficient or analysis inconclusive, an additional 'maturity factor' may be incorporated to reflect the full estimated life of the exposures, based upon experienced judgement and/or peer analysis. Potential future modifications of contracts are not taken into account when determining the expected life or EAD until they occur.\n\n## Discounting\n\nECLs are discounted at the EIR at initial recognition or an approximation thereof and consistent with income recognition. For loan commitments the EIR is the rate that is expected to apply when the loan is drawn down and a financial asset is recognised. Issued financial guarantee contracts are discounted at the risk free rate. Lease receivables are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease. For variable/floating rate financial assets, the spot rate at the reporting date is used and projections of changes in the variable rate over the expected life are not made to estimate future interest cash flows or for discounting.\n\n## Modelling techniques\n\nCurrently, Internal Ratings- Based models are leveraged to calculate the point-in-time PD and LGD, which serve as key inputs to the IFRS 9 models. Thereafter, these inputs are extrapolated by the IFRS 9 models to create macroeconomic sensitive forecast of PDs, LGDs and in turn ECL.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nA financial asset is subject to forbearance when it is modified due to the credit distress of the borrower. A modification made to the terms of an asset due to forbearance will typically be assessed as a non-substantial modification that does not result in derecognition of the original loan, except in circumstances where debt is exchanged for equity.\n\nBoth performing and non-performing forbearance assets are classified as Stage 3 except where it is established that the concession granted has not resulted in diminished financial obligation and that no other regulatory definition of default criteria have been triggered, in which case the asset is classified as Stage 2. The minimum probationary period for non-performing forbearance is 12 months and for performing forbearance, 24 months. Hence, a minimum of 36 months is required for non-performing forbearance to move out of a forborne state.\n\nNo financial instrument in forbearance can transfer back to Stage 1 until all of the Stage 2 thresholds are no longer met and can only move out of Stage 3 when no longer credit impaired.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nIFRS 9 impairment involves several important areas of judgement, including estimating forward-looking modelled parameters (PD, LGD and EAD), developing a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimating expected lives and assessing significant increases in credit risk, based on the Group's experience of managing credit risk. The determination of expected life is most material for Barclays' credit card portfolios which is obtained via behavioural life analysis to materially capture the risk of these facilities.\n\nWithin the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogenous assets with similar risk characteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, the impairment allowance is calculated using forward-looking modelled parameters which are typically run at account level. There are many models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or customer category. Judgement and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised. Management adjustments to impairment models, which contain an element of subjectivity, are applied in order to factor in certain conditions or changes in policy that are not fully incorporated into the impairment models, or to reflect additional facts and circumstances at the period end. Management adjustments are reviewed and incorporated into future model development where appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These considerations can be particularly subjective and can include the business prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral, the Group's position relative to other claimants, the reliability of customer information and the likely cost and duration of the work-out process. The level of the impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows (discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate), and its carrying amount. Furthermore, judgements change with time as new  information becomes available or as work-out strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment allowance as individual decisions are taken. Changes in these estimates would result in a change in the allowances and have a direct impact on the impairment charge.\n\nFurther information on impairment allowances, impairment charges, management adjustments to models for impairment, measurement uncertainty, sensitivity analysis and related credit information is set out within the Credit risk performance section.\n\nTemporary adjustments to calculated IFRS9 impairment allowances may be applied in limited circumstances to account for situations where known or expected risk factors or information have not been considered in the ECL assessment or modelling process. For further information please see page 307 in the Credit risk performance section.\n\nInformation about the potential impact of the physical and transition risks of climate change on borrowers is considered, taking into account reasonable and supportable information to make accounting judgements and estimates. Climate change is inherently of a long-term nature, with significant levels of uncertainty, and consequently requires judgement in determining the possible impact in the next financial year, if any.\n\n|                                                                         | 2023                              | 2023                             | 2023          | 2022                              | 2022                             | 2022   | 2021                              | 2021                             | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------|\n|                                                                         | Impairment  charges /  (releases) | Recoveries and  reimbursements 1 | Total 2       | Impairment  charges /  (releases) | Recoveries and  reimbursements 1 | Total  | Impairment  charges /  (releases) | Recoveries and  reimbursements 1 | Total  |\n|                                                                         | \u00a3m                                | \u00a3m                               | \u00a3m            | \u00a3m                                | \u00a3m                               | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m                                | \u00a3m                               | \u00a3m     |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost 3                                  | 2,017                             |                                  | (73)    1,944 | 1,428                             | (263)                            | 1,165  | (361)                             | 240                              | (121)  |\n| Off-balance sheet loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts    | (61)                              | -                                | (61)          | 18                                | -                                | 18     | (514)                             | -                                | (514)  |\n| Total                                                                   | 1,956                             |                                  | (73)    1,883 | 1,446                             | (263)                            | 1,183  | (875)                             | 240                              | (635)  |\n| Cash collateral and settlement balances                                 | 4                                 | -                                | 4             | 28                                | -                                | 28     | (4)                               | -                                | (4)    |\n| Financial instruments at fair value  through other comprehensive income | (1)                               | -                                | (1)           | 9                                 |                                  | 9      | (8)                               | -                                | (8)    |\n| Other financial asset measured at cost                                  | (5)                               | -                                | (5)           | -                                 | -                                | -      | (6)                               | -                                | (6)    |\n| Credit impairment charges /(releases)                                   | 1,954                             |                                  | (73)    1,881 | 1,483                             | (263)                            | 1,220  | (893)                             | 240                              | (653)  |\n\n## Notes\n\n- 3 Includes Debt securities at amortised cost.\n\n## Write-offs that can be subjected to enforcement activity\n\nThe contractual amount outstanding on financial assets that were written off during the year and that can still be subjected to enforcement activity is \u00a3597m (2022: \u00a3949m). This is lower than the write-offs presented in the movement in gross exposures and impairment allowance table due to assets sold during the year post write-offs and post write-off recoveries.\n\n## Modification of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets of \u00a32,690m (2022: \u00a32,412m, 2021: \u00a33,446m), with a loss allowance measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, were subject to non-substantial modification during the year, with a resulting loss of \u00a34m (2022: \u00a34m, 2021: \u00a311m). The gross carrying amount of financial assets subject to non-substantial modification for which the loss allowance has changed to a 12 month ECL during the year amounts to \u00a3149m (2022: \u00a31,077m, 2021: \u00a3419m).\n\n## 9 Tax\n\n## Accounting for income taxes\n\nThe Group applies IAS 12 Income Taxes in accounting for taxes on income. Income tax payable on taxable profits (current tax) is recognised as an expense in the periods in which the profits arise. Withholding taxes are also treated as income taxes. Income tax recoverable on tax allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offsetting against taxable profits arising in the current or prior periods. Current tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is not recognised where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.\n\nThe Group considers an uncertain tax position to exist when it considers that ultimately, in the future, the amount of profit subject to tax may be greater than the amount initially reflected in the Group's tax returns. The Group accounts for provisions in respect of uncertain tax positions in two different ways.\n\nA current tax provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax position will alter the amount of cash tax due to, or from, a tax authority in the future. From recognition, the current tax provision is then measured at the amount the Group ultimately expects to pay the tax authority to resolve the position. The accrual of interest and penalty amounts in respect of uncertain income tax positions is recognised as an expense within profit before tax.\n\nDeferred tax provisions are adjustments made to the carrying value of deferred tax assets in respect of uncertain tax positions. A deferred tax provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax position will result in a reduction in the carrying value of the deferred tax asset. From recognition of a provision, measurement of the underlying deferred tax asset is adjusted to take into account the expected impact of resolving the uncertain tax position on the loss or temporary difference giving rise to the deferred tax asset.\n\nThe approach taken to measurement takes account of whether the uncertain tax position is a discrete position that will be reviewed by the tax authority in isolation from any other position, or one of a number of issues which are expected to be reviewed together concurrently and resolved simultaneously with a tax authority. The Group's measurement of provisions is based upon its best estimate of the additional profit that will become subject to tax. For a discrete position, consideration is given only to the merits of that position. Where a number of issues are expected to be reviewed and resolved together, the Group will take into account not only the merits of its position in respect of each particular issue but also the overall level of provision relative to the aggregate of the uncertain tax positions across all the issues that are expected to be resolved at the same time. In addition, in assessing provision levels, it is assumed that tax authorities will review uncertain tax positions and that all facts will be fully and transparently disclosed.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThere are two key areas of judgement that impact the reported tax position. Firstly, the level of provisioning for uncertain tax positions; and secondly, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of current and deferred tax balances, including provisions for uncertain tax positions in the next financial year. The provisions for uncertain tax positions cover a diverse range of issues and reflect advice from external counsel where relevant. It should be noted that only a proportion of the total uncertain tax positions will be under audit at any point in time, and could therefore be subject to challenge by a tax authority over the next year.\n\nDeferred tax assets have been recognised based on business profit forecasts which included consideration for the current view of climate impacts. Details on the recognition of deferred tax assets are provided in this note.\n\n|                                       | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current tax charge/(credit)           |           |           |           |\n| Current year                          | 1,359     | 1,045     | 1,417     |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years | (181)     | (444)     | 317       |\n|                                       | 1,178     | 601       | 1,734     |\n| Deferred tax (credit)/charge          |           |           |           |\n| Current year                          | (95)      | 235       | (352)     |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years | 151       | 203       | (244)     |\n|                                       | 56        | 438       | (596)     |\n| Tax charge                            | 1,234     | 1,039     | 1,138     |\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the banking surcharge rate reduced from 8% to 3% from 1 April 2023 resulting in a total tax rate applicable to banks' UK profits of 27.75% for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\nThe effective tax rate of 18.8% is lower than the applicable UK corporation tax rate of 23.5% primarily due to tax relief on payments made under AT1 instruments and tax relief on holdings of inflation-linked government bonds. These factors, which have each decreased the effective tax rate, are partially offset by non-creditable taxes including withholding taxes.\n\n## Factors that may influence the effective tax rate in future periods\n\nThe Group's future tax charge will be sensitive to the geographic mix of profits earned, the tax rates in force and changes to the tax rules in the jurisdictions that the Group operates in.\n\nTax law is, at times, complex, and it is the role of courts and tribunals to act as the final authority on the correct interpretation of tax law. In October 2023, a First-tier Tax Tribunal hearing took place between Barclays Bank PLC and HM Revenue & Customs in respect of the UK corporation tax treatment of an element of the finance costs associated with reserve capital instruments issued as part of the capital raising announced by Barclays in October 2008, which have since been redeemed. The maximum additional tax liability that could arise under the dispute is \u00a3215m and a provision of \u00a3106m is carried in respect of this uncertainty. The judgement is expected to be received in early 2024.\n\nThe OECD and G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting announced plans under the Pillar Two Framework to introduce a global minimum tax rate of 15% and the OECD issued model rules in 2021. Further OECD guidance has been released during 2022 and 2023 and the UK Government enacted legislation on 11 July 2023 to implement the global minimum tax rules and a UK domestic minimum tax. The UK's Pillar Two rules apply for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023 and will apply in respect of profits for every jurisdiction where the Group operates.\n\nAdditionally, the Group may be subject to Qualifying Domestic Minimum Top-up Taxes (QDMTTs) under the Pillar Two rules implemented in its operating jurisdictions. The application of QDMTT rules should not affect the overall impact of any additional taxes resulting from the Pillar Two regime on the Group's tax charge, as any taxes paid under a local QDMTT would be expected to result in a reduction in any top-up tax being payable in the UK.\n\nThe Group has adopted the International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules amendments to IAS 12, which were issued on 23 May 2023 and approved by the UK Endorsement Board on 19 July 2023, and has applied the exception set out in paragraph 4A in respect of recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.\n\nThe Group has reviewed the published UK legislation alongside the OECD model rules and guidance and has performed an assessment of the expected impact of the new regime. Additional taxes resulting from the implementation of Pillar Two are expected to arise from 1 January 2024 in respect of a limited number of jurisdictions in which the Group operates, principally in the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, and Ireland, by virtue of their low statutory tax rates. However, these additional taxes are not expected to significantly increase the Group's future tax charge based on an estimated impact of c.\u00a320m per annum, with actual future liabilities being dependent on levels of profits in particular jurisdictions. The Group will continue to review further guidance due to be released by the OECD and governments implementing this new tax regime to assess the potential impact.\n\nIn the USA, the corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statements income introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act became effective on 1 January 2023. The Group will continue to review the regulations and guidance as they are issued. However, the Group's tax liability was not increased as a result of the corporate alternative minimum tax in 2023 and it is not expected that it will materially increase the Group's future effective tax rate.\n\n## Tax in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income\n\nThe tax relating to each component of other comprehensive income can be found in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## Tax included directly in equity\n\nTax included directly in equity comprises a \u00a39m credit (2022: \u00a31m) relating to share-based payments and deductible costs on issuing other equity instruments.\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nThe deferred tax amounts on the balance sheet were as follows:\n\n|                                                             | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| UK Tax Group                                                | 4,081     | 4,925     |\n| US Intermediate Holding Company Tax Group ('IHC Tax Group') | 973       | 1,094     |\n| Barclays Bank PLC's US Branch Tax Group                     | 386       | 482       |\n| Other (outside the UK and US tax groups)                    | 520       | 490       |\n| Deferred tax asset                                          | 5,960     | 6,991     |\n| Deferred tax liability                                      | (22)      | (16)      |\n| Net deferred tax                                            | 5,938     | 6,975     |\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n437\n\n<!-- image -->",

The deferred tax asset in Barclays Bank PLC's US Branch Tax Group of \u00a3386m (2022: \u00a3482m) relates entirely to temporary differences.\n\nIn relation to the IHC Tax Group, these temporary differences include \u00a3387m (2022: \u00a3434m) arising from New York State and City prior net operating loss conversion which can be carried forward and will expire in 2034. Business profit forecasts indicate that all of the New York State attributable amounts will be utilised prior to expiry and that \u00a338m of the New York City attributable amounts previously recognised will not be utilised prior to expiry.  Accordingly, in the current period the deferred tax asset recognised has been reduced by \u00a338m.\n\n## UK Tax Group deferred tax asset\n\nThe deferred tax asset in the UK Tax Group of \u00a34,081m (2022: \u00a34,925m) includes \u00a31,566m (2022: \u00a31,535m) relating to tax losses, with the balance relating to temporary differences. There is no time limit on utilisation of UK tax losses and business profit forecasts indicate that these losses will be fully recovered.\n\n## Other deferred tax assets (outside the UK and US tax groups)\n\nThe deferred tax asset of \u00a3520m (2022: \u00a3490m) in other entities within the Group includes \u00a3147m (2022: \u00a390m) relating to tax losses. These deferred tax assets relate to a number of different territories and their recognition is based on profit forecasts or local country law which indicate that it is probable that those deferred tax assets will be fully recovered.\n\nOf the deferred tax asset of \u00a3520m (2022: \u00a3490m), an amount of \u00a320m (2022: \u00a333m) relates to entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or prior year and for which the utilisation of the deferred tax is dependent on future taxable profits. This has been taken into account in reaching the above conclusion that these deferred tax assets will be fully recovered in the future.\n\nThe table below shows movements on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits and gains will be available against which they can be utilised.\n\n## Group investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised in respect of the value of the Group's investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of these temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was \u00a3873m (2022: \u00a3852m).\n\n## 10 Earnings per share\n\n|                                                              |                          |                          |                          | 2023 \u00a3m                    | 2022 \u00a3m                    | 2021 \u00a3m                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent |                          |                          |                          | 4,274                      | 5,023                      | 6,205                      |\n|                                                              |                          |                          |                          | 2023                       | 2022                       | 2021                       |\n|                                                              |                          |                          |                          | million                    | million                    | million                    |\n| Basic weighted average number of shares in issue             |                          |                          |                          | 15,445                     | 16,333                     | 16,985                     |\n| Number of potential ordinary shares                          |                          |                          |                          | 450                        | 534                        | 435                        |\n| Diluted weighted average number of shares                    |                          |                          |                          | 15,895                     | 16,867                     | 17,420                     |\n|                                                              | Basic earnings per share | Basic earnings per share | Basic earnings per share | Diluted earnings per share | Diluted earnings per share | Diluted earnings per share |\n|                                                              | 2023                     | 2022                     | 2021                     | 2023                       | 2022                       | 2021                       |\n|                                                              | p                        | p                        | p                        | p                          | p                          | p                          |\n| Earnings per ordinary share                                  | 27.7                     | 30.8                     | 36.5                     | 26.9                       | 29.8                       | 35.6                       |\n\nThe calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and the basic weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares held in employee benefit trusts or held for trading. When calculating the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted for the effects of all expected dilutive potential ordinary shares held in respect of Barclays PLC, totalling 450m (2022: 534m, 2021: 435m) shares. The number of share options outstanding, under schemes that were considered to be potentially dilutive was 750m (2022: 789m, 2021: 688m) in total. These options have strike prices ranging from \u00a30.83 to \u00a31.51.\n\nOf the total number of employee share options and share awards at 31 December 2023, 39m (2022: 27m, 2021: 5m) were anti-dilutive. The 888m decrease (2022: 652m decrease, 2021: 315m decrease) in the basic weighted average number of shares is primarily due to the impact of the share buy-back programmes completed each year.\n\n## 11 Dividends on ordinary shares\n\nThe Directors have approved a total dividend in respect of 2023 of 8.00p per ordinary share of 25p each. The full year dividend for 2023 of 5.30p per ordinary share will be paid on 3 April 2024 to shareholders on the Share Register on 1 March 2024. On 31 December 2023, there were 15,155m ordinary shares in issue. The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 do not reflect this dividend, which will be accounted for in shareholders' equity as an appropriation of retained profits in the year ending 31 December 2024.\n\nThe Directors have confirmed their intention to initiate a share buyback of up to \u00a31bn  after the balance sheet date. The proposed share buyback  is expected to  commence in the first quarter of 2024. The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 do not reflect the impact of the proposed share buyback, which will be accounted for as and when shares are repurchased by the Company.\n\nThe 2023 financial statements include the 2023 interim dividend of \u00a3417m (2022: \u00a3364m, 2021: \u00a3339m); a full year dividend declared in relation to 2022 of \u00a3793m (2021: \u00a3664m, 2020: \u00a3173m ) and two share buyback programmes totalling \u00a31,250m (2022: \u00a31,500m, 2021: \u00a31,200m). Dividends and share buybacks are funded out of distributable reserves.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n439\n\n<!-- image -->",

They include swaps, forward-rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments and primarily affect the Group's net interest income, net trading income and derivative assets and liabilities. Notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded on the balance sheet. Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, credit risk, inflation risk, exchange rate, commodity equity exposures, and exposures to certain indices such as house price indices and retail price indices related to non-trading positions.\n\nAll derivative instruments are held at fair value through profit or loss, except for derivatives that are in a designated cash flow or net investment hedge accounting relationship. Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe Group applies the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for hedge accounting purposes. The Group applies hedge accounting to represent the economic effects of its interest rate, currency and contractually-linked inflation risk management strategies. Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Group applies fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate to the risks being hedged.\n\n## Fair value hedge accounting\n\nChanges in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The fair value changes adjust the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability held at amortised cost.\n\nIf hedge relationships no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued. For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship using the effective interest method. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement. For items classified as fair value through other comprehensive income, the hedge accounting adjustment is included in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Cash flow hedge accounting\n\nFor qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially in other comprehensive income, and then recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\n## Hedges of net investments\n\nThe Group's net investments in foreign operations, including monetary items accounted for as part of the net investment, are hedged for foreign currency risks using both derivatives and foreign currency borrowings. Hedges of net investments are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges; the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is being recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income statement. The cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, or other reductions in the Group's investment in the operation.\n\n|                                                                 | Total derivatives   | Total derivatives   | Total derivatives   | Total derivatives   | Total derivatives   | Total derivatives   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                                 | 2023                | 2023                | 2023                | 2022                | 2022                | 2022                |\n|                                                                 | Notional contract   | Fair value          | Fair value          | Notional contract   | Fair value          | Fair value          |\n|                                                                 | amount              | Assets              | Liabilities         | amount              | Assets              | Liabilities         |\n|                                                                 | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m                  |\n| Total derivative assets/(liabilities) held for trading          | 64,993,491          | 254,643             | (249,458)           | 52,689,773          | 301,647             | (288,573)           |\n| Total derivative assets/(liabilities) held for risk  management | 299,576             | 2,193               | (586)               | 285,505             | 733                 | (1,047)             |\n| Derivative assets/(liabilities)                                 | 65,293,067          | 256,836             | (250,044)           | 52,975,278          | 302,380             | (289,620)           |\n\nFurther information on netting arrangements of derivative financial instruments can be found within Note 18.\n\nThe fair values and notional amounts of derivative instruments held for trading and held for risk management are set out in the following table:\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n441\n\n<!-- image -->",

Interest rate risk also includes exposure to inflation risk for certain types of investments.\n- \u25aa Currency risk - arises due to assets or liabilities being denominated in different currencies than the functional currency of the relevant entity. At a consolidated level, currency risk also arises when the functional currency of subsidiaries are different from the parent.\n- \u25aa Contractually linked inflation risk - arises from financial instruments within contractually specified inflation risk. The Group does not hedge inflation risk that arises from other activities.\n\nIn order to hedge these risks, the Group uses the following hedging instruments:\n\n- \u25aa Interest rate derivatives to swap interest rate exposures into either fixed or variable rates.\n- \u25aa Currency derivatives to swap foreign currency exposures into the entity's functional currency, and net investment exposure to local currency.\n- \u25aa Inflation derivatives to swap inflation exposure into either fixed or variable interest rates.\n\nIn some cases, certain items which are economically hedged may be ineligible hedged items for the purposes of IAS 39, such as core deposits and equity. In these instances, a proxy hedging solution can be utilised whereby portfolios of floating rate assets are designated as eligible hedged items in cash flow hedges.\n\nIn some hedging relationships, the Group designates risk components of hedged items as follows:\n\n- \u25aa Benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, such as the Risk Free Rate (RFR) component.\n- \u25aa Inflation risk as a contractually specified component of a debt instrument.\n- \u25aa Spot exchange rate risk for foreign currency financial assets or financial liabilities.\n- \u25aa Components of cash flows of hedged items, for example certain interest payments for part of the life of an instrument.\n\nUsing the benchmark interest rate risk results in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge accounting relationship.\n\nIn respect of many of the Group's hedge accounting relationships, the hedged item and hedging instrument change frequently due to the dynamic nature of the risk management and hedge accounting strategy. The Group applies hedge accounting to dynamic scenarios, predominantly in relation to interest rate risk, with a combination of hedged items in order for its financial statements to reflect as closely as possible the economic risk management undertaken. In some cases, if the hedge accounting objective changes, the relevant hedge accounting relationship is de-designated and is replaced with a different hedge accounting relationship.\n\nChanges in the GBP value of net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, resulting in a movement in CET1 capital. The Group mitigates this by matching the CET1 capital movements to the revaluation of the foreign currency RWA exposures. Net investment hedges are designated where necessary to reduce the exposure to movement in a particular exchange rate to within limits mandated by Risk. As far as possible, existing external currency liabilities are designated as the hedging instruments.\n\nThe hedging instruments share the same risk exposures as the hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is determined with reference to quantitative tests, predominantly regression testing, but to the extent hedging instruments are exposed to different risks than the hedged items, this could result in hedge ineffectiveness or hedge accounting failures.\n\nSources of ineffectiveness include the following:\n\n- \u25aa Mismatches between the contractual terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument, including basis differences.\n- \u25aa Changes in credit risk of the hedging instruments.\n- \u25aa If a hedging relationship becomes over-hedged, for example in hedges of net investments if the net asset value designated at the start of the period falls below the amount of the hedging instrument.\n- \u25aa Cash flow hedges using external swaps with non-zero fair values.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n443",

They are subsequently remeasured at fair value and changes therein (except for those relating to impairment, interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses) are recognised in other comprehensive income until the assets are sold. Interest (calculated using the effective interest method) is recognised in the income statement in net interest income (Note 3). Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is included in net investment income (Note 6).\n\nIn determining whether the business model is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, it is determined that both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are integral to achieving the objective of the business model. The Group will consider past sales and expectations about future sales to establish if the business model is achieved.\n\nFor equity securities that are not held for trading, the Group may make an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present subsequent changes in the fair value of the instrument in other comprehensive income (except for dividend income which is recognised in profit or loss).\n\n|                                                                   | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Debt securities and other eligible bills                          | 71,059    | 64,832    |\n| Equity securities                                                 | 6         | 8         |\n| Loans and advances                                                | 771       | 222       |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 71,836    | 65,062    |\n\n## 16 Financial liabilities designated at fair value\n\n## Accounting for liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, financial liabilities may be designated at fair value, with gains and losses taken to the income statement within net trading income (Note 5) and net investment income (Note 6). Movements in own credit are reported through other comprehensive income, unless the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in P&L. In these scenarios, all gains and losses on that liability (including the effects of changes in the credit risk of the liability) are presented in P&L. On derecognition of the financial liability no amount relating to own credit risk is recycled to the income statement. The Group has the ability to make the fair value designation when holding the instruments at fair value reduces an accounting mismatch (caused by an offsetting liability or asset being held at fair value), or is managed by the Group on the basis of its fair value, or includes terms that have substantive derivative characteristics (Note 14).\n\nThe details on how the fair value amounts are arrived at for financial liabilities designated at fair value are described in Note 17.\n\n|                                                           | 2023       | 2023                               | 2022       | 2022                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                                           | Fair value | Contractual amount due on maturity | Fair value | Contractual amount due on maturity |\n|                                                           | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m                                 | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m                                 |\n| Debt securities                                           | 68,261     | 82,820                             | 57,846     | 73,757                             |\n| Deposits                                                  | 43,552     | 44,862                             | 41,037     | 42,455                             |\n| Repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing | 185,716    | 186,593                            | 172,746    | 173,511                            |\n| Other financial liabilities                               | 10         | 10                                 | 8          | 8                                  |\n| Financial liabilities designated at fair value            | 297,539    | 314,285                            | 271,637    | 289,731                            |\n\nThe cumulative own credit net loss recognised is \u00a3307m (2022: \u00a3674m gain).\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n448\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, financial assets are held at fair value through profit or loss if they do not contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, or if the financial asset is not held in a business model that is either (i) a business model to collect the contractual cash flows or (ii) a business model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling. Subsequent changes in fair value for these instruments are recognised in the income statement in net investment income, except if reporting it in trading income reduces an accounting mismatch.\n\nWherever possible, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument. For many of the Group's financial assets and liabilities, especially derivatives, quoted prices are not available and valuation models are used to estimate fair value. The models calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract and then discount these values back to a present value. These models use as their basis independently sourced market inputs including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities and commodities prices, option volatilities and currency rates.\n\nFor financial liabilities measured at fair value, the carrying amount reflects the effect on fair value of changes in own credit spreads derived from observable market data such as in primary issuance and redemption activity for structured notes.\n\nOn initial recognition, it is presumed that the transaction price is the fair value unless there is observable information available in an active market to the contrary.\n\nFor valuations that have made use of unobservable inputs, the difference between the model valuation and the initial transaction price (Day one profit) is recognised in profit or loss either: on a straight-line basis over the term of the transaction; or over the period until all inputs will become observable where appropriate; or released in full when previously unobservable inputs become observable.\n\nVarious factors influence the availability of observable inputs and these may vary from product to product and change over time. Factors include the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the marketplace, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction (bespoke or generic). To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are not observable in the market, the determination of fair value can be more subjective, dependent on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques.\n\nThe sensitivity of valuations used in the financial statements to possible changes in significant unobservable inputs is shown on page 456.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe valuation of financial instruments often involves a significant degree of judgement and complexity, in particular where valuation models make use of unobservable inputs ('Level 3' assets and liabilities). This note provides information on these instruments, including the related unrealised gains and losses recognised in the period, a description of significant valuation techniques and unobservable inputs, and a sensitivity analysis.\n\nClimate-related risks are assumed to be included in the fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets. Within less active markets, for counterparties and instruments identified as being more susceptible to climate change risk, an impact assessment was performed through increasing their probability of default. The change in valuation of the assets and liabilities from this assessment was sufficiently immaterial to necessitate any amendment to the reported year end valuations.\n\n## Valuation\n\nAssets and liabilities according to a hierarchy that reflects the observability of significant market inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below with judgement applied in determining the boundary between Level 2 and 3 classification.\n\n## Quoted market prices - Level 1\n\nAssets and liabilities are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market. Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Valuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. Valuations based on observable inputs include assets and liabilities such as swaps and forwards which are valued using market standard pricing techniques, and options that are commonly traded in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable. For certain instruments that derive a fair value using unobservable inputs that are not considered significant, then the asset or liability may be classified as Level 2.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n449",

A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price. Unobservable input levels are generally determined via reference to observable inputs, historical observations or using other analytical techniques.\n\nThe following table shows the Group's assets and liabilities that are held at fair value disaggregated by valuation technique (fair value hierarchy) and balance sheet classification:\n\n## Assets and liabilities held at fair value\n\n|                                                                    | 2023     | 2023                  | 2023    | 2023                 | 2022 Valuation technique using   | 2022 Valuation technique using   | 2022 Valuation technique using   | 2022 Valuation technique using   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------|---------|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                                                    | Level 1  | Level 2               | Level 3 | Total                | Level 1                          | Level 2                          | Level 3                          | Total                            |\n| As at 31 December                                                  | \u00a3m       | \u00a3m                    | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m                   | \u00a3m                               | \u00a3m                               | \u00a3m                               | \u00a3m                               |\n| Trading portfolio assets                                           | 94,658   | 73,438                | 6,509   | 174,605              | 62,478                           | 64,855                           | 6,480                            | 133,813                          |\n| Financial assets at fair value through the income  statement       | 5,831    | 192,571               | 8,249   | 206,651              | 5,720                            | 198,723                          | 9,125                            | 213,568                          |\n| Derivative financial assets                                        | 107      | 253,189               | 3,540   | 256,836              | 10,054                           | 287,152                          | 5,174                            | 302,380                          |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income | 30,247   | 40,511                | 1,078   | 71,836               | 20,704                           | 44,347                           | 11                               | 65,062                           |\n| Investment property                                                | -

The sensitivity methodologies applied take account of the nature of the valuation techniques used, as well as the availability and reliability of observable proxy and historical data and the impact of using alternative models.\n\nSensitivities are dynamically calculated on a monthly basis. The calculation is based on range or spread data of a reliable reference source or a scenario based on relevant market analysis alongside the impact of using alternative models. Sensitivities are calculated without reflecting the impact of any diversification in the portfolio.\n\nThe valuation techniques used, observability and sensitivity analysis for material products within Level 3, are described below.\n\n## Interest rate derivatives\n\nDescription: Derivatives linked to interest rates or inflation indices. The category includes futures, interest rate and inflation swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, inflation options, balance guaranteed swaps and other exotic interest rate derivatives.\n\nValuation: Interest rate and inflation derivatives are generally valued using curves of forward rates constructed from market data to project and discount the expected future cash flows of trades. Instruments with optionality are valued using volatilities implied from market inputs, and use industry standard or bespoke models depending on the product type.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n450\n\n<!-- image -->",

The agreements are primarily short-term in nature.\n\nValuation: Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are generally valued by discounting the expected future cash flows using industry standard models that incorporate market interest rates and repurchase rates, based on the specific details of the transaction.\n\nObservability: Inputs are deemed observable up to liquid maturities or for consensus pricing with low pricing-range and are determined based on the specific features of the transaction. Unobservable inputs are generally set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another reasonable method.\n\n## Loans\n\nDescription : A drawn lending facility issued to corporate clients and customers.\n\nValuation: Loans are valued either using a price-based approach, or  through  models that discount expected future cash flows based on interest rates and loan spreads.\n\nObservability: Within this loan population, the price or loan spread may be  generally unobservable.\n\n## Private equity investments\n\nDescription: Includes investments in equity holdings in operating companies not quoted on a public exchange.\n\nValuation: Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the 'International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines' which require the use of a number of individual pricing benchmarks such as the prices of recent transactions in the same or similar entities, discounted cash flow analysis and comparison with the earnings or revenue multiples of listed companies. While the valuation of unquoted equity instruments is subjective by nature, the relevant methodologies are commonly applied by other market participants and have been consistently applied over time.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Unobservable inputs include earnings or revenue estimates, multiples of comparative companies, marketability discounts and discount rates.\n\n## Other\n\nDescription: Other includes funds and fund-linked products, issued debt, government sponsored debt, asset backed securities, equity cash products  and  investment property.\n\n## Assets and liabilities reclassified between Level 1 and Level 2\n\nDuring the period, there were no material transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 (2022: there were no material transfers between Level 1 and Level 2).\n\n## Level 3 movement analysis\n\nThe following table summarises the movements in the Level 3 balances during the period. Transfers have been reflected as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year.\n\nAsset and liability transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 are primarily due to i) an increase or decrease in observable market activity related to an input or ii) a change in the significance of the unobservable input, with assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 if an unobservable input is deemed significant.\n\n## Analysis of movements in Level 3 assets and liabilities\n\n|                                                                          | As at 1     |           |                       |        |              | Total gains and (losses)  in the period  recognised in the  income statement   | Total gains and (losses)  in the period  recognised in the  income statement   | Total gains  or (losses)   | Transfers    | Transfers      |                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|--------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                          | January     |           |                       |        |              | Trading  income 2                                                              | Other  income                                                                  | recognised                 |              |                | As at 31  December |\n|                                                                          | 2023        | Purchases | Sales                 | Issues | Settlements  |                                                                                |                                                                                | in OCI                     | In           | Out            | 2023               |\n| Corporate debt                                                           | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m                    | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m           | \u00a3m                                                                             | \u00a3m                                                                             | \u00a3m                         | \u00a3m           | \u00a3m             | \u00a3m                 |\n|                                                                          | 597         | 352       | (146)                 | -

Points are a percentage of par; for example, 100 points equals 100% of par. A basis point equals 1/100th of 1%; for example, 150 basis points equals 1.5%.\n- 3 Certain derivative instruments are classified as Level 3 due to a significant unobservable credit spread input into the calculation of the Credit Valuation Adjustment for the instruments. The range of significant unobservable credit spreads is between 29-1672bps (2022: 17-2,159bps).\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements (continued)\n\nAssets and liabilities held at fair value\n\nThe following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the table above, and the sensitivity of fair value measurement of the instruments categorised as Level 3 assets or liabilities to increases in significant unobservable inputs. Where sensitivities are described, the inverse relationship will also generally apply.\n\nWhere reliable interrelationships can be identified between significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurement, a description of those interrelationships is included below.\n\n## Forwards\n\nA price or rate that is applicable to a financial transaction that will take place in the future.\n\nIn general, a significant increase in a forward in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the contracted receiver of the underlying (currency, bond, commodity, etc.), but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\n## Credit spread\n\nCredit spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate. Credit spreads reflect the additional yield that a market participant demands for taking on exposure to the credit risk of an instrument and form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.\n\nIn general, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation will result in a movement in a fair value decrease for a cash asset.\n\nFor a derivative instrument, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\n## Volatility\n\nVolatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in return for a given derivative underlying. It is an estimate of how much a particular underlying instrument input or index will change in value over time. In general, volatilities are implied from observed option prices. For unobservable options the implied volatility may reflect additional assumptions about the nature of the underlying risk, and the strike/ maturity profile of a specific contract.\n\nIn general a significant increase in volatility in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the holder of a simple option, but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\nThere may be interrelationships between unobservable volatilities and other unobservable inputs (e.g. when equity prices fall, implied equity volatilities generally rise) but these are generally specific to individual markets and may vary over time.\n\n## Correlation\n\nCorrelation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation can be a significant input into valuation of derivative contracts with more than one underlying instrument. Credit correlation generally refers to the correlation between default processes for the separate names that make up the reference pool of a CDO structure.\n\nA significant increase in correlation in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\n## Comparable price\n\nComparable instrument prices are used in valuation by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable observable instrument, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to account for relevant differences such as maturity or credit quality. Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable and unobservable instruments in order to establish a value.\n\nLoans includes a portfolio of loans extended to clients within the Group's leveraged finance business. Leveraged finance loans are originated where Barclays provide financing commitments to clients to facilitate strategic transactions such as leverage buyouts and acquisitions. The sensitivity of the portfolio to unobservable inputs is judgmental reflecting their illiquid nature and the significance of unobservable price inputs to the valuation.\n\nIn general, a significant increase in comparable price in isolation will result in an increase in the price of the unobservable instrument. For derivatives, a change in the comparable price in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\n## Loan spread\n\nLoan spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate. Loan spreads typically reflect credit quality, the level of comparable assets such as gilts and other factors, and form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.\n\nLoans containing unobservable input loan spreads into their valuation primarily consist of long-dated fixed rate loans extended to counterparties in the UK Education, Social Housing and Local Authority sectors (ESHLA). The loans are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to their illiquid nature and the significance of unobservable loan spreads to the valuation. Valuation uncertainty arises from the long-dated nature of the portfolio, the lack of secondary market in the loans and the lack of observable loan spreads. The majority of ESHLA loans are to borrowers in heavily regulated sectors that are considered extremely low credit risk, and have a history of near zero defaults since inception. While the overall loan spread range is from 40bps to 307bps (2022: 50bps to 589bps), the vast majority of spreads are concentrated towards the bottom end of this range, with 98% of the loan notional being valued with spreads less than 200bps for the current period.\n\nIn general, a significant increase in loan spreads in isolation will result in a fair value decrease for a loan.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Unfavourable changes shown in the table above are partly provided for through the capital and prudential valuation adjustment framework\n\n## Fair value adjustments\n\nKey balance sheet valuation adjustments are quantified below:\n\n|                                                              | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Exit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads | (569)     | (577)     |\n| Uncollateralised derivative funding                          | (4)       | (11)      |\n| Derivative credit valuation adjustments                      | (209)     | (319)     |\n| Derivative debit valuation adjustments                       | 144       | 208       |\n\n## Exit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads\n\nThe Group uses mid-market pricing where it is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid price (which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets). For other financial assets and liabilities, bid-offer adjustments are recorded to reflect the exit level for the expected close out strategy. The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves calculating the net risk exposure by offsetting long and short positions by strike and term in accordance with the risk management and hedging strategy.\n\nBid-offer levels are generally derived from market quotes such as broker data. Less liquid instruments may not have a directly observable bid-offer level. In such instances, an exit price adjustment may be derived from an observable bid-offer level for a comparable liquid instrument, or determined by calibrating to derivative prices, or by scenario or historical analysis.\n\nExit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads have decreased by \u00a38m to \u00a3(569)m.\n\n## Discounting approaches for derivative instruments\n\n## Collateralised\n\nIn line with market practice, the methodology for discounting collateralised derivatives takes into account the nature and currency of the collateral that can be posted within the relevant credit support annex (CSA). The CSA aware discounting approach recognises the 'cheapest to deliver' option that reflects the ability of the party posting collateral to change the currency of the collateral.\n\n## Uncollateralised\n\nA fair value adjustment of \u00a3(4)m is applied to account for the impact of incorporating the cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivative portfolios and collateralised derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not allow the rehypothecation of collateral received. The  derivative funding adjustment  has decreased by \u00a37m to \u00a3(4)m .\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n456\n\n<!-- image -->",

These adjustments are calculated for uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivatives across all asset classes. Derivative credit valuation adjustments and Derivative debit valuation adjustments are calculated using estimates of exposure at default, probability of default and recovery rates, at a counterparty level. Counterparties include (but are not limited to) corporates, sovereigns and sovereign agencies and supranationals.\n\nExposure at default is generally estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors through approximating with a more vanilla structure, or by using current or scenario-based mark to market as an estimate of future exposure.\n\nProbability of default and recovery rate information is generally sourced from the CDS markets. Where this information is not available, or considered unreliable, alternative approaches are taken based on mapping internal counterparty ratings onto historical or marketbased default and recovery information.\n\nDerivative credit valuation adjustments decreased by \u00a3110m to \u00a3(209)m as a result of tightening input counterparty credit spreads. Derivative debit valuation adjustments decreased by \u00a364m to \u00a3144m as a result of tightening input Barclays Bank PLC credit spreads .\n\nCorrelation between counterparty credit and underlying derivative risk factors, termed 'wrong-way,' or 'right-way' risk, is not systematically incorporated into the derivative credit valuation adjustments calculation but is adjusted where the underlying exposure is directly related to the counterparty.\n\nBarclays continues to monitor market practices and activity to ensure the approach to uncollateralised derivative valuation remains appropriate.\n\n## Portfolio exemptions\n\nThe Group uses the portfolio exemption in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement to measure the fair value of groups of financial assets and liabilities. Instruments are measured using the price that would be received to sell a net long position (i.e. an asset) for a particular risk exposure or to transfer a net short position (i.e. a liability) for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date under current market conditions. Accordingly, the Group measures the fair value of the group of financial assets and liabilities consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.\n\n## Unrecognised gains as a result of the use of valuation models using unobservable inputs\n\nThe amount that has yet to be recognised in income that relates to the difference between the transaction price (the fair value at initial recognition) and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using unobservable inputs been used on initial recognition, less amounts subsequently recognised, is \u00a3205m (2022: \u00a3126m) for financial instruments measured at fair value and \u00a3192m (2022: \u00a3216m) for financial instruments carried at amortised cost. There are additions and FX loss of \u00a3136m (2022: \u00a359m additions and FX gains), and amortisation and releases of \u00a357m (2022: \u00a366m) for financial instruments measured at fair value and additions of \u00a30m (2022: \u00a30m) and amortisation and releases of \u00a324m (2022: \u00a314m) for financial instruments measured at amortised cost.\n\n## Third-party credit enhancements\n\nStructured and brokered certificates of deposit issued by Barclays are insured up to $250,000 per depositor by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the US. The FDIC is funded by premiums that Barclays and other banks pay for deposit insurance coverage. The carrying value of these issued certificates of deposit that are designated under the IFRS 9 fair value option includes this third party credit enhancement. The on-balance sheet value of these brokered certificates of deposit amounted to \u00a35,162m (2022: \u00a35,197m).\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a wide range of valuation techniques are available, it may not be appropriate to directly compare this fair value information to independent market sources or other financial institutions. Different valuation methodologies and assumptions can have a significant impact on fair values which are based on unobservable inputs.\n\n## Financial assets\n\n## Loans and advances at amortised cost\n\nThe fair value of loans and advances, for the purpose of this disclosure, is derived from discounting expected cash flows in a way that reflects the current market price for lending to issuers of similar credit quality. Where market data or credit information on the underlying borrowers is unavailable, a number of proxy/extrapolation techniques are employed to determine the appropriate discount rates. For 2023, the fair value is lower than carrying value mainly on fixed rate products driven by rising interest rates. The majority will be part of a wider portfolio which includes fair valued instruments that are not presented in this table .\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing\n\nThe fair value of reverse repurchase agreements approximates carrying amount as these balances are generally short dated and fully collateralised.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n## Deposits at amortised cost\n\nIn many cases, the fair value disclosed approximates carrying value because the instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently, such as customer accounts and other deposits and short-term debt securities.\n\nThe fair value for deposits with longer-term maturities, mainly time deposits, are estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Consequently, the fair value discount is minimal.\n\nRepurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing\n\nThe fair value of repurchase agreements approximates carrying amounts as these balances are generally short dated.\n\n## Debt securities in issue\n\nFair values of other debt securities in issue are based on quoted prices where available, or where the instruments are short dated, carrying amount approximates fair value.\n\n## Subordinated liabilities\n\nFair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital are based on quoted market rates for the issuer concerned or issuers with similar terms and conditions.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n458\n\n<!-- image -->",

Details regarding the Group's liquidity and capital position can be found in the Treasury and Capital risk section.\n\n## 19 Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Accounting for property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost, which includes direct and incremental acquisition costs less accumulated depreciation and provisions for impairment, if required. Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in enhancement of the asset.\n\nDepreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives. Depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances including consideration on future Climate and Sustainability investments.\n\nThe Group uses the following annual rates in calculating depreciation:\n\n| Annual rates in calculating depreciation               | Depreciation rate                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Freehold land                                          | Not depreciated                      |\n| Freehold buildings                                     | 2-3.3%                               |\n| Leasehold property                                     | Over the remaining life of the lease |\n| Costs of adaptation of freehold and leasehold property | 6-10%                                |\n| Equipment installed in freehold and leasehold property | 6-10%                                |\n| Computers and similar equipment                        | 17-33%                               |\n| Fixtures and fittings and other equipment              | 9-20%                                |\n\nCosts of adaptation and installed equipment are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the lease or the depreciation rates noted in the table above.\n\n## Investment property\n\nThe Group initially recognises investment property at cost, and subsequently at fair value at each balance sheet date, reflecting market conditions at the reporting date. Gains and losses on remeasurement are included in the income statement.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n460\n\n<!-- image -->",

Refer to Note 20 for further details.\n- 2 Disposals primarily pertain to  fully depreciated assets which are not in use.\n\nProperty rentals of \u00a312m (2022: \u00a310m) have been included in other income.\n\nThe fair value of investment property is determined by reference to current market prices for similar properties, adjusted as necessary for condition and location, or by reference to recent transactions updated to reflect current economic conditions. Discounted cash flow techniques may be employed to calculate fair value where there have been no recent transactions, using current external market inputs such as market rents and interest rates. Valuations are carried out by management with the support of appropriately qualified independent valuers.\n\n## 20 Leases\n\n## Accounting for leases\n\nWhen the Group is the lessee, it is required to recognise both:\n\n- \u25aa A lease liability, measured at the present value of remaining cash flows on the lease, and\n- \u25aa A right of use (ROU) asset, measured at the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any lease payments made prior to commencement date, initial direct costs, and estimated costs of restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the lease, less any lease incentives received.\n\nSubsequently the lease liability will increase for the accrual of interest, resulting in a constant rate of return throughout the life of the lease, and reduce when payments are made. The right of use asset will amortise to the income statement over the life of the lease.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU asset, or is recorded in the income statement if the carrying amount of the ROU asset has been reduced to nil.\n\nOn the balance sheet, the ROU assets are included within property, plant and equipment and the lease liabilities are included within other liabilities.\n\nThe Group applies the recognition exemption in IFRS 16 for leases with a term not exceeding 12 months. For these leases the lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

A finance lease is a lease which confers substantially all the risks and rewards of the leased assets on the lessee. An operating lease is a lease where substantially all of the risks and rewards of the leased asset remain with the lessor.\n\n## As a Lessor\n\nFinance lease receivables are included within loans and advances at amortised cost.\n\nThe following table sets out a maturity analysis of lease receivables, showing the lease payments to be received after the reporting date.\n\n|                        | 2023                                             | 2023                   | 2023                                                  | 2023                           | 2022                                             | 2022                   | 2022                                                  | 2022                           |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                        | Gross  investment in  finance lease  receivables | Future finance  income | Present value  of minimum  lease  payments receivable | Unguaranteed  residual  values | Gross  investment in  finance lease  receivables | Future finance  income | Present value  of minimum  lease  payments receivable | Unguaranteed  residual  values |\n|                        | \u00a3m                                               | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                                                    | \u00a3m                             | \u00a3m                                               | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                                                    | \u00a3m                             |\n| Not more than one year | 3                                                | -                      | 3                                                     | -                              | 14                                               | (1)                    | 13                                                    | -                              |\n| One to two years       | 2                                                | -                      | 2                                                     | -                              | 9                                                | (1)                    | 8                                                     | -                              |\n| Two to three years     | -                                                | -                      | -                                                     | -                              | 2                                                | -                      | 2                                                     | -                              |\n| Three to four years    | -                                                | -                      | -                                                     | -                              | 1                                                | -                      | 1                                                     | -                              |\n| Four to five years     | -                                                | -                      | -                                                     | -                              | 1                                                | -                      | 1                                                     | -                              |\n| Over five years        | -                                                | -                      | -                                                     | -                              | 1                                                | -                      | 1                                                     | -                              |\n| Total                  | 5                                                | -                      | 5                                                     | -                              | 28                                               | (2)                    | 26                                                    | -                              |\n\nBarclays Asset Finance provided leasing and other asset finance facilities across a broad range of asset types to business and individual customers. There is no significant impairment allowance for finance lease receivables in current and previous year.\n\nThe Group does not have any material operating leases as a lessor.\n\n## Finance lease income\n\nFinance lease income is included within interest income. The following table shows amounts recognised in the income statement during the year.\n\n|                                             | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Finance income from net investment in lease | 1         | 2         |\n| Profit on sales                             | -         | -         |\n\n## As a Lessee\n\nThe Group leases various offices, branches and other premises under non-cancellable lease arrangements to meet its operational business requirements. In some instances, Barclays will sublease property to third parties when it is no longer needed to meet business requirements. Currently, Barclays does not have any material subleasing arrangements.\n\nROU asset balances relate to property leases only. Refer to Note 19 for the carrying amount of ROU assets.\n\nThe total expenses recognised during the year for short term leases were \u00a32m (2022: \u00a31m). The portfolio of short term leases to which Barclays is exposed at the end of the year is not dissimilar to the expenses recognised in the year.\n\n|                                 | Lease liabilities   | Lease liabilities   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                 | 2023                | 2022                |\n|                                 | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m                  |\n| As at 1 January                 | 1,216               | 1,317               |\n| Interest expense                | 54                  | 56                  |\n| New leases                      | 19                  | 42                  |\n| Disposals                       | (11)                | (13)                |\n| Cash payments 1                 | (406)               | (239)               |\n| Exchange and other movements    | 99                  | 53                  |\n| As at 31 December (see Note 22) | 971                 | 1,216               |\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 Cash payments include one time lease liability payment of \u00a3182m related to structural cost action in relation to the real estate review.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n462\n\n<!-- image -->",

Currently, Barclays has 517 (2022: 401) leases out of the total 756 (2022: 896) leases which have variable lease payment terms based on market-based pricing adjustments. Of the gross cash flows identified above \u00a31,062m (2022: \u00a31,087m) is attributable to leases with some degree of variability predominately linked to market-based pricing adjustments.\n- \u25aa Extension and termination options: The table above represents Barclays' best estimate of future cash outflows for leases, including assumptions regarding the exercising of contractual extension and termination options. The above gross cash flows have been reduced by \u00a3441m (2022: \u00a3516m) for leases where Barclays is highly expected to exercise an early termination option. However, there is no significant impact where Barclays is expected to exercise an extension option.\n\nIn 2023, Group does not have any sale and leaseback transaction (2022: \u00a388m).\n\nThe Group does not have any restrictions or covenants imposed by the lessor on its property leases which restrict its businesses.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n463",

The test involves comparing the carrying value of a cash generating unit (CGU) including goodwill with the present value of the pre-tax cash flows, discounted at a rate of interest that reflects the inherent risks, of the CGU to which the goodwill relates, or the CGU's fair value if this is higher.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are initially recognised when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, the cost can be measured reliably and, in the case of intangible assets not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow from their use.\n\nFor internally generated intangible assets, only costs incurred during the development phase are capitalised. Expenditure in the research phase is expensed when it is incurred.\n\nIntangible assets are stated at cost (which is, in the case of assets acquired in a business combination, the acquisition date fair value) less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the pattern to which they contribute to future cash flows, generally using the amortisation periods set out below:\n\n| Annual rates in calculating amortisation   | Amortisation period   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Goodwill                                   | Not amortised         |\n| Internally generated software 1            | 12 months to 6 years  |\n| Other software                             | 12 months to 6 years  |\n| Customer lists                             | 12 months to 25 years |\n| Licences and other                         | 12 months to 25 years |\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 Exceptions to the above rate relate to useful lives of certain core banking platforms that are assessed individually and, if appropriate, amortised over longer periods ranging from 10 to 15 years.\n\nIntangible assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets not yet available for use are reviewed annually for impairment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.  The review of goodwill for impairment involves calculating a value in use (VIU) valuation which is compared to the carrying value of a CGU associated with the goodwill to determine whether any impairment has occurred. This includes the identification of independent CGUs across the organisation and the allocation of goodwill to those CGUs.\n\nThe calculation of a value in use contains a high degree of uncertainty in estimating the future cash flows and the rates used to discount them. Key judgements include determining the carrying value of the CGU, the cash flows and discount rates used in the calculation.\n\n- \u25aa The cash flow forecasts used by management involve judgement and are based upon a view of the prospects of the business and market conditions at the point in time the assessment is prepared, including the potential effect of climate change. The estimation of cash flows is sensitive to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding long-term sustainable cash flows.\n- \u25aa The discount rates applied to the future cash flows also involve judgement as they can have a significant impact on the valuation. The discount rates used are compared to market participants to ensure that they are appropriate and based on an estimated cost of equity for each CGU.\n- \u25aa The choice of a terminal growth rate used to determine the present value of the future cash flows of the CGUs is also a judgement that can impact the outcome of the assessment. The terminal growth rate and discount rates used may vary due to external market rates and economic conditions that are beyond management's control, including the potential effect of climate change.\n\nFurther details of some of the key judgements are set out below.\n\n## 2023 impairment review\n\nThe 2023 impairment review was performed during Q4 2023, with the approach and analysis set out below.\n\n## Determining the carrying value of CGUs\n\nThe carrying value for each CGU is the sum of the tangible equity, goodwill and intangible asset balances associated with that CGU.\n\nThe Group manages the assets and liabilities of its CGUs with reference to the tangible equity of the respective businesses. That tangible equity is derived from the level of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and capital required to be deployed in the CGU and therefore reflects its relative risk, as well as the level of capital that management consider a market participant would be required to hold and retain to support business growth.\n\nGoodwill is initially allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition that generated it. Goodwill is only reallocated if there is a change in its use or when reporting structures are altered in a way that changes the composition of one or more cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. During the year, the Merchant Acquiring business was split from the Cards & Payments business and was identified as a CGU.\n\n## Cash flows\n\nThe five-year cash flows used in the calculation are based on the formally agreed medium-term plans approved by the Board. These are prepared using macroeconomic assumptions which management consider reasonable and supportable, and reflect business agreed initiatives for the forecast period. The macroeconomic assumptions underpinning the medium term plan were determined during 2023 and management has considered whether there are subsequent significant changes in those assumptions which would adversely impact the results of the impairment review.\n\nAs required by IAS 36, estimates of future cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from restructuring initiatives where a constructive obligation to carry out the plan does not yet exist.\n\nIn line with prior year treatment, the Education, Social Housing and Local Authority (ESHLA) portfolio has been excluded from the Business Banking CGU cash flows. This is a legacy loan portfolio which was previously within the Non-Core bank and was not part of the business to which the goodwill relates. As such, the cash flows relating to this portfolio have been excluded from the Business Banking VIU calculation.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nIAS 36 requires that the discount rate used in a value in use calculation reflects the pre-tax rate an investor would require if they were to choose an investment that would generate similar cash flows to those that the entity expects to generate from the asset. In determining the discount rate, management identified the cost of equity associated with market participants that closely resemble the Group's CGUs. The cost of equity has been used as the discount rate in the impairment assessment and applied to the post tax cash flows of the CGU. This post-tax method incorporates the impact of changing tax rates on the cash flows and is expected to produce the same VIU result as a pre-tax method adjusted for varying tax rates. Using the resultant VIU the equivalent pre-tax discount rate has been calculated. The cost of equity rate used for all CGUs in this year's calculation has been increased to the reflect the relative volatility of Barclays PLC's stock price versus the average of our peers. The range of equivalent pre-tax discount rates applicable across the CGUs range from 14.7% to 18.5% (2022: 14.1% to 16.5%).\n\n## Terminal growth rate\n\nThe terminal growth rate is used to estimate the effect of projecting cash flows to the end of an asset's useful economic life. It is management's judgement that the cash flows associated with the CGUs will grow in line with the major economies in which the Group operates. Inflation rates are used as an approximation of future growth rates and form the basis of the terminal growth rates applied. The terminal growth rate used is 2.0% (2022: 2.0%).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The goodwill within Personal Banking was \u00a33,064m ( 2022: \u00a32,752m), of which \u00a32,501m (2022: \u00a32,501m) was attributable to Woolwich, and within Business Banking was \u00a3629m (2022: \u00a3629m), fully attributable to Woolwich.\n\nThe largest portion of the Group's intangible assets sits within the Investment Bank CGU, part of Barclays International with an allocation of \u00a31,043m (2022: \u00a3919m).\n\nThe recoverable amount for both Personal Banking and Business Banking have decreased in comparison to the 2022 impairment review, reflective of changes in the interest rate and macroeconomic outlook.\n\nAn impairment of \u00a333m of goodwill and \u00a3257m of intangible assets has been identified and recognised for the year, fully impairing the goodwill and intangibles of the Merchant Acquiring CGU.  In all other CGUs, the value in use exceeds the carrying value and no impairment has been identified.\n\nThe outcome of the impairment review for Personal Banking, Business Banking, Barclaycard UK and Cards and Payments  are set out below:\n\n| Cash generating unit   | Tangible equity   | Goodwill   | Intangibles   | Carrying value   | Value in use   | Value in use  exceeding carrying  value   | Value in use  exceeding carrying  value 2022   |\n|------------------------|-------------------|------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|                        | \u00a3m                | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m            | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m             | \u00a3m                                        | \u00a3m                                             |\n| Personal Banking       | 6,130             | 3,066      | 740           | 9,936            | 12,297         | 2,361                                     | 4,667                                          |\n| Cards and Payments     | 3,626             | 180        | 800           | 4,606            | 5,342          | 736                                       | 1,598                                          |\n| Business Banking       | 1,836             | 629        | 239           | 2,704            | 5,990          | 3,286                                     | 6,623                                          |\n| Barclaycard UK         | 1,938             | 179        | 164           | 2,281            | 2,307          | 26                                        | 364                                            |\n| Total                  | 13,530            | 4,054      | 1,943         | 19,527           | 25,936         | 6,409                                     | 13,252                                         |\n\nAll CGUs showed a reduction in value in use in the period which is mainly attributable to the increase in the discount rates used in the assessment as a result of increases in interest rates as well as the introduction of the Barclays share price volatility premium.\n\nThe value in use for Barclaycard UK has reduced to a level that an adverse movement in any of the key judgement areas would result in an impairment.\n\n## Sensitivity of key judgements\n\nThe CGUs are sensitive to possible adverse changes in the key assumptions that support the recoverable amount:\n\nCash flows: The medium-term plans used to determine the cash flows used in the VIU calculation rely on macroeconomic forecasts, including interest rates, GDP and unemployment, and forecast levels of market and client activity. Interest rate assumptions impact planned cash flows from both customer income and structural hedge contributions and therefore cash flow expectations are highly sensitive to movements in the yield curve. The cash flows also contain assumptions with regard to the prudential and financial conduct regulatory environment which may be subject to change. Given the current level of economic uncertainty, a 10% reduction in cash flows has been provided to show the sensitivity of the outcome to a change in these key assumptions.\n\nDiscount rate: The discount rate should reflect the market risk-free rate adjusted for the inherent risks of the business it is applied to. Management have identified discount rates for comparable businesses and consider these to be a reasonable estimate of a suitable market rate for the profile of the business unit being tested. The risk that these discount rates may not be appropriate is quantified below and shows the impact of a 100bps change in the discount rate.\n\nTerminal growth rate: The terminal growth rate is used to estimate the cash flows into perpetuity based on the expected longevity of the CGU's businesses. The terminal growth rate is sensitive to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The risk that using inflation data may not be appropriate for its determination is quantified below and shows the impact of 100bps change in the terminal growth rate.\n\nAllocated capital rate: Tangible equity is allocated based on the level of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and capital required to be deployed in the CGU which is dependent on the relative risk of businesses. The capital ratio used in determining the level of tangible equity allocated to the CGU and its capital cash flows could move over time. The impact of a 50bps increase in capital ratio is quantified below.\n\nThe sensitivity of the value in use to key judgements in the calculations for certain CGUs holding goodwill balances is set out below:\n\n|                      |                  |                 |                                           |                |                        | Reduction in headroom                     | Reduction in headroom                        | Reduction in headroom                        | Reduction in headroom                     | Change required to reduce headroom to zero   | Change required to reduce headroom to zero   | Change required to reduce headroom to zero   | Change required to reduce headroom to zero   |\n|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Cash generating unit | Carrying  value  | Value in  use   | Value in  use  exceeding  carrying  value | Discount  rate | Terminal  growth  rate | 100 bps  increase  in the  discount  rate | 100 bps  decrease  in terminal  growth  rate | 50 bps  increase to  allocated  capital rate | 10%  reduction in  forecasted  cash flows | Discount  rate                               | Terminal  growth  rate                       | Allocated  capital  rate                     | Cash  flows                                  |\n|                      | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m              | \u00a3m                                        | %              | %                      | \u00a3m                                        | \u00a3m                                           | \u00a3m                                           | \u00a3m                                        | %                                            | %                                            | %                                            | %                                            |\n| Personal Banking     |                  | 9,936    12,297 | 2,361                                     | 18.2           |                        | 2.0    (1,042)                            | (710)                                        | (263)                                        | (1,337)                                   | 2.5                                          | (4.1)                                        | 4.5                                          | (17.6)                                       |\n| Cards and Payments   | 4,606            | 5,342           | 736                                       | 16.8           | 2.0                    | (647)                                     | (473)                                        | (250)                                        | (724)                                     | 1.2                                          | (1.6)                                        | 1.5                                          | (10.2)                                       |\n| Total                | 14,542    17,639 |                 | 3,097                                     |                |                        |                                           |                                              |                                              |                                           |                                              |                                              |                                              |                                              |\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n467\n\n<!-- image -->",

Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, and it can be reliably estimated. Contingent liabilities reflect potential liabilities that are not recognised on the balance sheet.\n\n## 22 Other liabilities\n\n|                                                      | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Accruals and deferred income                         | 4,315     | 4,618     |\n| Other creditors                                      | 6,638     | 7,870     |\n| Items in the course of collection due to other banks | 89        | 85        |\n| Lease liabilities (refer to Note 20)                 | 971       | 1,216     |\n| Other liabilities                                    | 12,013    | 13,789    |\n\n## 23 Provisions\n\n## Accounting for provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is more likely than not that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, which can be reliably estimated.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe financial reporting of provisions involves a significant degree of judgement and is complex. Identifying whether a present obligation exists and estimating the probability, timing, nature and quantum of the outflows that may arise from past events requires judgements to be made based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to individual events and often requires specialist professional advice. When matters are at an early stage, accounting judgements and estimates can be difficult because of the high degree of uncertainty involved. Management continues to monitor matters as they develop to re-evaluate on an ongoing basis whether provisions should be recognised, however there can remain a wide range of possible outcomes and uncertainties, particularly in relation to legal, competition and regulatory matters, and as a result it is often not practicable to make meaningful estimates even when matters are at a more advanced stage.\n\nThe amount that is recognised as a provision can also be very sensitive to the assumptions made in calculating it. This gives rise to a large range of potential outcomes which require judgement in determining an appropriate provision level. See Note 25 for more detail of legal, competition and regulatory matters.\n\n|                                                                  | Redundancy and  restructuring                               | Customer redress   | Legal,  competition and  regulatory  matters   | Sundry provisions   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------|\n| As at 1 January 2023                                             | 136                                                         | 378                | 159                                            | 288                 | 961     |\n| Additions                                                        | 469                                                         | 84                 | 29                                             | 132                 | 714     |\n| Amounts utilised                                                 | (166)                                                       | (152)              | (75)                                           | (56)                | (449)   |\n| Unused amounts reversed                                          | (38)                                                        | (60)               | (11)                                           | (69)                | (178)   |\n| Exchange and other movements                                     | (4)                                                         | 45                 | (3)                                            | (6)                 | 32      |\n| As at 31 December 2023                                           | 397                                                         | 295                | 99                                             | 289                 | 1,080   |\n| Undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees 1      | Undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees 1 |                    |                                                |                     |         |\n| As at 1st January 2023                                           |                                                             |                    |                                                |                     | 583     |\n| Net change in expected credit loss provision and other movements |                                                             |                    |                                                |                     | (79)    |\n| As at 31 December 2023                                           |                                                             |                    |                                                |                     | 504     |\n| Total Provisions                                                 |                                                             |                    |                                                |                     |         |\n| As at 1st January 2023                                           |                                                             |                    |                                                |                     | 1,544   |\n| As at 31 December 2023                                           |                                                             |                    |                                                |                     | 1,584   |\n\n## Note\n\nProvisions expected to be recovered or settled within no more than 12 months after 31 December 2023 were \u00a31,357m (2022: \u00a31,348m).\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n468\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, when the Group has a detailed formal plan for restructuring a business and has raised valid expectations in those affected by the restructuring by announcing its main features or starting to implement the plan.\n\n## Customer redress\n\nCustomer redress provisions comprise the estimated cost of making redress payments to customers, clients and counterparties for losses or damages associated with inappropriate judgement in the execution of the Group's business activities.\n\n## Legal, competition and regulatory matters\n\nThe Group is engaged in various legal proceedings, both in the UK and a number of other overseas jurisdictions, including the US. For further information in relation to legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties, refer to Note 25.\n\n## Sundry provisions\n\nThis category includes provisions that do not fit into any of the other categories, such as fraud losses and dilapidation provisions.\n\n## Undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees\n\nImpairment allowance under IFRS 9 considers both the drawn and the undrawn counterparty exposure. For retail portfolios, the total impairment allowance is allocated to the drawn exposure to the extent that the allowance does not exceed the exposure as ECL is not reported separately. Any excess is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision. For wholesale portfolios, the impairment allowance on the undrawn exposure is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision. For further information, refer to the Credit risk section for loan commitments and financial guarantees on page 298.\n\n## 24 Contingent liabilities and commitments\n\n## Accounting for contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events and present obligations where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed unless the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources is remote.\n\nThe following table summarises the nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities and commitments which are not recorded onbalance sheet:\n\n|                                                                            | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security            | 17,353    | 17,760    |\n| Performance guarantees, acceptances and endorsements                       | 7,987     | 6,445     |\n| Total contingent liabilities and financial guarantees                      | 25,340    | 24,205    |\n| Of which: Financial guarantees and letters of credit carried at fair value | 1,266     | 1,423     |\n| Documentary credits and other short-term trade related transactions        | 2,352     | 1,748     |\n| Standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments                     | 388,085   | 393,760   |\n| Total commitments                                                          | 390,437   | 395,508   |\n| Of which: Loan commitments carried at fair value                           | 15,203    | 13,471    |\n\nProvisions for expected credit losses held against contingent liabilities and commitments equal \u00a3504m (2022: \u00a3583m) and are reported in Note 23.

The extent of the impact of these matters cannot always be predicted but may materially impact our operations, financial results, condition and prospects. Matters arising from a set of similar circumstances can give rise to either a contingent liability or a provision, or both, depending on the relevant facts and circumstances.\n\nThe recognition of provisions in relation to such matters involves critical accounting estimates and judgments in accordance with the relevant accounting policies applicable to Note 24, Provisions. We have not disclosed an estimate of the potential financial impact or effect on the Group of contingent liabilities where it is not currently practicable to do so. Various matters detailed in this note seek damages of an unspecified amount. While certain matters specify the damages claimed, such claimed amounts do not necessarily reflect the Group's potential financial exposure in respect of those matters.\n\nMatters are ordered under headings corresponding to the financial statements in which they are disclosed.\n\n## 1. Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC\n\n## Investigations into certain advisory services agreements and other proceedings\n\n## FCA proceedings\n\nIn 2008, Barclays Bank PLC and Qatar Holdings LLC entered into two advisory service agreements (the Agreements). The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) conducted an investigation into whether the Agreements may have related to Barclays PLC's capital raisings in June and November 2008 (the Capital Raisings) and therefore should have been disclosed in the announcements or public documents relating to the Capital Raisings. In 2013, the FCA issued warning notices (the Warning Notices) finding that Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC acted recklessly and in breach of certain disclosure-related listing rules, and that Barclays PLC was also in breach of Listing Principle 3. The financial penalty provided in the Warning Notices was \u00a350m. Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC contested the findings. In September 2022, the FCA's Regulatory Decisions Committee (RDC) issued Decision Notices finding that Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC breached certain disclosure-related listing rules. The RDC also found that in relation to the disclosures made in the Capital Raising of November 2008, Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC acted recklessly, and that Barclays PLC breached Listing Principle 3. The RDC upheld the combined penalty of \u00a350m on Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC, the same penalty as in the Warning Notices. Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC have referred the RDC's findings to the Upper Tribunal for reconsideration.\n\n## Other proceedings\n\nIn November 2023, Barclays received requests for arbitration from two Jersey special purpose vehicles connected to PCP International Finance Limited asserting claims in relation to the October 2008 capital raising. Barclays is defending these claims.\n\n## Investigations into LIBOR and other benchmarks and related civil actions\n\nRegulators and law enforcement agencies, including certain competition authorities, from a number of governments have conducted investigations relating to Barclays Bank PLC's involvement in allegedly manipulating certain financial benchmarks, such as LIBOR. Various individuals and corporates in a range of jurisdictions have threatened or brought civil actions against the Group and other banks in relation to the alleged manipulation of LIBOR and/or other benchmarks.\n\n## USD LIBOR civil actions\n\nThe majority of the USD LIBOR cases, which have been filed in various US jurisdictions, have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the US District Court in the Southern District of New York (SDNY). The complaints are substantially similar and allege, among other things, that Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital Inc. (BCI) and other financial institutions individually and collectively violated provisions of the US Sherman Antitrust Act (Antitrust Act), the US Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), the US Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and various state laws by manipulating USD LIBOR rates.\n\nPutative class actions and individual actions seek unspecified damages with the exception of one lawsuit, in which the plaintiffs are seeking no less than $100m in actual damages and additional punitive damages against all defendants, including Barclays Bank PLC. Some of the lawsuits also seek trebling of damages under the Antitrust Act and RICO.\n\n## Sterling LIBOR civil actions\n\nIn 2016, two putative class actions filed in the SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other Sterling LIBOR panel banks alleging, among other things, that the defendants manipulated the Sterling LIBOR rate in violation of the Antitrust Act, CEA and RICO, were consolidated. The defendants' motion to dismiss the claims was granted in 2018. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.\n\n## Japanese Yen LIBOR civil actions\n\nIn 2012, a putative class action was filed in the SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC and other Japanese Yen LIBOR panel banks by a lead plaintiff involved in exchange-traded derivatives and members of the Japanese Bankers Association's Euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (Euroyen TIBOR) panel. The complaint alleges, among other things, manipulation of the Euroyen TIBOR and Yen LIBOR rates and breaches of the CEA and the Antitrust Act. In 2014, the court dismissed the plaintiff's antitrust claims, and, in 2020, the court dismissed the plaintiff's remaining CEA claims.\n\nIn 2015, a second putative class action, making similar allegations to the above class action, was filed in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI. Barclays and the plaintiffs reached a settlement of $17.75m for both actions, which received final court approval in March 2023. This matter is now concluded.\n\n## ICE LIBOR civil action\n\nIn August 2020, an action related to the LIBOR benchmark administered by the Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and certain of its affiliates (ICE) was filed by a group of individual plaintiffs in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of\n\n<!-- image -->",

The plaintiffs' motion seeking, among other things, preliminary and permanent injunctions to enjoin the defendants from continuing to set LIBOR or enforce any financial instrument that relies in whole or in part on USD LIBOR was denied. The defendants' motion to dismiss the case was granted in September 2022. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which was dismissed in October 2023. The plaintiffs are appealing the dismissal.\n\n## Non-US benchmarks civil actions\n\nThere remains one claim, issued in 2017, against Barclays Bank PLC and other banks in the UK in connection with alleged manipulation of LIBOR. Proceedings have also been brought in a number of other jurisdictions in Europe, Argentina and Israel relating to alleged manipulation of LIBOR and EURIBOR. Additional proceedings in other jurisdictions may be brought in the future.\n\n## Foreign Exchange investigations and related civil actions\n\nThe Group has been the subject of investigations in various jurisdictions in relation to certain sales and trading practices in the Foreign Exchange market. Settlements were reached in various jurisdictions in connection with these investigations, including the EU and US. The financial impact of any remaining ongoing investigations is not expected to be material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position. Various individuals and corporates in a range of jurisdictions have threatened or brought civil actions against the Group and other banks in relation to alleged manipulation of Foreign Exchange markets.\n\n## US FX opt out civil action\n\nIn 2018, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI settled a consolidated action filed in the SDNY, alleging manipulation of Foreign Exchange markets (Consolidated FX Action), for a total amount of $384m. Also in 2018, a group of plaintiffs, who opted out of the Consolidated FX Action, filed a complaint in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other defendants. Some of the plaintiffs' claims were dismissed in 2020. Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, and BCI have reached a settlement of all claims against them in the matter. A settlement payment was made in April 2023 and the matter is now concluded . The financial impact of this settlement is not material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## US retail basis civil action\n\nIn 2015, a putative class action was filed against several international banks, including Barclays PLC and BCI, on behalf of a proposed class of individuals who exchanged currencies on a retail basis at bank branches (Retail Basis Claims). The SDNY has ruled that the Retail Basis Claims are not covered by the settlement agreement in the Consolidated FX Action. The Court subsequently dismissed all Retail Basis  Claims  against  the  Group  and  all  other  defendants.  The  plaintiffs  filed  an  amended  complaint.  The  defendants'  motion  for summary judgment was granted in March 2023, dismissing the plaintiffs' remaining claims. The plaintiffs have appealed the decision.\n\n## Non-US FX civil actions\n\nLegal proceedings have been brought or are threatened against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and Barclays Execution Services Limited (BX) in connection with alleged manipulation of Foreign Exchange in the UK, a number of other jurisdictions in Europe, Israel, Brazil and Australia. Additional proceedings may be brought in the future.\n\nThe above-mentioned proceedings include two purported class actions filed against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BX, BCI and other financial institutions in the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) in 2019. The CAT refused to certify these claims in the first quarter of 2022.  In July 2023 (as amended in November 2023), the Court of Appeal overturned the CAT's decision and found that the claims should be certified on an opt out basis. The Court of Appeal upheld the CAT's determination as to which of the two purported class representatives should be chosen to bring the claim. Subject to any further appeal, only the claim brought by the chosen class representative will now proceed in the CAT. Also in 2019, a separate claim was filed in the UK in the High Court of Justice (High Court), and subsequently transferred to the CAT, by various banks and asset management firms against Barclays Bank PLC and other financial institutions alleging breaches of European and UK competition laws related to FX trading. This claim has been settled as part of the settlement payment referred to under the US FX opt out civil action above and the matter is now concluded.\n\n## Metals-related civil actions\n\nA US civil complaint alleging manipulation of the price of silver in violation of the CEA, the Antitrust Act and state antitrust and consumer protection laws was brought by a proposed class of plaintiffs against a number of banks, including Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and BX, and transferred to the SDNY. The complaint was dismissed against these Barclays entities and certain other defendants in 2018, and against the remaining defendants in May 2023. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal of the complaint against all defendants.\n\nCivil actions have also been filed in Canadian courts against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital Canada Inc. and BCI on behalf of proposed classes of plaintiffs alleging manipulation of gold and silver prices.\n\n## US residential mortgage related civil actions\n\nThere are two US Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) related civil actions arising from unresolved repurchase requests submitted  by  Trustees  for  certain  RMBS,  alleging  breaches  of  various  loan-level  representations  and  warranties  (R&Ws)  made  by Barclays Bank PLC and/or a subsidiary acquired in 2007. In one action, the parties have agreed to settle the litigation. The financial impact of the settlement is not material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position. Barclays' motion to dismiss the other repurchase action was denied in October 2023. Barclays is appealing the decision.\n\n## Government and agency securities civil actions\n\n## Treasury auction securities civil actions\n\nConsolidated putative class action complaints filed in US federal court against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other financial institutions under the Antitrust Act and state common law allege that the defendants (i) conspired to manipulate the US Treasury securities market and/or (ii) conspired to prevent the creation of certain platforms by boycotting or threatening to boycott such trading platforms. The court dismissed the consolidated action in March 2021.The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The defendants' motion to dismiss\n\n<!-- image -->",

The plaintiffs appealed this decision, and in February 2024 the appellate court affirmed the dismissal.\n\nIn addition, certain plaintiffs have filed a related, direct action against BCI and certain other financial institutions, alleging that defendants conspired to fix and manipulate the US Treasury securities market in violation of the Antitrust Act, the CEA and state common law. This action remains stayed.\n\n## Supranational, Sovereign and Agency bonds civil actions\n\nCivil antitrust actions have been filed in the SDNY and Federal Court of Canada in Toronto against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI, BX, Barclays Capital Securities Limited and, with respect to the civil action filed in Canada only, Barclays Capital Canada, Inc. and other financial institutions alleging that the defendants conspired to fix prices and restrain competition in the market for US dollar-denominated Supranational, Sovereign and Agency bonds. The SDNY actions were dismissed and these matters are now concluded.\n\nIn the Federal Court of Canada action, the parties have reached a settlement in principle, which will require court approval. The financial impact of the settlement is not expected to be material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Variable Rate Demand Obligations civil actions\n\nCivil actions have been filed against Barclays Bank PLC and BCI and other financial institutions alleging the defendants conspired or colluded to artificially inflate interest rates set for Variable Rate Demand Obligations (VRDOs). VRDOs are municipal bonds with interest rates that reset on a periodic basis, most commonly weekly. Two actions in state court have been filed by private plaintiffs on behalf of the states of Illinois and California. Three putative class action complaints have been consolidated in the SDNY. In the consolidated SDNY class action, certain of the plaintiffs' claims were dismissed in November 2020 and June 2022 and the plaintiffs' motion for class certification was granted in September 2023, which means the case may proceed as a class action. The defendants are appealing this decision. In the California action, the California appeals court reversed the dismissal of the plaintiffs' claims in April 2023. In the Illinois action, the defendants reached a settlement with the Attorney General for the State of Illinois to resolve the litigation. The court approved the settlement in October 2023 and dismissed the matter. The financial impact of the settlement is not material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position. This matter is now concluded.\n\n## Odd-lot corporate bonds antitrust class action\n\nIn 2020, BCI, together with other financial institutions, were named as defendants in a putative class action. The complaint alleges a conspiracy to boycott developing electronic trading platforms for odd-lots and price fixing. The plaintiffs demand unspecified money damages. The defendants' motion to dismiss was granted in 2021 and the plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.\n\n## Credit Default Swap civil action\n\nA putative antitrust class action is pending in New Mexico federal court against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and various other financial institutions. The plaintiffs, the New Mexico State Investment Council and certain New Mexico pension funds, allege that the defendants conspired to manipulate the benchmark price used to value Credit Default Swap (CDS) contracts at settlement (i.e. the CDS final auction price). The plaintiffs allege violations of US antitrust laws and the CEA, and unjust enrichment under state law. The defendants' motion to dismiss was denied in June 2023.\n\n## Interest rate swap and credit default swap US civil actions\n\nBarclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI, together with other financial institutions that act as market makers for interest rate swaps (IRS), are named as defendants in several antitrust actions, including one putative class action and individual actions brought by certain swap execution facilities, which are consolidated in the SDNY. The complaints allege the defendants conspired to prevent the development of exchanges for IRS and demand unspecified money damages. The plaintiffs' motion for class certification was denied in December 2023, meaning the case cannot proceed as a class action. The plaintiffs have sought the court's leave to appeal that decision.\n\nIn 2017, Tera Group Inc. (Tera) filed a separate civil antitrust action in the SDNY claiming that certain conduct alleged in the IRS cases also caused Tera to suffer harm with respect to the Credit Default Swaps market. In 2019, the court dismissed Tera's claims for unjust enrichment and tortious interference but denied motions to dismiss the antitrust claims. Tera filed an amended complaint in January 2020. Barclays' motion to dismiss all claims was granted in August 2023. Tera has filed a Notice of Appeal.\n\n## BDC Finance L.L.C.\n\nIn 2008, BDC Finance L.L.C. (BDC) filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (NY Supreme Court), demanding damages of  $298m,  alleging  that  Barclays  Bank  PLC  had  breached  a  contract  in  connection  with  a  portfolio  of  total  return  swaps governed by an ISDA Master Agreement (the Master Agreement). Following a trial, the court ruled in 2018 that Barclays Bank PLC was not a defaulting party, which was affirmed on appeal. In April 2021, the trial court entered judgment in favour of Barclays Bank PLC for $3.3m and as yet to be determined legal fees and costs. BDC appealed. In January 2022, the appellate court reversed the trial court's summary judgment decision in favour of Barclays Bank PLC and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings. The parties filed cross-motions on the scope of trial. In January 2024, the court ruled in Barclays' favour. BDC is appealing, and the trial is adjourned until the appeal is decided.\n\nIn 2011, BDC's investment advisor, BDCM Fund Adviser, LLC and its parent company, Black Diamond Capital Holdings, LLC, also sued Barclays Bank PLC and BCI in Connecticut State Court for unspecified damages allegedly resulting from Barclays Bank PLC's conduct relating to the Master Agreement, asserting claims for violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and tortious interference with business and prospective business relations. This case has been withdrawn.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The complaints generally allege that Barclays Bank PLC and those banks engaged in a conspiracy to facilitate US dollar-denominated transactions for the Iranian Government and various Iranian banks, which in turn funded acts of terrorism that injured or killed the plaintiffs or the plaintiffs' family members. The plaintiffs seek to recover damages for pain, suffering and mental anguish under the provisions of the US Anti-Terrorism Act, which allow for the trebling of any proven damages.\n\nThe court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss three out of the six actions in the EDNY. The plaintiffs appealed in one action and the dismissal was affirmed , and judgment was entered, in January 2023. The court has given the plaintiffs until February 2024 to make a motion to vacate the judgment. The other two dismissed actions in the EDNY were consolidated into one action. The plaintiffs in that action,  and  in  one  other  action  in  the  EDNY,  filed  amended  complaints  in  December  2023.  The  two  other  actions  in  the  EDNY are currently stayed. Out of the two actions in the SDNY, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the first action. That action is stayed, and the second SDNY action is stayed pending any appeal on the dismissal of the first.\n\n## Shareholder derivative action\n\nIn November 2020, a purported Barclays shareholder filed a putative derivative action in New York state court against BCI and a number of  current  and  former  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Barclays  PLC  and  senior  executives  or  employees  of  the  Group.  The shareholder filed the claim on behalf of nominal defendant Barclays PLC, alleging that the individual defendants harmed the company through breaches of their duties, including under the Companies Act 2006. The plaintiff seeks damages on behalf of Barclays PLC for the losses that Barclays PLC allegedly suffered as a result of these alleged breaches. An amended complaint was filed in April 2021, which BCI and certain other defendants moved to dismiss. The motion to dismiss was granted in April 2022. The plaintiff appealed the decision, and the dismissal was unanimously affirmed in June 2023 by the First Judicial Department in New York. The plaintiff has sought leave to appeal the First Judicial Department's decision to the New York Court of Appeals.\n\n## Derivative transactions civil action\n\nIn 2021, Vestia, a Dutch housing association, brought a claim against Barclays Bank PLC in the UK in the High Court in relation to a series of derivative transactions entered into with Barclays Bank PLC between 2008 and 2011, seeking damages of \u00a3329m. Barclays Bank PLC is defending the claim and has made a counterclaim.\n\n## Skilled person review in relation to historic timeshare loans and associated matters\n\nClydesdale Financial Services Limited (CFS), which trades as Barclays Partner Finance and houses Barclays' point-of-sale finance business, was required by the FCA to undertake a skilled person review in 2020 following concerns about historic affordability assessments for certain loans to customers in connection with timeshare purchases. The skilled person review was concluded in 2021. CFS complied fully with the skilled person review requirements, including carrying out certain remediation measures. CFS was not required to conduct a full back book review. Instead, CFS reviewed limited historic lending to ascertain whether its practices caused customer harm and is remediating any examples of harm. This work was substantially completed during 2023, utilising provisions booked to account for any remediations.\n\n## Motor finance commission arrangements\n\nIn January 2024, the FCA announced that it was appointing a skilled person to undertake a review of the historical use of discretionary commission arrangements and sales in the motor finance market across several firms.  This follows two final decisions by the UK Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), including one upholding a complaint against CFS in relation to commission arrangements and disclosure in the sale of motor finance products and a number of complaints and court claims, including some against CFS.  Barclays will co-operate fully with the FCA's skilled person review, the outcome of which is unknown, including any potential financial impact.  The FCA plans to set out next steps on this matter by the end of September 2024. Barclays ceased operating in the motor finance market in late 2019.\n\n## Over-issuance of securities in the US\n\nIn March 2022, executive management became aware that Barclays Bank PLC had issued securities materially in excess of the set amount under its US shelf registration statements. As a result, Barclays Bank PLC commenced a rescission offer on 1 August 2022, by which Barclays Bank PLC offered to repurchase relevant affected securities from certain holders, which expired on 12 September 2022. Further, in September 2022, the SEC announced the resolution of its investigation of Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC relating to such over-issuance of securities.\n\nIn September 2022, a purported class action claim was filed in the US District Court in Manhattan seeking to hold Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and former and current executives responsible for declines in the price of Barclays PLC's American depositary receipts, which the plaintiffs claim occurred as a result of alleged misstatements and omissions in its public disclosures. The defendants have moved to dismiss the case. In addition, holders of a series of ETNs have brought claims against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, and former and current executives and board members in the US alleging, among other things, that Barclays' failure to disclose that these ETNs were unregistered securities misled investors and that, as a result, Barclays is liable for the holders' alleged losses following the suspension of further sales and issuances of such series of ETNs. Two such actions are purported class actions that have been consolidated into a single action in federal court in New York. Barclays has moved to dismiss the complaint.\n\nAny liabilities, claims or actions in connection with the over-issuance of securities under Barclays Bank PLC's US shelf registration statements could have an adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation as a frequent issuer in the securities markets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC\n\n## HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) assessments concerning UK Value Added Tax\n\nIn 2018, HMRC issued notices that have the effect of either removing certain Barclays overseas subsidiaries that have operations in the UK from Barclays' UK VAT group or preventing them from joining it. Supplies between members of a UK VAT group are generally free from VAT. The notices had both retrospective and prospective effect. Barclays has appealed HMRC's decisions to the First Tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) in relation to both the retrospective VAT assessments and the on-going VAT payments made since 2018. \u00a3181m of VAT (inclusive of interest) was assessed retrospectively by HMRC covering the periods 2014 to 2018, of which approximately \u00a3128m is expected to be attributed to Barclays Bank UK PLC and \u00a353m to Barclays Bank PLC. This retrospectively assessed VAT was paid in 2018 and an asset, adjusted to reflect expected eventual recovery, is recognised. Since 2018 Barclays has paid, and recognised as an expense, VAT on intra-group supplies from the relevant subsidiaries to the members of the VAT group .\n\n## FCA investigation into transaction monitoring\n\nThe FCA has been investigating Barclays' compliance with UK money laundering regulations and the FCA's rules and Principles for Businesses in an enforcement investigation which is focused on aspects of Barclays' transaction monitoring in relation to certain business lines now in Barclays Bank UK PLC. The FCA has informed Barclays that it is closing the enforcement investigation into this matter.\n\n## 3. Barclays PLC\n\n## Civil action in respect of Barclays' statements regarding the relationship between its former CEO and Jeffrey Epstein\n\nIn November 2023, a purported class action was filed in federal court in California against Barclays PLC and a number of current and former members of the Board of Directors of Barclays PLC. The complaint seeks to hold the defendants responsible for declines in the price of Barclays PLC's American depositary receipts, which the plaintiffs claim occurred as a result of alleged misstatements and omissions in Barclays' public disclosures relating to its former CEO's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n## Alternative trading systems\n\nIn 2020, a claim was brought against Barclays PLC in the UK in the High Court by various shareholders regarding Barclays PLC's share price based on the allegations contained within a complaint by the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) in 2014. Such claim was settled in 2016, as previously disclosed. The more recent claim seeks unquantified damages and Barclays is defending the claim. The NYAG complaint was filed against Barclays PLC and BCI in the NY Supreme Court alleging, among other things, that Barclays PLC and BCI engaged in fraud and deceptive practices in connection with LX, BCI's SEC-registered alternative trading system.\n\n## General\n\nThe Group is engaged in various other legal, competition and regulatory matters in the UK, the US and a number of other overseas jurisdictions. It is subject to legal proceedings brought by and against the Group which arise in the ordinary course of business from time to time, including (but not limited to) disputes in relation to contracts, securities, guarantees, debt collection, consumer credit, fraud, trusts, client assets, competition, data management and protection, intellectual property, money laundering, financial crime, employment, environmental and other statutory and common law issues.\n\nThe Group is also subject to enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, investigations and legal and other proceedings by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with (but not limited to) consumer protection measures, measures to combat money laundering and financial crime, compliance with legislation and regulation, wholesale trading activity and other areas of banking and business activities in which the Group is or has been engaged. The Group is cooperating with the relevant authorities and keeping all relevant agencies briefed as appropriate in relation to these matters and others described in this note on an ongoing basis.\n\nAt the present time, Barclays PLC does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these other matters to have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters and the matters specifically described in this note, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters (including formerly active matters or those matters arising after the date of this note) will not be material to Barclays PLC's results, operations or cash flows for a particular period, depending on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the amount of profit otherwise reported for the reporting period.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The principal terms of the dated subordinated liabilities are described below:\n\n## Subordination\n\nDated subordinated liabilities issued by Barclays PLC ranks behind the claims against Barclays PLC of unsecured unsubordinated creditors but before the claims of the holders of its equity.\n\nAll dated subordinated liabilities externally issued by Barclays Bank PLC rank behind the claims against Barclays Bank PLC of depositors and other unsecured unsubordinated creditors but before the claims of the holders of its equity. The dated subordinated liabilities externally issued by other subsidiaries are similarly subordinated as the external subordinated liabilities issued by Barclays Bank PLC.\n\n## Interest\n\nInterest on the Floating Rate Notes is fixed periodically in advance, based on the related market rates.\n\nInterest on Fixed Rate Notes is set by reference to market rates at the time of issuance and fixed until maturity.\n\nInterest on the 4.836% USD Fixed Rate Subordinated Callable Notes, 3.75% SGD Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes, 3.75% GBP Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes, 3.811% USD  Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable notes, 1.125% EUR Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes, 3.564% USD Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes, and the 8.407% GBP Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes  are fixed until the call date. After the respective call dates, in the event that they are not redeemed, the interest rates will be reset and fixed until maturity based on a market rate. Interest on the 5.088%  USD Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Callable Notes and 7.119% USD  Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Callable Notes are fixed until the call date. After the call date, in the event that they are not redeemed, the interest rate will reset periodically in advance based on market rates.\n\n## Repayment\n\nThose subordinated liabilities with a call date are repayable at the option of the issuer on such call date in accordance with the conditions governing the respective debt obligations, some in whole or in part, and some only in whole. The remaining dated subordinated liabilities outstanding at 31 December 2023 are redeemable only on maturity, subject in particular cases to provisions allowing an early redemption in the event of certain changes in tax law, or to certain changes in legislation or regulations.\n\nAny repayments prior to maturity require, in the case of Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC, the prior consent of the PRA, or in the case of the overseas issues, the approval of the local regulator for that jurisdiction and of the PRA in certain circumstances.\n\nThere are no committed facilities in existence at the balance sheet date which permit the refinancing of debt beyond the date of maturity.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n476\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the AT1 securities are redeemable, at the option of Barclays PLC, in whole in the event of certain changes in the tax or regulatory treatment of the securities. Any redemptions require the prior consent of the PRA.\n- \u25aa Interest on the AT1 securities will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of Barclays PLC, and Barclays PLC has sole and absolute discretion at all times and for any reason to cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be payable on any interest payment date.\n\n## 28 Reserves\n\n## Currency translation reserve\n\nThe currency translation reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on the retranslation of the Group's net investment in foreign operations, net of the effects of hedging.\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income reserve\n\nThe fair value through other comprehensive income reserve represents the changes in the fair value of financial instruments accounted for at fair value through other comprehensive income investments since initial recognition.\n\n## Cash flow hedging reserve\n\nThe cash flow hedging reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on effective cash flow hedging instruments that will be recycled to profit or loss when the hedged transactions affect profit or loss.\n\n## Own credit reserve\n\nThe own credit reserve reflects the cumulative own credit gains and losses on financial liabilities at fair value. Amounts in the own credit reserve are not recycled to profit or loss in future periods.\n\n## Other reserves and treasury shares\n\nOther reserves relate to redeemed ordinary and preference shares issued by the Group.\n\nTreasury shares relate to Barclays PLC shares held in relation to the Group's various share schemes. These schemes are described in Note 31. Treasury shares are deducted from shareholders' equity within other reserves. A transfer is made to retained earnings in line with the vesting of treasury shares held for the purposes of share-based payments.\n\n|                                                       | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Currency translation reserve                          | 3,671     | 4,772     |\n| Fair value through other comprehensive income reserve | (1,366)   | (1,560)   |\n| Cash flow hedging reserve                             | (3,707)   | (7,235)   |\n| Own credit reserve                                    | (240)     | 467       |\n| Other reserves and treasury shares                    | 1,565     | 1,364     |\n| Total                                                 | (77)      | (2,192)   |\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n478\n\n<!-- image -->",

As at 31 December 2023, Barclays Bank PLC has in issue preference shares and Upper Tier 2 instruments. These are non-controlling interests to the Group.\n\nA fixed coupon rate is attached to all Upper Tier 2 instruments until the initial call date.\n\nAfter the initial call date, in the event they are not redeemed, coupon payments in relation to the  6.125% Undated Notes are fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on market rates. Coupon payments for all other Upper Tier 2 instruments are at rates fixed periodically in advance based on market rates.\n\nThe payment of preference share dividends and Upper Tier 2 coupons are typically at the discretion of Barclays Bank PLC, except for coupon payments that become compulsory where Barclays PLC has declared or paid a dividend on ordinary shares, or in certain cases, any class of preference shares, in the preceding six-month period.  Coupons not paid become payable in each case if such a dividend is subsequently paid or in certain other circumstances. No dividend or coupon payments may be made unless Barclays Bank PLC satisfies a specified solvency test. Under the terms of these instruments, Barclays PLC may not pay dividends on ordinary shares until a dividend or coupon is next paid on these instruments or the instruments are redeemed or purchased by Barclays Bank PLC. There are no restrictions on Barclays Bank PLC's ability to remit capital to the Parent as a result of these issued instruments.\n\nPreference share redemptions are typically at the discretion of Barclays Bank PLC and are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the initial call date and on any dividend payment date after the initial call date, pursuant to their respective terms. Upper Tier 2 instruments are repayable, at the option of Barclays Bank PLC in whole at the initial call date and on any fifth anniversary after the initial call date. In addition, each issue of Upper Tier 2 instruments is repayable, at the option of Barclays Bank PLC, in whole for certain tax reasons, either at any time, or on an interest payment date. There are no events of default except non-payment of principal or mandatory interest. Any repayments or redemptions require the prior consent of the PRA, and in respect of the preference shares, any such redemption will be subject to the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles of Barclays Bank PLC.\n\n| Instrument                                                     | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Preference Shares:                                             |           |           |\n| US Dollar Preference Shares                                    | 318       | 318       |\n| Euro Preference Shares                                         | 211       | 211       |\n| Total Barclays Bank PLC Preference Shares                      | 529       | 529       |\n| Upper Tier 2 Instruments:                                      |           |           |\n| Undated Floating Rate Primary Capital Notes Series 1           | -         | 93        |\n| Undated Floating Rate Primary Capital Notes Series 2           | -         | 179       |\n| 5.03% Undated Reverse Dual Currency Subordinated Loan (JPY8bn) | 39        | 39        |\n| 5.0% Reverse Dual Currency Undated Subordinated Loan (JPY12bn) | 53        | 53        |\n| 9% Permanent Interest Bearing Capital Bonds (\u00a3100m)            | -         | 40        |\n| 6.125% Undated Subordinated Notes (\u00a3550m)                      | 34        | 34        |\n| Total Upper Tier 2 Instruments                                 | 126       | 438       |\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n479\n\n<!-- image -->",

To receive payment under an award, employees must provide service over the vesting period. The period over which the expense for deferred cash and share awards is recognised is based upon the period employees consider their services contribute to the awards. For past awards, the Group considers that it is appropriate to recognise the awards over the period from the date of grant to the date that the awards vest. In relation to awards granted from 2017, the Group, taking into account the changing employee understanding surrounding those awards, considered it appropriate for expense to be recognised over the vesting period including the financial year prior to the grant date.\n\nThe accounting policies for share-based payments, and pensions and other post-retirement benefits are included in Note 31 and Note 32 respectively.\n\n|                                                                                | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Incentive awards granted:                                                      |           |           |           |\n| Current year bonus                                                             | 1,202     | 1,241     | 1,278     |\n| Deferred bonus                                                                 | 543       | 549       | 667       |\n| Total incentive awards granted                                                 | 1,745     | 1,790     | 1,945     |\n| Reconciliation of incentive awards granted to income statement charge:         |           |           |           |\n| Less: deferred bonuses granted but not charged in current year                 | (384)     | (388)     | (457)     |\n| Add: current year charges for deferred bonuses from previous years             | 390       | 399       | 280       |\n| Other differences between incentive awards granted and income statement charge | (1)       | 35        | (23)      |\n| Income statement charge for performance costs                                  | 1,750     | 1,836     | 1,745     |\n| Other income statement charges:                                                |           |           |           |\n| Salaries                                                                       | 5,120     | 4,732     | 4,290     |\n| Social security costs                                                          | 755       | 714       | 619       |\n| Post-retirement benefits 1                                                     | 539       | 563       | 539       |\n| Other compensation costs                                                       | 555       | 504       | 431       |\n| Total compensation costs 2                                                     | 8,719     | 8,349     | 7,624     |\n| Other resourcing costs:                                                        |           |           |           |\n| Outsourcing                                                                    | 601       | 607       | 357       |\n| Redundancy and restructuring 3                                                 | 452       | (7)       | 296       |\n| Temporary staff costs                                                          | 91        | 113       | 109       |\n| Other                                                                          | 154       | 190       | 125       |\n| Total other resourcing costs                                                   | 1,298     | 903       | 887       |\n| Total staff costs                                                              | 10,017    | 9,252     | 8,511     |\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Post-retirement benefits charge includes \u00a3371m (2022: \u00a3313m; 2021: \u00a3289m) in respect of defined contribution schemes and \u00a3168m (2022: \u00a3250m; 2021: \u00a3250m) in respect of defined benefit schemes.\n- 2 \u00a3860m (2022: \u00a3604m; 2021: \u00a3484m) of Group compensation cost was capitalised as internally generated software and  excluded from the Staff cost disclosed above .\n- 3 Redundancy and restructuring cost included  \u00a3340m relating to structural cost actions taken in Q4 2023.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n480\n\n<!-- image -->",

The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the period that employees provide services. The overall cost of the award is calculated using the number of shares and options expected to vest and the fair value of the shares or options at the date of grant.\n\nThe number of shares and options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and service conditions included in the terms of the awards will be met. For other share-based payment schemes such as Sharesave and Sharepurchase, there are nonvesting conditions which must be met. Failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation, resulting in an acceleration of recognition of the cost of the employee services.\n\nThe fair value of shares is the market price ruling on the grant date, in some cases adjusted to reflect restrictions on transferability. The fair value of options granted is determined using the Black Scholes model to estimate the numbers of shares likely to vest. The model takes into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors. Market conditions that must be met in order for the award to vest are also reflected in the fair value of the award, as are any other non-vesting conditions - such as continuing to make payments into a share-based savings scheme.\n\nThe charge for the year arising from share-based payment schemes was as follows:\n\n|                                                | Charge for the year   | Charge for the year   | Charge for the year   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                | 2023 \u00a3m               | 2022 \u00a3m               | 2021 \u00a3m               |\n| Deferred Share Value Plan and Share Value Plan | 284                   | 295                   | 256                   |\n| Others                                         | 191                   | 214                   | 216                   |\n| Total equity settled                           | 475                   | 509                   | 472                   |\n| Cash settled                                   | 4                     | 4                     | 5                     |\n| Total share-based payments                     | 479                   | 513                   | 477                   |\n\nThe terms of the main current plans are as follows:\n\n## Share Value Plan (SVP)\n\nSVP awards have been granted to participants in the form of a conditional right to receive Barclays PLC shares or provisional allocations of Barclays PLC shares which vest or are considered for release over a period of three, four, five or seven years. Participants do not pay to receive an award or to receive a release of shares. For awards granted before December 2017, the grantor may also make a dividend equivalent  payment  to  participants  on  release  of  a  SVP  award.  SVP  awards  are  also  made  to  eligible  employees  for  recruitment purposes. All awards are subject to potential forfeiture in certain leaver scenarios.\n\n## Deferred Share Value Plan (DSVP)\n\nThe terms of the DSVP are materially the same as the terms of the SVP as described above, save that Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the DSVP and the DSVP operates over market purchase shares only.\n\n## Other schemes\n\nIn addition to the SVP and DSVP, the Barclays PLC Group operates a number of other schemes settled in Barclays PLC Shares including Sharesave (both UK and Ireland), Sharepurchase (both UK and overseas), and the Barclays PLC Group Long Term Incentive Plan. A delivery of upfront shares to 'Material Risk Takers' can be made as a Share Incentive Award (Holding Period) under the SVP.\n\n## Share option and award plans\n\nThe weighted average fair value per award granted, weighted average share price at the date of exercise/release of shares during the year, weighted average contractual remaining life and number of options and awards outstanding (including those exercisable) at the balance sheet date were as follows:\n\n|                  | 2023                                                       | 2023                                                              | 2023                                        | 2023                                  | 2022                                                       | 2022                                                              | 2022                                        | 2022                                  |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                  | Weighted  average fair  value per  award  granted in  year | Weighted  average  share price at  exercise/ release  during year | Weighted average remaining contractual life | Number of options/ awards outstanding | Weighted  average fair  value per  award  granted in  year | Weighted  average  share price at  exercise/ release  during year | Weighted average remaining contractual life | Number of options/ awards outstanding |\n|                  | \u00a3                                                          | \u00a3                                                                 | in years                                    | (000s)                                | \u00a3                                                          | \u00a3                                                                 | in years                                    | (000s)                                |\n| DSVP and SVP 1,2 | 1.49                                                       | 1.68                                                              | 1                                           | 495,724                               | 1.43                                                       | 1.61                                                              | 1                                           | 501,454                               |\n| Others 1         | 0.31-1.69                                                  | 1.43-1.69                                                         | 0-3                                         | 288,755                               | 0.38-1.64                                                  | 1.59-1.66                                                         | 0-3                                         | 316,534                               |\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consequently, the fair value of these awards is based on the market value at that date.\n\nSharesave has a contractual life of 3 years and 5 years, the expected volatility is 34.10% for 3 years and 33.12% for 5 years. The risk free interest  rates  used  for  valuations  are 4.60%  and  4.36%  for  3  years  and 5  years  respectively.  The  pure  dividend  yield  rates  used  for valuations are 5.27% and 5.02% for 3 years and 5 years respectively. The repo rates used for valuations are (0.50)% and (0.57)% for 3 years and 5 years respectively. The inputs into the model such as risk free interest rate, expected volatility, pure dividend yield rates and repo rates are derived from market data.\n\n## Movements in options and awards\n\nThe movement in the number of options and awards for the major schemes and the weighted average exercise price of options was:\n\n|                                                   | DSVP and SVP 1,2   | DSVP and SVP 1,2   | Others 1,3    | Others 1,3    | Others 1,3                     | Others 1,3                     |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                   | Number (000s)      | Number (000s)      | Number (000s) | Number (000s) | Weighted average ex. price (\u00a3) | Weighted average ex. price (\u00a3) |\n|                                                   | 2023               | 2022               | 2023          | 2022          | 2023                           | 2022                           |\n| Outstanding at beginning of year/acquisition date | 501,454            | 413,859            | 316,534       | 335,976       | 0.97                           | 0.95                           |\n| Granted in the year                               | 232,479            | 291,876            | 198,386       | 146,203       | 1.17                           | 1.33                           |\n| Exercised/released in the year                    | (196,900)          | (178,634)          | (193,669)     | (133,682)     | 0.88                           | 1.15                           |\n| Less: forfeited in the year                       | (41,309)           | (25,647)           | (29,424)      | (28,789)      | 1.20                           | 1.01                           |\n| Less: expired in the year                         | -                  | -                  | (3,072)       | (3,174)       | 1.42                           | 1.23                           |\n| Outstanding at end of year                        | 495,724            | 501,454            | 288,755       | 316,534       | 1.06                           | 0.97                           |\n| Of which exercisable:                             | -                  | -                  | 67,967        | 34,247        | 0.87                           | 1.19                           |\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Options/award granted over Barclays PLC shares.\n- 2 Weighted average exercise price is not applicable for SVP and DSVP awards as these are not share option schemes.\n- 3 The number of awards within Others at the end of the year principally relates to Sharesave (number of awards exercisable at end of year was 44,109,518). The weighted average exercise price relates to Sharesave.\n\nAwards  and  options  granted  under  the  Group's  share  plans  may  be  satisfied  using  new  issue  shares,  treasury  shares  and  market purchase shares. Awards granted under the DSVP may be satisfied using market purchase shares only.\n\nThere were no significant modifications to the share-based payments arrangements in 2023 and 2022.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the total liability arising from cash-settled share-based payments transactions was \u00a35m (2022: \u00a35m).\n\n## Holdings of Barclays PLC shares and hedges\n\nVarious employee benefit trusts established by the Group hold shares in Barclays PLC to meet obligations under the Barclays sharebased payment schemes. The total number of Barclays shares held in these employee benefit trusts at 31 December 2023 was 19m (2022: 14m). Dividend rights have been waived on all these shares. The total market value of the shares held in trust based on the year end share price of \u00a31.54 (2022: \u00a31.59) was \u00a329m (2022: \u00a322m). For accounting of treasury shares, see Note 28.\n\nThe Group has entered into physically settled forward contracts to hedge the settlement of certain share-based payment schemes. The fixed forward price to be paid under these contracts is \u00a3481m and has been recorded in retained earnings.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n482\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\n## Notes to the financial statements (continued)\n\nEmployee benefits\n\n## 32 Pensions and post-retirement benefits\n\n## Accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of pension schemes and post-employment benefit schemes.\n\nDefined contribution schemes the Group recognises contributions due in respect of the accounting period in the income statement. Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.\n\nDefined benefit schemes the Group recognises its obligations to members of each scheme at the period end, less the fair value of the scheme assets after applying the asset ceiling test.\n\nEach scheme's obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method. Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the period end.\n\nChanges in pension scheme liabilities or assets (remeasurements) that do not arise from regular pension cost, net interest on net defined benefit liabilities or assets, past service costs, settlements or contributions to the scheme, are recognised in other comprehensive income. Remeasurements comprise experience adjustments (differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred), the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, return on scheme assets (excluding amounts included in the interest on the assets) and any changes in the effect of the asset ceiling restriction (excluding amounts included in the interest on the restriction).\n\nPost-employment benefit schemes the cost of providing healthcare benefits to retired employees is accrued as a liability in the financial statements over the period that the employees provide services to the Group, using a methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension schemes.\n\n## Pension schemes\n\n## UK Retirement Fund (UKRF)\n\nThe UKRF is the Group's main scheme, representing 96% (2022: 96%) of the Group's total retirement benefit obligations. Barclays Bank PLC is the principal employer of the UKRF. The UKRF was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2012, and comprises 10 sections, the two most significant of which are:\n\n- \u25aa Afterwork, which comprises a contributory cash balance defined benefit element, and a voluntary defined contribution element. The cash balance element is accrued each year and revalued until Normal Retirement Age in line with the increase in Retail Price Index (RPI) (up to a maximum of 5% p.a.). The main risks that Barclays runs in relation to Afterwork are limited although additional contributions are required if pre-retirement investment returns are not sufficient to provide for the benefits.\n- \u25aa The 1964 Pension Scheme. Most employees recruited before July 1997 built up benefits in this non-contributory defined benefit scheme in respect of service up to 31 March 2010. Pensions were calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary. From 1 April 2010, members became eligible to accrue future service benefits in either Afterwork or the Pension Investment Plan, a historic defined contribution section which is now closed to future contributions. The risks that Barclays runs in relation to the 1964 section are typical of final salary pension schemes, principally that investment returns fall short of expectations, that inflation exceeds expectations, and that retirees live longer than expected.\n\n## Barclays Pension Savings Plan (BPSP)\n\nThe BPSP is a defined contribution scheme providing benefits for all new UK hires from 1 October 2012. BPSP is not subject to the same investment return, inflation or life expectancy risks for Barclays that defined benefit schemes are. Members' benefits reflect contributions paid and the level of investment returns achieved.\n\n## Other\n\nApart from the UKRF and the BPSP, Barclays operates a number of smaller pension and long-term employee benefits and postretirement healthcare plans globally, the largest of which are the US defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. Many of the schemes are funded, with assets backing the obligations held in separate legal vehicles such as trusts. Others are operated on an unfunded basis. The benefits provided, the approach to funding, and the legal basis of the schemes, reflect local environments.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe UKRF operates under trust law and is managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and all relevant legislation. The Corporate Trustee is Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited, a private limited company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC. The Trustee is the legal owner of the assets of the UKRF which are held separately from the assets of the Group.\n\nThe Trustee Board comprises six Management Directors selected by Barclays, of whom three are independent Directors with no relationship with Barclays (and who are not members of the UKRF), plus three Member Nominated Directors selected from eligible active, deferred or pensioner members who apply for the role.\n\nThe BPSP is a Group Personal Pension arrangement which operates as a collection of personal pension plans. Each personal pension plan is a direct contract between the employee and the BPSP provider (Legal & General Assurance Society Limited), and is regulated by the FCA.\n\nSimilar principles of pension governance apply to the Group's other pension schemes, depending on local legislation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The decrease in the UKRF surplus during the year was driven by lower corporate bond yields and the assets underperforming the discount rate.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the benefit payments reflected in the defined benefit obligation for the UKRF is 12 years (2022: 13 years). The UKRF expected benefits promised to date are projected to be paid out for in excess of 50 years, although 30% of the benefits are expected to be paid in the next 10 years; 35% in years 11 to 20 and 20% in years 21 to 30. The remainder of the benefits are expected to be paid beyond 30 years.\n\nOf the \u00a31,075m (2022: \u00a31,299m) UKRF benefits paid out, \u00a3122m (2022: \u00a3390m) related to transfers out of the fund.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the case of the UKRF the asset ceiling is not applied as, in certain specified circumstances such as wind-up, the Group expects to be able to recover any surplus. Similarly, a liability in respect of future minimum funding requirements is not recognised. The Trustee does not have a substantive right to augment benefits, nor do they have the right to wind up the plan except in the dissolution of the Group or termination of contributions by the Group. The application of the asset ceiling to other plans and recognition of additional liabilities in respect of future minimum funding requirements are considered on an individual plan basis.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nActuarial valuation of the scheme's obligation is dependent upon a series of assumptions. Below is a summary of the main financial and demographic assumptions adopted for the UKRF.\n\n|                                | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Key UKRF financial assumptions | % p.a. | % p.a. |\n| Discount rate                  | 4.49   | 4.80   |\n| Inflation rate (RPI)           | 3.17   | 3.21   |\n\nThe UKRF discount rate assumption for 2023 was based on a standard WTW RATE Link model. The RPI inflation assumption for 2023 was set by reference to the Bank of England's implied inflation curve. The inflation assumption incorporates a deduction of 20 basis points as an allowance for an inflation risk premium. The methodology used to derive the discount rate and inflation assumptions is consistent with that used at the prior year end.\n\nThe UKRF's post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on best estimates derived from an analysis in 2022 of the UKRF's own post-retirement mortality experience and taking account of recent evidence from published mortality surveys. An allowance has been made for future mortality improvements based on the 2022 core projection model published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau subject to a long-term trend of 1.25% per annum in future improvements (2022: 1.25% per annum).  The table below shows how the assumed life expectancy at 60, for members of the UKRF, has varied over the past three years:\n\n| Assumed life expectancy                                               | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Life expectancy at 60 for current pensioners (years)                  |        |        |        |\n| - Males                                                               | 26.5   | 26.8   | 27.3   |\n| - Females                                                             | 29.3   | 29.5   | 29.6   |\n| Life expectancy at 60 for future pensioners currently aged 40 (years) |        |        |        |\n| - Males                                                               | 28.0   | 28.3   | 29.1   |\n| - Females                                                             | 30.7   | 31.0   | 31.4   |\n\nThrough transactions in 2020 and 2022 approximately  three-quarters of the longevity risk for current pensioners has been reinsured, and the transactions will provide income to the UKRF if pensions are paid out for longer than expected. The contracts form part of the UKRF's investment portfolio.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis on actuarial assumptions\n\nThe sensitivity analysis has been calculated by valuing the UKRF liabilities using the amended assumptions shown in the table below and keeping the remaining assumptions the same as disclosed in the table above, except in the case of the inflation sensitivity where other assumptions that depend on assumed inflation have also been amended correspondingly. The difference between the recalculated liability figure and that stated in the balance sheet reconciliation table above is the figure shown. The selection of these movements to illustrate the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to key assumptions should not be interpreted as Barclays expressing any specific view of the probability of such movements happening.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n<!-- image -->",

This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long-term returns and some asset classes may be more volatile than others. The long-term investment strategy ensures, among other aims, that investments are adequately diversified.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\nBarclays PLC\n\nAnnual Report 2023\n\n486",

The valuation for some of the unquoted assets, in particular private equities, is based on valuations as at 30 September 2023 adjusted by cash flows, these being the latest available valuations as at the point of publication. All valuations are determined in accordance with relevant industry guidance. Barclays does not believe these valuations will differ materially from the fair value, in the context of the overall UKRF asset size.\n- 2 Cash and liquid assets for the UKRF consists of \u00a3354m (2022: \u00a3521m) Cash, \u00a391m (2022: \u00a380m) Receivables/payables, \u00a33,036m (2022:\u00a33,286m)  Pooled cash funds and \u00a3(1,588)m (2022: \u00a3(2,390)m)  Repurchase agreements.\n\nIncluded within the fair value of UKRF scheme assets was nil (2022: nil) relating to shares in Barclays PLC and nil (2022: nil) relating to bonds issued by Barclays PLC. The UKRF also invests in pooled investment vehicles which may hold shares or debt issued by Barclays PLC.\n\nDuring 2023, the Trustee undertook a review of the investment strategy to reflect updated liabilities and market assumptions. The Trustee agreed to continue their existing de-risking plan and make no fundamental changes to the investment strategy.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, 39% of the UKRF assets were invested in liability-driven investment strategies; primarily UK gilts as well as interest rate and inflation swaps. These swaps are used to better match the assets to its liabilities. The swaps are used to reduce the scheme's inflation and duration risks against its liabilities.\n\nThe UKRF employs derivative instruments, where appropriate, to match assets more closely to liabilities, or to achieve a desired exposure or return.  The value of assets shown reflects the assets held by the UKRF, with any derivative holdings reflected on a fair value basis. The UKRF uses repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements to achieve the Trustee's liability hedging objective. Investment managers are allowed to undertake repo transactions on the UKRF's existing gilt holdings to raise cash with which to buy additional gilts for efficient portfolio management; and reverse repo transactions to receive gilts and be paid a fee for providing cash.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n487\n\n<!-- image -->",

The aim of the liquidity framework is to ensure that pension payments and other liquidity outflows are paid in due course, sufficient liquidity and collateral is maintained to achieve strategic allocation targets and that all liquidity outflows/collateral needs are covered without forced sale or strategic asset allocation changes.\n\nThe UKRF holds two longevity reinsurance contracts covering c75% of the current pensioner liabilities. The contracts provide income to the UKRF if pensions are paid out for longer than expected. At 31 December 2023, the combined value of the contracts was \u00a3(131)m (2022: \u00a3(123)m). The negative value reflects the estimated impact of changes in the reinsurance market, demographic assumptions and risk premia since the contracts were entered into by the UKRF.\n\nFor information on the UKRF Trustee's approach to Responsible Investment and Climate Risk, in the context of managing the UKRF, please refer to the UKRF Trustee website at http://epa.towerswatson.com/accounts/barclays/public/barclays-bank-responsibleinvestment-policy/.\n\n## Triennial valuation\n\nThe UKRF annual funding update as at 30 September 2023 showed a funding surplus of \u00a32.03bn compared to \u00a31.97bn  at 30 September 2022 triennial actuarial valuation. The improvement was mainly due to asset returns outperforming the change in liabilities.\n\nThe main differences between the funding and accounting assumptions are a different approach to setting the discount rate and a more conservative longevity assumption for funding.\n\nAs part of the 2022 triennial valuation, the Trustee and Barclays Bank PLC agreed an annual adequacy test on a basis more prudent than the IAS 19 or funding bases. Should the UKRF be sufficiently funded on this basis, the regular employer contributions to the UKRF to fund future Afterwork accrual will not be required in the following calendar year. The test will be reviewed at the 2025 triennial valuation. The test was passed in September, so no regular employer contributions are required for 2024.\n\nThe next funding valuation of the UKRF is due to be completed in 2026 with an effective date of 30 September 2025.\n\n## Other support measures agreed which remain in place\n\nCollateral - Barclays Bank PLC has entered into an agreement with the UKRF Trustee to provide collateral to cover at least 100% of any funding deficit with an overall cap of \u00a39bn, to provide security if the UKRF is in a funding deficit. The collateral pool is currently zero, reflecting the surplus funding position. The arrangement provides the UKRF Trustee with dedicated access to the pool of assets in the event of Barclays Bank PLC not paying any required deficit reduction contribution to the UKRF or in the event of Barclays Bank PLC's insolvency.\n\nParticipation - As permitted under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Banking Reform) (Pensions) Regulations 2016, Barclays Bank UK PLC is a participating employer in the UKRF and will remain so during a transitional phase until September 2025 as set out in a deed of participation. In the event of Barclays Bank PLC's insolvency during this period provision has been made to require Barclays Bank UK PLC to become the principal employer of the UKRF. Barclays Bank PLC's Section 75 debt would be triggered by the insolvency (the debt would be calculated after allowing for the payment to the UKRF of any collateral above).\n\nDefined benefit contributions paid with respect to the UKRF were as follows:\n\n|      | Contributions paid   |\n|------|----------------------|\n|      | \u00a3m                   |\n| 2023 | 39                   |\n| 2022 | 1,785                |\n| 2021 | 955                  |\n\nThere were nil (2022: nil) Section 75 contributions included within the Group's contributions paid as no participating employers left the UKRF in 2023.\n\nThe Group's expected contribution to the UKRF in respect of defined benefits in 2024 is \u00a322m. In addition, the expected contributions to UK defined contribution schemes in 2024 is \u00a332m to the UKRF and \u00a3293m to the BPSP.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n488\n\n<!-- image -->",

Refer to Note 29 for more information.\n\nDetermining whether the Group has control of an entity is generally straightforward based on ownership of the majority of the voting capital. However, in certain instances, this determination will involve judgement, particularly in the case of structured entities where voting rights are often not the determining factor in decisions over the relevant activities. This judgement will involve assessing the purpose and design of the entity. It will also often be necessary to consider whether the Group, or another involved party with power over the relevant activities, is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.\n\nThere is also often considerable judgement involved in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities. In this regard, where market conditions have deteriorated such that the other investors' exposures to the structure's variable returns have been substantively eliminated, the Group may conclude that the managers of the structured entity are acting as its agent and therefore will consolidate the structured entity.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n489\n\n<!-- image -->",

Interests relating to this entity are included in Note 34.\n\n## Significant restrictions\n\nAs is typical for a group of its size and international scope, there are restrictions on the ability of Barclays PLC to obtain distributions of capital, access the assets or repay the liabilities of members of its Group due to the statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements of its subsidiaries and due to the protective rights of non-controlling interests. These are considered below.\n\n## Regulatory requirements\n\nBarclays' principal subsidiary companies have assets and liabilities before intercompany eliminations of \u00a32,022bn (2022: \u00a31,962bn) and \u00a31,927bn (2022: \u00a31,869bn) respectively. Certain of these assets and liabilities are subject to prudential regulation and regulatory capital requirements in the countries in which they are regulated. These require entities to maintain minimum capital levels which cannot be returned to the parent company, Barclays PLC, on a going concern basis.\n\nIn order to meet capital requirements, subsidiaries may issue certain equity-accounted and debt-accounted financial instruments and non-equity instruments such as Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments and other forms of subordinated liabilities. Refer to Note 26 and Note 27 for particulars of these instruments. These instruments may be subject to cancellation clauses or preference share restrictions that would limit the ability of the entity to repatriate the capital on a timely basis.\n\n## Liquidity requirements\n\nRegulated subsidiaries of the Group are required to meet applicable PRA or local regulatory requirements pertaining to liquidity. The regulated subsidiaries include Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Securities Limited (which are regulated on a combined basis under a Domestic Liquidity Sub-Group (DoLSub) arrangement), Barclays Bank UK PLC, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, Barclays Capital Inc. and Barclays Bank Delaware. Refer to the Liquidity risk section for further details of liquidity requirements, including those of the Group's significant subsidiaries.\n\n## Statutory requirements\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits and generally to maintain solvency. These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to make remittances of dividends to Barclays PLC, the ultimate parent, except in the event of a legal capital reduction or liquidation. In most cases, the regulatory restrictions referred to above exceed the statutory restrictions.\n\n## Asset encumbrance\n\nThe Group uses its financial assets to raise finance in the form of securitisations and through the liquidity schemes of central banks, as well as to provide security to the UK Retirement Fund. Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around the Group. The assets typically affected are disclosed in Note 37.\n\n## Other restrictions\n\nThe Group is required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities, and these amounted to \u00a33,758m (2022: \u00a33,457m).\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n490\n\n<!-- image -->",

Voting rights may relate to administrative tasks only, with the relevant activities of the entity being directed by means of contractual arrangements.  Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well-defined objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities.\n\nDepending on the Group's power over the activities of the entity and its exposure to and ability to influence its own returns, it may consolidate the entity. In other cases, it may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but not consolidate it.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group has contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support to the following types of consolidated structured entities:\n\n- \u00b7 Securitisation vehicles: The Group uses securitisation as a source of financing and a means of risk transfer.  Where entities are controlled by the Group, they are consolidated.  Refer to Note 36 for further detail.\n- \u25aa Commercial Paper (CP) conduits: These entities issue CP and use the proceeds to lend to clients as part of the Group's multi-seller conduit programme.   The Group has provided \u00a322.4bn (2022: \u00a320.8bn) in contractual liquidity facilities to the CP conduits that the Group consolidates. These amounts represent the maximum the conduits can lend externally. The amounts of CP conduit lending (drawn and undrawn) to unconsolidated structured entities can be seen in Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities under multi-seller conduit programme in the Nature of interest table.\n- \u25aa Employee benefit trusts: The Group provides capital contributions to employee benefit trusts to enable them to meet obligations to employees in relation to share-based remuneration arrangements.\n- \u25aa Tender Option Bond (TOB)  trusts: During 2023, the Group provided undrawn liquidity facilities of \u00a33.7bn (2022: \u00a33.8bn) to consolidated TOB trusts.  These trusts invest in fixed income instruments issued by state, local or other municipalities in the United States, funded by long-term senior floating-rate notes and junior residual securities.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe term 'unconsolidated structured entities' refers to structured entities not controlled by Barclays, and are established either by Barclays or a third party. An interest in a structured entity is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variability in returns arising from the performance of the entity for the Group. Such interests include holdings of debt or equity securities, derivatives that transfer financial risks from the entity to the Group, lending, loan commitments, financial guarantees and investment management agreements.\n\nThe Group enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer transactions, to provide  risk management services and for specific investment opportunities.  This is predominantly within the CIB business. Structured entities may take the form of funds, trusts, securitisation vehicles, and private investment companies. The largest transactions for Barclays include loans and derivatives with hedge fund structures and special purpose entities, multi-seller conduit lending, holding notes issued by securitisation vehicles, and facilitating customer requirements through funds.\n\nThe nature and extent of the Group's interests in structured entities is summarised below:\n\n<!-- image -->",

For this reason, the total assets of these entities are not considered meaningful for the purposes of understanding the related risks and so have not been presented. Other interests include conduits and lending where the interest is driven by normal customer demand. As at 31 December 2023, Barclays entered into transactions with approximately 6,000 (2022: 6,000) structured entities.\n\n## Secured financing\n\nThe Group routinely enters into reverse repurchase contracts, margin lending, stock borrowing and similar arrangements on normal commercial terms where the counterparty to the arrangement is a structured entity. Due to the nature of these arrangements, especially the transfer of collateral and ongoing margining, the Group is able to manage its variable exposure to the performance of the structured entity counterparty. The counterparties included in secured financing mainly include hedge fund limited structures, investment companies and special purpose entities.\n\n## Short-term traded interests\n\nAs part of its market making activities, the Group buys and sells interests in structured vehicles, which are predominantly debt securities issued by asset securitisation vehicles. Such interests are typically held individually or as part of a larger portfolio for no more than 90 days. In such cases, the Group typically has no other involvement with the structured entity other than the securities it holds as part of trading activities and its maximum exposure to loss is restricted to the carrying value of the asset.\n\n## Traded derivatives\n\nThe Group enters into a variety of derivative contracts with structured entities which reference market risk variables such as interest rates, equities, foreign exchange rates and credit indices among other things. The main derivative types which are considered interests in structured entities include equity options, index-based and entity-specific credit default swaps, and total return swaps.  Interest rate swaps and foreign exchange derivatives that are not complex and which expose the Group to insignificant credit risk by being senior in\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n<!-- image -->",

The risk of loss may be mitigated through ongoing margining requirements as well as a right to cash flows from the structured entity which are senior in the payment waterfall. Such margining requirements are consistent with market practice for many derivative arrangements and in line with the Group's normal credit policies.\n\nDerivative transactions require the counterparty to provide cash or other collateral under margining agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Group is mainly exposed to settlement risk on these derivatives which is mitigated through daily margining. Total notional contract amounts were \u00a3335,552m (2022: \u00a3244,780m).\n\nExcept for credit default swaps where the maximum exposure to loss is the swap notional amount, it is not possible to estimate the maximum exposure to loss in respect of derivative positions as the fair value of derivatives is subject to changes in market rates of interest, exchange rates and credit indices which by their nature are uncertain. In addition, the Group's losses would be subject to mitigating action under its traded market risk and credit risk policies that require the counterparty to provide collateral in cash or other assets in most cases.\n\n## Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group's interests in structured entities not held for the purposes of short-term trading activities are set out below, summarised by the nature of the interest and limited to significant categories, based on maximum exposure to loss.\n\n| Nature of interest                                                 | Multi-seller  conduit  programme   | Lending   | Other   | Total   | Of which: Barclays  owned, not  consolidated  entities 1   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2023                                             |                                    |           |         |         |                                                            |\n| Financial assets at fair value through the income statement        | -

All loans are subject to the Group's credit sanctioning process.

The Barclays drawn commitments to finance or otherwise provide resources to its joint ventures and associates are \u00a3474m (2022: \u00a3474m) The Barclays share of the associates and joint ventures unutilised credit facilities commitments amounted to \u00a31,695m (2022: \u00a31,796m).\n\n## 36 Securitisations\n\n## Accounting for securitisations\n\nThe Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer. Such transactions generally result in the transfer of contractual cash flows from portfolios of financial assets to holders of issued debt securities.\n\nSecuritisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction; lead to partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement in those assets or lead to derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer. Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.\n\nIn the course of its normal banking activities, the Group makes transfers of financial assets, either where legal rights to the cash flows from the asset are passed to the counterparty or beneficially, where the Group retains the rights to the cash flows but assumes a responsibility to transfer them to the counterparty. Depending on the nature of the transaction, this may result in derecognition of the assets in their entirety, partial derecognition or no derecognition of the assets subject to the transfer.\n\nA summary of the main transactions, and the assets and liabilities and the financial risks arising from these transactions, is set out below:\n\n## Transfers of financial assets that do not result in derecognition\n\n## Securitisations\n\nThe Group was party to securitisation transactions involving its credit card balances and other personal lending. In these transactions, the assets, interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash flows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special purpose entity, which then issues interest bearing debt securities to third party investors.\n\nSecuritisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction.

Total Financial assets of \u00a33,353m (2022: \u00a3828m) were transferred in this manner and the carrying value of the asset representing continued involvement is included in the table above.\n\nFor transfers of assets in relation to repurchase agreements, refer to Note 37.\n\n## Continuing involvement in financial assets that have been derecognised\n\nIn some cases, the Group may have transferred a financial asset in its entirety but may have continuing involvement in it. This arises in asset securitisations where loans and asset backed securities were derecognised as a result of the Group's involvement with asset backed securities, residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities. Continuing involvement largely arises from providing financing into these structures in the form of retained notes, which do not bear first losses.\n\nThe table below shows the potential financial implications of such continuing involvement:\n\n|                                        | Continuing involvement 1   | Continuing involvement 1   |                           |                    |                            |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                        | Carrying amount            | Fair value                 | Maximum  exposure to loss | For the year ended | Cumulative to 31  December |\n| Type of transfer                       | \u00a3m                         | \u00a3m                         | \u00a3m                        | \u00a3m                 | \u00a3m                         |\n| 2023                                   |                            |                            |                           |                    |                            |\n| Asset backed securities                | 2                          | 2                          | 2                         | -                  | 3                          |\n| Residential mortgage backed securities | 1,798                      | 1,796                      | 1,798                     | 49                 | 68                         |\n| Commercial mortgage backed securities  | 392                        | 341                        | 392                       | 3                  | 19                         |\n| Total                                  | 2,192                      | 2,139                      | 2,192                     | 52                 | 90                         |\n| 2022                                   |                            |                            |                           |                    |                            |\n| Asset backed securities                | 8                          | 8                          | 8                         | 1                  | 3                          |\n| Residential mortgage backed securities | 913                        | 907                        | 913                       | 18                 | 22                         |\n| Commercial mortgage backed securities  | 412                        | 357                        | 412                       | 5                  | 16                         |\n| Total                                  | 1,333                      | 1,272                      | 1,333                     | 24                 | 41                         |\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 Assets which represent the Group's continuing involvement in derecognised assets are recorded in Loans and advances at amortised cost and Debt securities at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\n496\n\n<!-- image -->",

Assets transferred are non-cash assets transferred to a third party that do not qualify for derecognition from the Group balance sheet, for example because Barclays retains substantially all the exposure to those assets under an agreement to repurchase them in the future for a fixed price.\n\nAssets pledged or transferred as collateral include all assets categorised as encumbered in the disclosure on pages 197 to 201 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited), other than those held in commercial paper conduits. In these transactions, the Group will be required to step in to provide financing itself under a liquidity facility if the vehicle cannot access the commercial paper market.\n\nWhere non-cash assets are pledged or transferred as collateral for cash received, the asset continues to be recognised in full, and a related liability is also recognised on the balance sheet. Where non-cash assets are pledged or transferred as collateral in an exchange for non-cash assets, the transferred asset continues to be recognised in full, and there is no associated liability as the non-cash collateral received is not recognised on the balance sheet. The Group is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets for the duration of the transaction and remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on these pledged assets.

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use. In order to be classified as held for sale, the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary, and the sale must be highly probable. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.  Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Management accounting estimates and judgements\n\nManagement judgement is required in determining whether the IFRS 5 held for sale classification criteria are met, in particular whether the sale is highly probable and expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within 12 months of classification. This assessment requires consideration of how committed management is to the sales plan, the likelihood of obtaining regulatory or other external approvals which is often required for sales of banking operations and how committed the buyer is to complete the sales transaction within the agreed timelines.\n\nBarclays is currently engaged in a process to sell its German consumer finance business (comprising credit cards, unsecured personal loans and deposits), currently within CC&P, as part of our ambition to simplify Barclays and support our focus on growing our key businesses.  A sale is expected to complete in 2024.\n\nThe perimeter of the disposal group has been accounted for in line with the requirements of IFRS5 as at 31 December 2023.  A detailed analysis of the disposal group is presented below:\n\n| As at 31 December                                                   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Assets included in disposal groups classified as held for sale      |           |\n| Loans and advances to customers                                     | 3,855     |\n| Intangible assets                                                   | 15        |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                       | 24        |\n| Other assets                                                        | 22        |\n| Total assets classified as held for sale                            | 3,916     |\n| Liabilities included in disposal groups classified as held for sale |           |\n| Deposits from customers                                             | 3,077     |\n| Other liabilities                                                   | 83        |\n| Provisions                                                          | 4         |\n| Total liabilities classified as held for sale                       | 3,164     |\n| Net assets classified as held for sale                              | 752       |\n\n## 41 Subsequent events\n\nBarclays announced on 9 February 2024 that Barclays Bank UK PLC has entered into an agreement with Tesco Personal Finance plc (operating using the trading name 'Tesco Bank') to acquire its retail banking business, which includes credit cards, unsecured personal loans, deposits and the operating infrastructure. Additionally upon completion, Barclays Bank UK PLC will enter into a long-term, exclusive strategic partnership with Tesco Stores Limited for an initial period of 10 years to market and distribute credit cards, unsecured personal loans and deposits using the Tesco brand, as well as explore other opportunities to offer financial services to Tesco customers. The transaction involves the acquisition of approximately \u00a38.3bn of unsecured lending balances, including approximately \u00a34.2bn of gross credit card receivables and \u00a34.1bn of gross unsecured personal loans, together with approximately \u00a36.7bn in customer deposits. The acquisition is expected to occur in H2 2024, subject to court sanction and regulatory approvals.\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements",

The decrease of \u00a383m during the year resulted from a capital injection of \u00a350m to Barclays Principal Investments Limited offset by a decrease in the AT1 holdings and associated fair value which totalled \u00a3133m.\n\n## Impairment in subsidiaries\n\nAt the end of each reporting period an impairment review is undertaken in respect of investment in the ordinary shares of subsidiaries. Where impairment may be indicated a test of the carrying value against the recoverable value is performed; impairment being indicated where the investment exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as a value in use (VIU) which is derived from the present value of future cash flows expected to be received from the investment. The VIU calculations use forecast profits based on financial budgets approved by management, covering a five year period as an approximation of future cash flows discounted using a pre-tax discount rate appropriate to the subsidiary being tested. A terminal growth rate has then been applied to the cash flows thereafter which is based upon expectations of future inflation rates. The 2023 review identified the value in use calculated was higher than the carrying value for all subsidiaries.\n\n## Loans and advances to subsidiaries\n\nDuring the year loans and advances to subsidiaries decreased by \u00a34,702m to \u00a318,926m (2022: \u00a323,628m). The decrease was largely driven due to maturities of \u00a34,982m intra-group loans to Barclays PLC subsidiaries and foreign exchange impact of \u00a31,049m due to the appreciation of GBP largely against USD. This was partially offset by the new issuances of intra-group loans to Barclays PLC subsidiaries of \u00a31,260m.\n\n## Subordinated liabilities and debt securities in issue\n\nDuring the year, Barclays PLC issued USD1,500m of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes, which are included within the subordinated liabilities balance of \u00a310,018m (2022: \u00a311,230m). Debt securities in issue of \u00a318,308m (2022: \u00a324,086m) have reduced during the year primarily due to  maturities of \u00a34,931m senior issuances and the  foreign exchange impact of \u00a3847m due to the appreciation of GBP largely against USD.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value\n\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value of \u00a331,832mm (2022: \u00a322,971m) primarily included new issuances during the year of EUR1,250m Fixed Rate Resetting Senior Callable Notes, \u00a32,000m Fixed Rate Resetting Senior Callable Notes, USD8,200m Fixed-toFloating Rate Senior Callable Notes and USD300m Floating Rate Senior Notes . The proceeds raised through these transactions were used to invest in subsidiaries of Barclays PLC and are included within the financial assets designated at fair value through the income statement balance of \u00a335,787m (2022: \u00a328,930m). The effect of changes in the liabilities fair value, including those due to credit risk, is expected to offset the changes in the fair value of the related financial asset in the income statement. The difference between the financial liabilities carrying amount and the contractual amount on maturity is \u00a31,838m (2022: \u00a32,100m).\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDuring the year derivative financial liabilities decreased by \u00a3195m to \u00a3711m (2022: \u00a3906m). This is primarily driven by the gain in derivatives due to a decreasing rate environment.\n\n## Total equity\n\n## Called up share capital and share premium\n\nCalled up share capital and share premium of Barclays PLC is \u00a34,288m (2022: \u00a34,373m). The decrease in the year is primarily due to 837m shares repurchased with a total nominal value of \u00a3209m. This decrease was offset by shares issued under employee share schemes.\n\n## Other equity instruments\n\nOther equity instruments of \u00a313,198m (2022: \u00a313,250m) comprises AT1 securities issued by Barclays PLC. The AT1 securities are perpetual securities with no fixed maturity and are structured to qualify as AT1 instruments under prevailing capital rules applicable as at the relevant issue date. During the year there were three issuances with principal amounts totalling \u00a31,500m, USD1,750m and SGD400m and redemptions with principal amounts totalling \u00a31,250m and USD2,500m.

Unless otherwise stated, the income statement analysis compares the year ended 31 December 2023 to the corresponding twelve months of 2022 and balance sheet analysis as at 31 December 2023 with comparatives relating to 31 December 2022. The abbreviations '\u00a3m' and '\u00a3bn' represent millions and thousands of millions of Pounds Sterling respectively; the abbreviations '$m' and '$bn' represent millions and thousands of millions of US Dollars respectively; and the abbreviations '\u20acm' and '\u20acbn' represent millions and thousands of millions of Euros respectively.\n\nThere are a number of key judgement areas, for example impairment calculations, which are based on models and which are subject to ongoing adjustment and modifications. Reported numbers reflect best estimates and judgements at the given point in time.\n\nRelevant terms that are used in this document but are not defined under applicable regulatory guidance or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are explained in the results glossary that can be accessed at home.barclays/ investor-relations/reports-and-events/ latest-financial-results.\n\nThese results will be filed on a Form 20-F with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as soon as practicable following their publication. Once filed with the SEC, a copy of the Form 20-F will be available from the Barclays Investor Relations website at home.barclays/ annualreport and from the SEC's website at sec.gov. Barclays is a frequent issuer in the debt capital markets and regularly meets with investors via formal road-shows and other ad hoc meetings. Consistent with its usual practice, Barclays expects that from time to time over the coming quarter it will meet with investors globally to discuss these results and other matters relating to the Group.\n\n## Non-IFRS performance measures\n\nBarclays' management believes that the non-IFRS performance measures included in this document provide valuable information to the readers of the financial statements as they enable the reader to identify a more consistent basis for comparing the businesses' performance between financial periods and provide more detail concerning the elements of performance which the managers of these businesses are most directly able to influence or are relevant for an assessment of the Group. They also reflect an important aspect of the way in which operating targets are defined and performance is monitored by Barclays' management. However, any nonIFRS performance measures in this document are not a substitute for IFRS measures and readers should consider the IFRS measures as well. Refer to pages 387 to 393 for further information and calculations of non-IFRS performance measures included throughout this document, and the most directly comparable IFRS measures.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThis document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue', 'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but also may be made verbally by directors, officers and employees of the Group (including during management presentations) in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group's future financial position, business strategy, income levels, costs, assets and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, capital leverage and other regulatory ratios, capital distributions (including policy on dividends and share buybacks), return on tangible equity, projected levels of growth in banking and financial markets, industry trends, any commitments and targets (including environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments and targets), plans and objectives for future operations and other statements that are not historical or current facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. Forward-looking statements speak only as at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking statements may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation: changes in legislation, regulations, governmental and regulatory policies, expectations and actions, voluntary codes of practices and the interpretation thereof, changes in International Financial Reporting Standards and other accounting standards, including practices with regard to the interpretation and application thereof and emerging and developing ESG reporting standards; the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; the Group's ability along with governments and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; environmental, social and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics and similar events beyond the Group's control; the impact of competition in the banking and financial services industry; capital, liquidity, leverage and other regulatory rules and requirements applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions, including inflation; volatility in credit and capital markets; market related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; higher or lower asset valuations; changes in credit ratings of any entity within the Group or any securities issued by it; changes in counterparty risk; changes in consumer behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on European and global macroeconomic conditions, political stability and financial markets; political elections; developments in the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU); the risk of cyberattacks, information or security breaches, technology failures or other operational disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the Group's reputation, business or operations; the Group's ability to access funding; and the success of acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions. A number of these factors are beyond the Group's control. As a result, the Group's actual financial position, results, financial and non-financial metrics or performance measures or its ability to meet commitments and targets may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in the Group's forwardlooking statements. In setting its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, Barclays has made certain assumptions about the macro-economic environment, including, without limitation, inflation, interest and unemployment rates, the different markets and competitive conditions in which Barclays operates, and its ability to grow certain businesses and achieve costs savings and other structural actions. Additional risks and factors which may impact the Group's future financial condition and performance are identified in the description of material existing and emerging risks beginning on page 258 of this Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSubject to Barclays PLC's obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the UK and the US) in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nThis document is printed on Revive 100 Offset, made from 100% FSC\u00ae Rec ycled certified fibre sourced from de-inked post-consumer waste.
