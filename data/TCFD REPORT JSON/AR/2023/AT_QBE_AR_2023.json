More than ever, we are reminded of the importance of resilience and how it is fundamental to our future success.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, QBE delivered a statutory net profit after tax of $1,355 million in 2023 following a continuation of exceptional premium growth of 10%. Importantly, our capital position and balance sheet remain strong. Reflecting our confidence in the outlook, the Board has declared a final dividend of 48 Australian cents per share, bringing the total dividends paid in respect of the 2023 year to 62 Australian cents per share. This compares with dividends of 39 Australian cents per share for 2022.\n\nAs we face an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events\n\nglobally, we must collectively learn to mitigate their impacts and improve our preparedness and responses. Our focus remains on keeping people and communities as safe as possible and reducing the devastating impacts that these events can have on all of us.\n\nQBE is committed to the sustainability agenda we set in 2022. We continue to find ways to partner with our customers and suppliers to foster an orderly and inclusive transition to a net-zero future.\n\nOur people remain at the heart of QBE. To support a sustainable and resilient workforce, in March 2023 we created new 'belonging' targets and measurements across multiple dimensions of the diversity of our people. We were externally recognised for this market leading work, winning the Most Inclusive Workplace at the Australian HR Institute (AHRI) Awards.\n\nAs we plan for the future, building talent and succession is a key focus for QBE, at all levels of the enterprise. We have strengthened our pipeline of talent and succession and benefitted from this strong commitment with a number of internal executive appointments in 2023.\n\nBoard renewal remains critical to the stewardship of QBE and we were pleased to welcome Peter Wilson, Steve Ferguson and Penny James as Independent Non-Executive Directors during 2023.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nOur Vision of being the most consistent and innovative partner demands that QBE is future ready. Cognisant of this, we continue to take advantage of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), to enhance our operations. We also continue to invest in protecting data privacy in an environment where cyber-related challenges are increasingly prevalent.\n\nQBE has a strong history of supporting customers for over 137 years, and in 2023 we were proud to celebrate 50 years of continuous trading on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).\n\nUnder the leadership of Andrew Horton and the Group Executive Committee, QBE has executed strongly against our strategic priorities, with a global team of over 13,000 people who are united behind our Purpose and Vision. I thank all of our team for their focus and dedication delivering for our shareholders, customers and our communities.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I also thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support of QBE.\n\nMike Wilkins AO\n\nChair\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

Against this backdrop I am pleased with the improved resilience in the business, as we remain focused on building greater consistency.\n\nto short-tail prior year reserve deterioration, and inflationary pressure across a small group of portfolios.\n\nReducing volatility remains a primary focus, and we have made good progress this year. Our property catastrophe exposure has undergone a dramatic recalibration, and will benefit from recent portfolio terminations plus material improvement in rate and terms.\n\nMarkets remain attractive, and we achieved gross written premium growth of 10%, driven by premium rate increases of 9.7%, which continue to compound.\n\nWe take comfort from the general stability in long-tail reserves in the year, with the reserve transaction completed in 1H23, a significant milestone in reducing potential reserve volatility. With global insured losses of around $120 billion, it is encouraging to see our catastrophe costs land below allowance for the year.\n\nOur North America division delivered a combined operating ratio of 103.7%. While performance will improve with the run-off of non-core lines, we remain focused on driving incremental performance improvement in our core segments.\n\nHigher interest rates have supported a strong investment result for the period, and continue to suggest a positive outlook for returns in 2024.\n\nFor detailed discussion of Group and divisional performance, please refer to pages 8 to 15 of this report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRecent years have demanded the need for organisations to respond and steer through complex circumstances. Our QBE teams around the world continue to demonstrate their commitment to our customers, and I am incredibly proud of their enthusiasm in our purpose of enabling a more resilient future.\n\nOur efforts over the near term will continue to concentrate around resilience and reducing volatility, which should drive more consistent outcomes for our people, customers and stakeholders. We remain focused on delivering better performance in North America; and despite an unsatisfactory result this period, we have made the business simpler, terminated poorer performing property relationships, and performance is expected to improve with the run-off of non-core lines.\n\nI am pleased with our internal appointments to the Group Executive Committee during the year. In September 2023, Peter Burton, who has over 15 years with QBE in underwriting and management, was appointed as Group Chief Underwriting Officer; and Julie Wood was appointed Chief Executive Officer, North America.\n\n## Business performance\n\nFinancial performance improved in the period, and QBE is demonstrating greater consistency and resilience. Our Group adjusted cash return on equity of 16.0% improved materially from the prior year.\n\nOur combined operating ratio of 95.2% improved from 95.9% in the prior year; however this missed our original plan, largely due",

        "page_content": "## Strategy in action\n\nOur six strategic priorities remain consistent. We are focused on having the right capabilities, people and technology to deliver our strategy, drive competitive advantage and support our customers. Pages 6 and 7 of this report detail our progress and achievements against these priorities, along with future focus areas.\n\nOur strategy to improve performance in North America remains a primary focus for the Board and management, and we are tasked to build a business which delivers performance that is consistent with our Group targets. We have renewed our focus on building and strengthening relationships with our major trading partners, and are confident we can successfully manage our priorities for the division. This includes the run-off of non-core lines, improvement in middle-market performance, driving growth in adjacent specialties and achieving better balance across our three core insurance segments of Crop, Speciality and Commercial.\n\nPortfolio Optimisation and Sustainable Growth priorities play a critical role in our ambition to deliver a consistent Group combined operating ratio in the low to mid 90s. Our Portfolio Optimisation initiatives in 2023 focused on our property portfolio, where we have improved balance across the Group and reduced potential earnings volatility.\n\nWe want to accelerate QBE's data-centric capabilities and expand our ability to support customer resilience through new technologies, such as AI. We will continue to leverage technology to deliver better outcomes for customers through our Modernisation strategic priority and QBE Ventures initiatives.\n\nDelivering against the strategic priorities outlined at the beginning of 2022 is uniting our enterprise and we have made good progress. We enter 2024 with a consistent set of strategic priorities and strong momentum across the enterprise.\n\n## Supporting our customers, communities and people\n\nPeople are at the heart of our business, and it is the actions we take to support our customers, communities and people that underline this commitment. As a global insurer, QBE's portfolio is broad and diverse, helping customers recover from a range of unexpected events. We are proud of our dedicated people, who are experts in their fields across our business, and are there for our customers and partners around the world.\n\nQBE has been there for families, businesses and communities who have been impacted by extreme weather events. This year there were a number of natural catastrophe events globally, including the flooding and cyclone events in New Zealand, earthquakes in Turkey and Syria and a series of powerful convective storms across the United States and Europe.\n\nI am encouraged by the progress we are making on our sustainability agenda and integrating sustainability into our business. Importantly, from 2024 our long-term incentive target will have an element directly tied to our sustainability performance. We continue to progress against our three sustainability focus areas and further details can be found in our Sustainability Report, Sustainability Data Book and pages 20 to 33 of this report. In October 2023, the QBE Foundation was recognised at the Australian Workplace Giving Awards and received three Runners Up Awards for Best Corporate and Charity Partnership for our Global Disaster Relief and Resilience Partnership, Best Grants Program and Best Innovation for QGiving (an employee fundraising and volunteering platform).\n\n## Outlook\n\nOver the last two years, QBE has been focused on delivering greater resilience and consistency. I see meaningful progress across the business, and I am confident that we can drive further progress against our strategic priorities in 2024.\n\nThe alignment and connectivity across the enterprise has improved considerably in my time at QBE and we are motivated to deliver on our plan, better leverage our unique global platform and ultimately realise our potential.\n\nWe expect trading conditions to remain favourable in the year ahead.

The management basis reflects adjustments to the statutory result to provide greater transparency over the underlying drivers of the Group's performance. A reconciliation between the management basis and the statutory result is provided on pages 14 and 15.\n\nThe Group reported a combined operating ratio of 95.2% which improved from 95.9% in the prior year, and includes a 0.6% impact from the upfront cost of the $1.9 billion reserve transaction announced in February 2023. The result was supported by attractive premium rate increases, which accelerated notably in property and reinsurance lines. As a result, aggregate rate increases trended at or above inflation across most lines, resulting in further ex-cat claims ratio improvement.\n\nThe year was characterised by a significant reinsurance supply-demand imbalance, particularly for lower attaching catastrophe coverage. Associated challenges were compounded by record significant secondary peril activity with 2023 industry insured losses of around $120 billion. Against this backdrop, it was pleasing to see current year catastrophe costs contained well within allowance. The result was however impacted by meaningful catastrophe related short-tail reserve strengthening, reflecting late-2022 events including winter storm Elliott and floods in Australia.\n\nTotal investment income, excluding fixed income losses from changes in risk-free rates, improved to $1,374 million or a return of 4.7%, compared with $570 million or 2.0% in the prior year, supported by higher interest rates across the core fixed income portfolio.\n\nThe broader result also included a $25 million impairment of QBE's North American owner occupied office premises.\n\nQBE's balance sheet remains strong. The indicative APRA PCA multiple increased to 1.82x from 1.79x at 31 December 2022, and is at the upper end of our 1.6-1.8x target range. Allowing for the payment of the 2023 final dividend of 48 Australian cents, the pro-forma PCA multiple would decline to 1.74x. Capital released from the $1.9 billion reserve transaction added around 6 points to the PCA multiple, and supported growth in the period.\n\nQBE adopted AASB 17 Insurance Contracts from 1 January 2023. The new standard is applied retrospectively, resulting in a restatement of the comparative period. The impacts of adoption are detailed in note 8.1.1 of the consolidated financial statements on page 133. Definitions of key metrics, including how they are calculated, are provided in the glossary from pages 156 to 160. As a result of changes to the presentation of insurance line items introduced by AASB 17, the key metrics used by QBE to manage and assess underwriting performance are derived from components that are no longer separately presented in the financial statements. An analysis of the insurance operating result by these components is provided on page 15.",

        "page_content": "## Underwriting performance\n\nUnless otherwise stated, discussion of performance is on a management basis. A reconciliation to the equivalent statutory result is provided on page 14.\n\n## Net insurance revenue\n\n## Gross written premium\n\nGross written premium increased 9% on a headline basis to $21,748 million from $19,993 million in the prior year. On a constant currency basis, gross written premium increased 10% as a result of strong premium rate increases and targeted new business growth, partially offset by deliberate property portfolio exits in North America and Australia, and reduced exposure across other property lines. Excluding Crop, gross written premium growth was 9% on the same basis. The Group achieved an average renewal premium rate increase of 9.7% compared with 7.9% in the prior year, driven by strong rate increases in property classes and favourable markets for QBE Re, alongside softening rates in financial lines. Premium rate changes exclude North America Crop and Australian compulsory third party motor (CTP).\n\n## Reinsurance expenses\n\nHeadline reinsurance expenses increased 13% to $4,226 million from $3,746 million in the prior year. Much of the increase relates to Crop, where the majority of growth in the portfolio was ceded to the Federal reinsurance scheme, in an effort to manage net retention and earnings volatility. Reinsurance expenses also included a charge of $101 million, representing the upfront cost of the $1.9 billion reserve transaction completed in the first half of 2023.\n\n## Net insurance revenue\n\nGroup net insurance revenue increased 11% on a constant currency basis, slightly higher than the growth in gross written premium. This largely reflects the earn-through of strong premium rate increases in recent periods. The upfront cost associated with the aforementioned reserve transaction was incurred in our North America and International business segments.\n\n## Net claims\n\nThe net claims ratio decreased to 65.1% from 66.0% in 2022. The result was driven by improvement in the ex-cat claims ratio, partially offset by largely catastrophe related adverse prior year development. Current year catastrophe costs trended favourably relative to allowance, following more benign experience through the second half.\n\nThe ex-cat claims ratio decreased to 59.1% from 60.5% in the prior year. The result included the current year risk adjustment of $518 million, compared to $591 million in the prior year. Excluding risk adjustment, the ex-cat claims ratio reduced to 56.0% from 56.6% in the prior year. The industry continues to exhibit good discipline in response to elevated inflation, where rate increases remained at or above observed inflation across most lines. While inflation is easing in some lines, it remains more persistent across a small number of portfolios including Australia Pacific personal lines, and North America non-core lines and Accident & Health. While evidence of higher claims inflation across many longer tail classes is limited, QBE remains attuned to the potential for lags and persistency of inflation in these lines, alongside the risks posed by social inflation.\n\nThe net cost of catastrophe claims increased marginally to $1,092 million or 6.6% of net insurance revenue, from $1,060 million or 7.0% in the prior year. The result was below the Group's catastrophe allowance of $1,175 million. Natural catastrophe costs were driven by significant secondary peril activity, including the New Zealand floods, a series of North American convective storm events through the first half, and meaningful storm and flood activity in Europe and Australia in the second half.\n\nQBE strengthened the central estimate of outstanding claims by $225 million, which largely reflected adverse development on short-tail lines. This compares to $141 million adverse in the prior year. The outcome was driven by late development on end-2022 catastrophe events including winter storm Elliott in North America and floods in Australia. In addition, the North America result was impacted by adverse development of $30 million in Crop. These impacts were partially offset by favourable development in LMI and CTP in Australia Pacific, and QBE Re. The aforementioned reserve strengthening was more than offset by favourable development of  $320 million related to the unwind of risk adjustment from prior accident years, a decrease from $369 million in the prior year. This resulted in favourable prior accident year claims development of $95 million or 0.6% of net insurance revenue, decreasing from $228 million or 1.5% in the prior year.\n\n## Commission and expenses\n\nThe net commission ratio increased to 18.3% from 18.2% in the prior year, primarily due to business mix changes, where the impact from quota share reinsurance ceding commissions is now recorded within reinsurance income under AASB 17.\n\nThe Group's expense ratio of 11.8% was a slight increase from 11.7% last year. This reflected constant currency expense growth of 12%, which was balanced by strong net revenue growth. Elevated expense growth reflected investment in our modernisation program, the cost of targeted growth initiatives and the impact of elevated inflation across the broader expense base.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

Key metrics disclosed on a statutory basis are derived from unadjusted components of /financial statement line items.\n\n## North America\n\nGross written premium increased by 4% to $7,555 million, with strong premium rate increases and targeted organic growth partially offset by the run-off of non-core lines. Excluding premium rate increases and Crop, premium declined by 12% mainly reflecting the run-off of non-core lines. On the same basis and excluding this drag, premium growth was 4%.\n\nNorth America reported a combined operating ratio of 103.7%, which compares to 99.5% in the prior year. The ex-cat claims ratio improved by 0.2% to 65.7%, or increased by 0.2% when excluding risk adjustment. This reflected inflationary pressures observed in Accident & Health, alongside challenges in non-core lines, partially offset by improvement in middle-market and property classes. Net catastrophe claims of $234 million or 4.9% of net insurance revenue were mainly driven by convective storm and flood events in the first half of 2023, and compared favourably to 5.4% in the prior year. Catastrophe experience was more benign through the second half. Adverse prior year central estimate development of $200 million or 4.2% compared with 0.9% in the prior year, and was driven predominantly by short-tail lines, including adverse development on winter storm Elliott from late-2022, and $30 million in Crop.\n\nThe current accident year Crop combined operating ratio was 96.6%, slightly higher than expectations primarily due to lower commodity prices and drought across several States.\n\n|                                |      | MANAGEMENT 1   | MANAGEMENT 1   | STATUTORY   | STATUTORY      |\n|--------------------------------|------|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|\n| FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER |      | 2023           | RESTATED  2022 | 2023        | RESTATED  2022 |\n| Key underwriting metrics       |      |                |                |             |                |\n| Gross written premium          | US$M | 7,555          | 7, 28 0        | 7,555       | 7, 28 0        |\n| Net insurance revenue          | US$M | 4,790          | 4,641          | 4,432       | 4,435          |\n| Net claims ratio               | %    | 73.0           | 68.9           | 70.3        | 67.8           |\n| Net commission ratio           | %    | 21.6           | 21.4           | 22.6        | 22.3           |\n| Expense ratio                  | %    | 9.1            | 9.2            | 9.8         | 9.7            |\n| Combined operating ratio       | %    | 103.7          | 99.5           | 102.7       | 99.8           |\n\n## International\n\nGross written premium increased by 17% in constant currency to $8,802 million, reflecting an acceleration in rate increases for property and reinsurance lines, and continued execution against a number of multi-year growth opportunities.

The ex-cat claims ratio improved by 3.0% to 54.3%, or 1.6% excluding the risk adjustment. This strong result reflects the benefit from aggregate rate increases which continue to track at or above inflation, and benign large claims experience.

        "page_content": "## Australia Pacific\n\nContinued premium rate increases and targeted growth supported constant currency growth in gross written premium of 8% to $5,392 million. Excluding premium rate increases, gross written premium reduced by 1% compared to the prior year. The exit of two consumer portfolios, in line with our focus on reducing property catastrophe volatility was largely offset by organic growth in Australian commercial lines, CTP and in New Zealand.\n\nAustralia Pacific reported a combined operating ratio of 93.6%, which declined slightly from 92.8% in the prior year. The ex-cat claims ratio reduced by 1.1% to 58.2%, or 0.4% excluding the risk adjustment. Persistent short-tail claims inflation, particularly in personal lines, has been an ongoing challenge; however, the momentum in short-tail premium rate increases which generally built through 2023, is expected to support underwriting margins in the year ahead. Net catastrophe claims of $409 million or 8.4% of net insurance revenue, increased slightly from 8.1% in the prior year driven by storm and flood events in New Zealand, and Australian east coast storms in the final weeks of the year. Favourable prior year central estimate development of $20 million or 0.4% reduced from $44 million or 0.9% in the prior year. Favourable experience in LMI and CTP more than offset catastrophe and inflation-related strengthening in short-tail classes, and higher wage growth assumptions in liability lines.\n\n|                                |      | MANAGEMENT 1   | MANAGEMENT 1   | STATUTORY   | STATUTORY      |\n|--------------------------------|------|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|\n| FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER |      | 2023           | RESTATED  2022 | 2023        | RESTATED  2022 |\n| Key underwriting metrics       |      |                |                |             |                |\n| Gross written premium          | US$M | 5,392          | 5,219          | 5,392       | 5,219          |\n| Net insurance revenue          | US$M | 4,881          | 4,585          | 4,901       | 4,689          |\n| Net claims ratio               | %    | 64.0           | 64.2           | 60.2        | 61.0           |\n| Net commission ratio           | %    | 15.7           | 15.5           | 16.8        | 17.1           |\n| Expense ratio                  | %    | 13.9           | 13.1           | 14.0        | 14.1           |\n| Combined operating ratio       | %    | 93.6           | 92.8           | 91.0        | 92.2           |\n\n## Investment performance\n\nTotal investment income for the year was $1,374 million, equating to a return of 4.7%. The result improved substantially from $570 million or 2.0% in the prior year, with higher interest rates supporting fixed income returns, which also included a favourable mark to market impact from tighter credit spreads. Risk asset returns were broadly in line with our long-term return expectations, a pleasing outcome given valuation pressure in the unlisted property portfolio.\n\nCore fixed income includes cash and cash equivalents, and excludes enhanced fixed income risk assets which comprise emerging market debt, high yield debt and private credit. Enhanced fixed income assets are analysed as part of risk assets. The core fixed income portfolio delivered a return of 4.8% or $1,247 million, a significant increase on $544 million in the prior year. The result included a $116 million benefit from tighter credit spreads, compared to an adverse impact of $128 million in the prior year. The running yield on the core fixed income portfolio remained strong through the year, with the 31 December 2023 exit running yield of 4.6% around 50 basis points higher than at 31 December 2022.\n\nRisk asset performance improved significantly compared to the prior year. Enhanced fixed income and infrastructure assets delivered strong returns, helping to offset weaker performance in the unlisted property portfolio, due to lower property valuations. Despite negative unlisted property returns, the risk asset portfolio delivered a return of 5.7% or $190 million compared with 1.2% in the prior year.\n\n## Funds under management\n\nFunds under management comprise cash and cash equivalents, investments and investment properties. Funds under management of $30,064 million increased by 7% compared to $28,167 million at 31 December 2022, or 5% on a constant currency basis. Strong investment returns and continued premium growth were offset by the material reduction in investment assets associated with the $1.9 billion reserve transaction, which was announced in February 2023.\n\nPortfolio mix continued to trend toward our target strategic asset allocation in 2023. The allocation to risk assets increased to 12% (and 14% on a committed basis) from 11% at 31 December 2022. The core fixed income portfolio now represents 88% of total investments, and QBE continues to target a strategic asset allocation of ~85% core fixed income and ~15% risk assets.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Tax\n\nQBE's effective statutory tax rate was 25.7% compared with 12.0% in the prior year. The effective tax rate reflects the mix of corporate tax rates across QBE's key regions. The 2022 effective tax rate was impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognised tax losses in the North American tax group.\n\nDuring the year, QBE paid $138 million in corporate income tax globally. No tax payments were made by the Australian tax group for the year due to the utilisation of tax losses, which are now fully utilised. The Australian tax group is expected to pay taxes from 2024. The balance of the franking account stood at A$46 million as at 31 December 2023. Having regard to QBE's franked AT1 distribution commitments and carry over tax losses, the dividend franking percentage is expected to remain around 10%.\n\n## Balance sheet and capital management\n\n## Balance sheet and share information\n\n|                               |          | STATUTORY        | STATUTORY                  |\n|-------------------------------|----------|------------------|----------------------------|\n| AS AT                         |          | 31 DECEMBER 2023 | RESTATED  31 DECEMBER 2022 |\n| Net assets                    | US$M     | 9,953            | 8,857                      |\n| Less: intangible assets       | US$M     | 2,112            | 2,018                      |\n| Net tangible assets           | US$M     | 7,841            | 6,839                      |\n| Number of shares on issue     | millions | 1,494            | 1,485                      |\n| Net tangible assets per share | US$      | 5.25             | 4.61                       |\n\n## Net outstanding claims\n\nNet outstanding claims comprise claims reserves within the net liability for incurred claims including recoveries on reinsurance loss portfolio transfers. At 31 December 2023, the net discounted central estimate was $17,198 million, which increased from $16,101 million at 31 December 2022 due to organic growth and reserve strengthening, partially offset by the impact of the $1.9 billion reserve transaction and higher discount rates.\n\nExcluding foreign exchange and the reserve transaction, the net discounted central estimate increased by $2,485 million. This underlying growth primarily reflected new business growth, inflation and reserve strengthening in the period.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the risk adjustment was $1,379 million or 8.0% of the net discounted central estimate, consistent with 31 December 2022, and at the top end of our 6-8% target range.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nAt 31 December 2023, total borrowings were $2,798 million, an increase of $54 million from $2,744 million at 31 December 2022. The broadly stable outcome reflects Tier 2 funding activity in the period, including the issuance of A$300 million and A$330 million in June 2023 and October 2023 respectively, largely offsetting a $400 million redemption in November 2023.\n\nDebt to total capital reduced to 21.9% at 31 December 2023, from 23.7% at 31 December 2022, reflecting continued growth across the business along with improved investment performance. At 31 December 2023, all the Group's borrowings count towards regulatory capital. Gross interest expense on borrowings for the year was $169 million, an increase from $166 million in the prior year, reflecting the sequencing of funding activity in the year. The average annualised cash cost of borrowings at 31 December 2023 was 5.9%, consistent with the prior year.\n\n## Capital\n\nQBE's indicative PCA multiple improved to 1.82x at 31 December 2023 from 1.79x at 31 December 2022. Allowing for the payment of the 2023 final dividend of 48 Australian cents, the pro-forma PCA multiple would decline to 1.74x. Capital generation over the period was supported by strong profitability, alongside a 6 point benefit associated with the $1.9 billion reserve transaction. This more than offset capital consumed through ongoing premium growth and the payment of dividends during the year.",

This represents a full year dividend payout ratio of 45% of adjusted cash profit. QBE's dividend policy is calibrated to a 40-60% payout of annual adjusted cash profit, which has been set at a level which can support the Group's growth ambitions and provide flexibility to manage the dynamics associated with the global insurance cycle. The payout for the current period reflects the Board's confidence in the strength of the balance sheet and favourable outlook for returns, while retaining flexibility given the positive outlook for premium growth. The full year dividend payout of A$926 million compares with A$580 million in 2022. The final dividend will be 10% franked and is payable on 12 April 2024. The Dividend Reinvestment Plan and Bonus Share Plan will be satisfied by the issue of shares at a nil discount.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe exit 2023 having executed multiple initiatives to reduce potential reserve volatility and build a more resilient property portfolio. Our portfolio optimisation focus will continue to centre around reducing volatility, with meaningful scope for further improvement. Elevated investment will continue in 2024 as we progress our modernisation agenda. This will ultimately position QBE to grow our core franchises and become a more accessible and efficient partner.\n\nThe outlook for premium rate increases remains favourable. While we expect some moderation from 2023 levels, the degree of uncertainty surrounding the path of inflation, geopolitical tensions and elevated catastrophe activity should serve to maintain market discipline. We enter the year with a broad growth agenda and see good opportunity for further ex-rate growth. This will be tempered by the ongoing run-off of exited property portfolios in North America and Australia, which are collectively expected to represent a ~$300 million gross written premium headwind in 2024. Executing on our strategy in North America remains a primary focus. The underwriting loss associated with non-core lines should reduce meaningfully into 2024, and then reduce further and broadly conclude in 2025.\n\nInflation challenges are expected to remain a feature for the foreseeable future. While we expect aggregate claims inflation to normalise slightly into 2024, recent experience highlights this is unlikely to occur uniformly across all regions and classes, and the operating backdrop remains dynamic.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

In the current year, this principally related to Crop (North America) for additional premium cessions to the US government on prior year claims under the MPCI scheme and CTP (Australia Pacific) for profit commission income arising from favourable development under the 2021 reinsurance loss portfolio transfer. Underlying PYD also includes an adjustment for periodic payment order (PPO) liabilities within International to reflect their annuity characteristics.\n\n## Reinsurance loss portfolio transfer transactions (LPT)\n\nThe subsequent impacts of in-force reinsurance loss portfolio transfer contracts within reinsurance expenses and reinsurance income are analysed on a net basis within net claims expense to provide a view of the underlying development on these contracts against the corresponding development of the subject gross reserves, consistent with the focus on net underwriting performance. Adjustments relate to the current year reserve transaction to reinsure claims liabilities in North America and International, and other reinsurance loss portfolio transfer contracts entered into in prior years.\n\n## Australian pricing promise review (APPR)\n\nIn 2022, the Group recognised a $75 million net cost (before tax) following a review of pricing promises across a range of retail products which identified instances where the policy pricing promise was not fully delivered. The net cost comprised amounts for customer remediation, interest payable and other costs associated with administering the program. There has been no material change to the costs recognised in profit or loss since the prior year.\n\n## Investment risk-free rate (RFR) impacts\n\nNet investment income (loss) is analysed separately between risk-free rate movement impacts on fixed income assets, and remaining income (loss). This enables analysis of these risk-free rate movement impacts alongside the corresponding offsetting impacts on net insurance liabilities within insurance finance income.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nQBE's Risk Management Strategy (RMS) outlines our approach to managing risk by articulating the fundamental principles which apply to all levels of the organisation. The RMS is reviewed annually to assess compliance and e/ffectiveness. QBE's approach to managing risk e/ffectively is supported by our Enterprise Risk Management Framework.\n\n## Strategic planning, risk appetite and capital management\n\nQBE embeds risk management in the strategic and business planning process to allow risks to be managed in an integrated manner and to support QBE's overall strategic objectives. Material risks are identified and assessed as part of this and stress testing is performed to enable QBE to design actions to help achieve our business plan objectives while staying within risk appetite.\n\nRisk Appetite Statements (RAS) define thresholds for our risk appetite with associated actions for clear reporting to management and the Board. Key risk indicators and other financial and non-financial metrics are continually being developed to support our RAS and quantify our risk tolerance, informing timely and appropriate responses.\n\nTo maintain balance between our risk appetite and strategic planning, our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process enables us to allocate resources for sustainable growth and optimise risk and return. There has been significant effort in aligning the capital management approach across all divisions and uplifting use of capital models in decision making.\n\n## Risk processes and standards\n\nQBE's Group Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) Standard sets out minimum requirements for how we identify and assess risks and controls in a way that embeds risk management across the business. The standard enables improvement of risk and control effectiveness, where strong embedment of RCSAs has increased the understanding and capability of first line and led to strong ownership of risks, controls and responsibilities.\n\nQBE's Incident and Issue Management Standard sets out minimum requirements for managing incidents and issues which allows us to understand our risk exposure and identify root causes to improve the overall control environment. The standard outlines the identification, escalation, resolution and reporting process for incidents and issues.\n\nThe Risk Maturity Self-Assessment (RMSA) is used to annually assess risk maturity across the Group, understand how well risk is being managed and benchmark against our target maturity levels. QBE is on an ongoing journey to uplift risk maturity, and identifying areas for continual improvement of risk management through RMSA enables us to achieve our strategic goals and business objectives.\n\nQBE's risk management processes and standards are underpinned by our internal governance, risk and compliance system Insight which captures data relating to our risks, obligations, controls, incidents and issues. We regularly make improvements to Insight to build this data analysis capability, with report and dashboard functionalities supporting oversight and monitoring activity.\n\n## Risk governance\n\nRisk management is governed primarily by the Board Risk & Capital Committee, and by the Executive Risk Committee at a management level.\n\nQBE manages risk through the three lines model which outlines where accountabilities for risk management activities sit across the business. Primary responsibility for risk management lies with the business (first line). The Risk and Compliance team provides review and challenge, oversight, monitoring and reporting on QBE's material risks (second line). Internal Audit provides independent assurance on the compliance with, and effectiveness of, QBE's risk management framework (third line).\n\n## Risk culture\n\nQBE recognises the importance of a sound risk culture, and that risk culture is strongly intertwined with our QBE DNA. Our Board, assisted by the Board Risk & Capital Committee, is responsible for overseeing our risk culture, including forming a view on whether it supports QBE to operate consistently within its risk appetite.\n\nQBE regularly monitors and measures the maturity of our risk culture against Board-approved Target Statements, applying a range of tools and indicators. Important components which facilitate our risk culture include developing a strong risk mindset and risk skills in our business, a commitment to safety in speaking up, and recognising risk performance through balanced rewards and incentives.",

Natural catastrophe activity continues globally with multiple storm, flood and wildfire events. QBE is focused on analysing and managing the potential impacts from these external factors. Each year, the top risks inform planning of activities such as stress and scenario analysis, realistic disaster scenarios and Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process scenarios. Our analysis of top risks includes impact to QBE, management actions and the risk trend. The management actions taken to address the top risks are closely linked with the work we are doing as part of our strategic priority areas.\n\n## Top risks\n\n## Management actions\n\n| Geopolitical:  Potential consequences associated with political  shifts, international conflicts, trade disruptions, and regulatory  changes, which can influence the insurance landscape.  Increased levels of sanctions, including increased differences  across major trading economies (US, UK, EU and Australia),  pose a risk of operational complexity and an uncompetitive  position in international markets.                                                                    | Our proactive approach to geopolitical risk management  involves monitoring rapid changes in the international  sanctions' environment, undertaking of appropriate  screening and due diligence and continuously  assessing the geopolitical environment when making  risk selection decisions.                                                                                                                                             |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Economic uncertainty:  This year we have seen persistent  high levels of inflation across the global economy following  Russia's invasion of Ukraine, worsening supply chain issues  which emerged from COVID-19 and restricting the supply  of oil and gas. In response to inflation, central banks from  major economies have regularly increased interest rates.  A heightened risk of recession arose from weaker growth  in nominal economic activity and associated cost of living. | We continue to monitor these economic variables by  engaging in comprehensive analysis to understand the  potential impact on our business. The risk of inflation and  recession have been key considerations for underwriting  in 2023. Scenario testing was performed in 2023 to consider  the potential impact of a deep recession on gross written  premium, reserves and investment income and how it would  affect the business plan. |\n| Cyber:  The proliferation of technology has brought about  unprecedented opportunities and convenience, but it has also  exposed businesses to a new realm of threats. Cyberattack,  data breaches and privacy violations can disrupt business  operations and erode customer trust.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | QBE continues to monitor the cyber threat landscape.

        "page_content": "## Strategy\n\n## QBE has a strong focus on climate-related risks and opportunities through our sustainability strategy focus areas.\n\nAs an international insurer and reinsurer, we see first-hand the impacts of a changing climate on our customers, communities and partners. This is why two of our three sustainability strategy focus areas relate to the role we play in addressing climate risks and opportunities:\n\n## 1. Foster an orderly and inclusive transition to a net-zero economy\n\n- 2. Enable a sustainable and resilient workforce\n\n## 3. Partner for growth through innovative, sustainable and impactful solutions\n\nOur first focus area outlines our support for an orderly and inclusive transition to a net-zero emissions economy, aligned with limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C by the end of 2100. We recognise the importance of addressing climate change and incorporating climate-related risks and opportunities into our decision-making, facilitating a resilient future for our business and our customers. Further, our third focus area looks at how we can explore ways to co-create solutions to meet the changing needs of our customers, and support communities affected by climate impacts and the net-zero transition. Our landscape is changing, presenting opportunities to innovate and partner on impactful solutions through our investments, supplier and broker relationships, the QBE Foundation and QBE Ventures.\n\nTwo of the top three sustainability topics identified through our sustainability materiality assessment this year were climate-related, specifically, natural disaster resilience and, climate change transition and emissions reduction.\n\nWe aim to influence through advocacy, either directly or through industry bodies and have a focus on resilience to extreme weather and emissions reduction by the insurance industry.\n\nThrough industry partnerships, we can share our experience and knowledge to stimulate investment into the area of climate finance to improve natural disaster resilience in the face of a changing climate. For example, QBE is a member of the Hazards Insurance Partnership (HIP), a partnership between the Australian Government and the insurance industry, managed by the National Emergency Management Agency. Through the HIP, the Australian Government and insurers are working together with the aim of addressing insurance affordability and availability issues as driven by natural hazard risk, to reduce risk\n\nfor communities and improve Australia's resilience to natural hazards. In 2023, QBE continued to play an important role in the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) committees and working groups, contributing to the national debate on improved land use planning, building codes, relocation of communities with repeated flood impacts, investment in community resilience to reduce risk and insurance premiums, the net-zero transition, and the value of nature for a more resilient future.\n\nWe seek to influence our stakeholders through engagement, including our supply chain, and external investment managers. We are also engaging with customers, initially focused on our Australasia, Canadian and European businesses with which we have a material commercial relationship, based on gross written premium; and who operate in higher-emitting sectors. In our own operations, we continue to progress our net-zero roadmap and this year maintained our carbon neutrality 1 for a defined inventory of greenhouse gas emissions related to our global operations 2 .\n\nTo further our understanding of climate risks and opportunities, we have continued to undertake physical and transition scenario analysis. Understanding the changing nature of weather-related risks is critical to considering how we can help our customers manage their own physical risks and how we price for, and manage, the accumulation of these risks.\n\nWe have undertaken a global, economy-wide transition scenario analysis which has highlighted the risks and opportunities associated with the pathways to achieving net-zero emissions. While there is more work to be done to deepen our understanding and response to the decarbonisation journey, current data indicates QBE is broadly resilient. As a global insurer and reinsurer, we have the ability to support the transition across many industries and regions through the products and partners we work with across our insurance portfolio, investment portfolio and own operations.\n\n## Our net-zero commitments\n\nQBE has made net-zero commitments for our own operations by 2030, and our investment and underwriting portfolios by 2050. Through these commitments we seek to contribute to the reduction of real-world emissions to mitigate the level of warming this century, and the most severe risks to our customers, society, economy and environment.\n\nQBE's ability to meet our net-zero commitments is reliant on many factors, including the progress individuals, businesses and economies can make to transition to net-zero collectively, particularly in developed countries with net-zero commitments. It also depends on the development of new technology associated with carbon removal and emissions reduction.\n\n- 1  Based on the RE100 Climate Group's materiality threshold guidance which excludes countries with small electricity loads (<100MWh/year and up to a total of 500MWh/year) and where it is not feasible to source renewable electricity via any credible sourcing options.

In 2023, we continued to progress our commitment to net-zero by 2030 for our global operations. Across each of our divisions, we formed working groups to identify further initiatives to reduce our operational emissions. These are summarised in our net-zero operational roadmap, which will continue to evolve over time. Fuel use for our fleet vehicles contributes the most of our Scope 1 emissions, and this year we continued transitioning our fleet to low emissions vehicles. We also continued to optimise the office space we occupy in line with our new ways of working, releasing surplus floorspace and implementing energy efficiency measures across our operations.\n\nAs we provide a hybrid working environment, our commuting and working from home emissions form part of our operational emissions footprint, and we are working with our people to identify ways to reduce these emissions. This includes offering discounts on public transport in certain countries and raising awareness of government lease schemes for electric and hybrid vehicles, where available. To further embed climate considerations into operational decision making, we have set our internal carbon price at $65 per metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent for 2024. We will use this to support internal investment in emission reduction initiatives as well as any expenditure required to maintain our environmental commitments. In 2023, we met our RE100 target for the third year, with 100% of our electricity use across QBE offices (excluding Bermuda and Pacific Islands) certified as renewable, supporting our commitment to 100% renewable electricity by 2025 2 . In 2023, we also maintained carbon neutrality 1 by purchasing renewable energy and fire abatement carbon offset certificates to cover residual emissions for a defined inventory 3 of greenhouse gas emissions related to our global operations, as described in our data book.\n\n## Our net zero roadmap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supply chain\n\nIn 2023, we began climate-related discussions with strategic suppliers across our global supply chain, centred around climate risks, opportunities and measuring and reducing emissions. Initially, a pilot supplier engagement project for 55 suppliers was launched in the Australia Pacific division for the Claims and Indirect Procurement teams, and the Global IT Procurement team. Strategic suppliers were selected, based on QBE's annual spend and importance to QBE's operations. Engagement involved sending a survey out to the selected suppliers with an invitation to join an engagement session to discuss QBE's public targets and obtain details of the supplier's approach to transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Details of emissions calculations, target setting and ongoing sustainability initiatives were collected from the suppliers. This program was then extended to 74 more strategic suppliers from our global supply chain across the Procurement teams in other divisions.\n\nThrough this engagement we have identified several emission reduction opportunities that are being explored within the business. Going forward, we are focusing on addressing these opportunities and working to set targets for these suppliers by the end of 2025.\n\n- 1  Please refer to our data book (Focus Area 1 and Metrics Criteria) for all definitions, calculations, assumptions and methodologies.\n- 2  Based on the RE100 Climate Group's materiality threshold guidance which excludes countries with small electricity loads (<100MWh/year and up to a total of 500MWh/year) and where it is not feasible to source renewable electricity via any credible sourcing options.

        "page_content": "## Investments\n\nAt QBE we are driven by our purpose of enabling a more resilient future. QBE seeks to responsibly invest our proprietary assets, including our premium income, across the globe. Climate change continues to be the most material ESG risk for QBE, and addressing the risks and opportunities associated with climate change will be essential towards aligning our investments portfolio to a net-zero economy. This aligns with our first sustainability focus area, to foster an orderly and inclusive transition to a net-zero economy, and QBE aims to do this through our target setting and tracking, scaling investments in climate solutions, assessing our portfolios' exposures to climate risks and opportunities and engaging with investees to decarbonise their operations.\n\n## Net-zero in investments\n\nAligned with our broader climate strategy and our commitment to impact and responsible investments, QBE became a member of the Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance (NZAOA) in 2020, joining a growing group of institutional investors committed to transitioning their investment portfolios to net-zero emissions by 2050. To deliver on our commitment to transition our investment portfolio to net-zero by 2050, we set our initial 2025 intermediate targets in 2021 on sub-portfolio, engagement and financing the transition metrics, aligned with the NZAOA Target Setting Protocol.\n\nIn 2023, we have progressed towards our 2025 intermediate targets. We continued to invest in climate solutions through an addition of $117 million in green bonds in our portfolio and in 2024 we will explore strategies to set our 2030 target. For sub-portfolio 1 , we have continued to reduce our equities carbon emissions by moving from passive strategies via exchange traded funds to tailored mandates with external developed market equity managers. Engagement continues to be a critical component of our net-zero approach, and we prioritise engagement with our highest emitters in our investment grade corporate credit portfolio, and all external managers, with a key focus on our net-zero 2050 commitment and transition planning. A further update on our progress can be found in the metrics and targets section on page 33, with further information on our engagement strategy and outcomes below.\n\n## Engagement\n\nAs asset owners, we have a unique role at the top of the investment value chain, and we acknowledge both the responsibilities and opportunities that come with this role. Because of this, engagement is our preferred method of eliciting impactful change as we believe that engaging in conversation with our investees to implement sustainable practices in the transition to net-zero will ultimately be more impactful than divestment.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to engage with all our external managers across key climate-related issues and have seen increased ambition in net-zero commitments, enhancement to scenario analysis capabilities and Scope 3 measurement. For our top 20 highest emitters in our investment grade corporate credit portfolio, we focused on challenging them to set short-, medium-, and long-term science-based emissions reduction goals. We are also in discussion with them on a reduction in Scope 1, 2 and material Scope 3 emissions and the formulation of a decarbonisation strategy with clear demonstration that capital expenditure is consistent with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Engagement\n\n## All external managers\n\nacross our investment portfolio\n\n## 20 highest emitters\n\nin our investment grade corporate credit portfolio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof assets under management in climate solutions investments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCarbon intensity reduction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof our Scope 1 and 2 emissions in our equity portfolio",

In 2023, as a result of the implementation of our new investments system, we have been able to undertake analysis on additional asset classes due to an increase in data coverage. As data coverage continues to increase and mature, we too will look to undertake additional analysis.\n\n## Carbon footprinting\n\nWe have assessed the carbon footprint 1 which remains in line with our commitment to maintaining a low carbon risk rating 2 . We use weighted average carbon intensity (WACI), which calculates the weighted average emissions of a portfolio normalised by revenue and measures our portfolio's exposure to carbon-related potential market and regulatory risks. Our WACI of 11.45 tCO2e/$m sales is significantly below the MSCI USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index of 124.4 tCO2e/$m sales due to our low exposure to high-emitting sectors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## High-emitting sector exposure\n\nTo assess our transition risk, we have also looked at the exposure to high-emitting sectors 3 . We expanded our analysis in 2023 to include our high yield debt, emerging market debt and developed market equities portfolios, in addition to investment grade corporate credit. Understanding our exposure to these industries will enable us to continue to target our engagement strategies. Our transition risk remains low, with 6.6% of our portfolio exposed to these high-emitting sectors, as a result of our fossil fuel exclusions screening criteria.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  Our carbon footprinting analysis has been completed on the Scope 1 and 2 weighted average carbon intensity of our investment grade corporate credit portion of our AUM.\n- 2  Carbon risk rating measures exposure to carbon intensive companies. MSCI Carbon Risk is categorised as Very Low (<15), Low (15 to <70), Moderate (70 to <250), High (250 to <525) and Very High (>=525).\n- 3  We use Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) for our high-emitting sector classification, a decision which is informed by the NZAOA Target Setting Protocol and its annex.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Strategy continued\n\n## Underwriting\n\nAlthough QBE withdrew from the Net Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) in May 2023, QBE's focus on our sustainability agenda remains unchanged and continues to be driven by our purpose of enabling a more resilient future. Our commitment of a net-zero underwriting portfolio by 2050 aligns with our commitment to a net-zero investment portfolio by 2050 and net-zero in our own operations by 2030. This is subject to the availability of relevant methodologies, data quality and external factors such as development of technologies.\n\nOur net-zero in underwriting strategy focuses on three important areas:\n\n- 1.  Customer engagement and insights : understanding our priority customers' net-zero ambitions and plans.\n- 2.  Innovative products and services : exploring opportunities to further expand our offerings in support of the transition.\n- 3.  Emissions modelling and tracking : understanding and tracking the emissions of our underwriting portfolio and how we can identify and address material data gaps.\n\n## Customer engagement and insights\n\nEngagement is key because our ability to reach a net-zero underwriting portfolio is dependent on our customers' ability to reduce their own emissions and ultimately become net zero. Initially, we are focused on customers in our Australasia, Canadian and European businesses which:\n\n- \u00b7 we have a material commercial relationship with, based on gross written premium; and\n- \u00b7 operate in higher-emitting sectors (e.g. fossil fuel extraction and use; transportation; agriculture), defined as priority customers.\n\nEngagement with customers allows us to better understand how we can help support them to reduce their emissions. We look to engage at least 50 priority customers at the time of renewal to gather data that we have not previously captured to understand their net-zero ambitions and how they plan to achieve these through decarbonisation efforts.\n\nCustomer insights are invaluable in refining our net-zero underwriting approach, helping us to identify areas for improvement, guiding product and service innovation, and aligning our efforts with customers' expectations by co-creating solutions.\n\n## Innovative products and services\n\nIn July 2023, we took another step towards aligning our underwriting capabilities with the transition by launching insurance for Australian renewable energy projects. We were the first insurer in the Australian market to offer 'cradle to grave' coverage across a project's lifecycle: from construction of renewable energy infrastructure, through to operation, upgrading and decommissioning.\n\n## Emissions modelling and tracking\n\nWe support emissions reporting to provide transparency and to enable progress on transition planning across our value chain, but recognise that poor data capture and quality may result in inaccurate estimations of emissions and of progress on reductions. Insurers, such as QBE, have a material data challenge in measuring and disclosing attributable emissions in relation to their underwriting portfolios as policyholders can range from small and medium enterprises (SMEs), with limited publicly available emissions data, through to large corporates, where emissions disclosures are yet to be standardised. The initiative focuses on commercial lines and private motor, subject to available methodologies, data and regulations.\n\nOur work is ongoing, as emissions data coverage and quality is expected to continue to improve globally, driven predominantly by growth in sustainability reporting regulations. QBE remains focused on supporting an orderly and inclusive transition to a net-zero economy through better data and reporting to inform decision-making.\n\n## Catastrophe modelling\n\nQBE has a global Catastrophe Accumulation Management team. This year we established a Catastrophe Modelling Research team, which will advance our in-house ability to validate and customise our models, including considerations for potentially unaccounted impacts of climate change. We also continue to collaborate with the external partners (model vendors, reinsurance brokers, science community) to stay across advancements in science and technology. The Catastrophe Accumulation Management team regularly refreshes the catastrophe models to keep them aligned with the evolving extreme weather risk we are facing. The new research team has increased rigour and scientific knowledge to the model maintenance process.",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to managing climate risk in underwriting\n\nWe expect climate change will increasingly impact the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes over the long term. In the short term, it is often difficult to distinguish the impact of climate change versus the normal variability in weather and natural catastrophes. Our underwriting approach, implemented through the business planning process, aims to diversify and manage insurance risks accepted and reduce volatility of returns. Climate change is changing our approach to plan for catastrophe risk as outlined below.\n\n## Portfolio management\n\n## Annual renewability\n\nAs our insurance policies typically renew annually, we can continuously adjust our pricing or underwriting appetite.\n\n## Pricing\n\nThe Catastrophe Accumulation Management team provides technical catastrophe pricing for a large number of commercial property policies. Pricing factors are refreshed annually to reflect current catastrophe accumulations, reinsurance costs, required return on capital, and use the best updated catastrophe models available. Policies are modelled individually based on detailed location level information. With the continued elevated catastrophe activity, there is an opportunity to better align our technical pricing on more recent activity rather than longer-term average annual losses.\n\n## Underwriting appetite\n\nWe reduced our property exposure to hurricane risks in North America given its significance in terms of its exposure to physical climate risk and driving potential losses for our business, and we are leveraging our in-demand QBE Re catastrophe capacity to gain access to ancillary lines to better manage volatility. As part of our underwriting and investment process, QBE applies exclusions to activities that are outside of our risk appetite, depending on the specific conditions and circumstances of the risk being evaluated. For example, through our positions in the Environmental and Social Risk Framework we have committed to reduce our exposure to higher transition risks in the energy sector including no new coal and oil sands projects.\n\n## Reinsurance\n\nIn the short term, we manage the volatility of natural catastrophe claims by deploying a comprehensive Group catastrophe reinsurance program and considering a wide range of event frequency scenarios in our capital planning. In the reinsurance market, we continue to see a reduced appetite to provide coverage for a frequency of catastrophe events which is reflected in recent changes to our reinsurance structure. These dynamics are factored into our pricing strategy.\n\n## Catastrophe allowance\n\nTo reflect the elevated level of catastrophe activity experienced in recent years, we aim to establish our annual catastrophe allowance above the long-term average of our modelled catastrophe costs, helping to improve the reliability and consistency of our results. In 2023, despite a year of heightened catastrophe costs and extensive secondary peril activity for the industry, our catastrophe costs of $1,092 million were below the Group's allowance of $1,175 million. In 2024, our catastrophe allowance is $1,280 million.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Physical risks and opportunities\n\nClimate change is one of several drivers of the increasing costs of natural disasters globally. This can create volatility in QBE's profitability and is addressed through modelling and understanding the risk to grow a portfolio with diversity of location and risk, through our pricing and risk selection and through our reinsurance and capital management. The global insurance market pricing for natural disaster risk has been increasing for a range of reasons including concentration of properties in areas prone to risk, increasing building costs and increasing scarcity of labour and materials, especially where the same region is impacted over the short term. Increasingly, regulators of financial services industries are seeking to understand how climate risk can contribute to an insurance protection gap impacting a greater proportion of the population. As insurance often enables investment and credit flows, a growing protection gap can contribute to financial challenges through compounding factors such as a series of natural disasters, with sea level rise in the future.\n\nQBE is investing in models and talent to better manage our risk and sharing our knowledge and expertise to attract investment towards adaptation and emissions reduction for a more resilient future.\n\nTo better understand the potential impact of climate change on specific perils and regions, over the past few years, we have partnered with catastrophe modelling vendors Risk Management Solutions, Inc. and AIR Worldwide, and with Aon to analyse the scientific literature related to the potential impact of climate change on specific perils and regions. We have then enhanced our catastrophe models to better understand how extreme weather risk may evolve as the climate continues to change over the next 30+ years. The scope, scenarios and timeframes analysed are summarised on page 29.\n\nThese scenarios do not represent forecasts of the impact of climate change, and instead are indicative of the potential outcomes assuming the scenario occurs.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of our analysis, our catastrophe models were recalibrated to reflect the potential change indicated by scientific literature in order to determine the potential impact to net claims costs under each scenario. We have concentrated our analysis on the perils and regions relating to QBE's extreme weather exposure.\n\nQBE's property exposures most impacted by shorter-term physical risks of climate change are typically driven by exposure to North American hurricanes, and perils such as floods, bushfires and convective storms. The evaluation of the impact is supported by our accumulations management process, including regularly updated natural perils models, monitoring of property accumulations across the portfolio to simulate weather-related loss potential, budgeting, price setting, and the use of reinsurance to protect capital and reduce earnings volatility.\n\nOur analysis concludes that the impact of climate change will differ significantly across both regions and the type of catastrophes. From the perils and regions studied so far, flood claims in Europe and Australia potentially could be the most impacted; while cyclones and convective storms in North America and Australia may take a little longer (mid-century) before the impact of climate change becomes more significant.\n\nWe have experienced a series of low probability events, including Cyclone Gabrielle and the North Island flooding events in New Zealand, alongside a series of convective storms in North America. However, we remained within our planned catastrophe allowance for 2023 and continue to plan for elevated catastrophe activity.",

        "page_content": "## Transition risks and opportunities\n\nIn 2022, we refreshed our climate transition scenario analysis to align with six of the latest Network for Greening the Financial System scenarios, supported by an external consultant. The results show an estimated sectoral impact, measured based on percentage change in profit over 2025, 2030 and 2050. This was used to better understand which segments of our insurance and investment portfolios may be exposed to high growth or contraction sectors as a result of the transition to a net-zero economy.\n\n## Investments\n\nWe assessed QBE's core fixed income (excluding cash and cash equivalents), high yield debt and emerging market debt (collectively referred to as 'in-scope assets'), which represents 88% of Group Investments assets under management (AUM).\n\nThe sector impacts shown against the investment portfolio are based on the 'divergent net zero' scenario, which aligns with our commitment to net-zero, and assumes a disorderly transition which is more aligned with the current state of global markets and regulation around climate transition.\n\nIn relation to the in-scope assets, QBE continues to be resilient with respect to climate transition risks as our investment portfolio has limited exposure to highly impacted sectors. 83% of QBE's in-scope assets are exposed to the Finance and Insurance and Central Banks/Sovereign sectors, which are not expected to be significantly impacted by the climate transition.\n\nClimate change transition and emissions reductions are included in our broader sustainability considerations within our investment decision-making process.\n\nOur overall exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities is assessed through further analysis of our investments portfolio, including carbon footprinting and reviewing residual exposures to high-emitting sectors. Further details are outlined on pages 24 and 25.\n\n## Underwriting\n\nThe ability to classify the Group's underwriting data at a sectoral level remains a challenge and we continue to make investment in data, people and systems to allow us to better understand our underwriting exposure at a sectoral level.\n\nWe are developing our capability for baselining and measuring insurance-associated emissions based on industry methodologies, and approaches to address data gaps, as this will be a key input for developing our transition plan.\n\nTransition risks result from the relative uncertainty created by the global shift towards a more sustainable, net-zero economy. Transition risks are very broad in nature and can be difficult to quantify or model. For instance, regulatory, geopolitical, and social pressures can create material impacts on the operations of a business, its reputation, and the value of its assets.\n\nQBE covers risks across the globe and across many sectors. Our analysis continues to focus on where we have a heightened transition risk as well as how we can support the transition. This includes our evolving product offering, for example, the 2023 launch of the renewable energy offering in Australia. Transition risk analysis may also support us in reviewing our underwriting strategy and portfolio mix.\n\nFurther details are outlined on pages 26 and 27.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

Climate change is a component of ESG risk, which is classified as a strategic risk sub-class in our Risk Management Strategy.\n\nClimate risk management is overseen by the ESG Risk Committee, the Executive Risk Committee at a management level and the Board Risk & Capital Committee at a Board level.\n\n## Identifying and assessing climate risks\n\nWe have a range of tools and processes to assist with identifying and assessing climate risks.\n\n|                                                                                     | UNDERWRITING   | INVESTMENT   | SUPPLY CHAIN   | OPERATIONS   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|\n| Environmental and Social (E&S) Risk Framework  (application, referrals, monitoring) |                |              | -              | -            |\n| Climate scenario analysis                                                           |                |              | -              | -            |\n| Risk and Control Self-Assessments                                                   |                |              |                |              |\n| ESG risk horizon scan                                                               |                |              |                |              |\n\nEach year we undertake an ESG risk horizon scan to identify and assess risks and understand how we are mitigating our top ESG risks. Climate change continues to be our top ESG risk. Climate change has also been identified again this year as one of the top risks facing the organisation, as set out in the risk management section on pages 16 to 19.\n\nQBE's Group Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) Standard sets minimum requirements for identifying, documenting, and assessing key risks that QBE faces in delivering our strategic and business objectives. The RCSA process also requires an assessment of the effectiveness\n\nof the controls in place to manage those risks. This year we have documented the climate-related risks and controls which will be drawn upon in RCSAs going forward.\n\nScenario analysis is a key tool we use to better understand the future potential impacts of climate change from a physical and transition perspective. We have undertaken extensive climate scenario analysis and the results have been an input into a range of strategic and risk processes including catastrophe models, executive briefings, business planning, net-zero planning and portfolio optimisation.\n\n## Managing climate risks\n\nWe use a range of tools and processes to manage and monitor our climate risks, across our underwriting, investment, supply chain and our own operations. This year we have introduced an ESG risk dashboard to support management reporting with quantitative indicators, where data allows; and we will continue to evolve the dashboard as our data coverage and quality improves.\n\n|                                                                                     | UNDERWRITING   | INVESTMENT   | SUPPLY CHAIN   | OPERATIONS   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|\n| Risk appetite as per E&S Risk Framework                                             |                |              | -              | -            |\n| Management reporting                                                                |                |              |                |              |\n| Engagement on climate transition and net-zero                                       |                |              |                | -            |\n| Business continuity plans                                                           | -              | -            | -              |              |\n| Portfolio management including annual renewability,  pricing, underwriting appetite |                | -            | -              | -            |\n| Catastrophe allowance and reinsurance                                               |                | -            | -              | -            |\n| Greenwashing risk principles                                                        |                |              |                |              |",

Risk management is a continuous process and an integral part of QBE's governance structure, QBE's broader business processes and, most importantly, QBE's culture.\n\nSome of the material business risks that QBE faces include strategic, insurance, credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and Group risks. Explanations of these risks and their mitigations are set out in detail in note 4 to the financial statements which we recommend you read.

As Chair of the People & Remuneration Committee, I am especially proud to acknowledge the continued hard work and dedication of our people in enabling a sustainable and resilient workforce.\n\nWe have made substantial progress during 2023 and I think it is important to share a few examples of how this has come to life: the launch of our 'Why QBE' campaign focused on career and development opportunities and building deeper succession pathways at QBE; the ongoing Safety to Speak Up initiative encourages our people to participate, experiment, challenge, and to call out risks, issues or concerns; leadership capability programs across our three enterprise leadership groups supported the embedment of the QBE DNA through role modelling in day-to-day activities. This is particularly important as having the right culture in place is crucial to our future success. In addition, the launch of QShare, our new opt-in employee share purchase plan, brings our enterprise together and helps a wider range of our employees to think and act as shareholders. During the year, QBE received external recognition through an array of people and culture awards, see page 43.\n\n## Executive key management personnel\n\nDuring 2023, we had some changes at the executive leadership level. The two internal appointments to our executive key management personnel (KMP) highlights the bench-strength of high calibre leaders already within QBE and reflects the enhanced focus we have made on internal talent and leadership over the last few years. Peter Burton was appointed as Group Chief Underwriting Officer on 4 September 2023; and Julie Wood, as Chief Executive Officer (CEO), North America, on 18 September 2023.\n\nThe global market for attracting and retaining talent remains highly competitive, and we continue to invest to ensure QBE stands out as an employer of choice. Having conducted a detailed benchmark comparison of local and global companies with a similar footprint, industry and complexity, and recognising the cumulative impacts of inflation, an adjustment of up to 5% was applied to the fixed remuneration of the executive KMP during 2023. The long-term incentive (LTI) maximum opportunities were also aligned for the three Divisional CEOs and Group Chief Financial Officer to drive long-term performance.\n\n## Performance during 2023\n\nQBE recorded a Group adjusted cash return on equity (ROE) for incentive purposes of 16.0%, a strong result above target, buoyed by more resilient underwriting performance and a favourable investment result. The strong investment returns were underpinned by higher interest rates, while risk asset returns were also sound, despite weaker returns in the unlisted property portfolio.\n\nOur business has demonstrated continued resilience despite numerous catastrophes, with multiple storm, flood, wildfire and hurricane events across key regions during 2023, although underwriting profitability was challenged by the impact of largely catastrophe related prior year development. As a result, the Group combined operating ratio (COR) for incentive purposes was 95.2%, between threshold and target.\n\nWe've continued to make strong progress on each of our six strategic priorities and uplifted our risk maturity across the Group.\n\n- For more information on the strategic priorities' achievements and the financial performance in 2023, refer to pages 6 to 15.",

        "page_content": "The executive KMP business scorecard outcome is utilised as an input in determining executive KMP incentives. For the 2023 performance year, having considered the financial and non-financial measures, the executive KMP business scorecard was assessed as slightly below target, see page 47.\n\nThe Board's consideration of executive KMP performance against their 2023 objectives resulted in their incentive outcomes for the period ranging between 55.2% to 70.0% of their maximum opportunity, see pages 48 and 49. The Group CEO received 91.9% of the target opportunity (61.3% of the maximum opportunity), of which 50% is deferred as conditional rights and vests in equal tranches over the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the award.\n\n- For more information on 2023 executive KMP remuneration, refer to pages 48 and 49.\n\n## Non-executive directors\n\nAs part of our continuous Board renewal, the Board appointed Peter Wilson and Stephen Ferguson as new non-executive directors during 2023, with Penny James joining the Board in January 2024. Non-executive director fees were reviewed to ensure they remain competitive relative to international financial institution peers and commensurate with the directors' experiences, accountabilities and workloads. Following this review, an increase of 3% will apply from 1 January 2024, the first such increase since 2015.\n\n- For more information on 2023 non-executive director remuneration, refer to pages 62 to 64.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThe new Australian Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration (CPS 511) will apply across the remuneration programs in the new performance year; and includes the addition of non-financial measures in the LTI plan. As alluded to in last year's Remuneration Report, I am pleased to confirm that we have included a new measure for the LTI awards in 2024 which supports our sustainability strategy and commitments. This will be in place alongside a new customer-aligned measure, see page 45. Further details will be shared in the 2024 Remuneration Report.\n\nFor 2024, there will be continued focus on uplifting the capability of our employees and the implementation of multiple people and culture initiatives that will support how we build a resilient workforce for the future.\n\nThank you for your support in 2023. As always, we welcome shareholder feedback.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTan Le\n\nChair, People & Remuneration Committee\n\n## Recognition and awards\n\nGender Equality Index (GEI)\n\n2023 Bloomberg GEI\n\nTop 100 for Gender Equality\n\n2023 Equileap Global Report & Ranking\n\nMost Inclusive Workplace (Australia)\n\n2023 Australian HR Institute (AHRI)\n\nPlatinum Well Workplace Award (USA)\n\n2023 Wellness Council of America\n\nHR Asia Best Companies to Work for In Asia (Hong Kong)\n\n2023 Business Media International\n\nParental Policies Award (UK)\n\n2023 Working Dads Employer Awards\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

The way that each executive complies with the requirements of our Group Code of Ethics and Conduct (the Code) and manages their risk is a key consideration of the Board in determining their incentive outcomes. Executive KMP performance assessments include a formal assessment of risk and behaviours using input from the Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chair of the People & Remuneration Committee, the Chair of the Board Risk & Capital Committee and chairs of divisional boards where relevant.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to focus on measuring not only what was achieved but how it was achieved to further strengthen our culture.  The future inclusion of non-financial elements in our LTI plan, together with extended deferral for certain regulated roles, further promotes the effective management of financial and non-financial risks.",

A high level summary is provided below.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nQBE recognises the importance for people, communities and businesses to build resilience in order to address the challenges we face now, and into the future. The new LTI performance measures, aligned to our sustainability strategy, will help drive forward our sustainability commitments.\n\nFor the 2024 LTI award, the measures will track our performance against a range of targets aligned with our three sustainability focus areas. These provide significant opportunity to expand into further sustainability-focused initiatives in future years.\n\n## Customer\n\nThe inclusion of customer measures in the 2024 LTI encourages our senior leaders to continue to improve how we service our customers. Delivering an enhanced customer experience through modernising key business processes during the performance period will make it easier for customers to do business with us.\n\nBetter customer experiences will be evidenced through improved external ratings from broker relationships and efficient and consistent improvements in business processes through modernisation.\n\nThere are both quantitative and qualitative metrics aligned to the new non-financial measures. Following the three-year performance period, a pre-vest assessment by the Board will determine appropriate vesting outcomes. Where the LTI measures are deemed to be commercially sensitive, they will be disclosed at the end of the performance period (unless sensitivity remains).\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n6",

From a divisional performance perspective, North America made progress in rebalancing its portfolio, noting underwriting profitability was challenged by short-tail reserve strengthening. Non-core lines, made up of recently terminated or legacy business, weighed heavily on underwriting performance accounting for a significant amount of divisional catastrophe costs and reserve strengthening. The International result included strong premium growth and excellent underwriting profitability. Australia Pacific achieved strong premium growth, and delivered resilient underwriting returns in light of ongoing catastrophe activity and persistent inflation. For detailed commentary of Group and divisional financial performance, please refer to pages 8 to 15.\n\nTHRESHOLD\n\n30%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group cash ROE\n\nOUTCOME:\n\nQBE recorded a Group adjusted cash ROE for incentive purposes of 16.0%, which was above target buoyed by a resilient underwriting performance and a strong investment result. Favourable investment performance was supported by higher interest rates. While risk asset returns were sound overall, there were weaker returns in the unlisted property portfolio. Our business has demonstrated continued resilience despite a dynamic operating environment, which included heightened catastrophe activity and increased inflation impacting all regions.\n\n## Non-financial\n\n## Risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe annual Risk Maturity Self-Assessment completed for 2023 received an outcome of 'embedded' and reflects improvements across all elements of our Enterprise Risk Management Framework. Risk Skills and Culture was the highest scoring element driven by improvements in psychological safety and speaking up and tone from the top, both essential to influencing effective risk management across the Group. Uplift was also seen in risk-based decision making and how risk is governed, evidencing a greater ownership of risk within the business.\n\n## People and culture\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPositive progress against the people and culture initiatives was achieved in 2023 with the launch of our Employee Promise 'Why QBE' campaign which reinforced career development opportunities and succession pathways through our three enterprise talent groups. Further improvements were made on employee engagement levels and we achieved our Women in Leadership targets, supported by strengthened inclusion of diversity (IoD) activity across the enterprise. This included introducing global inclusive recruitment principles and IoD Policy enhancements. Innovative new global targets focused on equal sense of belonging across the dimensions of gender, race/ethnicity, disability status and LGBTIQ+ identification were also introduced, along with the launch of our new employee share purchase plan, QShare.\n\n## Strategic priorities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe delivery of our strategic priorities progressed well in 2023. There was a notable reduction in volatility achieved through portfolio optimisation initiatives, including portfolio exits and the reserve transaction. We progressed cyber and delivered sustainable growth across a number of areas, including reinsurance, global specialty and QBE's UK business. Bring the enterprise together was a key enabler supporting initiatives to improve performance. Our efforts to modernise our business focused on progressing our enterprise data strategy and our approach to piloting and scaling AI.\n\nAPI business scorecard weighted outcome: Slightly below target\n\nWEIGHTING: 30%\n\nSUPERIOR\n\n150%\n\nWEIGHTING: 70%\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

This ensures that the remuneration arrangements are appropriately designed and managed and that the agreed frameworks and policies are applied and monitored across QBE.\n\n## Board\n\nHas overall responsibility for the remuneration strategy and outcomes for executives and non-executive directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## People & Remuneration Committee\n\nIs the main governing body for key people and remuneration items across the Group.\n\n- Further details on the role and scope of the People & Remuneration Committee are set out in the QBE People & Remuneration Committee charter, available from www.qbe.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/ qbe-charters-and-constitution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup CEO\n\nDivisional People & Remuneration Committees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Managing risk\n\nThe continued focus on and investment in managing our risk provides for a stronger and more resilient QBE. Executive KMP are required to adhere to a range of Group-wide policies to ensure risks are well managed, strong governance structures are in place and high ethical standards are maintained. The remuneration governance framework incorporates risk oversight principles so that executives cannot unduly influence a decision that could materially impact their own incentive outcome. The Board approves a comprehensive delegated authority for the Group CEO, which is an integral part of QBE's risk management process.\n\nThe People & Remuneration Committee works closely with the Board Risk & Capital Committee, with members of both committees attending a joint meeting at least once a year. Further, members of the Board attend the meetings of the People & Remuneration Committee during the year which contributes to strengthened remuneration governance across QBE. The Group CRO attends and provides input to the joint committee meetings with resultant risk outcomes appropriately reflected in remuneration decisions and aligned with the Group's risk management framework.\n\nThe performance-based components of remuneration established in QBE's incentive plans are designed to encourage behaviour that supports the Group's long-term financial soundness. Specifically, the QBE incentive plans:\n\n- \u00b7 deliver a target remuneration mix balanced between fixed/variable remuneration, short- and long-term and cash and equity;\n- \u00b7 incorporate individual performance objectives through the API that measure demonstrable proactive sound risk management, including an assessment of risk maturity and the setting of a clear and consistent tone about the importance of managing risk;\n- \u00b7 incorporate robust corporate standards for all employees supporting the QBE risk culture;\n- \u00b7 balance performance outcomes based on delivery against a range of financial and non-financial measures which are set in the context of business plans that have been appropriately stress-tested by the Group CRO;\n- \u00b7 enable the build-up of meaningful shareholding with API deferred equity and LTI underpinned by the MSR (refer to page 52);\n- \u00b7 provide the Board with discretion to take other factors into account when determining the appropriate incentive outcome; and\n- \u00b7 allow for multiple risk adjustments: in-year, malus for unvested awards and clawback of cash and vested equity (refer to page 51).\n\nAs part of the 2023 year-end process, an assessment of each senior executive's approach to risk management has been completed using input from the Group CRO. This process recognises positive and negative risk culture and risk management through upward or downward adjustment of performance ratings, incentive payouts and consequences (that can include executives leaving the organisation). Across the Group in 2023, over 100 assessments were carried out including for executive KMP and divisional executive teams. Reviews against the malus and clawback provisions were also completed as part of the year-end process. While there was no application of malus or clawback in 2023, there were upward and downward performance ratings and/or incentive adjustments applied across the workforce.",

Through following the Code and our QBE DNA behaviours, we demonstrate the expected standards of professionalism and ethical behaviour in our actions and interactions.\n\n- A copy of QBE's Group Code of Ethics and Conduct is available from www.qbe.com/investor-relations/corporategovernance/global-policies.\n\n## Consequence management\n\nThe QBE Consequence Management Policy was implemented in 2023. The policy introduces principles and guidance to ensure consequences for misconduct or poor risk outcomes are fair, consistent and aligned with local legislative, regulatory and Code requirements.\n\nMalus and clawback provisions reflect QBE's regulatory obligations to incorporate terms allowing for the adjustment of incentive awards to protect QBE's financial soundness and ability to respond to unforeseen significant issues.\n\n## Malus provision\n\nThe malus provision gives the People & Remuneration Committee and the Board discretion to reduce the amount of an unvested award (including to zero) in certain circumstances during the retention period, including in the case of:\n\n- \u00b7 misconduct leading to significant adverse outcomes;\n- \u00b7 a significant failure of financial or non-financial risk management;\n- \u00b7 a significant failure or breach of accountability, fitness and propriety, or compliance obligations;\n- \u00b7 a significant error or a significant misstatement of criteria on which the variable remuneration determination was based; and/or\n- \u00b7 significant adverse outcomes for customers, beneficiaries or counterparties.\n\n## Clawback provision\n\nThe clawback provision allows, to the extent permissible by applicable law, all variable remuneration (cash and deferred remuneration) to remain subject to clawback for a period of two years from the date of payment or vesting (as the case may be) of the relevant component of variable remuneration.\n\nThe Board can determine whether to apply clawback to paid or vested variable remuneration and, if so, the appropriate value over which clawback will be applied.\n\nThe circumstances in which the Board may apply clawback include those where it concludes in good faith that there is or has been:\n\n- \u00b7 misconduct leading to material adverse outcomes;\n- \u00b7 a material failure of financial or non-financial risk management;\n- \u00b7 a material failure or breach of accountability, fitness and propriety, or compliance obligations;\n- \u00b7 a material error or a material misstatement of criteria on which the variable remuneration determination was based; and/or\n- \u00b7 material adverse outcomes for customers, beneficiaries or counterparties.\n\nClawback may be applied to any variable remuneration regardless of whether or not the employment or engagement of the relevant person is ongoing.\n\n## Adjustments to incentive plans\n\nThe API and LTI rules provide suitable discretion for the People & Remuneration Committee to adjust any formulaic outcomes to ensure awards under these plans appropriately reflect performance.\n\nThe People & Remuneration Committee may defer the vesting of any award after the end of any performance period to one or more participants in circumstances where there is a dispute of any nature between a participant and QBE, or in cases where a participant's actions or inactions may be relevant to an ongoing internal or external investigation.\n\nFurther, the People & Remuneration Committee may reduce any unvested award to zero, if considered appropriate, in the instances of misconduct, misstatement or to protect the financial soundness of QBE.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report continued\n\n## 1. REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE\n\n## Securities Trading Policy\n\nTrading in QBE ordinary shares is generally permitted outside of designated closed periods. QBE's Securities Trading Policy states that non-executive directors and other designated employees must notify any intended share transaction to nominated people within the Group. The policy prohibits the hedging of QBE securities at all times. The purpose of this prohibition is to ensure that there is an alignment between the interests of non-executive directors, executives and shareholders.\n\n- A copy of QBE's Securities Trading Policy for dealing in securities is available from www.qbe.com/investor-relations/ corporate-governance/global-policies.\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirement\n\nThe MSR ensures executives build their shareholding to have significant exposure to QBE's share price. Under the MSR, a minimum of three times fixed remuneration for the Group CEO (one-and-a-half times for other executive KMP) is to be maintained as long as the executive KMP remains at QBE. New executive KMP are required to build their shareholdings over a five-year period after becoming executive KMP.\n\nThe value of shareholdings as a multiple of fixed remuneration as at 31 December 2023 for each executive KMP is shown on pages 48 and 49. All executive KMP have either met the MSR requirements as at 31 December 2023, or are within the five-year period to achieve the MSR.\n\n## Use of external advisers\n\nRemuneration advisers provide guidance on remuneration for executives, facilitate discussion, and review remuneration and at-risk reward benchmarking within industry peer groups. They also provide guidance on current trends in executive remuneration practices. Any advice provided by remuneration advisers is used as a guide and is not a substitute for consideration of all the issues by each non-executive director on the People & Remuneration Committee.\n\nErnst & Young (EY) currently acts as the independent remuneration adviser to the People & Remuneration Committee. The People & Remuneration Committee and the Board are satisfied that the advice provided by EY during 2023 was free from undue influence.\n\nDuring 2023, management requested and utilised reports on market practice from various reputable sources. No recommendations in relation to the remuneration of KMP were provided as part of these engagements.\n\n## Treatment of conditional rights on a change in control of QBE\n\nIn accordance with the rules of each of QBE's incentive plans, a change in control is defined as either a scheme of arrangement that has been approved by QBE's shareholders and become effective or a bidder has at least 50% of the issued and to be issued QBE shares under an unconditional takeover offer made in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\nShould a change in organisational control occur, the People & Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine how unvested conditional rights should be treated, having regard to factors such as the length of time elapsed in the performance period, the level of performance to date and the circumstances of the change of control.",

EXECUTIVE KMP REMUNERATION IN DETAIL\n\nTo deliver our strategic ambitions, we must ensure that our executive remuneration framework reflects QBE's desire to attract and retain the best people. Having the right talent across the Group enables us to create shareholder value, while prudently managing risk and maintaining strong corporate governance.\n\nThe graph below sets out the typical remuneration structure and delivery for the Group CEO and other executive KMP for on-target performance at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Group CEO and other executive KMP pay mix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe average pay mix for other executive KMP is fixed remuneration 29%; API cash 19%; API deferred equity 13%; and LTI maximum face-value 39%. Their individual pay mix reflects the relative accountabilities, responsibilities and regulatory requirements of their role.\n\n## Executive KMP remuneration structure\n\nQBE's executive KMP remuneration structure for 2023 comprised a mix of fixed and at-risk remuneration through API and LTI plan arrangements. Each of these components is discussed in further detail on the following pages.\n\n## FIXED REMUNERATION - KEY DETAILS\n\n## Description\n\nFixed remuneration comprises cash salary, superannuation/pension and packaged benefits, additional annual benefits and associated taxes. Additional annual benefits may include health insurance, life assurance, personal accident insurance, expatriate benefits, occasional partner travel to accompany the executive on business and applicable taxes.\n\nFixed remuneration is delivered in accordance with terms and conditions of employment.\n\n## Determining fixed remuneration levels\n\nFixed remuneration considers the diversity, complexity and expertise required of individual roles. Remuneration quantum is set in the context of QBE's broader reward strategy and internal relativities.\n\nTo assess the competitiveness of fixed remuneration, the People & Remuneration Committee considers market data and recognised published surveys.\n\nAustralian-based executive roles are generally benchmarked to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) 30 and ASX 10-50 peer groups of companies, with a specific focus on global companies and companies in the financial services industry. Overseasbased executives or roles that have a global reach are compared with a peer group consisting of global insurers. The peer group of companies used for remuneration benchmarking purposes is set out in the table below:\n\n| PEER GROUP                                                                                                                                       | DESCRIPTION                  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| The financial services sub-peer group is determined based on the industry classification on the  ASX and includes commercial banks and insurers. | ASX peer group               |\n| Consists of large, global insurance companies aligned with the peer group used for the LTI plan.                                                 | Global insurance  peer group |\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

EXECUTIVE KMP REMUNERATION IN DETAIL\n\n## ANNUAL PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN - KEY DETAILS\n\n## Description\n\nThe API is an annual, performance-based incentive, measured over a 12-month period. This plan provides an incentive outcome with a clear link between business performance, risk management and individual performance and behaviours, and allows further discretion by the Board to be applied where warranted. The API award is delivered as 60% cash and 40% deferred as conditional rights to QBE shares (50%:50% in the case of the Group CEO). The conditional rights vest in equal tranches over a further four years, on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the award. Vesting is subject to service conditions during the deferral period.\n\nAPI outcomes may be adjusted by other items (such as material acquisitions or divestments) not included in the business plan and as deemed appropriate by the People & Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Performance measures and rationale\n\nThe performance measures and a summary of achievements and position against targets is set out in the executive KMP business scorecard on page 47. Performance above threshold leads to outcomes ranging from 30% up to 150% of target. The measures and their rationale for use is provided below:\n\n## Financial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| MEASURE/ WEIGHTING %        | DEFINITION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | RATIONALE                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| COR 45 .5                   | Comprises net claims expense, net commission and expenses and  other income as a percentage of net insurance revenue.

EXECUTIVE KMP REMUNERATION IN DETAIL\n\n## Treatment of incentives on termination\n\n## Voluntary termination\n\nAll unvested incentives are forfeited.\n\n## Involuntary termination\n\n## On termination with cause or for poor performance:\n\nAll unvested incentives are forfeited.\n\n## On termination without cause:\n\nFor API, the executive remains eligible to be considered for an award on a pro-rata basis, with any award to be determined following the end of the performance year and subject to the standard deferral arrangements.\n\n'Good leaver' provisions (for example, retirement, redundancy, ill health, injury, or mutually agreed separation (in some cases)) will apply such that unvested deferred Executive Incentive Plan (EIP), STI and API conditional rights remain in the plan subject to the original vesting dates and malus, with clawback provisions included from 2021.\n\nIn cases of good leavers as described above, unvested LTI conditional rights may be reduced to a pro-rata amount to reflect the proportion of the performance period in service and may continue to be held subject to the same performance and vesting conditions.\n\nLegacy equity awards generally remain in the plan subject to the original performance and vesting conditions, however, the People & Remuneration Committee has discretion to vest these awards in accordance with the original terms and plan rules.\n\n## Other equity schemes\n\nThe information below summarises QBE's other equity plans mentioned in the Remuneration Report.\n\n## QShare\n\nOur employee share purchase and matching plan, QShare, was launched in 2023 to bring our enterprise together, encourage retention and build share ownership. This plan is globally consistent and allows employees to purchase QBE shares up to an agreed threshold using after-tax salary. The QBE shares are matched with conditional rights which may vest in the future, subject to ongoing service and retention of the underlying purchased QBE shares.\n\n## 2021 LTI award\n\n## LTI levelling mechanism\n\nThe LTI levelling mechanism, introduced in 2019 and removed after 2021, effectively put a ceiling and a floor on aggregate catastrophe claims in determining LTI outcomes, because extreme or benign catastrophe periods can have a material effect across multiple LTI awards with the performance periods measured over three consecutive years. The cap and collar uses a range of +/- 1.5% of net earned premium on the budgeted catastrophe allowance for which LTI participants are exposed to catastrophe risk. In 2021, the Group adjusted cash ROE was 11%. There was no need to adjust the Group cash ROE for catastrophe claims in 2022 or 2023.\n\n## Group cash ROE award targets\n\nThe 2021 LTI approach for Group cash ROE, set out in more detail in the 2021 Remuneration Report, addressed the difficulty of long-range forecasting due to significant anticipated economic volatility through setting target ranges for each of the three performance years at the start of each relevant year and providing disclosure in the following year. The threshold and maximum ranges for each relevant year over the performance period are used to create the target range for the three-year performance period:\n\n| QBE'S AVERAGE GROUP CASH ROE PERFORMANCE                                           | THRESHOLD   | MAXIMUM   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|\n| 2021                                                                               | 6.3%        | 10.3%     |\n| 2022                                                                               | 7.9%        | 11.9%     |\n| 2023                                                                               | 12.0%       | 19.0%     |\n| Average Group cash ROE over 2021, 2022 and 2023                                    | 8.7%        | 13.7%     |\n| % of LTI conditional rights subject to the Group cash ROE component which may vest | 30%         | 100%      |\n\nStraight-line vesting commences at 30% from the lower range up to 100% at the upper range.

Performance was measured over a 12-month period. The conditional rights were deferred over four equal tranches: 25% vested over each of the four anniversaries of the award.\n\nEIP outcomes were subject to the achievement of multiple performance measures comprising Group's cash ROE and COR targets, individual performance ratings and, for divisional staff, divisional COR targets.\n\nThe EIP was replaced by the STI and LTI plans for executive KMP from 2019. The EIP awards made to Peter Burton and Sam Harrison prior to their appointments as executive KMP include cash-settled share-based payment awards which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the equivalent conditional rights described above. The benefit received at vesting is indexed to the movement in the A$ value of QBE's shares, including dividends declared, in the period between grant and vest dates.\n\n## Short Term Incentive - until 31 December 2021 (legacy plan)\n\nThe STI was a performance-based incentive delivered in the form of an annual cash payment and deferred award in the form of conditional rights to fully paid ordinary QBE shares. Performance was measured over a 12-month period. The conditional rights were deferred in two equal tranches: 50% vested on the first and second anniversaries of the award.\n\nSTI outcomes were subject to the achievement of a blend of divisional CORs for 2021, Group cash ROE targets, divisional COR targets in the case of divisional employees, and individual performance objectives reflecting QBE's strategic priorities. The STI was replaced by the API from 2022.\n\n## Employment agreements\n\nThe table below summarises the material terms for the current executive KMP which are subject to applicable laws.

See note 8.6 to the financial statements on page 139 for more detail.\n- 4 Includes conditional rights and legacy cash-settled awards. The fair value of conditional rights at grant date is determined using appropriate models including Monte Carlo simulations and the Black-Scholes model, depending on the vesting conditions. The fair value of each conditional right is recognised evenly over the service period ending at vesting date. Where an award will no longer vest, the related accounting charge for any non-market component is reversed in full and the reversal is included in the table above. This may include conditional rights granted as compensation for incentives forfeited on ceasing previous employment to join QBE. Details of conditional rights are provided on pages 59 to 61.\n\n- 5 For Peter Burton and Sam Harrison, the share-based payments expense includes amounts, including reversals, related to legacy cash-settled share-based awards for grants made prior to their appointments as executive KMP under the 2019 to 2021 EIP totalling $36,000 and ($220,000) respectively. A description of the EIP is provided on page 57.\n- 6 Peter Burton and Julie Wood were executive KMP for part of the year. Their commencement dates are shown on pages 48 and 49.\n- 7 Sam Harrison, former Group Chief Underwriting Officer, was executive KMP to 28 April 2023.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report continued\n\n## 4. NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION\n\nThe following section contains information on the approach to non-executive director remuneration, their fees, other benefits and shareholdings.\n\n## Remuneration philosophy\n\nNon-executive director remuneration reflects QBE's desire to attract, motivate and retain experienced independent directors and to ensure their active participation in the Group's affairs for the purpose of corporate governance, regulatory compliance and other matters.\n\nQBE aims to provide a level of remuneration for non-executive directors comparable with that of its peers, which include international financial institutions. The Board reviews surveys published by independent remuneration consultants and other public information to ensure that fee levels are appropriate. The remuneration arrangements of non-executive directors are distinct and separate from those of the executive KMP.\n\n## Fee structure and components\n\nThe aggregate amount approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2022 was A$4,750,000 per annum. The total amount paid to non-executive directors in 2023 was A$3,133,676 (2022 A$3,387,953).\n\nUnder the current fee framework, non-executive directors receive a base fee expressed in Australian dollars. In addition, a non-executive director (other than the Chair) may receive further fees for chairing or membership of a Board Committee.\n\nDuring 2023, we reviewed the structure and level of non-executive director fees to ensure they remain competitive in the international market in which we operate and are commensurate with their workload. As a result, Board fees have been adjusted upwards by 3% with effect from 1 January 2024, the first Board fee adjustment since 2015. Committee fees were not adjusted.\n\nThe non-executive director fee structure for 2024 (with comparisons reflected for 2023) is shown in the table below:\n\n| BOARD/COMMITTEE   | ROLE         | 2024 A$   | 2023 A$   |\n|-------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Board             | Chair        | 683,000   | 663,000   |\n|                   | Deputy chair | 236,000   | 229,000   |\n|                   | Member       | 215,000   | 208,000   |\n| Committee         | Chair        | 50,000    | 50,000    |\n|                   | Member       | 27,000    | 27,000    |\n\n## Other benefits\n\nNon-executive directors do not receive any performance-based remuneration such as cash incentives or equity awards. Under QBE's Constitution, non-executive directors are entitled to be reimbursed for all travel and related expenses properly incurred in connection with the business of QBE. All non-executive directors are eligible to receive an annual cash travel allowance of A$42,750 (A$64,000 for the Chair), in addition to fees for the time involved in travelling to Board meetings and other Board commitments. This policy has remained unchanged since 2015, with the exception of the travel allowance being paused during COVID-19.\n\n## Superannuation\n\nQBE pays superannuation to Australian-based non-executive directors in accordance with Australian superannuation guarantee (SG) legislation. Overseas-based non-executive directors receive the cash equivalent amount in addition to their fees. From 1 July 2023, the SG contribution increased by 0.5% to 11%. This change is reflected in table 4.1.\n\nSince 1 January 2020, Australian-based directors may elect to opt out of superannuation contributions as long as they are still receiving contributions from at least one employer. In such cases, a superannuation allowance is paid in lieu of actual contributions.",

Superannuation is calculated as 10.5% of fees, up to 30 June 2023 and increased by 0.5% to 11.0% through to 31 December 2023. Superannuation in excess of the statutory minimum may be taken as additional cash fees or in the form of superannuation contributions at the option of the director. For all or part of 2023, Yasmin Allen and Jann Skinner elected to opt out of superannuation contributions and a superannuation allowance was paid in lieu of superannuation contributions.\n- 3 Stephen Ferguson commenced in role on 1 November 2023 and Peter Wilson commenced in role on 1 September 2023.\n- 4 Eric Smith retired on 10 March 2023.\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirement\n\nWith effect from 1 April 2014, a non-executive director MSR was introduced for the Board. Under this requirement, non-executive directors have five years to build a minimum shareholding equal to 100% of annual base fees.\n\nTo assist current and new non-executive directors in meeting the requirement, the DSAP was established with effect from 1 June 2014. The DSAP allows non-executive directors to sacrifice a portion of their director pre-tax base fees to acquire QBE shares. Shares acquired in this way are not subject to performance targets, as they are acquired in place of cash payments. Non-executive directors' shareholdings are shown overleaf.\n\nAll non-executive directors have met the MSR as at 31 December 2023, or are within the five-year period to achieve the MSR.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

OVERVIEW\n\n## 1.1 About QBE\n\n## About QBE Insurance Group\n\nQBE is one of the world's largest insurance and reinsurance companies, with operations in all the major insurance markets. Formed in Australia in 1886, QBE employs more than 13,000 people and carries on insurance activities in 27 countries, with operations in Australia, Europe, North America, Asia and the Pacific. QBE's captive reinsurers, Equator Re and Blue Ocean Re (collectively referred to as 'Equator Re'), provide reinsurance protection to our divisions in conjunction with the Group's external reinsurance programs.\n\nThe Company is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and is a for-profit entity.\n\n## About insurance\n\nIn simple terms, insurance and reinsurance companies help their customers (consumers, businesses and other insurance companies) to manage risk. More broadly put, an insurance company creates value by pooling and redistributing risk. This is done by collecting premium from those that it insures (i.e. policyholders), and then paying the claims of those that call upon their insurance protection. A company may also choose to reduce some of its own accumulated risk through the use of outward reinsurance (or referred to as reinsurance contracts held), which is insurance for insurance companies. As not all policyholders will actually experience a claim event, the effective pooling and redistribution of risk lowers the total cost of risk management, thereby making insurance protection more cost effective for all.\n\nThe operating model of insurance companies relies on profits being generated by:\n\n- \u00b7 appropriately pricing risk and charging adequate premium to cover the expected payouts that will be incurred over the life of the insurance policy (both claims and operating expenses); and\n- \u00b7 earning a return on the collected premium and funds withheld to pay future claims through the adoption of an appropriate investment strategy.\n\nInsurance therefore serves a critical function of providing customers with the confidence to achieve their business and personal goals through cost-effective risk management. This is achieved within a highly regulated environment, designed to ensure that insurance companies maintain adequate capital to protect the interests of policyholders.\n\nThe diagram below presents a simplified overview of the key components of this Financial Report:\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 1.2 About this report\n\nThis Financial Report includes the consolidated financial statements of QBE Insurance Group Limited (the ultimate parent entity or the Company) and its controlled entities (QBE or the Group).\n\nThe Financial Report includes the four primary statements, namely the statement of comprehensive income (which comprises profit or loss and other comprehensive income or loss), balance sheet, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows as well as associated notes as required by Australian Accounting Standards. Disclosures have been grouped into the following categories in order to assist users in their understanding of the financial statements:\n\n- 1. Overview contains information that impacts the Financial Report as a whole as well as segment reporting disclosures.\n- 2. Underwriting activities brings together results and balance sheet disclosures relevant to the Group's insurance activities.\n- 3. Investment activities includes results and balance sheet disclosures relevant to the Group's investments.\n- 4. Risk management provides commentary on the Group's exposure to various financial and capital risks, explaining the potential impact on the results and balance sheet and how the Group manages these risks.\n- 5. Capital structure provides information about the debt and equity components of the Group's capital.\n- 6. Tax includes disclosures relating to the Group's tax expense and balances.\n- 7. Group structure provides a summary of the Group's controlled entities and includes disclosures in relation to transactions impacting the Group structure.\n- 8. Other includes additional disclosures required to comply with Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nWhere applicable within each note, disclosures are further analysed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Overview provides some context to assist users in understanding the disclosures.\n- \u00b7 Disclosures (both numbers and commentary) provide analysis of balances as required by Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 How we account for the numbers summarises the accounting policies relevant to an understanding of the numbers.\n- \u00b7 Critical accounting judgements and estimates explains the key estimates and judgements applied by QBE in determining the numbers.\n\nThe notes include information which the directors believe is required to understand the financial statements and is material and relevant to the operations, balance sheet and results of the Group. Information is considered material and relevant if:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount in question is significant because of its size or nature;\n- \u00b7 it is important to assist in understanding the results of the Group;\n- \u00b7 it helps to explain the impact of significant changes in the Group's business - for example, significant acquisitions or disposals; or\n- \u00b7 it relates to an aspect of the Group's operations that is important to its future performance.\n\n## 1.2.1 Basis of preparation\n\nThis Financial Report is a general purpose financial report which:\n\n- \u00b7 has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 ;\n- \u00b7 complies with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Interpretations as issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC);\n- \u00b7 has been prepared on a historical cost basis as modified by certain exceptions, the most significant of which are the measurement of investments and derivatives at fair value and the measurement of the net insurance contract liabilities at present value;\n- \u00b7 is presented in US dollars; and\n- \u00b7 is presented with values rounded to the nearest million dollars or, in certain cases, to the nearest thousand dollars in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 .\n\nNew and amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that are now effective are detailed in note 8.1.1.\n\nThe Group has adopted AASB 2020-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and AASB 2022-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Non-current Liabilities with Covenants as listed in note 8.1.1. Other than these, the Group has not adopted any other Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have been issued or amended but are not yet effective as listed in note 8.1.2.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all entities controlled by the Company as at 31 December 2023 and the results for the financial year then ended. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all transactions between controlled entities are eliminated in full. Where control of an entity commences or ceases during a financial year, the results are included for that part of the year during which control existed. A list of entities controlled by the Company at the balance date is contained in note 7.3.\n\nLloyd's syndicates are accounted for on a proportional basis. The nature of Lloyd's syndicates is such that, even when one party provides the majority of capital, the syndicate as a whole is not controlled for accounting purposes.\n\nWhere necessary, comparative information has been restated to conform to the current year's disclosures.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 1. OVERVIEW\n\n## 1.2.2 Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect reported amounts.\n\nIn view of the geographic and product diversity of its international operations, the Group has developed a centralised risk management and policy framework designed to ensure consistency of approach across a number of operational activities, subject to the specific requirements of local markets, legislation and regulation. Such operational activities include underwriting, claims management, actuarial assessment of the outstanding claims within insurance liabilities and investment management.\n\nGiven the centralised approach, sensitivity analyses in respect of critical accounting estimates and judgements are presented at the consolidated Group level in order to provide information and analysis which is meaningful, relevant, reliable and comparable year-on-year. Sensitivity disclosure at business segment or product level would not provide a meaningful overview given the complex interrelationships between the variables underpinning the Group's operations.\n\nThe key areas in which critical estimates and judgements are applied are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 measurement of insurance and reinsurance contract assets and liabilities (note 2.2);\n- \u00b7 recoverability of deferred tax assets (note 6.2.1); and\n- \u00b7 impairment testing of intangible assets (note 7.2.1).\n\nThe Group has also considered the impact of climate change on the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements, particularly in the context of the risks and opportunities identified in our climate change disclosures on pages 20 to 33 of this Annual Report. Details of how these considerations have been reflected in the critical accounting judgements and estimates are discussed in the relevant notes where appropriate.\n\n## 1.2.3 Australian pricing promise review\n\nIn 2022, the Group recognised a provision on the balance sheet and a $75 million net cost (before tax) in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income following a review of pricing promises across a number of policy administration systems and products which identified instances where policy pricing promises were not fully delivered. The net cost comprises amounts for customer remediation, interest payable and other costs associated with administering the program.\n\nIn estimating the amounts recognised, assumptions were made based on the findings of the review, including in relation to the number of affected customers, and the premiums and interest refundable. As at 31 December 2023, QBE has reviewed the assumptions underlying the estimates based on latest information, and payments made, resulting in no material change to the costs recognised in profit or loss since the prior year.",

        "page_content": "## 1.2.4 Foreign currency\n\n## Translation of foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nTransactions included in the financial statements of controlled entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currencies at the spot rates of exchange applicable at the dates of the transactions. At the balance date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in profit or loss.\n\n## Translation of foreign operations\n\nThe results and balance sheets of all foreign operations that have a functional currency different from the Group's presentation currency of US dollars are translated into US dollars as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 income, expenses and other current period movements in comprehensive income are translated at average rates of exchange; and\n- \u00b7 balance sheet items are translated at the closing balance date rates of exchange.\n\nOn consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of net investments in foreign operations are taken to shareholders' equity and recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold in whole or part and capital is repatriated, exchange differences on translation from the entity's functional currency to the ultimate parent entity's functional currency of Australian dollars are reclassified out of other comprehensive income and recognised in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on sale.\n\n## Hedging of foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group manages its foreign exchange exposures as part of its foreign currency risk management processes, further information on which is provided in note 4.4.\n\nQBE uses borrowings to mitigate currency risk on translation of net investments in foreign operations to the ultimate parent entity's functional currency of Australian dollars. QBE may elect to use derivatives to manage currency translation risk in order to preserve capital.\n\nQBE also uses derivatives to mitigate risk associated with foreign currency transactions and balances.\n\nThe Group designates hedge relationships which meet the specified criteria in AASB 9 Financial Instruments as either cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Further information on the accounting for derivatives and for designated hedge relationships is provided in note 5.6.\n\n## Exchange rates\n\nThe principal exchange rates used in the preparation of the financial statements were:\n\n|        | 2023           | 2023          | 2022           | 2022          |\n|--------|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|\n|        | PROFIT OR LOSS | BALANCE SHEET | PROFIT OR LOSS | BALANCE SHEET |\n| A$/US$ | 0.664          | 0.682         | 0.693          | 0.678         |\n| \u00a3/US$  | 1.243          | 1.275         | 1.232          | 1.203         |\n| \u20ac/US$  | 1.081          | 1.105         | 1.051          | 1.067         |\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

The operating segments are consistent with the basis on which information is provided to the Group Executive Committee for measuring performance and determining the allocation of capital, being the basis upon which the Group's underwriting products and services are managed within the various markets in which QBE operates.\n\n## Operating segments\n\nThe Group's operating segments are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 North America writes general insurance, reinsurance and Crop business in the United States.\n- \u00b7 International writes general insurance business in the United Kingdom, Europe and Canada. It also writes general insurance and reinsurance business through Lloyd's; worldwide reinsurance business through offices in the United Kingdom, the United States, Ireland, Bermuda, Dubai and mainland Europe; and provides personal and commercial insurance covers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.\n- \u00b7 Australia Pacific primarily underwrites general insurance risks throughout Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific region, providing all major lines of insurance for personal and commercial risks.\n\nCorporate & Other includes non-operating holding companies that do not form part of the Group's insurance operations; gains or losses on disposals; and financing costs and amortisation of any intangibles which are not allocated to a specific operating segment. Intersegment transactions are priced on an arm's length basis and are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n| 2023                                                                                       | NORTH AMERICA  US$M   | INTERNATIONAL  US$M   | AUSTRALIA  PACIFIC  US$M   | TOTAL  REPORTABLE  SEGMENTS  US$M   | CORPORATE  & OTHER  US$M   | TOTAL  US$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| Insurance revenue -

The contractual service margin, which represents the unearned profit, is earned to insurance revenue based on a pattern of coverage units which reflects the provision of insurance services over the expected coverage period. The determination of the coverage units pattern is based on the quantity of benefits provided under the contracts in each period and includes consideration of amounts that can be validly claimed by policyholders if an insured event occurs, as well as expected lapses. The movement in the contractual service margin during the period is disclosed in note 2.2.3.\n- \u00b7 the recovery of insurance acquisition cash flows, which is determined by allocating a portion of the premium that relates to recovering those cash flows on a straight line basis over the coverage period of the contracts.",

Portfolios of insurance and reinsurance contracts issued that are assets are presented separately from those that are liabilities on the balance sheet. Similarly, portfolios of reinsurance contracts held that are assets are presented separately from those that are liabilities. There were no portfolios of insurance contracts issued that were assets or portfolios of reinsurance contracts held that were liabilities at the balance date and at 31 December 2022.\n\n|                                             | 2023                               | 2023                | 2023       | 2022 (RESTATED)                    | 2022 (RESTATED)     | 2022 (RESTATED)   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n|                                             | PREMIUM  ALLOCATION  APPROACH US$M | GENERAL  MODEL US$M | TOTAL US$M | PREMIUM  ALLOCATION  APPROACH US$M | GENERAL  MODEL US$M | TOTAL US$M        |\n| Insurance contract liabilities              | 27,003                             | 564                 | 27,567     | 25,503                             | 645                 | 26,148            |\n| Reinsurance contract assets                 | (5,819)                            | (2,215)             | (8,034)    | (6,248)                            | (896)               | ( 7,14 4)         |\n| Net insurance contract liabilities (assets) | 21,184                             | (1,651)             | 19,533     | 19,255                             | (251)               | 19,004            |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nInsurance and reinsurance contracts must be measured using a general model, unless the contracts meet certain eligibility criteria, in which case they may be measured using a simplified approach known as the premium allocation approach. Contracts are eligible for the simplified approach if they have coverage periods of one year or less or if the liability for remaining coverage under that approach is not expected to materially differ from that under the general model. The Group applies the premium allocation approach to most of its insurance and reinsurance contracts on the basis that these eligibility requirements are met.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nFor contracts with coverage periods greater than one year, the Group's assessment of eligibility for the premium allocation approach involves a qualitative consideration of contract features and, where applicable, modelling of the liability for remaining coverage under a range of reasonably expected scenarios. The following key assumptions and estimates are modelled:\n\n- \u00b7 expected future cash flows and the risk adjustment as described in notes 2.2.1 and 2.2.4;\n- \u00b7 pattern of coverage units used to determine the earning pattern of the contractual service margin, which includes consideration of the economic value of policyholders' insurable interests and any contractual limits to amounts that can be claimed under the relevant insurance contracts; and\n- \u00b7 expected variability in assumptions used, such as changes in discount rates.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n6",

Insurance acquisition cash flows are amortised over the coverage period of the related insurance contracts on the same basis as the insurance revenue earning pattern (note 2.1) for the business to which the cash flows relate. The liability for remaining coverage is not discounted where the time between providing each part of the services and the related premium due date is no more than a year.\n\nThe asset or liability for remaining coverage under the general measurement model is measured as the sum of:\n\n- \u00b7 the present value of future cash flows that are expected to arise as the Group fulfils the contracts, which mainly comprise premium, claims and attributable expenses;\n- \u00b7 a risk adjustment for non-financial risk (note 2.2.4); and\n- \u00b7 a contractual service margin, representing the profit that has not yet been recognised in profit or loss as it relates to future services to be provided over the remaining coverage of the insurance contracts.\n\nThe liability for remaining coverage includes a loss component which depicts amounts recognised on onerous contracts. A corresponding loss-recovery component within the reinsurance asset for remaining coverage depicts amounts recoverable in respect of losses on onerous contracts covered by reinsurance contracts held.\n\nUnder both measurement models, the liability for incurred claims (and corresponding recoveries of incurred claims) is measured as the fulfilment cash flows (sum of present value of future cash flows and a risk adjustment) relating to incurred claims and attributable expenses that have not yet been paid, including claims that have been incurred but not yet reported.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe determination of the amounts that the Group will ultimately pay for claims arising under insurance and reinsurance contracts issued involves a number of critical assumptions. Some of the uncertainties impacting these assumptions are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in patterns of claims incidence, reporting and payment;\n- \u00b7 volatility in the estimation of future costs for long-tail insurance classes due to the longer period of time that can elapse before a claim is paid in full;\n- \u00b7 existence of complex underlying exposures;\n- \u00b7 incidence of catastrophic events close to the balance date;\n- \u00b7 changes in the legal environment, including the interpretation of liability laws and the quantum of damages; and\n- \u00b7 changing social, environmental, political and economic trends, for example price and wage inflation.\n\nThe estimation of IBNR is generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than the estimation of the cost of settling claims that have been reported to the Group but are not yet paid, for which more information about claims is generally available. The notification and settlement of claims relating to liability and other long-tail classes of business may not happen for many years after the event giving rise to the claim. As a consequence, liability and other long-tail classes typically display greater variability between initial estimates and final settlement due to delays in reporting claims and uncertainty in respect of court awards and future claims inflation. Claims in respect of property and other short-tail classes are typically reported and settled soon after the claim event, typically giving rise to less uncertainty.\n\nEstimates of future cash flows for each class of business are determined using a variety of estimation techniques, generally based on an analysis of historical experience and with reference to external benchmarks where relevant. The cash flows are discounted to present value using appropriate discount rates as described in note 2.2.5.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nInsurance contracts are onerous when the liability for remaining coverage is insufficient to pay future claims and other insurance service expenses attributable to the contracts.\n\nContracts that are measured using the premium allocation approach are assumed not to be onerous unless facts and circumstances indicate otherwise. In identifying facts and circumstances that may be indicators of onerous contracts, the Group considers management information for Group planning and performance management, in combination with other indicators where relevant. If there are facts and circumstances that may indicate the existence of possible onerous contracts, the onerous contract losses are measured based on the extent to which the fulfilment cash flows attributable to the group of contracts exceed the liability for remaining coverage for that group.\n\nUnder both measurement models, onerous contract losses are measured on a gross basis (excluding the effect of reinsurance contracts held) and are immediately recognised in profit or loss. A loss component of the liability for remaining coverage is established (or increased) to depict the onerous contract losses recognised. Where the onerous contracts are covered by reinsurance contracts held, reinsurance income is recognised in profit or loss and a corresponding loss-recovery component of the reinsurance asset for remaining coverage is established to depict expected recoveries attributable to the onerous contract losses.\n\nThe consideration of facts and circumstances as well as the measurement of any onerous contract losses are determined separately for each underwriting year within a portfolio of contracts that are of similar risks and managed together. Where a subset of contracts within a portfolio would be identified as a separate group from other contracts within the portfolio only because of the existence of specific legal or regulatory constraints to the Group's practical ability to set a different price or level of benefits for policyholders with different characteristics, such contracts are included in the same group for the purposes of identifying and measuring onerous contracts.",

The net liability for incurred claims excludes recoveries under reinsurance loss portfolio transfer contracts that are accounted for under the general model and recognised within the reinsurance asset for remaining coverage as they relate to underlying claims that have not yet been settled. The confidence level inclusive of these recoveries is 90.6% (2022 90.0%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nThe risk adjustment reflects the compensation required for bearing uncertainty about the amount and timing of cash flows that arises from non-financial risk. For contracts measured under the premium allocation approach, unless the contracts are onerous, an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk is only estimated for the measurement of the liability for incurred claims.\n\nThe risk adjustment recognised in relation to the liability for incurred claims is determined with reference to QBE's weighted average cost of economic capital allocated to earned reserve risk. The risk adjustment also reflects the benefit from the diversification of the classes and geographies of the Group. The Group aims to maintain a risk adjustment within a range of 6% to 8% of the net present value of future cash flows in relation to the net outstanding claims liability (being claims reserves within the liability for incurred claims) inclusive of recoveries from reinsurance loss portfolio transfer contracts.\n\nChanges in the risk adjustment are disaggregated between the insurance service result and insurance and reinsurance finance income and expenses.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe risk adjustment is approved by the Board and represents the compensation QBE requires for bearing the uncertainty in the net discounted estimate of future cash flows within the insurance liabilities. The determination of the appropriate level of risk adjustment takes into account:\n\n- \u00b7 the level of economic capital that QBE allocates to support the net discounted cash flows and the weighted average cost of servicing that capital;\n- \u00b7 the run-off profile and term to settlement of the net discounted cash flows;\n- \u00b7 mix of business, in particular the mix of short-tail and long-tail business;\n- \u00b7 the benefit of diversification between classes of business and geographic locations; and\n- \u00b7 the level of uncertainty in the cash flow estimates due to estimation error, data quality, variability of key inflation assumptions, and possible economic and legislative changes.\n\nThe uncertainty by class of business is measured using techniques that determine a range of possible outcomes of ultimate payments and assign a likelihood to outcomes at different levels. These techniques generally use standard statistical distributions, and the measure of variability is referred to as the coefficient of variation.\n\nThe coefficient of variation for two or more classes of business or for two or more geographic locations combined is likely to be less than the coefficients of variation for the individual classes, reflecting the benefit of diversification in general insurance. The statistical measure used to determine diversification is called the correlation; the higher the correlation between two classes of business, the more likely it is that a negative outcome in one class will correspond to a negative outcome in the other class. For example, higher correlation exists between classes of business affected by court cases involving bodily injury claims such as motor third-party liability, workers' compensation and public liability, particularly in the same jurisdiction.\n\nThe confidence level for the Group is determined by analysing the variability of each class of business and the correlation between classes of business and divisions. Correlations are determined for aggregations of classes of business, where appropriate, at the divisional level. The correlations adopted by the Group are generally derived from industry analysis, the Group's historical experience and the judgement of experienced and qualified actuaries. The net present value of future cash flows used in the determination of the confidence level is discounted using risk-free rates.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6",

A bottom-up approach is applied to determine the discount rates used to discount insurance and reinsurance contract cash flows, which uses risk-free rates adjusted to reflect the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe illiquidity premium within discount rates is derived based on the long-term weighted average credit spread of a reference portfolio of assets with a similar currency mix and weighted average duration as the related insurance liabilities over the longer term. The effect of credit risk and other factors that are not relevant to the liquidity characteristics of insurance contracts is eliminated to estimate the portion of the spread that reflects the illiquidity premium.",

UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES\n\n## 2.2.7 Impact of changes in key variables on the net insurance contract liabilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nThe impact of changes in key variables used in the calculation of the net insurance contract liabilities is summarised in the table below, and is shown gross and net of reinsurance held. Each change has been calculated in isolation from the other changes and shows the after-tax impact on profit or loss assuming that there is no change to any of the other variables. In practice, this is considered unlikely to occur as, for example, an increase in interest rates is normally associated with an increase in the rate of inflation. Over the medium to longer term, the impact of a change in discount rates is expected to be, at least partly, offset by the impact of a change in the rate of inflation.\n\nThe sensitivities below assume that all changes directly impact profit after tax. In practice, if the present value of future cash flows was to increase, it is possible that part of the increase may result in an offsetting change in the level of risk adjustment required rather than in a change to profit or loss after tax, depending on the nature of the change in the cash flow estimate and risk outlook.\n\n|                                     |               | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   | PROFIT (LOSS) 1    | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   | PROFIT (LOSS) 1    |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n|                                     |               | GROSS             | GROSS              | NET               | NET                |\n|                                     | SENSITIVITY % | 2023 US$M         | RESTATED 2022 US$M | 2023 US$M         | RESTATED 2022 US$M |\n| Present value of future cash flows  | +5            | (895)             | (852)              | (635)             | (620)              |\n|                                     | -5            | 895               | 852                | 635               | 620                |\n| Risk adjustment                     | +5            | (70)              | (63)               | (48)              | (45)               |\n|                                     | -5            | 70                | 63                 | 48                | 45                 |\n| Inflation rate                      | +1            | (524)             | (475)              | (395)             | (375)              |\n|                                     | -1            | 486               | 443                | 366               | 348                |\n| Discount rate 2                     | +1            | 462               | 422                | 348               | 334                |\n|                                     | -1            | (507)             | (461)              | (383)             | (365)              |\n| Weighted average term to settlement | +10           | 197               | 185                | 145               | 143                |\n|                                     | -10           | (200)             | (187)              | (147)             | (144)              |\n\n- 1  Net of tax at the Group's prima facie income tax rate of 30%.\n- 2  The impact of reasonably possible changes in interest rates on interest-bearing financial assets owned by the Group at the balance date is shown in note 4.4.",

This table therefore illustrates the variability and inherent uncertainty in estimating the expected claims cash flows each year. The ultimate claims cost for any particular accident year is not known until all claims payments have been made which, for some long-tail classes of business, could be many years into the future. The estimate of net ultimate claims payments at the end of each subsequent accident year demonstrates how the original estimate has been revised over time (b).\n\nCumulative net claims payments (d) are deducted from the estimate of net ultimate claims payments in each accident year (c) at the current balance date, resulting in the undiscounted claims estimate at a fixed rate of exchange (e). This is revalued to the balance date rate of exchange (f) to report the net undiscounted claims estimate (g), which is reconciled to the net liability for incurred claims (h). The treatment of foreign exchange in the claims development table is explained on the following page.\n\nThe net increase (decrease) in estimated net ultimate claims payments (i) reflects the estimated ultimate net claims payments at the end of the current financial year (c) less the equivalent at the end of the previous financial year (b).\n\nThe claims development table is presented net of reinsurance. With insurance operations in 27 countries, hundreds of products, various reinsurance arrangements and with the Group's risk tolerance managed on a consolidated basis, it is considered neither meaningful nor practicable to provide this information other than on a consolidated Group basis.\n\n2018 &\n\n|                              |                                                                     | PRIOR US$M   | 2019 US$M   | 2020 US$M   | 2021 US$M   | 2022 US$M   | 2023 US$M   | TOTAL US$M       |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Net ultimate claims payments | Net ultimate claims payments                                        |              |             |             |             |             |             |                  |\n| (a)                          | Original estimate of net ultimate claims payments                   |              | 7,199       | 7,170       | 7,707       | 9,224       | 9,550       |                  |\n| (b)                          | One year later                                                      |              | 7,469       | 6,925       | 7,872       | 9,511       |             |                  |\n|                              | Two years later                                                     |              | 7,695       | 7,012       | 7,843       |             |             |                  |\n|                              | Three years later                                                   |              | 7,748       | 6,930       |             |             |             |                  |\n|                              | Four years later                                                    |              | 7,815       |             |             |             |             |                  |\n| (c)                          | Current estimate of net ultimate claims payments                    |              | 7,815       | 6,930       | 7,843       | 9,511       | 9,550       | 41,649           |\n| (d)                          | Cumulative net payments to date                                     |              | (6,474)     | (5,185)     | (5,341)     | (5,443)     |             | (2,401) (24,844) |\n| (e)                          | Net undiscounted claims estimate at fixed rate of  exchange         | 4,010        | 1,341       | 1,745       | 2,502       | 4,068       | 7,149       | 20,815           |\n| (f)                          | Foreign exchange impact                                             |              |             |             |             |             |             | (29)             |\n|                              | Provision for impairment                                            |              |             |             |             |             |             | 20               |\n| (g)                          | Net undiscounted claims estimate at 31 December 2023                |              |             |             |             |             |             | 20,806           |\n|                              | Discount to present value                                           |              |             |             |             |             |             | (2,421)          |\n|                              | Other attributable cash flows                                       |              |             |             |             |             |             | 637              |\n|                              | Risk adjustment                                                     |              |             |             |             |             |             | 1,520            |\n| (h)                          | Net liability for incurred claims at 31 December 2023  (note 2.2.2) |              |             |             |             |             |             | 20,542           |\n| (i)                          | Movement in estimated net ultimate claims payments                  | 142          | 67          | (82)        | (29)        | 287         | 9,550       | 9,935            |\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nThe estimate of net ultimate claims payments attributable to business acquired that apply the modified retrospective transition approach (note 8.1.1) is included in the claims development table in the accident year in which the acquisition was made. Information about claims development has been disclosed for the five accident years preceding the end of the current reporting period as permitted by AASB 17.\n\nThe Group writes business in many currencies. The translation of estimated net ultimate claims payments denominated in foreign currencies gives rise to foreign exchange movements which have no direct bearing on the development of the underlying claims. To eliminate this distortion, estimated net ultimate claims payments have been translated to the functional currencies of our controlled entities at constant rates of exchange. All estimates of ultimate claims payments for the accident years reported that are in functional currencies other than US dollars have been translated to US dollars using 2023 average rates of exchange.\n\n## 2.3.1 Reinsurance of prior accident year claims liabilities\n\nDuring 2023, the Group entered into a reserve transaction to reinsure certain prior accident year claims liabilities in North America and International which resulted in the recognition of an upfront net cost of $101 million within reinsurance expenses. Reinsurance expenses also include $620 million (2022 $87 million) relating to this transaction and reinsurance loss portfolio transfer contracts entered into in prior periods that remain in-force, reflecting amounts recognised over the coverage period as the underlying claims settle.",

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nPremiums collected from policyholders are invested to meet the Group's cash flow needs to pay claims and other expenses, as well as generating a return that contributes to the Group's profitability. A sound investment strategy is therefore integral to the success of the Group's operations.\n\nThe Group invests across a diversified range of instruments to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return. Decisions on where to invest are dependent on expected returns, cash flow requirements of the Group, liquidity of the instrument, credit quality of the instrument and the overall risk appetite of the Group.

They are therefore initially recognised at fair value, determined as the cost of acquisition excluding transaction costs, and are remeasured to fair value through profit or loss at each reporting date. The fair value hierarchy and the Group's approach to measuring the fair value of each category of investment instrument are disclosed in note 3.2.1.\n\nAll purchases and sales of investments that require delivery of the asset within the time frame established by regulation or market convention are recognised at trade date, being the date on which the Group commits to buy or sell the asset. Investments are de-recognised when the right to receive future cash flows from the asset has expired or has been transferred along with substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.",

Term deposits are valued at par. Other short-term money (bank bills, certificates of deposit, treasury bills and other short-term instruments) is priced using interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n\n## Government bonds, corporate bonds, emerging market debt and high yield debt\n\nThese assets are valued based on quoted prices sourced from external data providers. The fair value categorisation of these assets is based on the observability of the inputs.\n\n## Infrastructure debt\n\nInfrastructure debt is priced by external data providers where quoted prices are available or by the external fund manager who may use a combination of observable market prices or comparable prices where available and other valuation techniques. When valuation techniques require the use of significant unobservable inputs, these assets have been categorised as level 3.\n\n## Private credit\n\nThese assets comprise investments in fund vehicles that are valued using current unit prices as advised by the investment fund manager. As the valuation techniques require the use of significant unobservable inputs, these assets have been categorised as level 3.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

In order to conduct underwriting business within some territories, Lloyd's syndicates are required to lodge assets in locally regulated trust funds. Under Lloyd's byelaws, these amounts can only be used to pay claims and allowable expenses of the syndicate and cannot be withdrawn from the trust funds until they become distributable as profit once annual solvency requirements are met. Included in this amount is $1,068 million (2022 $790 million) of short-term money.\n\n## 3.2.3 Derivatives over investment assets\n\nIn accordance with our investment management policies and procedures, derivatives may be used in the investment portfolio as both a hedging tool and to alter the risk profile of the portfolio. Risk management policies over the use of derivatives are set out in note 4.\n\nThe Group's notional exposure to investment derivatives at the balance date is set out in the table below:\n\n| NOTIONAL EXPOSURE             | 2023 US$M   | 2022 US$M   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Bond futures                  |             |             |\n| Short government bond futures | (527)       | (1,347)     |\n| Long government bond futures  | 202         | 12          |\n| Interest rate futures         |             |             |\n| Short interest rates futures  | (2,809)     | -           |\n| Equity index futures          |             |             |\n| Short equity index futures    | -           | (80)        |\n\nQBE may also have exposure to derivatives through investments in underlying pooled funds in accordance with the fund mandate. Those derivative exposures are not included in the table above.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nDerivatives over investment assets are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss. They are therefore initially recognised at fair value, determined as the cost of acquisition excluding transaction costs, and are remeasured to fair value through profit or loss at each reporting date. For futures and options traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices. The mark-to-market value of futures positions is cash settled on a daily basis resulting in a fair value of nil at the balance date. The fair value of options was not material at the balance date.",

The Group's ability to satisfy customers' risk management needs is central to what we do. QBE aims to generate wealth and maximise returns for its shareholders by pursuing opportunities that involve risk. Our people are responsible for ensuring that QBE's risks are managed and controlled on a day-to-day basis. QBE aims to use its ability to properly manage risk to provide more certainty and improved outcomes for all stakeholders.\n\nQBE applies a consistent and integrated approach to enterprise risk management (ERM). QBE's ERM framework is articulated in the Group Risk Management Strategy (RMS) and Reinsurance Management Strategy (REMS), both of which are approved annually by the Board and lodged with APRA. QBE's framework sets out the approach to managing risk effectively to meet strategic objectives while taking into account the creation of value for our shareholders.\n\nThe ERM framework consists of complementary elements that are embedded throughout the business management cycle and culture of the organisation. Key aspects include risk appetite, governance, reporting, risk identification and measurement, modelling and stress testing, risk systems, and risk culture.\n\nRisk management is a continuous process and an integral part of robust business management. QBE's approach is to integrate risk management into the broader management processes of the organisation. It is QBE's philosophy to ensure that risk management remains embedded in the business and that the risk makers or risk takers are themselves the risk managers. Specifically, the management of risk must occur at each point in the business management cycle.\n\nThe Group's strategy for managing risk is to:\n\n- \u00b7 achieve competitive advantage by better understanding the risk environments in which we operate;\n- \u00b7 give confidence to the business to make objective, risk-based decisions to optimise returns; and\n- \u00b7 avoid unwelcome surprises to the achievement of business objectives by reducing uncertainty and volatility through the identification and management of risks.\n\nThe key risk categories used by QBE to classify risk are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 strategic risk (note 4.1);\n- \u00b7 insurance risk (note 4.2);\n- \u00b7 credit risk (note 4.3);\n- \u00b7 market risk (note 4.4);\n- \u00b7 liquidity risk (note 4.5);\n- \u00b7 operational risk (note 4.6);\n- \u00b7 compliance risk (note 4.7); and\n- \u00b7 Group risk (note 4.8).\n\n## Risk culture\n\nA sound risk culture underpins QBE's risk management strategy and is a key component of the ERM framework. QBE is committed to, and supports, a strong risk culture.\n\nIt recognises the importance of risk awareness and culture as being instrumental in the effectiveness of the ERM framework. Further information on risk culture is provided on page 16 of this Annual Report.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## 4.1 Strategic risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nStrategic risk is the current and prospective impact on earnings and/or capital arising from strategic business decisions and responsiveness to external change. QBE classifies strategic risk into five subcategories, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Performance risk: QBE is not able to achieve its performance objectives.\n- \u00b7 Capital risk: QBE's structure and availability of capital do not meet regulatory requirements and/or support strategic initiatives.\n- \u00b7 Reputational risk: QBE's stakeholders have a negative perception of QBE's brand which may damage QBE's reputation and threaten overall performance.\n- \u00b7 Environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk: this is the negative impact on QBE's strategic priorities or objectives from ESG issues.\n- \u00b7 Emerging risk: these are new or future risks which are difficult to assess but may have a significant impact to QBE or the markets in which it operates.\n\nQBE's approach to managing strategic risk is underpinned by the Group strategic risk appetite statement as set by the Board and is summarised below.\n\n## Performance risk\n\nFailure to deliver acceptable performance can result in shareholders losing confidence, impacting our reputation in the market and ultimately impacting our ability to deliver our strategic objectives.\n\nQBE evaluates performance risk by assessing potential earnings volatility against its risk appetite and considering the changing levels of risk in its business plan. The plan is supported by an established regime of attestations by chief underwriting officers, chief actuaries, chief financial officers and chief risk officers, enabling action prior to signing off the business plan and making market commitments. Performance risk is monitored throughout the year against committed business plans (supported by performance monitoring, cell reviews and mid-year risk reviews).\n\n## Capital risk\n\nThe Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) outlines QBE's approach to:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing the risks arising from its activities and ensuring that capital held is commensurate with the level of risk; and\n- \u00b7 maintaining adequate capital over time, including the setting of capital targets consistent with risk profile, risk appetite and regulatory capital requirements.\n\nQBE maintains a level of eligible regulatory capital that exceeds requirements, with the capital target set at a multiple of 1.6-1.8 times the Prescribed Capital Amount (PCA).\n\nAll regulated controlled entities are required to maintain a minimum level of capital to meet obligations to policyholders. It is the Group's policy that each regulated entity maintains a capital base appropriate to its size, business mix, complexity and risk profile which fully complies with and meets or exceeds local regulatory requirements.\n\nQBE aims to maintain the ratio of borrowings to total capital at 15%-30%. At the balance date, this ratio was 21.9% (2022 23.7%). 2022 is calculated based on total capital that has been restated for the application of AASB 17 (note 8.1.1).\n\nThe ICAAP also sets out QBE's approach to:\n\n- \u00b7 accessing potential sources of additional capital if required;\n- \u00b7 setting and monitoring risk indicators and triggers for capital levels, to alert management to periods of potential heightened risk;\n- \u00b7 outlining the management actions that can be used to mitigate the potential implications of heightened risk;\n- \u00b7 undertaking stress testing and scenario analysis to anticipate, and be better prepared for, certain adverse events;\n- \u00b7 assessing the quality and composition of capital to meet regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and rules; and\n- \u00b7 determining and monitoring capital allocation and ensuring that QBE earns an effective rate of return on its capital deployed.\n\nThe governance over the ICAAP includes the Board and Board Committees, the Executive Investment & Capital Committee, the Executive Risk Committee, senior management, and supporting functions.",

Each of these relationships is managed through divisional and Group teams, including corporate affairs, human resources, regulatory, compliance and distribution teams.\n\n## ESG and emerging risks\n\nESG and emerging risk horizon scans are performed annually to identify and assess the key ESG and emerging risks to QBE. We maintain oversight of ESG risks through the ESG Risk Committee and both ESG and emerging risks are considered as part of the development of the Group's top risk profile. The Group's top risk profile is overseen by the Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk & Capital Committee.\n\nESG, including climate change, is a material business risk for QBE, potentially impacting our business and customers in the medium to long term. We have considered short-term scenarios that could affect our insurance business written to date and current investments. Climate change is expected to increasingly impact the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes over the long term. In the short term, it is often difficult to distinguish the impact of climate change from the normal variability in weather and natural catastrophes. Claims in respect of classes most impacted by these events (e.g. property classes) are typically reported and settled soon after the claim event, and climate change is therefore not expected to materially impact the level of uncertainty in estimating the ultimate cost of those claims. QBE looks to manage for natural catastrophe volatility by considering a wide range of event frequency and severity scenarios in our capital planning, and by purchasing a comprehensive Group catastrophe reinsurance program.\n\nQBE's investments continue to be resilient with respect to climate transition risks as they have limited exposure to highly impacted sectors. Given the medium to long-term nature of the estimated impacts of climate transition, this factor is not expected to be significant to the fair value measurement of the Group's investment assets at the balance date.\n\nFurther detail on QBE's approach to climate change is included in our climate change disclosures on pages 20 to 33 of this Annual Report.\n\n## 4.2 Insurance risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nInsurance risk is the risk of fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of insured events and claims settlements, relative to expectations.\n\nQBE classifies insurance risk into three subcategories, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 underwriting/pricing risk;\n- \u00b7 insurance concentration risk; and\n- \u00b7 reserving risk.\n\nQBE's approach to managing insurance risk is underpinned by the Group's insurance risk appetite statement which is set by the Board and is summarised below.\n\n## Underwriting/pricing risk\n\nQBE manages underwriting/pricing risk by appropriately setting and adjusting underwriting strategy, risk selection and pricing practices throughout the underwriting cycle. Underwriting/pricing risk is monitored throughout the year against committed business plans, underpinned by cell reviews.\n\nQBE's underwriting strategy aims to diversify and limit the type of insurance risks accepted and reduce the variability of the expected outcome. The underwriting strategy is implemented through QBE's annual business planning process, supported by minimum underwriting standards and delegated authorities. These authorities reflect the level of risk that the Group is prepared to take with respect to each permitted insurance class.\n\nPricing of risks is controlled by the use of in-house pricing models relevant to specific portfolios and the markets in which QBE operates. Underwriters and actuaries maintain pricing and claims analysis for each portfolio, combined with a knowledge of current developments in the respective markets and classes of business.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Insurance concentration risk\n\nQBE's exposure to concentrations of insurance risk is mitigated by maintaining a business portfolio that is diversified across countries and classes of business. Product diversification is pursued through a strategy of developing strong underwriting skills in a wide variety of classes of business.\n\nThe table below demonstrates the diversity of QBE's operations:\n\n| INSURANCE REVENUE                | 2023 US$M   | RESTATED  2022 US$M   |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| Commercial and domestic property | 6,306       | 5,538                 |\n| Agriculture                      | 4,310       | 3,935                 |\n| Public/product liability         | 2,703       | 2,243                 |\n| Motor and motor casualty         | 2,059       | 1,900                 |\n| Marine, energy and aviation      | 1,506       | 1,297                 |\n| Professional indemnity           | 1,373       | 1,540                 |\n| Workers' compensation            | 1,082       | 1,131                 |\n| Accident and health              | 969         | 802                   |\n| Financial and credit             | 385         | 419                   |\n| Other                            | 133         | 99                    |\n|                                  | 20,826      | 18,904                |\n\nInsurance concentration risk includes the risks from natural or man-made events that have the potential to produce claims from many of the Group's policyholders at the same time (e.g. catastrophes). QBE currently uses a variety of methodologies to monitor aggregate exposures and manage catastrophe risk. These include the use of catastrophe models from third-party vendors, realistic disaster scenarios and group aggregate methodology. In determining catastrophe risk accumulation, QBE considers the insurance concentration risk charge (ICRC), a capital measure under APRA prudential standards. QBE's maximum risk tolerance for an individual natural catastrophe is determined annually and is linked to the maximum net annual allowance for catastrophe claims.\n\n## Reserving risk\n\nReserving risk is managed through the actuarial valuation of insurance liabilities, which is conducted at least half-yearly. The valuation of the present value of future claims cash flows within the net insurance contract liabilities is performed by qualified and experienced actuaries, with reference to historical data and reasoned expectations of future experience and events. The present value of future claims cash flows within the net insurance contract liabilities is subject to a comprehensive independent review at least annually.",

QBE's exposure to credit risk results from financial transactions with securities issuers, debtors, brokers, policyholders, reinsurers and guarantors.\n\nQBE's approach to managing credit risk is underpinned by the Group's credit risk appetite as set by the Board and is summarised below.\n\n## Reinsurance credit risk\n\nThe Group's objective is to maximise placement of reinsurance with highly rated counterparties. Concentration of risk with reinsurance counterparties is monitored strictly and regularly by the Group's Security Committee and is controlled by reference to the following protocols:\n\n- \u00b7 treaty or facultative reinsurance is placed in accordance with the requirements of the Group REMS and Group Security Committee guidelines;\n- \u00b7 reinsurance arrangements are regularly reassessed to determine their effectiveness based on current exposures, historical claims and potential future claims based on the Group's insurance concentrations; and\n- \u00b7 exposure to reinsurance counterparties and the credit quality of those counterparties are actively monitored.\n\nCredit risk exposures are calculated regularly and compared with authorised credit limits. The Group is exposed to material concentrations of credit risk in relation to reinsurance recoveries at the balance date, in particular to large global reinsurers. In certain cases, the Group requires letters of credit or other collateral arrangements to be provided to guarantee the recoverability of the amount involved. Collateral held for the Group in respect of reinsurance arrangements, including loss portfolio transfer contracts, is $1,261 million (2022 $1,809 million). The carrying amount of relevant asset classes on the balance sheet represents the maximum amount of credit exposure. Collateral held may reduce the level of credit risk associated with this exposure but does not change the total amount recoverable. The credit rating analysis below includes the impact of such security arrangements. In some cases, further security has been obtained in the form of trust arrangements, reinsurer default protection and other potential offsets. This additional security has not been included in the credit rating analysis below.\n\nThe following table provides information about the quality of the Group's credit risk exposure in respect of reinsurance recoveries at the balance date. The analysis classifies the assets according to Standard & Poor's (S&P) counterparty financial strength credit ratings. AAA is the highest possible rating.\n\n|                                                         | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   |            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|\n|                                                         | AAA US$M        | AA US$M         | A US$M          | BBB US$M        | NOT RATED US$M  | TOTAL US$M |\n| At 31 December 2023                                     |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |            |\n| Reinsurance recoveries on incurred outstanding claims 1 | 72              | 4,931           | 2,655           | 11              | 153             | 7,822      |\n| Reinsurance recoveries on paid claims                   | 4               | 1,797           | 383             | 9               | 19              | 2,212      |\n| At 31 December 2022 (RESTATED)                          |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |            |\n| Reinsurance recoveries on incurred outstanding claims 1 | 69              | 4,423           | 1,892           | 31              | 77              | 6,492      |\n| Reinsurance recoveries on paid claims                   | 2               | 2,066           | 437             | 4               | 15              | 2,524      |\n\nThe following table provides further information regarding the ageing of reinsurance recoveries on paid claims at the balance date:\n\n|                                       |                  |                                       | PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED   | PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED   | PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED   | PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED   |            |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                                       | YEAR             | NEITHER  PAST  DUE NOR  IMPAIRED US$M | 0 TO 3  MONTHS US$M         | 4 TO 6  MONTHS US$M         | 7 MONTHS   TO 1 YEAR US$M   | GREATER  THAN   1 YEAR US$M | TOTAL US$M |\n| Reinsurance recoveries on paid claims | 2023             | 1,119                                 | 1,031                       | 5                           | 1                           | 56                          | 2,212      |\n|                                       | 2022  (RESTATED) | 1,183                                 | 1,043                       | 54                          | 147                         | 97                          | 2,524      |\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Investment and treasury credit risk\n\nThe Group only transacts with investment counterparties within the limits outlined in the delegated authorities. Investment counterparty exposure limits are applied to individual counterparty exposures and to multiple exposures within a group of related companies in relation to investments, cash deposits and forward foreign exchange exposures. Counterparty exposure limit compliance is monitored daily.\n\nThe following table provides information regarding the Group's aggregate credit risk exposure at the balance date in respect of the major classes of financial assets. Amounts within insurance contract liabilities and other receivables are excluded from this analysis on the basis that they comprise smaller credit risk items which generally cannot be rated and are not individually material. The analysis classifies the assets according to S&P counterparty credit ratings. AAA is the highest possible rating. Rated assets falling outside the range of AAA to BBB are classified as speculative grade.\n\n|                                  | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING           |                |            |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------|------------|\n|                                  | AAA US$M        | AA US$M         | A US$M          | BBB US$M        | SPECULATIVE  GRADE US$M | NOT RATED US$M | TOTAL US$M |\n| At 31 December 2023              |                 |                 |                 |                 |                         |                |            |\n| Cash and cash equivalents        | 314             | 478             | 558             | 11              | -                       | 5              | 1,366      |\n| Interest-bearing investments     | 4,310           | 11,051          | 7,652           | 2,587           | 688                     | 217            | 26,505     |\n| Derivative financial instruments | -               | 147             | 99              | 3               | -                       | 1              | 250        |\n| At 31 December 2022 (RESTATED)   |                 |                 |                 |                 |                         |                |            |\n| Cash and cash equivalents        | 137             | 231             | 437             | 17              | 1                       | 10             | 833        |\n| Interest-bearing investments     | 3,796           | 10,217          | 7,629           | 2,869           | 482                     | 153            | 25,146     |\n| Derivative financial instruments | -               | 121             | 154             | 8               | -                       | 1              | 284        |\n\nThe carrying amount of non-derivative asset classes on the balance sheet represents the maximum amount of credit exposure at the balance date.

The continuous due diligence over brokers involves an assessment of the broker's reputation, regulatory standing and financial strength.\n\nQBE regularly reviews the collectability of receivables and the adequacy of associated provisions for impairment. Concentration risk for large brokers is also monitored. Balances are monitored on the basis of uncollected debt and debt outstanding in excess of six months. Brokers are also subject to regular due diligence to ensure adherence to local broker policies and associated requirements.\n\nThe following table provides information regarding the ageing of the Group's financial assets that are past due but not impaired and which are largely unrated at the balance date:\n\n|                                |                                      | PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED   | PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED   | PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED   | PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED   |            |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                                | NEITHER PAST  DUE NOR  IMPAIRED US$M | 0 TO 3  MONTHS US$M         | 4 TO 6  MONTHS US$M         | 7 MONTHS   TO 1 YEAR US$M   | GREATER THAN   1 YEAR US$M  | TOTAL US$M |\n| At 31 December 2023            |                                      |                             |                             |                             |                             |            |\n| Premium receivable 1           | 9,312                                | 427                         | 115                         | 71                          | 27                          | 9,952      |\n| Other trade debtors            | 212                                  | 2                           | 1                           | 4                           | 1                           | 220        |\n| Receivables within insurance   |                                      |                             |                             |                             |                             |            |\n| contract liabilities           | 9,524                                | 429                         | 116                         | 75                          | 28                          | 10,172     |\n| Other receivables              | 513                                  | 3                           | 1                           | 1                           | 1                           | 519        |\n| At 31 December 2022 (RESTATED) |                                      |                             |                             |                             |                             |            |\n| Premium receivable 1           | 8,149                                | 282                         | 110                         | 51                          | 28                          | 8,620      |\n| Other trade debtors            | 213                                  | 1                           | 1                           | 2                           | 5                           | 222        |\n| Receivables within insurance   |                                      |                             |                             |                             |                             |            |\n| contract liabilities           | 8,362                                | 283                         | 111                         | 53                          | 33                          | 8,842      |\n| Other receivables              | 417                                  | 3                           | 1                           | 1                           | 1                           | 423        |\n\nDue to the predominantly short-term nature of these receivables, the carrying value is assumed to approximate the fair value.

Market factors include, but are not limited to, interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates.\n\nQBE's approach to managing market risk is underpinned by the Group's market risk appetite as set by the Board and is summarised below.\n\nQBE's approach to managing investment market movements is underpinned by the Group's investment strategy which outlines QBE's view of the markets and its corresponding investment approach.\n\nInvestment market risk is managed through the application of risk limits. These limits are based on the market risk appetite as determined by the Board and apply to:\n\n- \u00b7 losses generated on the investment portfolio under market stress scenarios. The scenarios assume adverse movements in market factors and are designed to reflect a significant market stress event; and\n- \u00b7 sensitivities to changes in risk factors which have a significant impact on the investment portfolio such as interest rate risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nQBE's exposure to interest rate risk arises mainly through its holdings in interest-bearing assets and the measurement of its net insurance contract liabilities. Interest-bearing borrowings issued by the Group are measured at amortised cost and therefore do not expose the Group result to fair value interest rate risk.\n\nInterest-bearing investments with a floating interest rate expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas fixed interest rate instruments expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. QBE's risk management approach is to minimise interest rate risk by actively managing investment portfolios to achieve a balance between cash flow interest rate risk and fair value interest rate risk. The Group predominantly invests in high quality, liquid interest-bearing securities and cash and may use derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate risk of the fixed interest investment portfolio and other financial instruments. All investments are financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Movements in interest rates impacting the fair value of interest-bearing financial assets therefore impact reported profit or loss after income tax.\n\nThe estimates of future cash flows in the net insurance contract liabilities are discounted to present value by reference to risk-free interest rates adjusted to reflect an illiquidity premium (note 2.2.5). The Group is therefore also exposed to potential profit or loss volatility arising from the measurement of the net insurance contract liabilities as a result of interest rate movements. In practice, over the longer term, an increase or decrease in interest rates is normally offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in inflation. The impacts of changes in interest rates on the Group's net insurance contract liabilities are recognised within the net insurance finance result in profit or loss which is analysed as follows:\n\n|                                                                                     | NOTE   | 2023 US$M   | RESTATED  2022 US$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| Insurance finance (expenses) income                                                 |        |             |                       |\n| Effect of changes in interest rates                                                 |        | (72)        | 1,796                 |\n| Discount unwind and changes in financial assumptions                                |        | (962)       | (632)                 |\n| Accretion of interest on contractual service margin                                 |        | (5)         | (7)                   |\n|                                                                                     | 2.2.1  | (1,039)     | 1,157                 |\n| Reinsurance finance income (expenses)                                               |        |             |                       |\n| Effect of changes in interest rates                                                 |        | 42          | (546)                 |\n| Discount unwind and changes in financial assumptions                                |        | 434         | 426                   |\n| Accretion of interest on contractual service margin and premium financing component |        | (16)        | -                     |\n|                                                                                     | 2.2.1  | 460         | (120)                 |\n| Net insurance finance (expenses) income                                             |        | (579)       | 1,037                 |\n\nThe impact of interest rate changes on the fair value of interest-bearing financial assets will be partially offset by the corresponding impact on the Group's net insurance contract liabilities. The Group seeks to minimise the net impact of movements in interest rates on the Group's profit or loss through managing the duration of fixed interest securities relative to the net insurance contract liabilities. At the balance date, the average modified duration of cash and fixed interest securities was 1.7 years (2022 1.6 years). Although QBE maintains a shorter asset duration relative to net insurance contract liabilities, the Group's overall exposure to interest rate risk is not material given the quantum by which the value of fixed income assets exceeds the value of the net insurance contract liabilities.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

The Group's foreign exchange exposure generally arises as a result of either the translation of foreign currency amounts to the functional currency of a controlled entity (operational currency risk) or due to the translation of the Group's net investments in foreign operations to the functional currency of the ultimate parent entity of Australian dollars and to QBE's presentation currency of US dollars (currency translation risk).\n\n## Operational currency risk\n\nOperational currency risk is managed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Each controlled entity manages the volatility arising from changes in foreign exchange rates by matching liabilities with assets of the same currency, as far as is practicable, thus ensuring that any exposures to foreign currencies are minimised. The Group's aim is to mitigate, where possible, its operational foreign currency exposures at a controlled entity level.\n- \u00b7 Forward foreign exchange contracts are used where possible to protect any residual currency positions. Where appropriate, forward foreign exchange contracts may also be used in relation to the Group's borrowings and may be designated as hedge relationships for accounting purposes. Further information on forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage operational currency risk is provided in note 5.6.\n\nThe risk management process relating to the use of forward foreign exchange contracts involves close senior management scrutiny. All forward foreign exchange contracts are subject to delegated authority levels provided to management and the levels of exposure are reviewed on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe analysis below demonstrates the impact on profit or loss after income tax of a 10% strengthening or weakening of the major currencies against the functional currencies of the underlying QBE entities for which the Group has a material exposure at the balance date. The exposures below reflect the aggregation of operational currency exposures of multiple entities with different functional currencies. The sensitivity is measured with reference to the Group's residual (or unmatched) operational foreign currency exposures at the balance date. Operational foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with the policy set out in note 1.2.4. The sensitivities provided demonstrate the impact of a change in one key variable in isolation while other assumptions remain unchanged.\n\nThe sensitivities shown in the table below are relevant only at the balance sheet date, as any unmatched exposures are actively monitored by management and the exposure subsequently matched. 2022 amounts have been restated to reflect amounts within the net insurance contract liabilities that became monetary items following the application of AASB 17.\n\n|                   | 2023                    | 2023          | 2023                 | 2022 (RESTATED)         | 2022 (RESTATED)   | 2022 (RESTATED)      |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| EXPOSURE CURRENCY | RESIDUAL  EXPOSURE US$M | SENSITIVITY % | PROFIT (LOSS) 1 US$M | RESIDUAL  EXPOSURE US$M | SENSITIVITY %     | PROFIT (LOSS) 1 US$M |\n| US dollar         | 165                     | +10           | 12                   | 350                     | +10               | 25                   |\n|                   |                         | (10)          | (12)                 |                         | (10)              | (25)                 |\n| Euro              | 116                     | +10           | 8                    | (154)                   | +10               | (11)                 |\n|                   |                         | (10)          | (8)                  |                         | (10)              | 11                   |\n| Australian dollar | 64                      | +10           | 4                    | 15                      | +10               | 1                    |\n|                   |                         | (10)          | (4)                  |                         | (10)              | (1)                  |\n| Sterling          | 17                      | +10           | 1                    | 15                      | +10               | 1                    |\n|                   |                         | (10)          | (1)                  |                         | (10)              | (1)                  |\n| Canadian dollar   | (2)                     | +10           | -                    | 13                      | +10               | 1                    |\n|                   |                         | (10)          | -                    |                         | (10)              | (1)                  |\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Currency translation risk\n\nQBE is exposed to currency risk in relation to the translation of:\n\n- \u00b7 the ultimate parent entity's net investments in foreign operations to its functional currency of Australian dollars; and\n- \u00b7 all non-US dollar functional currency operations to the Group's presentation currency of US dollars.\n\nCurrency translation risk in relation to QBE's investment in foreign operations is monitored on an ongoing basis and may be mitigated by designation of foreign currency borrowings as a hedge of this risk. Any borrowing that qualifies as a hedging instrument may be designated as a hedge of the Australian dollar ultimate parent entity's net investments in foreign operations and any residual exposure to foreign operations in tradeable currencies may be hedged up to the limit specified in the Group risk appetite statement. The extent of hedging this exposure is carefully managed to ensure an appropriate balance between currency risk and associated risks such as liquidity risk and stability of capital adequacy levels.\n\nQBE does not ordinarily seek to use derivatives to mitigate currency translation risk on translation to the ultimate parent entity functional currency of Australian dollars for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 currency translation gains and losses generally have no cash flow;\n- \u00b7 currency translation gains and losses are accounted for in the foreign currency translation reserve (a component of equity) and therefore do not impact profit or loss unless the related foreign operation is disposed of; and\n- \u00b7 management of translation risk needs to be balanced against the impact on capital requirements and liquidity risk.\n\nQBE may, however, elect to use derivatives to manage currency translation risk in order to preserve capital.\n\nCurrency management processes are actively monitored by Group Treasury and involve close senior management scrutiny. All hedge transactions are subject to delegated authority levels provided to management, and the levels of exposure are reviewed on an ongoing basis. All instruments that are designated as hedges are tested for effectiveness in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments .\n\nFurther information on derivatives and borrowings designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations is provided in note 5.6.1.\n\nForeign exchange gains or losses arising on translation of the Group's foreign operations from the ultimate parent entity's functional currency of Australian dollars to the Group's US dollar presentation currency are recognised directly in equity in accordance with the policy set out in note 1.2.4. The Group cannot hedge this exposure.\n\nThe analysis below demonstrates the impact on equity of a 10% strengthening or weakening against the US dollar of the major currencies to which QBE is exposed through its net investments in foreign operations. The basis for the sensitivity calculation is the Group's actual residual exposure at the balance date.\n\n|                    | 2023                    | 2023          | 2023                             | 2022 (RESTATED)         | 2022 (RESTATED)   | 2022 (RESTATED)                  |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|\n| EXPOSURE CURRENCY  | RESIDUAL  EXPOSURE US$M | SENSITIVITY % | EQUITY INCREASE  (DECREASE) US$M | RESIDUAL  EXPOSURE US$M | SENSITIVITY %     | EQUITY INCREASE  (DECREASE) US$M |\n| Australian dollar  | 3,564                   | +10           | 356                              | 3,214                   | +10               | 321                              |\n|                    |                         | (10)          | (356)                            |                         | (10)              | (321)                            |\n| Euro               | 1,670                   | +10           | 167                              | 1,573                   | +10               | 157                              |\n|                    |                         | (10)          | (167)                            |                         | (10)              | (157)                            |\n| Sterling           | 1,144                   | +10           | 114                              | 664                     | +10               | 66                               |\n|                    |                         | (10)          | (114)                            |                         | (10)              | (66)                             |\n| New Zealand dollar | 302                     | +10           | 30                               | 303                     | +10               | 30                               |\n|                    |                         | (10)          | (30)                             |                         | (10)              | (30)                             |\n| Hong Kong dollar   | 213                     | +10           | 21                               | 151                     | +10               | 15                               |\n|                    |                         | (10)          | (21)                             |                         | (10)              | (15)                             |\n| Singapore dollar   | 137                     | +10           | 14                               | 126                     | +10               | 13                               |\n|                    |                         | (10)          | (14)                             |                         | (10)              | (13)                             |",

Cash flow forecasting and targeting are conducted at a legal entity level and involve actively managing operational cash flow requirements.\n\nTo supplement the cash flow targeting and to ensure that there are sufficient liquid funds available to meet insurance and investment obligations, a minimum percentage of QBE's liabilities is held, at all times, in cash and liquid securities. QBE also maintains a defined proportion of the funds under management in liquid assets.\n\nQBE actively forecasts cash flow requirements to identify future cash surpluses and shortages to optimise invested cash balances and limit unexpected calls from the investment pool. The Group limits the risk of liquidity shortfalls resulting from mismatches in the timing of claims payments and receipts of claims recoveries by negotiating cash call clauses in reinsurance contracts and seeking accelerated settlements for large reinsurance recoveries.\n\nThe following table summarises the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on the remaining contractual obligations, and includes derivative assets used to hedge contractual undiscounted interest payments on borrowings. Contractual cash flows are undiscounted and may not necessarily agree with their carrying amounts. Borrowings and contractual undiscounted interest payments are disclosed by reference to the first call date of the borrowings, details of which, including redemption terms, are included in note 5.1.\n\n|                                                                               | LESS THAN   1 YEAR US$M   | 13 TO 36  MONTHS US$M   | 37 TO 60  MONTHS US$M   | OVER 5  YEARS US$M   | NO FIXED  TERM US$M   | TOTAL US$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------|\n| At 31 December 2023                                                           |                           |                         |                         |                      |                       |              |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts                                            | 378                       | -                       | -                       | -                    | -                     | 378          |\n| Other payables                                                                | 399                       | 31                      | -                       | -                    | 2                     | 432          |\n| Lease liabilities                                                             | 59                        | 104                     | 76                      | 71                   | -                     | 310          |\n| Borrowings 1                                                                  | 700                       | 1,165                   | 735                     | 205                  | -                     | 2,805        |\n| Contractual undiscounted interest payments                                    | 166                       | 191                     | 75                      | 8                    | -                     | 440          |\n| Interest rate swaps used to hedge contractual  undiscounted interest payments | (12)                      | (20)                    | -                       | -                    | -                     | (32)         |\n| At 31 December 2022 (RESTATED)                                                |                           |                         |                         |                      |                       |              |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts                                            | 256                       | 131                     | -                       | -                    | -                     | 387          |\n| Other payables                                                                | 334                       | 11                      | -                       | 2                    | -                     | 347          |\n| Lease liabilities                                                             | 49                        | 88                      | 70                      | 94                   | -                     | 301          |\n| Borrowings 1                                                                  | 406                       | 1,000                   | 863                     | 481                  | -                     | 2,750        |\n| Contractual undiscounted interest payments                                    | 155                       | 195                     | 49                      | 9                    | -                     | 408          |\n\nThe maturity profile of the Group's insurance contract liabilities is analysed in note 2.2.6.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Overview\n\nOperational risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.\n\nOperational risk can materialise in a number of forms including fraud perpetrated by employees or by external parties (e.g. claims fraud or cyber attacks), employment practices (e.g. losses arising from acts inconsistent with laws or agreements governing employment, employee health or safety, or from diversity or discrimination events involving internal employees), improper business practices (e.g. failure to meet professional obligations or issues with the nature or design of an insurance product), business disruption and system failures, or business and transaction processing failures.\n\nQBE manages operational risk through setting policy, minimum standards, and process and system controls, including effective segregation of duties, access controls, authorisations and reconciliation procedures, business continuity management, fraud management, information security and physical security.\n\nQBE identifies, assesses and manages operational risk through the:\n\n- \u00b7 risk and control self-assessment process, which identifies and assesses the key risks to achieving business objectives and is conducted at the business unit level;\n- \u00b7 operational risk appetite statement, which sets out the nature and level of risk that the Board and Group Executive Committee are willing to take in pursuit of the organisation's objectives. The operational risk appetite statement is measured through an assessment of the control environment, key risk indicators, issues and incidents; and\n- \u00b7 scenario analysis process, which assesses the impact of potentially extreme scenarios and the appropriateness of our contingency planning.\n\nKey residual risks from the above processes are monitored by the Executive Risk Committee.",

Sources of Group risk are summarised below.\n\nSources of Group risk may include:\n\n- \u00b7 shared global reinsurance program, including counterparty risk of Equator Re;\n- \u00b7 intercompany loans and receivables;\n- \u00b7 contagion reputational risk;\n- \u00b7 credit agency dependency;\n- \u00b7 use of Group functions where there is a global operating model in place;\n- \u00b7 use of QBE's internal asset management function - Group Investments;\n- \u00b7 Group initiatives or decisions with a material impact on one or more divisions; and\n- \u00b7 liquidity and central foreign exchange management.\n\nQBE manages Group risk through various systems, controls and processes, including the management of reinsurance arrangements, use of intercompany transactions and balances accounting guidance, transfer pricing guidelines, investment management agreements, capital planning and assessments of the use of Group functions, Group initiatives and contagion reputational events.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6",

Borrowings are diversified across currencies and tenure.\n\nDetails of the Group's approach to capital risk management are disclosed in note 4.1.\n\n## 5.1 Borrowings\n\n| FINAL MATURITY DATE                                        | I SSUE DATE                                                | PRINCIPAL AMOUNT                                           | 2023 US$M   | 2022 US$M   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Senior debt                                                |                                                            |                                                            |             |             |\n| 25 May 2023                                                | 25 September 2017                                          | $6 million 1                                               | -           | 6           |\n|                                                            |                                                            |                                                            | -           | 6           |\n| Subordinated debt                                          |                                                            |                                                            |             |             |\n| 25 August 2036                                             | 25 August 2020                                             | A$500 million 2                                            | 340         | 338         |\n| 13 September 2038                                          | 13 September 2021                                          | \u00a3400 million                                               | 508         | 478         |\n| 26 October 2038                                            | 19 October 2023                                            | A$330 million                                              | 224         | -           |\n| 28 June 2039                                               | 21 June 2023                                               | A$300 million                                              | 204         | -           |\n| 24 November 2043                                           | 21 November 2016                                           | $400 million/A$689 million 2                               | -           | 400         |\n| 2 December 2044                                            | 2 December 2014                                            | $700 million/A$1,169 million 2                             | 699         | 699         |\n| 12 November 2045                                           | 12 November 2015                                           | $300 million                                               | 300         | 300         |\n| 17 June 2046                                               | 17 June 2016                                               | $524 million                                               | 523         | 523         |\n|                                                            |                                                            |                                                            | 2,798       | 2,738       |\n| Total borrowings 3                                         |                                                            |                                                            | 2,798       | 2,744       |\n| Amounts expected to be settled within 12 months 4          | Amounts expected to be settled within 12 months 4          | Amounts expected to be settled within 12 months 4          | 699         | 406         |\n| Amounts expected to be settled in greater than 12 months 4 | Amounts expected to be settled in greater than 12 months 4 | Amounts expected to be settled in greater than 12 months 4 | 2,099       | 2,338       |\n| Total borrowings                                           | Total borrowings                                           | Total borrowings                                           | 2,798       | 2,744       |\n\n- 1  The senior notes were redeemed on 24 May 2023.\n- 2  Details of related hedging activity are included in note 5.6.1.\n- 3  $2 million of finance costs (2022 nil) were capitalised during the year.\n- 4  Redemption of the securities is subject to the prior written approval of APRA.",

The rate will reset again, on the same basis, on 2 December 2034.\n\n## Subordinated debt due 2045\n\nInterest is payable semi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate of 6.1% per annum until 12 November 2025, at which time the rate will reset to a 10-year mid-market swap rate plus a margin of 3.993% per annum. The rate will reset again, on the same basis, on 12 November 2035.\n\n## Subordinated debt due 2046\n\nInterest is payable semi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate of 5.875% per annum until 17 June 2026. The rate will reset in 2026 and 2036 to a rate calculated by reference to the then 10-year mid-market swap rate plus a margin of 4.395% per annum.\n\n## Deferral of interest\n\nQBE has an option to defer payment of interest in certain circumstances and such deferral will not constitute an event of default for securities due 2036, 2038, 2039, 2044, 2045 and 2046.\n\n## Redemption terms\n\nThe securities are redeemable at the option of QBE, with the prior written approval of APRA, at any time in the event of certain tax and regulatory events and on:\n\n- \u00b7 25 August 2026, 26 October 2028 and 28 June 2029 and each interest payment date thereafter for Australian dollar denominated securities due 2036, 2038 and 2039 respectively;\n- \u00b7 any business day within the six-month period up to and including the first reset date of 13 September 2028 and on each reset date thereafter for sterling securities due 2038; and\n- \u00b7 each reset date for securities due 2044, 2045 and 2046.\n\n## Conversion terms\n\nThe securities due 2036, 2038, 2039, 2044, 2045 and 2046 must be converted into a variable number of the Company's ordinary shares, or written off, if APRA determines QBE to be non-viable. The conversion rate is subject to a price floor of 20% of the VWAP of the shares in the five trading days before the date of issue of the securities.\n\n## Security arrangements\n\nThe claims of bondholders pursuant to the subordinated debt will be subordinated in right of payment to the claims of all senior creditors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nBorrowings are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs directly attributable to the transaction and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds and the redemption amount is recognised through profit or loss over the period of the financial liability using the effective interest method.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n6",

The fair value of the Group's borrowings is categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fixed and floating rate securities are priced using broker quotes and comparable prices for similar instruments in active markets. Where no active market exists, floating rate resettable notes are priced at par plus accrued interest.\n\n## 5.1.2 Financing and other costs\n\n|                                 |   2023 US$M |   2022 US$M |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Interest expense on borrowings  |         169 |         166 |\n| Other costs                     |          63 |          79 |\n| Total financing and other costs |         232 |         245 |\n\n## 5.1.3 Movement in borrowings\n\n|                                       | 2023 US$M   | 2022 US$M   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| At 1 January                          | 2,744       | 3,268       |\n| Net changes from financing cash flows | (1)         | (412)       |\n| Other non-cash changes                | 2           | 2           |\n| Foreign exchange                      | 53          | (114)       |\n| At 31 December                        | 2,798       | 2,744       |\n\n## 5.2 Cash and cash equivalents\n\n|                        | 2023 US$M   |   2022 US$M |\n|------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Fixed interest rate    | 18          |           1 |\n| Floating interest rate | 1,348       |         832 |\n|                        | 1,366       |         833 |\n\n## Restrictions on use\n\nIncluded in cash and cash equivalents are amounts totalling $113 million (2022 $71 million) which are held in Lloyd's syndicate trust funds. In order to conduct underwriting business within some territories, Lloyd's syndicates are required to lodge assets in locally regulated trust funds. Under Lloyd's byelaws, these amounts can only be used to pay claims and allowable expenses of the syndicates and cannot be withdrawn from the trust funds until allowed to be distributed as profit once annual solvency requirements are met.\n\nAlso included in cash and cash equivalents is $160 million (2022 $126 million) relating to policyholder trust accounts in the United Kingdom which can only be accessed by QBE in certain circumstances, such as when QBE is owed a deductible by the policyholder on a claim. The Group recognises a corresponding payable in relation to these until such an event occurs.\n\nQBE has operations in many countries which have foreign exchange controls and regulations. These controls and regulations can vary from simple reporting requirements to outright prohibition of movement of funds without explicit prior central bank or regulator approval. The impact of these controls and regulations may restrict the Group's capacity to repatriate capital and/or profits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and on hand and deposits at call which are readily convertible to cash on hand and which are used for operational cash requirements. Amounts in cash and cash equivalents are the same as those included in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nThe reconciliation of profit or loss after income tax to net cash flows from operating activities is included in note 8.4.",

Each controlled entity manages operational foreign exchange volatility by matching liabilities with assets of the same currency, as far as practicable. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to manage residual currency exposures, with both the foreign exchange gains or losses on translation of the exposure and the mark-to-market of related derivatives reported through profit or loss. Forward foreign exchange contracts may also be utilised in cash flow hedging of foreign currency borrowings and/or hedging exposure to net investments in foreign operations (NIFO).\n\nInterest rate swaps and swaptions are used to hedge exposure to interest rate movements on the Group's borrowings.\n\nRefer to note 4.4 for additional information relating to QBE's approach to managing interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.\n\nThe Group's exposure to treasury derivatives at the balance date determined by reference to the functional currency of the relevant controlled entity is set out in the table below:\n\n|                                                               | 2023          | 2023                   | 2023                       | 2022          | 2022                   | 2022                       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                               | EXPOSURE US$M | FAIR VALUE  ASSET US$M | FAIR VALUE  LIABILITY US$M | EXPOSURE US$M | FAIR VALUE  ASSET US$M | FAIR VALUE  LIABILITY US$M |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts   not in designated hedges | 1,249         | 218                    | 248                        | 990           | 251                    | 172                        |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts  used in cash flow hedges  | (854)         | -                      | 105                        | (1,404)       | -                      | 186                        |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts  used in NIFO hedges       | 806           | 5                      | 20                         | 1,081         | 2                      | 29                         |\n| Interest rate swaps                                           | 341           | 27                     | -                          | -             | -                      | -                          |\n| Interest rate swaptions                                       | -             | -                      | -                          | 339           | 31                     | -                          |\n|                                                               |               | 250                    | 373                        |               | 284                    | 387                        |\n\nThe fair value of these derivatives are categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. They are fair valued using present value techniques utilising observable market data, broker quotes and/or comparable prices for similar instruments in active markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value, determined as the cost of acquisition excluding transaction costs, and remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Remeasurements are recognised in profit or loss at each reporting date, unless the derivative is designated as part of a qualifying hedge relationship (refer to note 5.6.1).\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

CAPITAL STRUCTURE\n\n## 5.6.1 Designated hedges\n\nThe Group's material designated hedge relationships are analysed below by risk category and are accounted for with reference to the accounting policies set out at the end of this note. Hedging ratios, being the relationship between the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item, are 1:1 as the nominal values of hedging instruments match those of the hedged items. Any ineffectiveness arising from factors such as credit risk is not expected to be material. Amounts recognised in equity or reclassified to profit or loss are disclosed in note 5.3.2.\n\n## Cash /flow hedges of borrowings\n\nAt the balance date, forward foreign exchange contracts were used to hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecast transactions in relation to $700 million of subordinated debt maturing in 2044. Foreign currency risk on future coupons and the principal amount is hedged up to and including the first call date of the subordinated debt in 2024. Similarly, interest rate swaps were used to hedge interest rate risk in relation to coupons on A$500 million of subordinated debt maturing in 2036, following the exercise of interest rate swaptions during the year. The interest rate swaps hedge coupon payments from the exercise date to the first call date in August 2026. These hedges were put in place to more effectively manage currency exposures and costs of funding.\n\nOnly the spot components of forward foreign exchange contracts, the fair value of interest rate swaps and the intrinsic value of interest rate swaptions prior to exercise, are designated in hedge relationships. For forward foreign exchange contracts, reclassifications of hedging gains and losses to profit or loss are included in foreign exchange (refer to note 3.1), consistent with the currency movement of the hedged borrowings. For the interest rate swaps, reclassifications of any cumulative hedging gains or losses to profit or loss occur as related coupon payments are made during the period from August 2023 to August 2026. A 'cost of hedging' election was made in respect of the forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaptions, as described below, and amortisation of the forward and currency basis components is included in financing costs (refer to note 5.1.2) where they relate to hedged coupons, or in foreign exchange (refer to note 3.1) where they relate to principal amounts.\n\nThe timing of the nominal amounts of the hedging instruments and corresponding average rates, if applicable, are provided in the following table:\n\n|                                    | 2023 MATURING IN:      | 2023 MATURING IN:   | 2023 MATURING IN:   | 2023 MATURING IN:   | 2022 MATURING IN:   | 2022 MATURING IN:   | 2022 MATURING IN:   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                    |                        | LESS THAN  1 YEAR   | 1 TO 5  YEARS       | OVER 5  YEARS       | LESS THAN  1 YEAR   | 1 TO 5  YEARS       | OVER 5  YEARS       |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts |                        |                     |                     |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Nominal amounts                    | Buy US$M/     Sell A$M | 747/1,251           | -                   | -                   | 477/819             | 747/1,251           | -                   |\n| Average forward rate               | US$/A$                 | 0.60                | -                   | -                   | 0.58                | 0.60                | -                   |\n| Interest rate swaps                |                        |                     |                     |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Nominal amounts                    | A$M                    | -                   | 500                 | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                   |\n| Average fixed interest rate        | %                      | -                   | 0.80                | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                   |\n\n## Hedges of currency risk relating to translation of net investments in foreign operations\n\nAt the balance date, forward foreign exchange contracts and borrowings were designated as NIFO hedges.

The relevant entity also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedge effectiveness requirements are met, including the relevant economic relationship, the effect of credit risk and the hedge ratio.\n\nFor qualifying cash flow hedges and NIFO hedges, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument associated with the effective portion of the hedge is accumulated in equity through other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item also affects profit or loss. For cash flow hedges, this is reflected in the cash flow hedge reserve; for NIFO hedges, this is reflected in the foreign currency translation reserve (refer to note 5.3.2). The gain or loss on any ineffective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss immediately.\n\nWhere the forward and currency basis components of a designated derivative do not form part of the designated hedge relationship, these components are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss unless a 'cost of hedging' election is made. Under this election, the fair value of these components at inception of the hedge are amortised through profit or loss over time periods relevant to the hedge, with other changes in their fair values after inception recognised in equity through other comprehensive income. This election can be made on a hedge-by-hedge basis and is reflected in the cost of hedging reserve (refer to note 5.3.2).\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the qualifying hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, including when the risk management objective is no longer met or is no longer relevant; the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; the hedged item matures, is sold or repaid; or a hedged forecast transaction is no longer considered highly probable. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued, any cumulative hedging gain or loss in equity at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss. If the hedged item is a forecast transaction that is no longer considered highly probable, the cumulative gain or loss is immediately reclassified to profit or loss. When a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is discontinued, any cumulative hedging gain or loss at that time remains in equity and is only recycled to profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation, forming part of the resulting gain or loss.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6",

TAX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nIncome tax expense or credit is the accounting tax outcome for the period and is calculated as the tax payable on the current period taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted for changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and unused tax losses. The relationship between accounting profit or loss and income tax expense or credit is provided in the reconciliation of prima facie tax to income tax expense or credit (refer to note 6.1). Income tax expense does not equate to the amount of tax actually paid to tax authorities around the world, as it is based upon the accrual accounting concept.\n\nAccounting income and expenses do not always have the same recognition pattern as taxable income and expenses, creating a timing difference as to when a tax expense or credit can be recognised. These differences usually reverse over time but, until they do, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognised on the balance sheet. Note 6.2 details the composition and movements in deferred tax balances and the key management assumptions applied in recognising tax losses.\n\nDetails of franking credits available to shareholders are disclosed in note 5.4.\n\n## 6.1 Reconciliation of prima facie tax to income tax expense\n\n|                                                                | NOTE   | 2023 US$M   | RESTATED  2022 US$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| Profit before income tax                                       |        | 1,837       | 676                   |\n| Prima facie tax expense at 30%                                 |        | 551         | 203                   |\n| Tax effect of non-temporary differences:                       |        |             |                       |\n| Untaxed dividends                                              |        | (2)         | (3)                   |\n| Differences in tax rates                                       |        | (42)        | 17                    |\n| Other, including non-taxable income and non-allowable expenses |        | 4           | 55                    |\n| Prima facie tax adjusted for non-temporary differences         |        | 511         | 272                   |\n| Deferred tax assets re-recognised                              |        | (41)        | (203)                 |\n| Underprovision in prior years                                  |        | 3           | 12                    |\n| Income tax expense                                             |        | 473         | 81                    |\n| Analysed as follows:                                           |        |             |                       |\n| Current tax                                                    |        | 280         | 91                    |\n| Deferred tax                                                   |        | 193         | (10)                  |\n|                                                                |        | 473         | 81                    |\n| Deferred tax expense (credit) comprises:                       |        |             |                       |\n| Deferred tax assets recognised in profit or loss               | 6.2.1  | 112         | (214)                 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities recognised in profit or loss          | 6.2.2  | 81          | 204                   |\n|                                                                |        | 193         | (10)                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nThe current income tax expense or credit is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries in which controlled entities operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\n\nCurrent tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends to either settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, as appropriate.",

TAX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\n## Recoverability of deferred tax assets\n\nQBE assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets at each balance date. In making this assessment, QBE considers in particular each controlled entity's future business plans, history of generating taxable profits, whether the unused tax losses resulted from identifiable causes which are unlikely to recur and if any tax planning opportunities exist in the period in which the taxable losses can be utilised.\n\nThe recognised deferred tax asset relating to the North American tax group of $420 million (2022 $390 million) comprises $300 million (2022 $220 million) of carry forward tax losses and $120 million (2022 $170 million) of deductible temporary differences, net of applicable offsetting deferred tax liabilities, as a result of insurance technical reserves and the tax deductibility of goodwill and other intangibles.\n\nUncertainty continues to exist in relation to the utilisation of this asset, which is subject to there being continued future taxable profits over the period of time in which the losses can be utilised. QBE has made a judgement that the North American tax group will be able to generate sufficient taxable profits over the foreseeable future, based upon the Group's business plan and assumptions which are consistent with those used in the impairment testing of goodwill. Key assumptions include an expectation of future taxable profit driven by no material deterioration in the estimates of prior accident year insurance liabilities, a sustained return to underwriting profitability, benefits flowing from initiatives to reduce the cost base of the division and sustained investment yields. Losses expire over the next 19 years, with the majority expiring between 2032 and 2040. The uncertainty around the recognition of the deferred tax asset will be resolved in future years if taxable profits are generated. Recovery of the asset continues to be sensitive to changes in the combined operating ratio, premium growth and investment yield assumptions as these items are the key drivers of future taxable profits.\n\n## 6.2.2 Deferred tax liabilities\n\n|                                                                                   | NOTE   | 2023 US$M   | RESTATED  2022 US$M   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| Amounts recognised in profit or loss                                              |        |             |                       |\n| Intangible assets                                                                 |        | 93          | 154                   |\n| Insurance provisions                                                              |        | 951         | 757                   |\n| Financial assets - fair value movements                                           |        | 15          | 37                    |\n| Other provisions                                                                  |        | 6           | 23                    |\n| Other                                                                             |        | 86          | 82                    |\n|                                                                                   |        | 1,151       | 1,053                 |\n| Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income and equity Defined benefit plans |        | 8           | 9                     |\n|                                                                                   |        | 8           | 9                     |\n| Deferred tax liabilities before set-off                                           |        | 1,159       | 1,062                 |\n| Set-off of deferred tax assets                                                    | 6.2.1  | (793)       | (913)                 |\n|                                                                                   | 6.2    | 366         | 149                   |\n\n## Movements\n\n|                                                  | NOTE   | 2023 US$M   | RESTATED  2022 US$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| At 1 January                                     |        | 1,062       | 886                   |\n| Amounts recognised in profit or loss             | 6.1    | 81          | 204                   |\n| Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income |        | (2)         | (9)                   |\n| Foreign exchange                                 |        | 18          | (19)                  |\n| At 31 December                                   |        | 1,159       | 1,062                 |",

Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or if they arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the controlled entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset in the consolidated financial statements when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.\n\n## 6.2.3 Tax losses\n\nThe Group has not brought to account $168 million (2022 $187 million) of tax losses, which includes some benefit arising from tax losses in overseas countries. $81 million (2022 $69 million) of tax losses not brought to account have an indefinite life and the remaining $87 million (2022 $118 million) expire in eight to 19 years. The benefits of unused tax losses will only be brought to account when it is probable that they will be realised.\n\nThis benefit of tax losses will only be obtained if:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group derives future assessable income of a nature and an amount sufficient to enable the benefit from the deductions for the losses to be realised;\n- \u00b7 the Group continues to comply with the conditions for deductibility imposed by tax legislation; and\n- \u00b7 no changes in tax legislation adversely affect the Group in realising the benefit from the deductions for the losses.\n\n## 6.2.4 Tax consolidation legislation\n\nOn adoption of the tax consolidation legislation, the Company and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities entered into a tax sharing and tax funding agreement that requires the Australian entities to fully compensate the Company for current tax liabilities and to be fully compensated by the Company for any current tax or deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses arising from external transactions occurring after the date of implementation of the tax consolidation legislation. The contributions are allocated by reference to the notional taxable income of each Australian entity. The head entity is QBE Insurance Group Limited.\n\n## 6.2.5 International tax reform - Pillar Two model rules\n\nThe Group has applied the mandatory exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income tax legislation, in accordance with AASB 112 Income Taxes as amended by AASB 2023-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules.\n\nAs at the balance date, Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in several jurisdictions in which QBE operates and will be effective from 1 January 2024, with a number of other jurisdictions expected to enact this legislation in 2024 with possible retrospective application from 1 January 2024.\n\nUnder the Pillar Two model rules, the Group is expected to be liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between the effective tax rate calculated in accordance with Pillar Two and a 15% minimum tax rate. The quantitative impact of Pillar Two legislation is not yet reasonably estimable, but the Group's exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is not expected to be material based on the Group's assessment to date. The Group's assessment is ongoing and actual impacts are subject to the finalisation of tax laws and guidance relating to the application of Pillar Two rules which continue to be developed and established.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6",

GROUP STRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nThis section provides information to help users understand the Group structure, including the impact of changes in the financial year. This includes acquisitions and disposals of businesses, intangible assets acquired or developed and the results of impairment reviews.\n\n## 7.1 Disposals\n\nDuring 2023, the Group disposed of QBE (PNG) Limited and its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, QBE Insurance (PNG) Limited.\n\nDuring 2022, the Group disposed of Westwood Insurance Agency in North America.\n\n## 7. 2 Intangible assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nIntangible assets are assets with no physical substance. The most significant classes of intangible assets are detailed below:\n\n## Lloyd's syndicate capacity\n\nThe Lloyd's syndicate capacity intangible asset relates to the syndicate capacity acquired as part of the acquisition of QBE Underwriting Limited (formerly trading as Limit) in 2000 and costs incurred as a result of increasing capacity since that date. Syndicate capacity is the aggregate of the premium limits of each member of that syndicate at a point in time. An existing capital provider has the first right to participate on the next year of account, giving the indefinite right to participate on all future years of account. The Group has demonstrated a long-term commitment to developing its operations at Lloyd's. The value of this asset is in the access it gives to future underwriting profits at Lloyd's. For these reasons, Lloyd's syndicate capacity is deemed to have an indefinite useful life.\n\n## Customer relationships\n\nCustomer relationships comprise the capitalisation of future profits relating to insurance contracts acquired and the expected renewal of those contracts. It also includes the value of distribution networks and agency relationships. Customer relationships are amortised over remaining lives of up to eight years depending on the classes of business to which the assets relate.\n\n## Brand names\n\nThese assets reflect the revenue-generating ability of acquired brands. In some circumstances, brand names are considered to have an indefinite useful life due to the long-term nature of the asset.\n\n## Insurance licences\n\nThese assets give the Group the right to operate in certain geographic locations and to write certain classes of business with a potential to generate additional revenue. In some cases, these are considered to have an indefinite useful life due to their long-term nature; however, where there is a finite useful life, assets are amortised over the remaining period, up to 13 years.\n\n## So/f\\_tware\n\nThis includes both acquired and internally developed software which is not integral or closely related to an item of hardware such as an underwriting system. Capitalised software is amortised over periods of up to 10 years, reflecting the period during which the Group is expected to benefit from the use of the software.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and therefore is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually, or more often if there is an indication of impairment.",

Those with a finite useful life are amortised over their estimated useful life in accordance with the pattern of expected consumption of economic benefits, with amortisation expense reported in insurance service expenses or in amortisation and impairment of intangibles depending on the use of the asset. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

GROUP STRUCTURE\n\n## 7. 2 . 1 Impairment testing of intangible assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nAn intangible asset's recoverable value is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less cost to sell.\n\nFor intangible assets with a finite life, if there are indicators that the intangible asset's recoverable value has fallen below its carrying value (e.g. due to changing market conditions), an impairment test is performed and a loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset's recoverable value.\n\nIntangible assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are tested annually for impairment or more frequently where there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, expected to benefit from synergies arising from the acquisition giving rise to the goodwill. Cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units reflect the level at which goodwill is monitored for impairment by QBE. As the Group acquires or disposes of operations or reorganises the way that operations are managed, reporting structures may change, giving rise to a reassessment of cash-generating units and the allocation of goodwill to those cash-generating units.\n\nThe goodwill relating to certain acquisitions is denominated in currencies other than the US dollar and so is subject to foreign exchange movements.\n\nGoodwill is analysed by groups of cash-generating units as follows:\n\n|                   | 2023 US$M   | 2022 US$M   |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| North America     | 30          | 30          |\n| International     | 501         | 490         |\n| Australia Pacific | 1,065       | 1,058       |\n|                   | 1,596       | 1,578       |\n\n## Impairment losses\n\nNo intangible assets were impaired during 2023.

Cash flow forecasts are based on a combination of actual performance to date and expectations of future performance based on prevailing and anticipated market factors.\n- \u00b7 Discount rates include a beta and a market risk premium determined with reference to observable market information, and a specific risk premium appropriate to reflect the nature of the risk associated with the intangible asset or the cash-generating unit to which the asset is allocated.\n\n## Impairment testing of goodwill\n\nThe recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units has been determined by reference to a value in use calculation based on the following key assumptions and estimates:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash flow forecasts reflect combined operating ratio and investment return assumptions that build from the latest three-year business plan. These forecasts cover a period of five years, with the final two years determined with reference to the terminal growth rates discussed below. The cash flow forecasts are based on a combination of historical performance and expectations of future performance based on prevailing and anticipated market factors and the benefit of committed cost saving measures.\n- \u00b7 Terminal value is calculated using a perpetuity growth formula from the end of the cash flow forecast period. Growth rates reflect the long-term average growth rates of the countries relevant to the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units and are based on observable market information. The terminal growth rates used in impairment testing are: North America 2.3% (2022 2.3%), Australia Pacific 2.5% (2022 2.5%) and International 2.0% (2022 2.0%).\n- \u00b7 Discount rates reflect a beta and a market risk premium determined with reference to observable market information, and a specific risk premium appropriate to reflect the nature of the business of each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units. The pre-tax discount rates used were: North America 12.9% (2022 12.7%), Australia Pacific 14.5% (2022 14.0%) and International 12.2% (2022 10.8%). The post-tax discount rates used were: North America 9.9% (2022 9.9%), Australia Pacific 10.1% (2022 9.9%) and International 9.0% (2022 8.6%).\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe Group's business plan, which is the basis for cash flow forecasts used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, considers the potential impact of climate change through the catastrophe allowance which reflects the anticipated rise in trends in the frequency and cost of weather-related events, as well as other assumptions, including relating to premium rate, which reflect QBE's underwriting strategy and planned management actions in response to these risks.\n\nThe disposal of Westwood Insurance Agency in 2022 (note 7.1) included an allocation of $328 million of goodwill relating to the North American cash-generating unit.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n6",

All transactions between and with controlled entities are eliminated in full. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of controlled entities are shown separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet and statement of changes in equity.\n\nWhere control of an entity commences during a financial year, its results are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. Where control of an entity ceases during a financial year, its results are included for that part of the year during which the control existed.\n\nA change in ownership of a controlled entity without the gain or loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction.",

The new standard was adopted in accordance with its transitional provisions which require retrospective application and restatement of comparative information as if AASB 17 had always been in effect, except to the extent that it is impracticable to do so, in which case permitted modifications have been applied ('modified retrospective approach'). The adoption of AASB 17 has resulted in an increase in net assets as at 1 January 2022 of $46 million. This amount, being the cumulative retrospective effect of adoption, was recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as shown in the statement of changes in equity. The opening net asset impact mainly reflects increases from the application of the AASB 17 risk adjustment ($130 million) and higher discount rates due to the inclusion of the illiquidity premium ($168 million), partly offset by decreases driven by onerous contracts ($39 million), the impact of changes in the pattern of revenue recognition for certain classes of business (largely resulting from the application of the general model) ($174 million), tax impacts ($36 million) and other smaller items.\n\nThe following permitted modifications under the modified retrospective approach have been applied to present and measure certain groups of insurance and reinsurance contracts on transition to AASB 17:\n\n- \u00b7 certain contracts acquired in the past (e.g. as part of a business combination) that, at the time of acquisition, were considered past expiry and were in their claims settlement period. For these contracts, the related liabilities were classified as liabilities for incurred claims, on the basis that it was impracticable to treat these liabilities as related to unexpired coverage;\n- \u00b7 determination of the contractual service margin, being the unearned profit for contracts measured under the general model, for which sufficient data on historical assumptions was not available for the estimation of future cash flows and risk adjustment at initial recognition as well as the amount of contractual service margin earned to profit or loss up to the transition date, which are key inputs. To the extent that this information was not available without the use of hindsight, permitted modifications in AASB 17 have been applied to estimate these amounts based on transition date expectations about changes that occurred between initial recognition and the transition date; and\n- \u00b7 identification of groups of onerous contracts relating to past underwriting years. These have been assessed based on information available at the transition date to the extent that reasonable and supportable information about facts and circumstances prior to that date was not available without the use of hindsight.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

An assessment of the financial impact of the standards and amendments has been undertaken and they are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n## 8.2 Contingent liabilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nContingent liabilities are disclosed when the possibility of a future settlement of economic benefits is considered to be less than probable but more likely than remote. If the expected settlement of the liability becomes probable, a provision is recognised.\n\nQBE is required to support the underwriting activities of the Group's controlled entities including corporate members at Lloyd's. Funds at Lloyd's are those funds of the Group which are subject to the terms of the Lloyd's Deposit Trust Deed and are required to support underwriting for the following year and the open years of account, determined by a formula prescribed by Lloyd's each year. At the balance date, letters of credit and similar forms of support of $2,361 million (2022 $2,330 million) were in place in respect of the Group's participation in Lloyd's, along with cash and investments of $110 million (2022 $89 million). In addition, a controlled entity has entered into various trust and security deeds with Lloyd's in respect of assets lodged to support its underwriting activities. These deeds contain covenants that require the entity to meet financial obligations should they arise in relation to cash calls from syndicate participations. A cash call would be made first on the assets held in syndicate trust funds and would only call on funds at Lloyd's after syndicate resources were exhausted. Only if the level of these trust funds was not sufficient would a cash call result in a draw down on the letters of credit and other assets lodged with Lloyd's.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Group is also exposed to contingent liabilities in relation to claims litigation and regulatory examinations arising out of its insurance and reinsurance activities. The Group may also be exposed to the possibility of contingent liabilities in relation to insurance and non-insurance litigation including but not limited to regulatory test cases and class actions, taxation and compliance matters, which may result in legal or regulatory penalties and financial or non-financial losses and other impacts. QBE is currently defending a representative class action in Australia relating to policyholders with business interruption policies.\n\nEntities in the Group may also provide guarantees to support representations in commercial transactions.\n\n## 8.3 Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group had a $228 million receivable and payable with a single counterparty which were fully offset in the balance sheet in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, on the basis that the Group intended to settle these on a net basis and had a legally enforceable right to do so.\n\nThe receivable and payable are nil at the balance date as they were net settled during the current year.",

Some of the assumptions used may be based on historical data which is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Reasonable changes in these assumptions would not have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n## 8.5.4 Employee options\n\nOptions were issued to employees in 2004 in lieu of shares under the Plan with an exercise price of A$11.08. The options vested immediately and are exercisable until March 2024. The market value of all shares underlying the options at the balance date was nil (2022 A$0.2 million). During 2023, 14,250 options (2022 nil) were cancelled or forfeited and 2,250 options (2022 nil) were exercised. At 31 December 2023, 500 options remained, excluding notional dividends (2022 17,000).\n\n## 8.5.5 Share-based payment expense\n\nThis expense, which includes amounts in relation to cash-settled share-based payment awards, was $47,712 thousand (2022 $44,344 thousand). These amounts are included in insurance service expenses.\n\n## 8.5.6 Shares purchased on-market\n\nThe Group may purchase shares on-market to satisfy entitlements under employee share schemes. The Group acquired 0.3 million (2022 0.1 million) such shares during the period at an average price of A$14.97 (2022 A$11.78).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nThe fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of equity-settled instruments is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the instruments granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. The impacts of non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of instruments that are expected to become exercisable.\n\nThe fair value of each instrument is recognised evenly over the service period ending at the vesting date; however, at each balance date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of instruments that are expected to become exercisable due to the achievement of non-market vesting conditions. The Group recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to equity.",

This group is collectively defined as key management personnel. Additional details in respect of key management personnel and their remuneration are shown in the Remuneration Report.\n\n|                                     | 2023 US$000   | 2022 US$000   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Short-term employee benefits        | 12,201        | 13,446        |\n| Post-employment benefits            | 200           | 192           |\n| Other long-term employment benefits | 6             | 101           |\n| Share-based payments                | 7,244         | 7,088         |\n|                                     | 19,651        | 20,827        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\n## Short-term employee bene/fits - pro/fit sharing and bonus plans\n\nA provision is recognised for profit sharing and bonus plans where there is a contractual obligation or where past practice has created a constructive obligation at the end of each reporting period. Bonus or profit sharing obligations are settled within 12 months from the balance date.\n\n## Post-employment bene/fits - de/fined contribution plans\n\nDefined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which an entity pays a fixed contribution into a fund during the course of employment and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Other long-term employee employment bene/fits\n\nThe liabilities for long service leave and annual leave are recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using high quality corporate bond yields with terms and currencies that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. Remeasurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nFurther information in relation to remuneration under equity-based compensation schemes is provided in note 8.5.\n\n## Termination bene/fits\n\nTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. When applicable, the Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the date when the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and\n- \u00b7 recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and involves the payment of termination benefits.\n\nIn the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n6",

The benefits are based on years of service and an average salary calculation. Contributions are made to cover the current cash outflows from the plans and a liability is recorded to recognise the estimated accrued but not yet funded obligations.\n\n|                                                    |                                     | FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS   | FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS   | PRESENT VALUE OF   PLAN OBLIGATIONS   | PRESENT VALUE OF   PLAN OBLIGATIONS   | NET RECOGNISED SURPLUSES  (DEFICITS)   | NET RECOGNISED SURPLUSES  (DEFICITS)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                                                    | DATE OF LAST  ACTUARIAL  ASSESSMENT | 2023  US$M                  | 2022  US$M                  | 2023  US$M                            | 2022  US$M                            | 2023  US$M                             | 2022  US$M                             |\n| Defined benefit plan surpluses                     |                                     |                             |                             |                                       |                                       |                                        |                                        |\n| Iron Trades Insurance staff trust                  | 31 Dec 2023                         | 211                         | 205                         | (177)                                 | (164)                                 | 34                                     | 41                                     |\n| Janson Green final salary  superannuation scheme 1 | 31 Dec 2023                         | 120                         | 117                         | (115)                                 | (112)                                 | 5                                      | 5                                      |\n|                                                    |                                     | 331                         | 322                         | (292)                                 | (276)                                 | 39                                     | 46                                     |\n| Defined benefit plan deficits                      |                                     |                             |                             |                                       |                                       |                                        |                                        |\n| QBE the Americas plan 1                            | 31 Dec 2023                         | 153                         | 154                         | (164)                                 | (167)                                 | (11)                                   | (13)                                   |\n| Other plans 2                                      | 31 Dec 2023                         | 24                          | 23                          | (36)                                  | (36)                                  | (12)                                   | (13)                                   |\n|                                                    |                                     | 177                         | 177                         | (200)                                 | (203)                                 | (23)                                   | (26)                                   |\n\n- 1  Defined benefit plan obligations are funded.\n- 2  Other plans include $8 million (2022 $9 million) of defined benefit post-employment plan obligations that are not funded.\n\nThe measurement of assets and liabilities in defined benefit plans makes it necessary to use assumptions about discount rates, expected future salary increases, investment returns, inflation and life expectancy. If actual outcomes differ materially from actuarial assumptions, this could result in a significant change in employee benefit expense recognised in profit or loss or in actuarial remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income, together with the defined benefit assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet.\n\nThe Group does not control the investment strategies of defined benefit plan assets, most of which are managed by trustees. Nonetheless, the Group has agreed, as part of ongoing funding arrangements, that the trustees should manage their strategic asset allocation in order to minimise the risk of material adverse impact. In particular, the Group has agreed with the trustees to reduce the level of investment risk by investing in assets that match, where possible, the profile of the liabilities. This involves holding a mixture of government and corporate bonds. The Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is also appropriate.\n\nThe charge recognised in profit or loss in the year of $1 million (2022 $2 million) is included in insurance service expenses. Total employer contributions expected to be paid to the various plans in 2024 amount to $2 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nThe surplus or deficit recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate or government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have a term to maturity approximating the term of the related superannuation liability. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, and are recognised in other comprehensive income. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.",

This is subject to the general principle that the fees for non-assurance services should not exceed 50% of all fees paid to the external auditor in any one financial year. The Board believes some non-audit services are appropriate given the external auditor's knowledge of the Group. External tax services are generally provided by an accounting firm other than the external auditor. Consistent with prior periods, the external auditor cannot provide excluded services which include preparing accounting records or financial reports or acting in a management capacity.\n\n|                                                                         | 2023 US$000   | 2022 US$000   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Australian firm                            |               |               |\n| Audit or review of financial reports of the ultimate parent entity      | 2,208         | 2,051         |\n| Audit of financial reports of controlled entities                       | 2,176         | 2,223         |\n| Audit of statutory returns                                              | 656           | 553           |\n| Other assurance services                                                | 1,465         | 725           |\n| Taxation services                                                       | 11            | 14            |\n| Advisory services                                                       | 484           | -             |\n|                                                                         | 7,000         | 5,566         |\n| Related practices of PwC Australian firm (including overseas PwC firms) |               |               |\n| Audit of financial reports of controlled entities                       | 9,349         | 8,247         |\n| Audit of statutory returns                                              | 2,758         | 2,691         |\n| Other assurance services                                                | 180           | 135           |\n| Taxation services                                                       | 4             | 11            |\n| Advisory services                                                       | 22            | 1,058         |\n|                                                                         | 12,313        | 12,142        |\n|                                                                         | 19,313        | 17,708        |\n| Audit and assurance services                                            | 18,792        | 16,625        |\n| Other services                                                          | 521           | 1,083         |\n|                                                                         | 19,313        | 17,708        |\n| Other auditors                                                          |               |               |\n| Audit of financial reports of controlled entities                       | 1,754         | 1,231         |\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Group, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- \u00b7 Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgements; for example, significant accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.\n- \u00b7 In conjunction with component auditors, we conducted an audit of the most financially significant components of the Group, being the Australia Pacific, International and North America divisions. In addition, we performed specific risk focused audit procedures in relation to the captive reinsurer, Equator Re, and other head office entities, where appropriate, as well as audit procedures over the consolidation process.\n- \u00b7 We determined the level of direction and supervision we needed to have over the audit work performed by component auditors to be satisfied that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained for the purposes of our opinion.\n- \u00b7 We kept in regular communication with component auditors throughout the year with conference calls and written instructions.\n- \u00b7 We also ensured that our team, including the component auditors across the Group, possessed the appropriate competence and capabilities needed for the audit of a complex global insurer. This included industry expertise as well as specialists and experts in accounting technical, information technology, actuarial, tax and valuations.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the current period. The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context. We communicated the key audit matters to the Board Audit Committee.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Transition to AASB 17 Insurance Contracts\n\n(Refer to note 8.1.1)\n\nOn 1 January 2023, the Group transitioned to reporting under the new accounting standard AASB 17 Insurance Contracts which replaced AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts .\n\nThe Group has evaluated the requirements of AASB 17 and exercised judgement to develop accounting policies and determine appropriate methodologies in order to comply with AASB 17. In particular, the determination of the measurement models (general model or premium allocation approach) to apply under the standard, the determination of risk adjustment and onerous contract methodologies, and the determination of the discount rate (adjusted for an illiquidity premium to reflect the liquidity characteristics of insurance contracts), were deemed to be significant to the overall impact of transition. The new standard has also had a significant impact on the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessing the significant judgements used by the Group to determine the relevant accounting policies against the requirements of AASB 17. This included judgements used to determine the measurement models adopted, risk adjustment, onerous contracts and discount rates used.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the Group's premium allocation approach eligibility analysis for insurance and reinsurance contracts with coverage periods greater than one year, including testing the relevant supporting data, the significant assumptions used and scenarios applied, and testing the accuracy of models used.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the application of the general model for specific insurance and reinsurance contracts. This included assessing the underlying significant assumptions used to derive the fulfilment cash flows and related contractual service margin, where applicable, as well as the related revenue recognition.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology used to determine the risk adjustment, including assessing the underlying discounted cash flow model and significant assumptions.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

Where the general model is adopted, this balance is also inclusive of a risk adjustment, contractual service margin and discounting.\n\nThe second component relates to the liability for incurred claims and comprises fulfilment cash flows related to past services provided under groups of insurance contracts which have not yet been paid, including claims that have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) and claims incurred but not enough reported (IBNER). This balance is also inclusive of a risk adjustment and discounting.\n\nWe considered the valuation of insurance contract liabilities to be a key audit matter due to the significant judgement required by the Group in estimating future cash flows, and in particular IBNR and IBNER. These estimates are inherently uncertain and can be further impacted by a number of factors such as 'long-tail' classes and natural catastrophe events occurring close to year end where data is limited and as a result require greater reliance on expert judgement.\n\nThe risk adjustment is also a key area of judgement given it is intended to reflect the compensation an entity requires for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with insurance contracts that arise from nonfinancial risks.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the onerous contract methodology used to identify any groups of onerous contracts on transition. Where onerous contracts were identified, we assessed the appropriateness of the significant assumptions and recalculated the relevant loss recovery components.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the updated discounting methodology, including the determination of the illiquidity premium against the requirements of the standard and comparing to external market data where available.\n- \u00b7 Testing the supporting calculations related to the material transition adjustments at 1 January 2022, with the standard applied retrospectively.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the new and restated disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of AASB 17.\n\nTogether with PwC actuarial experts, our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Developing an understanding of the control activities relevant to our audit over the Group's process for determining insurance contract liabilities, and for certain control activities, assessing whether they were appropriately designed and operating effectively on a sample basis, throughout the year ended 31 December 2023.\n- \u00b7 Developing point estimates for selected groups of contracts, focusing on groups of contracts which are material and have heightened uncertainty.\n- \u00b7 Testing specific groups of contracts including those most impacted by the higher inflationary environment, Covid-19, war conflict, natural catastrophes and other large losses by developing an understanding and assessing the methodology and assumptions used by the Group and, where available, comparing to historical experience of the Group, current industry trends and benchmarks, and other publicly available information.\n- \u00b7 Performing risk-based testing procedures on the remaining groups of contracts, where there have been material movements and related assumption changes.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness and reliability of significant data used to estimate future cash flows associated with groups of contracts, including agreeing a sample of claims to underlying information.\n- \u00b7 Testing the onerous contract assessments, including evaluating the significant assumptions against relevant supporting information.\n- \u00b7 Testing the discount rate applied through evaluating yield curves, claims payment patterns and the adopted illiquidity premium. This included comparing the rates applied to external market data and the payment patterns to historical information.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the relevant underlying calculations used to derive the risk adjustment, including the significant assumptions.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.",

This has required the use of judgement in the accounting for the contract and significant assumptions used.\n\n## Carrying value of goodwill\n\n(Refer to note 7.2)\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group held US$1,596 million of goodwill.\n\nAn impairment assessment is performed annually by the Group, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired.\n\nPotential impairment is identified by comparing the value-in-use of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to its carrying value, including goodwill. The valuein-use for each of the CGUs is estimated by the Group using a discounted cash flow model which includes significant judgements and assumptions relating to cash flow projections, investment returns, terminal growth rates and discount rates.\n\nWe considered the carrying value of goodwill a key audit matter due to the inherent estimation uncertainty and subjectivity in judgements in a number of the assumptions.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Developing an understanding of the control activities relevant to our audit over the Group's process for determining reinsurance contract assets, and for certain control activities, assessing whether they were appropriately designed and operating effectively on a sample basis, throughout the year ended 31 December 2023.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating a sample of reinsurance recoveries held by divisions and the Group against underlying contracts to assess the existence of cover and appropriateness of their recognition.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the risk of non-performance of reinsurers by considering the payment history and credit worthiness for a sample of reinsurance recoveries.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the accounting adopted for the LPT, including evaluating the underlying claims data used to recognise the related recoveries.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the determination and composition of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated in the context of the Group's operations and reporting processes.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the value-in-use methodology adopted against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 Developing an understanding of the process by which the cash flow projections were developed and comparing the cash flows included in the impairment assessment with the three year business plan presented to the Board.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of significant assumptions used to derive the cash flow projections by comparing to external market and industry data where available, and current and past performance of the CGUs.\n- \u00b7 Together with PwC valuation experts, we:\n- - Assessed the consistency of the terminal growth rates and investment returns with available external information.\n- - Reperformed the calculation of the discount rates applied to cash flow projections, comparing key inputs (including risk-free rates, market premiums and unlevered betas) to industry and other benchmarks.\n- \u00b7 Testing the mathematical accuracy of the models which were used to determine the value-in-use of the CGUs.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

The assessment is dependent upon the future profitability of the entities within the North American tax group, as well as the period over which tax losses will be available for recovery.\n\nWe considered the recoverability of the deferred tax assets in the North American tax group a key audit matter due to the inherent estimation uncertainty and subjectivity in judgements in a number of assumptions, including taxable income projections, investment returns, and terminal growth rates.\n\n## Valuation of level 3 investments\n\n(Refer to note 3.2)\n\nThe Group held US$28,670 million of investments at 31 December 2023, of which US$1,828 million were classified as level 3 in accordance with AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement .\n\nThe Group exercises judgement in valuing level 3 investments as there are significant unobservable inputs as a result of market illiquidity and/or instrument complexity.\n\nThe level 3 investments held at fair value largely consist of infrastructure assets and unlisted property trusts.\n\nWe considered the valuation of level 3 investments a key audit matter due to the extent of judgement involved in determining the fair value of investments as a result of significant unobservable market inputs.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the recoverability assessment against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards, and in particular the 'convincing other evidence' test under AASB 112 Income Taxes .\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of significant assumptions used to derive the taxable income projections, by comparing with external market and industry data where available, and current and past performance of the entities within the North American tax group.\n- \u00b7 Testing the mathematical accuracy of the models which were used to determine the recoverability of the deferred tax assets.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Developing an understanding of the control activities relevant to our audit over the Group's process for measuring level 3 investments at fair value, and for certain control activities, assessing whether they were appropriately designed and were operating effectively on a sample basis, throughout the year ended 31 December 2023.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies used against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 For a sample of infrastructure assets and unlisted property trusts, where the Group determines the fair value with reference to external information, we:\n- - Compared the price used by the Group to the 31 December 2023 price quoted by the fund manager.\n- - Evaluated the reliability and accuracy of relevant past fund manager statements by reference to the most recent audited financial statements of the relevant funds.\n- - Inspected the most recent reports provided by the fund manager setting out the controls in place at the fund manager, including consideration of the assurance reports on the design and operating effectiveness of those controls, where available.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.",

This involved assessing, where relevant to the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 Change management: the processes and controls used to develop, test and authorise changes to the functionality and configurations within systems.\n- \u00b7 System development: the project disciplines which ensure that significant developments or implementation are appropriately tested before implementation and that data is converted and transferred completely and accurately.\n- \u00b7 Security: the access controls designed to enforce segregation of duties, govern the use of generic and privileged accounts or ensure that data is only changed through authorised means.\n- \u00b7 IT operations: the controls over operations are used to ensure that any issues that arise are managed separately.\n\nWithin the scope of our audit where technology services are provided by a third party, we considered assurance reports from the third party's auditor on the design and operating effectiveness of controls.\n\nWe also carried out tests, on a sample basis, of IT application controls and IT dependencies in manual controls that were key to our audit testing in order to assess the accuracy of certain system calculations, the generation of certain reports and the operation of certain system enforced access controls.\n\nWhere we identified design or operating effectiveness matters relating to IT systems or application controls relevant to our audit, we performed alternative or additional audit procedures.

The website also offers regular QBE share price updates, a calendar of events, a history of QBE's dividends and online access to your shareholding details via the share registry.\n\n## Shareholder information and enquiries\n\nEnquiries and correspondence regarding shareholdings can be directed to QBE's share registry:\n\n## Computershare Investor Services Pty Limited (Computershare)\n\nGPO Box 2975\n\nMelbourne VIC 3001 Australia\n\n452 Johnston Street\n\nAbbotsford VIC 3067 Australia\n\nTelephone: 1300 723 487 (Australia)\n\nTelephone: +61 3 9415 4840 (International)\n\nWebsite: www.computershare.com.au\n\nEmail: qbe.queries@computershare.com.au\n\nFor security purposes, you will need to quote your Securityholder Reference Number (SRN) or Holder Identification Number (HIN).\n\nIf you are broker (CHESS) sponsored, queries relating to incorrect registrations and changes to name and/or address can only be processed by your stockbroker. Please contact your stockbroker. Computershare cannot assist you with these changes.\n\n## Shareholding details online\n\nManage your shareholding online by visiting QBE's share registry, Computershare. Log onto www.investorcentre.com to view your holding balance and dividend statements, to update your address (if you are registered with an SRN) or direct credit instructions, provide DRP or BSP instructions or change/add your tax file number (TFN)/Australian Business Number (ABN) details.\n\nYou may also register to receive shareholder documentation electronically including your dividend statements, notices of meetings and proxy and annual reports.\n\n## Privacy legislation\n\nChapter 2C of the Corporations Act 2001 requires information about you as a securityholder (including your name, address and details of the securities you hold) to be included in QBE's share register. These details must continue to be included in the public register even if you cease to be a securityholder. A copy of the privacy policy is available on Computershare's website.\n\n## Dividends\n\nQBE pays cash dividends to shareholders resident in Australia and New Zealand by direct credit. Shareholders in the United Kingdom and the United States also have the option to receive their cash dividends by direct credit, although it is not mandatory. The benefit to shareholders of the direct credit facility is access to cleared funds quickly and securely, reducing the risk of cheques being lost or stolen. Shareholders in other countries will receive cheque payments in Australian dollars if they have not elected to receive their payment by direct credit. Shareholders receive a dividend statement for tax records, either by post or by email depending on the selected communications option.\n\nEligible shareholders can participate in QBE's DRP and BSP when the plans are active. The DRP enables shareholders to subscribe for additional shares. The BSP is a bonus share plan whereby the dividend entitlement is forgone for bonus shares in lieu of the dividend. In order to participate in either the DRP or BSP, shareholders must have a minimum shareholding of 100 shares and have a registered address in Australia or New Zealand.\n\nParticipants may change their election to participate in the DRP and BSP at any time. DRP/BSP election cut-off dates and application forms are available from QBE's website.",

If you choose not to lodge these details, QBE is obliged to deduct tax at the highest marginal rate (plus the Medicare levy) from the unfranked portion of dividends paid. Australian shareholders living abroad should advise Computershare of their resident status.\n\n## Conduit foreign income (CFI)\n\nShareholders will receive CFI credits in respect of the whole unfranked portion of QBE dividends. These credits exempt non-resident shareholders from Australian withholding tax.\n\n## Unpresented cheques/unclaimed money\n\nUnder the Unclaimed Moneys Act 1950 , unclaimed dividends six or more years old must be given to the Australian Capital Territory. It is very important that shareholders bank outstanding dividend cheques promptly and advise Computershare immediately of changes of address or bank account details.\n\n## Recent QBE dividend\n\n| DATE PAID         | TYPE    | RECORD DATE    |   AUSTRALIAN CENTS PER SHARE |   FRANKING % |\n|-------------------|---------|----------------|------------------------------|--------------|\n| 31 March 2014     | Final   | 13 March 2014  |                           12 |          100 |\n| 23 September 2014 | Interim | 29 August 2014 |                           15 |          100 |\n| 13 April 2015     | Final   | 6 March 2015   |                           22 |          100 |\n| 2 October 2015    | Interim | 28 August 2015 |                           20 |          100 |\n| 14 April 2016     | Final   | 11 March 2016  |                           30 |          100 |\n| 28 September 2016 | Interim | 26 August 2016 |                           21 |           50 |\n| 13 April 2017     | Final   | 10 March 2017  |                           33 |           50 |\n| 29 September 2017 | Interim | 25 August 2017 |                           22 |           30 |\n| 20 April 2018     | Final   | 9 March 2018   |                            4 |           30 |\n| 5 October 2018    | Interim | 24 August 2018 |                           22 |           30 |\n| 18 April 2019     | Final   | 8 March 2019   |                           28 |           60 |\n| 4 October 2019    | Interim | 23 August 2019 |                           25 |           60 |\n| 9 April 2020      | Final   | 6 March 2020   |                           27 |           30 |\n| 25 September 2020 | Interim | 21 August 2020 |                            4 |           10 |\n| 24 September 2021 | Interim | 20 August 2021 |                           11 |           10 |\n| 12 April 2022     | Final   | 8 March 2022   |                           19 |           10 |\n| 23 September 2022 | Interim | 19 August 2022 |                            9 |           10 |\n| 14 April 2023     | Final   | 7 March 2023   |                           30 |           10 |\n| 22 September 2023 | Interim | 18 August 2023 |                           14 |           10 |\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of QBE Insurance Group Limited will be held at 10am on Friday, 10 May 2024.
