        "page_content": "## Dear Shareholders,\n\n2023 was a challenging year for the global semiconductor industry, but we also witnessed the rising emergence of generative AI-related applications, with TSMC as a key enabler. As the world re-emerged from more than two years of pandemic-induced slowdown, weakening global macroeconomic conditions and higher inflation and interest rates prolonged the semiconductor inventory adjustment cycle. Despite the near-term challenges, our technology leadership enabled TSMC to outperform the foundry industry in 2023. We are well-positioned to capture the future AI and high-performance computing (HPC)-related growth opportunities.\n\nIn 2023, Generative AI took the world by storm, with ChatGPT gaining over 100m active users in just two months, becoming the world's fastest growing consumer application. Generative AI requires high computing power and interconnect bandwidth, which drives semiconductor content increase. TSMC is a key enabler of AI applications. Today, the AI application is only in its nascent stage, and no matter which AI approach is taken, AI chips require the use of leading edge technologies and advanced packaging solutions, a strong foundry design ecosystem, and high yield to support larger die sizes. All of these are to TSMC's strengths, and thus all roads lead to working with TSMC.\n\nThe surge in AI-related demand in 2023 supports our already-strong conviction on energy-efficient computing. Thus, the value of our technology position is increasing.\n\nTo address the insatiable demand for energy-efficient computing power in a highly competitive market, customers rely on TSMC to provide a dependable and predictable cadence of technology offering and high quality manufacturing service.\n\nFor TSMC, today around ~70% of our total revenue is 16nm and more advanced nodes. With rising contribution from 3nm and 2nm technologies in the next several years, this number will only increase. Thus, our mature node exposure is around ~20% of our total revenue.\n\nOur focus on mature nodes is to build high yield capacity for specialized technologies, rather than just nominal capacity. In 2023, we worked closely with our customers to introduce specialty technologies such as N6RF+ for smartphones, CMOS Image Sensors for cameras, and 22nm MRAM for automotive and industrial applications. Our mature node strategies will continue to focus on working closely with strategic customers to develop specialty technology solutions to meet their requirement, and create differentiated and long-lasting value to customers.\n\nIn 2023, we inaugurated our new R&D center in Taiwan, and further enhanced our R&D intensity and technology development. Our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology entered high volume production with a strong ramp in the second half of 2023. We are also providing continuous enhancements of our N3 technology, including N3E, N3P and N3X, and expect an even greater contribution in 2024 and the years beyond, supported by robust demand from multiple customers.\n\nOur 2-nanometer is on track for volume production in 2025. It will be the most advanced technology in the semiconductor industry in both density and energy efficiency, when it is introduced. N2 will adopt nanosheet transistor structure, and deliver full-node performance and power benefits, to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing. As part of N2 technology platform, we also developed N2 with backside power rail solution, which is better-suited for specific HPC applications, to be available in the second half of 2025 to customers, with production in 2026.\n\nWe are observing a strong level of customer interest and engagement at our N2, higher than N3 at a similar stage, from both HPC and smartphone applications. With our strategy of continuous enhancements, N2 and its derivatives will further extend our technology leadership well into the future.\n\nThe insatiable demand for energy-efficient computing power not only requires leading edge process technologies, but also advanced packaging technologies to enable large-scale interconnectivity for lower power consumption, at affordable costs. TSMC's industry-leading 3DFabric \u00ae backend technologies include the CoWoS \u00ae and InFO family of advanced packaging technologies, with CoWoS \u00ae technology seeing robust demand from multiple customers' AI chips in 2023.

        "page_content": "## 2.1 An Introduction to TSMC\n\nEstablished in 1987 and headquartered in Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan, TSMC pioneered the pure-play foundry business model with an exclusive focus on manufacturing its customers' products. By choosing not to design, manufacture or market any semiconductor products under its own name, the Company ensures that it never competes with its customers. Based on this founding principle, the key to TSMC's success has always been to enable its customers' success. TSMC's foundry business model has led to the rise of the global fabless industry and, since its inception, TSMC has been one of the world-leading semiconductor foundries. In 2023, the Company manufactured 11,895 different products using 288 distinct technologies for 528 different customers.\n\nTSMC-made semiconductors serve a global customer base that is large and diverse entailing a wide range of applications. These products are used in a variety of end markets including high performance computing, smartphones, the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, and digital consumer electronics. Such strong diversification helps to smooth fluctuations in demand, which in turn allows TSMC to maintain high levels of capacity utilization and profitability, and generate healthy returns for future investment.\n\nThe annual capacity of the manufacturing facilities managed by TSMC and its subsidiaries exceeded 16 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2023. These facilities include four 12-inch wafer GIGAFAB \u00ae fabs, four 8-inch wafer fabs, and one 6-inch wafer fab - all in Taiwan - as well as one 12-inch wafer fab at a wholly owned subsidiary, TSMC Nanjing Company Limited, and two 8-inch wafer fabs at wholly owned subsidiaries, TSMC Washington (previously called WaferTech) in the United States and TSMC China Company Limited.\n\nIn August 2023, TSMC announced its plan to jointly invest in European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC) GmbH, in Dresden, Germany, to build a specialty technology fab focusing on automotive and industrial applications. 70% of ESMC's equity stake is owned by TSMC, with Robert Bosch GmbH, Infineon Technologies AG, and NXP Semiconductors N.V. each holding 10% equity stake. Total investments are expected to exceed 10 billion Euros. The planned fab is expected to have a monthly capacity of 40,000 300mm (12-inch) wafers on TSMC's 28nm/22nm planar complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\n\nand 16nm/12nm FinFET process technology. ESMC aims to begin construction of the fab in the second half of 2024 with production targeted to begin by the end of 2027.\n\nThe Company continues to execute its plan to construct and operate two fabs in Arizona, the United States. Production of the first fab is targeted for the first half of 2025 and construction of the second fab is ongoing. TSMC is also building a new fab in Kumamoto, Japan, with production projected for late 2024.\n\nTSMC provides customer support, account management and engineering services through offices in North America, Europe, Japan, China, and South Korea. At the end of 2023, the Company and its subsidiaries employed more than 76,000 people worldwide.\n\nThe Company is listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) under ticker number 2330, and its American Depositary Shares (ADSs) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol TSM.\n\n## 2.2 Market/Business Summary\n\n## 2.2.1 TSMC Achievements\n\nIn 2023, TSMC maintained its leading position in the foundry segment of the global semiconductor industry by accounting for 28% of the worldwide semiconductor market excluding memory, a decrease from 30% in 2022, mainly due to the semiconductor industry inventory correction.\n\nThe Company's strong market position stems in great part from its leadership in advanced process technologies. In 2023, 58% of TSMC's wafer revenue came from advanced manufacturing processes - defined as geometries of 7nm and smaller - up from 53% in 2022.\n\nTSMC offers a comprehensive technology portfolio and continues to invest in advanced technologies, specialty technologies, and advanced packaging and silicon stacking technologies, to provide customers more added value.\n\nIn addition to its leadership in advanced process and specialty technologies, TSMC offers TSMC 3DFabric \u00ae , a comprehensive family of 3D silicon stacking and advanced packaging technologies to complement its process technology offerings. TSMC 3DFabric \u00ae provides customers greater chip design\n\nflexibility to unleash innovation and is another differentiating competitive advantage for the Company.\n\n## 2.2.2 Market Overview\n\nTSMC estimates that the worldwide semiconductor market excluding memory reached US$481 billion in revenue in 2023, representing a 2% decline from 2022. In the foundry segment of the semiconductor industry, total revenue fell to US$114 billion in 2023, a 13% year-over-year decrease.\n\n## 2.2.3 Industry Outlook, Opportunities and Threats\n\n## Foundry Industry Demand and Supply Outlook\n\nIn 2023, TSMC's revenues in the foundry segment declined, primarily due to the weak electronic equipment (EE) end demand and supply-chain inventory corrections. Although industry megatrends, such as 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), and accelerating digital transformation remained intact, macro-economic uncertainties dampened both consumer and business spending, resulting in reduced demand for many EE devices, such as smartphones and personal computers (PCs). In addition, the electronics supply chain experienced severe inventory corrections throughout 2023 to digest the excess inventory that had accumulated over the past two years due to supply uncertainties, impacting the growth of foundry segment and TSMC.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties remain high. However, TSMC expects end demand for many EE products such as smartphones and PCs to gradually recover with mild growth spurred in part by the pent-up demand after consecutive declines in the past two years. In addition, the acceleration of AI related adoptions will also fuel demand for semiconductors. The Company also expects the overall excess inventory in the system and IC companies to be largely digested and back to healthy levels by the first half of 2024, establishing a solid base for growth in 2024. For the longer term, driven by the above-mentioned megatrends and increasing semiconductor content in most EE devices, TSMC projects a high single-digit compound annual growth rate for the worldwide semiconductor market excluding memory from 2023 through 2028. Furthermore, the Company expects foundry segment revenue growth to outpace the growth of semiconductors excluding memory, fueled by continuing market share gains by fabless companies, increases in integrated device manufacturer (IDM) outsourcing, and\n\nthe expanding use of in-house application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) by systems companies.\n\nAs an upstream supplier in the semiconductor supply chain, the foundry segment is tightly correlated with the market health of all major platforms including high performance computing (HPC), smartphones, Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, and digital consumer electronics (DCE).\n\n## \u25cf High Performance Computing (HPC)\n\nThe HPC platform includes PCs, tablets, game consoles, servers, base stations and more. Major HPC unit shipments declined 14% in 2023 due to prolonged high inflation, macro-economic uncertainty and continued inventory correction, all resulting in weak demand on the consumer side. Meanwhile, demand for servers and data centers equipped with accelerators was relatively healthy, to fulfill the rapidly expanding types and needs of AI applications, especially generative AI, and continued 5G base station deployment.\n\nMoving into 2024, despite lingering macro-economic uncertainty, TSMC projects low-single-digit growth in HPC unit shipments driven by normalized inventory levels, pent-up demand resulting from declines in the past two years, and the ongoing AI arms race. Longer term, an increasingly intelligent and more connected 5G world will demand massive computing power as well as increasingly energy-efficient computing. Both of these require higher performance and more power-efficient central processing units (CPUs), graphics processor units (GPUs), Network Processing Units (NPUs), AI accelerators, and related ASICs, which will drive the overall HPC platform towards richer silicon content, more advanced process technologies and advanced 3D packaging. These trends are all favorable to TSMC given TSMC's technology leadership in these areas\n\n## \u25cf Smartphones\n\nDue to higher inflation, a soft global economy and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, smartphone unit shipments declined 6% in 2023, reflecting a slowdown in the pace of 5G commercialization as well, thus prolonging the replacement cycle of 4G. The long supply chain inventory correction having subsided, smartphone growth is expected to return due to greater demand from emerging countries as well as cyclical recovery. TSMC therefore projects a low-single-digit growth for the smartphone market in 2024. Over the longer term, however, the inevitable migration to 5G, together with",

        "page_content": "improved performance, longer battery life, biosensors and more edge AI features, will all continue to propel smartphone sales growth going forward.\n\nHigh performance and power efficient IC technologies are essential requirements among handset manufacturers, and highly integrated chips and advanced 3D packaging designs are the preferred solutions to optimize cost, power and form factor (IC footprint and thickness). The migration to advanced process technologies will certainly continue, spurred by the need for higher performance chips to run edge AI applications and various complex software computations as well as higher resolution images and video. TSMC is an acknowledged leader in process technology for manufacturing highly integrated chips and advanced 3D packaging designs and, as such, is very well positioned to serve the evolving smartphone market.\n\n## \u25cf Internet of Things (IoT)\n\nThe IoT platform includes various types of smart connected devices ranging from wearables and health monitors to home and industrial automation devices. After the pandemic, digital transformation has resumed, refueling IoT growth momentum. Consumer and enterprise spending, however, was also held back by global inflation and economic slowdown. The end result was a modest 3% growth rate in IoT device shipments in 2023, with smart health and smart retail devices as the major drivers.\n\nAs IoT devices incorporate more AI features, the IoT industry is expected to maintain long-term growth. The first half of 2024 is projected to remain somewhat depressed, with growth momentum expected to recover in the second half. Overall, TSMC projects IoT unit shipments will enjoy a high-single-digit growth in 2024. Additionally, as more AI functions to be incorporated, IoT devices will require chips with higher performance and lower power consumption. TSMC offers various manufacturing processes that supports the need of IoT industry, including advanced technology, ultra-low power (ULP), and various special process technologies, to support customers in providing differentiated, innovative and competitive products, and fulfill requirements of sustainability development.\n\n## \u25cf Automotive\n\nThe global automotive market continues to recover from the supply constraints of the past couple years. Worldwide car unit production grew 9% in 2023, supported by pent-up consumer\n\ndemand and OEM inventory restocking as supply chains normalized. The ongoing headwinds of high inflation and macro-economic uncertainty, however, are expected to hold global car unit production to low-single-digit decline in 2024.\n\nThe megatrend in the automotive industry today is moving toward 'greener, safer and smarter,' which will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and smart cockpit/infotainment systems, along with new electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture. All these will lead to further boost demand for Application Processor (AP)/Microcontroller Unit (MCU)/ASIC processors, in-car networking, sensors, and power management ICs (PMICs), thus continuously increasing the silicon content per car. TSMC is well-positioned to support the automotive industry's megatrend transition, by providing advanced process technologies and manufacturing solutions that enable customers to develop competitive products for the automotive market. In addition, TSMC also offers a range of automotive-grade manufacturing processes, including those with AEC-Q100 and ISO 26262 certification, to ensure the highest levels of quality and reliability for automotive applications.\n\n## \u25cf Digital Consumer Electronics (DCE)\n\nThe global DCE market declined 3% in 2023 as overall demand was sluggish for TVs, set-top boxes (STB) and other consumer products that sold well during pandemic. Fighting longer replacement cycles, as well as high inflation squeezing consumer budgets, the TV market had a modest upswing of shipments in the U.S. due to restocking of low channel inventory but it was offset by weak demand in China, where economic growth has slowed and consumer spending fell due to a variety of factors including a weakened housing market, low marriage rates, and the US-China decoupling.\n\nIn 2024, the DCE market is expected to have gradual recovery in Europe and emerging regions. Therefore, TSMC forecasts shipments to show a low-single-digit annual growth rate. Potential growth drivers of the DCE market include large screens, 120Hz/165Hz high frame rate Gaming TVs, voice AI control, and WiFi 6 connectivity. Regardless of the timing of the recovery, TSMC's advanced technologies will continue to enable DCE customers to create and differentiate their innovative products.\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nThe electronics industry features a long and complex supply chain, the elements of which are correlated and highly interdependent. At the upstream manufacturing level, IC vendors need to have sufficient and flexible supply deliveries to handle fluctuating demand dynamics. Foundry vendors play an important role in maintaining the health and effectiveness of the supply chain. As a leader in the foundry segment, TSMC provides advanced technologies and large-scale capacity to complement the innovations created in the downstream chain.\n\n## 2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy\n\n## Position\n\nTSMC is a global semiconductor foundry leader in advanced and specialty technologies and in advanced packaging technologies. In 2023, TSMC accounted for 28% of the worldwide semiconductor market excluding memory, a decrease from 30% in 2022, mainly due to the semiconductor industry inventory correction. Net revenue by geography, calculated mainly on the country in which customer companies are headquartered, was: 68% from North America; 12% from China; 8% from the Asia Pacific region, excluding China and Japan; 6% from Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and 6% from Japan. Net revenue by platform was: 43% HPC; 38% smartphones; 8% the IoT; and 6% automotive. In addition, 2% came from DCE, while other segments accounted for the remaining 3%.\n\n## Differentiation\n\nTSMC's leadership position is based on three defining competitive strengths and a business strategy rooted in the Company's heritage. The Company distinguishes itself from the competition through its technology leadership, manufacturing excellence, and customer trust.\n\nAs a technology leader, TSMC is consistently first among dedicated foundries to provide leading-edge, next-generation technologies. The Company also maintains a leadership position in more mature technologies by applying the lessons learned in developing advanced technologies to enrich its specialty technologies. Beyond process technology, TSMC has established frontend and backend integration capabilities to create the optimum power/performance/area 'sweet spot' to help customers achieve faster time to production.\n\nTSMC is well recognized for industry-leading manufacturing capabilities and further extends its leadership through its Open Innovation Platform \u00ae (OIP) and Grand Alliance initiatives. The Company's OIP initiative accelerates the pace of innovation in the semiconductor design community and among the Company's ecosystem partners, as well as in its own IP, design and technology co-optimization (DTCO) capabilities, process technology and backend services. A key element is a set of ecosystem interfaces and collaborative components initiated and supported by the Company to more efficiently empower innovation throughout the supply chain and drive the creation and sharing of new revenue and profits. The TSMC Grand Alliance is one of the most powerful forces for innovation in the semiconductor industry, bringing together customers, electronic design automation (EDA) partners and IP partners, along with the partners in the new 3DFabric \u00ae Alliance, and key equipment and material suppliers - all to achieve new, higher levels of collaboration. Through this collaboration, the Grand Alliance's objective is to help customers, Alliance members and TSMC improve competitiveness and win business.\n\nThe foundation for customer trust is a commitment TSMC made when it opened for business in 1987 to never compete with its customers. In keeping this commitment, the Company has never designed, manufactured or marketed any integrated circuits under its own name, but instead has focused all of its efforts and resources on becoming the trusted foundry for its customers.\n\n## Strategy\n\nTSMC is confident that its competitive advantages will enable it to prosper from the foundry segment's many attractive growth opportunities. For the five major markets, namely smartphones, high performance computing, the Internet of Things, automotive, and digital consumer electronics, and in response to the fact that the focus of customer demand is shifting from a process-technology-centric to a productapplication-centric approach, the Company has constructed five corresponding technology platforms to provide customers with comprehensive, competitive logic process technologies, specialty technologies, IPs and packaging and testing technologies to shorten customers' time to design and time to market.

Tseng for NT$17,783,760.\n\n- Note 1:  Directors and Independent Directors' remuneration policies, procedures, standards and structure, as well as the linkage to responsibilities, risks and time spent: According to TSMC's Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine the salary for the Chairman, Vice Chairman and Directors, taking into account the extent and value of the\n- \u25cf  services provided for the management of the Corporation and the standards of the industry within the R.O.C. and overseas.\n- \u25cf  The Articles of Incorporation also provide that the compensation to directors shall be no more than 0.3% of annual profits and directors who also serve as executive officers of TSMC are not entitled to receive compensation to directors. According to TSMC's Compensation and People Development Committee Charter, the distribution of compensation to directors shall be made in accordance with TSMC's 'Rules for Distribution of Compensation to Directors' based on the following principles: (1) directors who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not entitled to receive compensation; (2) the compensation for independent directors may be higher than the other directors, as all independent directors also serve as members of the Audit and Risk Committee and the Compensation and People Development Committee and thus participate in the discussions as well as resolutions of related committee meetings in accordance with the charter of each committee; and (3) the compensation for overseas independent directors may be higher than domestic independent directors, as they require additional time to attend quarterly meetings in Taiwan.\n\nNote 2: Pensions funded according to applicable law.\n\n- Note 3:  The compensation of directors was expensed based on the estimated payment amounts. If the actual amounts subsequently paid differ from the above estimated amounts, the differences will be recorded in the year fully paid as a change in accounting estimate.\n\nNote 4:  The above-mentioned figures include expenses for Company cars and related reimbursements, but do not include compensation of Company drivers (totaled NT$5,034,409).\n\nNote 5:  Total remuneration of the directors from TSMC and from all consolidated entities in 2022, including their employee compensation, both accounted for 0.1365% of 2022 net income.",

The said compensation is also closely linked to both the financial and non-financial performance goals, so as to reflect the fulfillment of their responsibilities as well as their work performance. Compensation includes salary, quarterly paid cash bonus, allowances, and profit sharing based on annual profits of the Company. Moreover, since 2021, TSMC has begun to offer Employee Restricted Stock Awards to link their compensation with shareholders' interests and ESG achievements. The company places a greater emphasis on variable compensation constituting a larger proportion of the total compensation versus fixed compensation, and prioritizes long-term incentive rewards to better align the compensation of our CEO and executives with the company's sustainable business performance, shareholder interests, and ESG achievements. The Compensation and People Development Committee approves the compensation plan regularly, which is then submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.\n\n## \u25cf  The Procedures\n\nQuarterly cash bonuses and profit-sharing are for the purpose of rewarding employee contributions, incentivizing employees to continue to work hard, and aligning employee interests with those of TSMC's shareholders. According to Articles of Incorporation, if the Company is profitable for the year, at least 1% of the profits will be allocated as employee compensation. The frequency, date, and conditions of the distribution of employee compensation will be determined according to the Company's bonus policy. The Company further determines the bonus and profit-sharing amounts based on operating results and common domestic industry practice. The amount and distribution of the employee bonuses are recommended by the Compensation and People Development Committee to the Board of Directors for approval. Cash bonuses are paid quarterly, and profit sharing are paid after approval at the Board of Directors meeting and having reported the same at the Shareholders' meeting.\n\nTSMC established Employee Restricted Stock Awards to link the compensation for CEO and Vice Presidents with ESG achievements and the interests of shareholders. The number of shares granted to the CEO and Vice Presidents will be determined by the Chairman and CEO by taking into account the Company's business performance, the individual's job grade, performance, and other factors as deemed appropriate and approved by Compensation and People Development Committee, and ultimately subject to Board of Directors' approval.\n\n## \u25cf  The Linkage to the Performance Evaluation\n\nThe compensation of TSMC's CEO and Vice Presidents is governed by the Company's bonus policy, which covers the achievement of both corporate operational goals and personal annual objectives. Corporate goals include financial indicators and non-financial indicators. Personal annual objectives include operational goals and ESG achievements in focus areas: Drive Green Manufacturing, Build a Sustainable Supply Chain, Create a Diverse and Inclusive Workplace, Develop Talent, and Care for the Disadvantaged. The Employee Restricted Stock Awards provided has a vesting period of three years (for details, please refer to '4.6.1 Status of Employee Restricted Stock' on page 86-91 of this Annual Report). The corporate performance indicators are the relative total shareholder return (TSR) of the company compared to TSR of the S&P 500 IT Index TSR, with the company's ESG achievements as a modifier. Through these two clear quantitative indicators, we strengthen management's long-term and continuous creation of shareholder value while improving ESG performance, which shows a strong correlation with the Company's overall performance.\n\n## \u25cf  The Future Risk Exposure\n\nThe compensation of TSMC's CEO and Vice Presidents is based on the relevant industry benchmarks and the performance of the Company. The standards, structure, and system of compensation are reviewed and adjusted as necessary in response to changes in the Company's actual operating conditions and relevant laws and regulations. The Company does not create financial incentive programs that may lead executives to pursue remuneration at the expense of exceeding the Company's risk tolerance level, so as to ensure a balance between sustainable business operations and risk control.\n\n## \u25cf  Clawback Policy\n\nTSMC established the Clawback policy in 2023.

We believe that the basis for successful corporate governance is a sound and effective Board of Directors. In line with this principle, TSMC Board of Directors delegates various responsibilities and authority to three Board Committees, Audit and Risk Committee, Compensation and People Development Committee, and Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee. Each Committee's chairperson regularly reports to the Board on its activities and recommendations.\n\n## 2023 Corporate Governance Awards and Ratings\n\n| Organization                            | Awards                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) | Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 23 rd  consecutive year                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| MSCI ESG Indexes                        | MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index component  MSCI ESG Research -

We deeply rely on them for their diverse knowledge, personal perspectives, and solid business judgment. Six of those ten members are Independent Directors: former British Telecommunications Chief Executive Officer, Sir Peter L. Bonfield; former Chairman of National Performing Arts Center and former Advisor of Executive Yuan, R.O.C., Ms. Kok-Choo Chen; former Chairman of Applied Materials, Inc., Mr. Michael R. Splinter; former Chief Executive Officer of Xilinx, Inc., Mr. Moshe N. Gavrielov; currently Chairman of Delta Electronics Inc., Mr. Yancey Hai; and former President of MIT, Mr. L. Rafael Reif.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTSMC's Board is comprised of a diverse group of professionals from different backgrounds in industries, academia, law, etc. These professionals include citizens from Taiwan, Europe and the U.S. with world-class business operating experience, one of whom is female. Independent Directors constitute 60% of the Board.\n\nIn December 2023, TSMC announced that Dr. Mark Liu plans to retire from TSMC in June 2024, and will not seek re-election to the board of directors. During his tenure, Dr. Liu has reaffirmed the Company's commitment to its mission and focused on enhancing corporate governance and competitiveness particularly in technology leadership, digital excellence, and global footprint. TSMC's Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee recommends Dr. C.C. Wei, while remaining as CEO, to succeed as TSMC's next Chairman, subject to the election of the incoming board in June 2024.\n\n## Board Responsibilities\n\nInheriting the spirit of TSMC's Founder, Dr. Morris Chang's philosophy on corporate governance, under the leadership of Chairman Dr. Mark Liu and CEO & Vice Chairman Dr. C.C. Wei, TSMC's Board of Directors takes a serious and forthright approach to its duties and is a dedicated, competent and independent Board.\n\nThe Board's primary duty is to supervise the Company's compliance with relevant laws and regulations, financial transparency, timely disclosure of material information, and maintaining of the highest integrity. TSMC's Board of Directors strives to perform these responsibilities through its Audit and Risk Committee, Compensation and People Development Committee, Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, the hiring of a financial expert consultant for the Audit and Risk Committee, and coordination with our Internal Audit department.\n\nThe second duty of the Board of Directors is to appoint and dismiss officers of the Company when necessary, to evaluate management performance and to review the succession plan for senior executives. TSMC's management has maintained a healthy and functional communication with the Board of Directors, has been devoted in executing guidance of the Board, and is dedicated in running the business operations, all to achieve the best interests for TSMC shareholders.",

        "page_content": "The third duty of the Board of Directors is to resolve critical matters, such as capital appropriations, investment activities, dividends, etc.\n\nThe fourth duty of the Board of Directors is to provide guidance to the Company's management team and risk management. In each quarter, TSMC's management reports to the Board on various subjects (including ESG programs) and strategies, and spends substantial time and effort to communicate with the Board. The Board would comment on the risk and probabilities for success of the proposed corporate strategies. The Board also periodically oversees those strategies' implementation and outcomes, and may suggest the management team to make adjustments to the strategic goals and objectives if necessary.\n\n## Nomination and Election of Directors\n\nTSMC envisions the membership of its esteemed Board of Directors to be composed of highly ethical professionals with the necessary knowledge, experience as world-class business leaders and understanding from diverse backgrounds. TSMC Board of Directors members are nominated via rigorous selection processes. TSMC established the 'Guidelines for Nomination of Directors' that set out the procedures and criteria for the nomination, qualification and evaluation of Director candidates to be nominated by the Board of Directors. Also, TSMC developed the 'Corporate Governance Guidelines' that set out the criteria for evaluating director candidates for election by the shareholders shall be based on, among other considerations, their professional knowledge, experience, business judgment, commitment to uphold the Company's core values, as well as reputation in both ethical conduct and leadership. Diversity of backgrounds (including gender, age, and culture) of Board members shall also be considered. The 'Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee' will recommend Independent Director candidates to the Board of Directors for nomination. The independence of each Independent Director candidate is also considered and assessed under relevant laws.\n\nDirectors shall be elected pursuant to the candidate nomination system specified in Article 192-1 of the R.O.C. Company Law. The tenure of office for Directors shall be three years. The independence of each independent director candidate is also considered and assessed under relevant law such as the Taiwan 'Regulations Governing Appointment of Independent Directors and Compliance Matters for Public Companies'. Under R.O.C. law, in which TSMC was incorporated, any shareholders holding one percent or more of our total outstanding common shares may nominate their own candidate to stand for election as a Board member. This democratic mechanism allows our shareholders to become involved in the selection and nomination process of Board candidates. The final slate of candidates is put to the shareholders for voting at the relevant annual shareholders' meeting.\n\nTaking the position that directors who over time have developed increasing knowledge, experience and insight into the semiconductor industry and deeper understanding of the operations of the Company can better perform their duties and provide an increasing contribution and value to the shareholders of the Company. Except as otherwise provided in applicable regulations regarding the tenure limits of independent directors, there are no limits on the number of terms that a director may serve. The Board will, however, assess director tenure on an on-going basis to ensure the Board continues to benefit from new perspectives.\n\n## Directors' Compensation\n\nAccording to TSMC's Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine the salary for the Chairman, Vice Chairman and Directors, taking into account the extent and value of the services provided for the management of the Corporation and the standards of the industry within the R.O.C. and overseas.\n\nTSMC's Articles of Incorporation also state that not more than 0.3 percent of our annual profits may be distributed as compensation to our directors. In addition, directors who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not entitled to receive any director compensation. According to TSMC's Compensation and People Development Committee Charter, the distribution of compensation to directors shall be made in accordance with TSMC's 'Rules for Distribution of Compensation to Directors' based on the following\n\nprinciples: (1) directors who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not entitled to receive compensation; (2) the compensation for Independent Directors may be higher than other directors, as all Independent Directors also serve as members of the Audit and Risk Committee, Compensation and People Development Committee, and Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, and thus participate in the discussions as well as resolutions of related Committee meetings in accordance with the charter of each Committee; and (3) the compensation for overseas Independent Directors may be higher than domestic Independent Directors, as they require additional time to attend quarterly meetings in Taiwan.\n\n## Directors' Professional Qualifications and Independent Directors' Independence Status\n\n| Criteria Name/Title                        | Professional Qualification and Experience                                                                                                                                                                       | Independent Directors' Independence Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |   Number of Other  Taiwanese Public  Companies Concurrently  Serving as an Independent  Director |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mark Liu Chairman                          | For Directors' professional qualification and  experience, please refer to '2.4.1 Information  Regarding Board Members' on page 24-29 of this  Annual Report.

Currently, all ten members of the Board of Directors, including a female board member, represent diverse range of perspectives, including a complementary mix of skills, experiences, and backgrounds such as that from the industry, academia, and in law. These professionals, including a female board member, are citizens from Taiwan, Europe and the U.S. with world-class corporate management experiences. The six Independent Directors constitute 60% of the Board, and there is no marital or is within the second degree of kinship relationship between or among the Directors.

The improvement status in 2023 is as follows:\n- (1)  The TSMC Board set up the 'Audit Committee' and the 'Compensation Committee' in 2002 and 2003 respectively. In order to make our corporate governance more comprehensive, the TSMC Board took a step further in February 2023 to expand and strengthen the functions and responsibilities of its Committees, including renaming the 'Audit Committee' to the 'Audit and Risk Committee', and the renaming the 'Compensation Committee' to the 'Compensation and People Development Committee'. It also established a 'Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee'. (2) The TSMC Board established TSMC's 'Corporate Governance Guidelines' in May 2023.\n\n## Continuing Education/Training of Directors in 2023\n\nThe major training methods of Directors include:\n\n- \u25cf  At quarterly Board meetings, TSMC management presents updates on the Company's business, regulatory developments and other information;\n- \u25cf  The Company arranges speeches on politics, economics, and regulatory compliance, etc.;\n- \u25cf  At quarterly Audit and Risk Committee meetings, TSMC's General Counsel and the Company's independent auditors provide regulatory update reports and legal compliance status; and\n- \u25cf  Directors participate in externally-provided training courses as needed.\n\nIn addition, from time to time, Directors are invited by other parties to give speeches on corporate governance and related topics.\n\n| Name                  | Date     | Host by                                               | Training/Speech Title                                                                                          | Duration   |\n|-----------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Mark Liu (Note)       | 09/06    | SEMI                                                  | SEMICON Taiwan 2023, CEO Summit Keynote speech: Semiconductor Technology in the Era of Artificial Intelligence | 2.5 hours  |\n|                       | 10/02    | Science and Technology in Society (STS) Forum         | Semiconductor Technology in the Era of Artificial Intelligence                                                 | 1 hour     |\n|                       | 11/22    | Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce | Gongliang Memorial Lecture: TSMC in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Era                                       | 1.5 hours  |\n| F.C.

TSMC strictly adheres to the highest standards of integrity and promotes good ethical behavior to sustain the hard-earned trust and confidence of its shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and the general public - constantly and vigilantly promoting integrity, fairness, and transparency in all that we say and do. We have zero tolerance for corruption, refrain from bribery, fraud, abuse or embezzlement of corporate assets, and prohibit the advancement of personal interests at the expense of or in conflict with TSMC. At the heart of our corporate governance culture is the 'TSMC",

        "page_content": "Ethics and Business Conduct Policy' (Ethics Code). The Ethics Code requires that each employee bear a heavy personal responsibility to preserve and to protect TSMC's ethical values and reputation. At the same time, we have formulated the 'TSMC's Supplier Code of Conduct' as well to ensure our suppliers understand and follow the Ethics Code and together fulfill our corporate social responsibilities.\n\nSpecifically, every TSMC employee must adhere to the following:\n\n- \u25cf  Do not advance personal interests at the expense of or in conflict with the Company;\n- \u25cf  Refrain from corruption (including collusion with others), bribery, unfair competition, fraud, extortion, embezzlement, and waste or abuse of corporate assets;\n- \u25cf  Avoid any improper efforts to influence the decisions of anyone, including government officials, agencies, as well as TSMC's customers and suppliers;\n- \u25cf  Do not undertake any practices detrimental to TSMC, to the environment, or to society;\n- \u25cf  Procure all of our raw materials from socially responsible sources;\n- \u25cf  Protect proprietary information of TSMC, our customers and suppliers; and\n- \u25cf  Abide by the letter of all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n\nThe protection of intellectual properties is also an important part of TSMC's Ethics Code. In order to build and sustain an environment of innovation, technology leadership, and sustainable profitable growth, the Ethics Code requires that TSMC promotes business relationships founded upon an unwavering respect for the intellectual property rights, proprietary information and trade secrets of TSMC, our customers, and others.\n\nWith regarding to public disclosures, TSMC's officers, especially our CEO, CFO, and General Counsel, with oversight from our Board, are responsible for the full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable financial accounting and financial disclosure in reports and documents filed by the Company with securities authorities and in all TSMC public communications and disclosures. TSMC has a variety of measures in place to ensure compliance with these disclosure obligations.\n\nAny modification to the Ethics Code requires the approval of our Audit and Risk Committee to ensure our ethics compliance program is independently reviewed against corporate best practices.\n\n## Ethics Code Implementation\n\nHigh Standard of Ethics Culture: Our ethics program is implemented in four ways by all of TSMC's Board members, officers, and employees. First, the TSMC management team sets the 'tone from top' by acting in accordance with the Ethics Code so that they will be an example to all stakeholders. Second, working-level managers are responsible for ensuring their staff's understanding of and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Third, TSMC encourages an environment of open communications in discussing any questions related to the Ethics Code. Any employee may consult his or her direct supervisors, Human Resources or Legal to obtain timely advice. Lastly, TSMC requires all employees to stay vigilant and report any noncompliance by anyone to their supervisors, the function head of Human Resources, the responsible corporate senior management appointed by CEO that oversees the Ombudsman system, or to the Chairman of the Company's Audit and Risk Committee directly.\n\nSelf-Assessment of All Departments and Employees: Self-assessment of all departments and employees is an important part of our ethics compliance program. All TSMC departments and subsidiaries are required to conduct Control Self-Assessment (CSA) tests annually in reviewing employees' awareness of the Ethics Code, and to evaluate and strengthen the effectiveness of internal control related to the Ethics Code. The CSA results are reviewed to track the results of our compliance program. In addition, all employees must disclose any matters that cause, or may cause, actual or potential conflict of interest. In addition to this proactive disclosure requirement, employees with specific job grades or job responsibilities must annually declare any relationships that may constitute a conflict of interest, which enables TSMC to take necessary arrangements and report the results to the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nInternal Auditing: The Internal Auditor of TSMC plays a critical role in ensuring the Company's compliance with the Ethics Code and relevant rules and regulations. To ensure that our financial, managerial, and operating information is accurate, reliable, and timely and that our employees' actions are in compliance with applicable policies, standards, procedures, laws and regulations, our\n\nInternal Auditor conducts audits of various control points within the Company in accordance with its annual audit plan approved by the Board of Directors and subsequently reports its audit findings and remedial issues to the Board and management on a regular basis.\n\nTraining and Promotion: To promote awareness to our employees of their responsibilities under the Ethics Code, we publish our Ethics Code and related policies and documents on our intranet and, provide training courses, posters, emails, and other diversified ways to advocate the Company's core values and compliance system. In terms of training courses, TSMC not only provides annual online course on the Ethics Code and requires all employees to complete the training, as well as face-to-face training courses delving into more specific ethics-related topics for targeted employees. In 2023, there were 73,034 attendances that completed the 'Annual Ethics and Compliance Training Course' (mandatory 0.5 hour online course) at TSMC and its subsidiaries, both completion rate and exam pass rate reaching 100%.\n\nIn addition to our internal compliance efforts, we expect and assist our business partners such as customers and suppliers, and any other entities with whom we deal (include consultants or third party agents who act for or on behalf of TSMC) to recognize and understand TSMC's ethical standards to fulfill our responsibilities as a corporate citizen. For instance, we require all of our suppliers to declare in writing that they will respect and comply with TSMC's ethical standards and culture. TSMC is a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA, formerly the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, EICC). In addition to adopting the RBA Code of Conduct at all of its facilities, TSMC applied the RBA's standards to enhance our audit program of our suppliers and relevant business partners. We provide training and communicate our ethical culture to our suppliers through live seminars and online programs to prevent any unethical conduct and detect any sign of Ethics Code violations. In 2023, we held a sustainable supply chain ESH forum to share/exchange practical experiences on topics such as the Ethics Code, environmental protection, and occupational safety. We also exchange views on appropriate business conduct and TSMC's ethical standards and implementation status with our customers as part of customer audit programs.\n\n## Reporting Channels and Whistleblower Protection\n\nTSMC has established and published its 'Complaint Policy and Procedure for Certain Accounting & Legal Matters' and pledges to comply with the relevant regulations in the policy. Open and multiple reporting channels are available for internal and external voices to protect the rights and interests of stakeholders and the Company. All reported incidents collected from reporting channels inside or outside of TSMC are properly recorded and traced. TSMC also prohibits any form of retaliation by providing proper protection for any individual who in good faith reports a suspected violation or participates in an investigation. In 2023, the Ethics Committee held a total of five meetings to examine major reported incidents under investigation.\n\nTSMC investigates each individual case according to its characteristics through specific divisions, and treats every received case seriously, carefully, and effectively to ensure the accuracy of the investigation. The TSMC Ethics Committee will evaluate each case to determine whether it is an exceptional case or whether it results from systemic issues of insufficient awareness in ethics. This allows TSMC to continue evaluating whether it is necessary to improve its management and internal control procedures. Awareness such as emails to employees describing the violations and disciplinary actions in each quarter are conducted to promote employees' awareness and avoid recurrence of similar incidents.\n\nIn 2023, TSMC did not receive any reports related to insider trading, money laundering, or other finance, accounting or antitrust matters, nor did we receive any complaints concerning breach of customer privacy and loss of customer data, or any material regulatory violations (where a fine exceeds NT$1 million), including non-monetary sanctions.\n\nIn 2023, the incidents reported through the Audit and Risk Committee Whistleblower System, Ombudsman System, and Irregular Business Conduct Reporting System totaled 348. Among them, 218 cases were related to people management/employee relations, 117 cases were categorized as others (e.g., asking personal questions or private matters), and 13 cases were related to ethics. Five incidents were verified upon investigation and determined for disciplinary action by the Ethics Committee. In 2023, TSMC leveraged the five violations to strengthen ethics promotion for employees and suppliers in supplier-related activities. Below are the summary of reported incidents and reporting area.",

Each violator of the Ethics Code (or relevant regulations), for employees, in addition to affecting individual annual performance evaluation, will be severely disciplined to the full extent of our policies and the law, up to and including immediate dismissal, or termination of business relationship for suppliers, and judicial prosecution as appropriate.\n\n## 3.5.1  Corporate Conduct and Ethics

To further enhance relevant employees' awareness of the export control requirements, in 2023 TSMC altogether provided 9 face-to-face meeting sessions and a targeted on-line learning program to employees in relevant functions.\n- \u25cf  Supplier Management: TSMC shares and exchanges practical experiences with suppliers with sales offices in Taiwan by holding a sustainable supply chain ESH forums on topics such as Ethics Code, environmental protection and occupational safety. In total, 359 attendees from 117 suppliers participated (including through on-line meeting) in these activities.\n- \u25cf  Conflict-Free Supply Chain: As a recognized global leader in the Hi-tech supply chain, we acknowledge our corporate social responsibility to strive to procure conflict-free minerals in an effort to recognize humanitarian and ethical social principles that protect the dignity of all persons. Meanwhile, we have implemented a series of compliance safeguards in accordance with industry leading practices, requesting suppliers to fill in the 'Conflict Minerals Reporting Template' and sign the 'TSMC Conflict-Free Minerals Declaration' every year. TSMC will continuously make progress to ensure a conflict-free supply chain.\n- \u25cf  Personal Data Protection: Because of the importance of personal data protection, TSMC periodically reviews the Rules of Privacy and Personal Data Protection and external and internal privacy policies to identify the needs to update such documents. Based on current personal data protection laws and risks, TSMC conducts an annual training on privacy and personal data protection to enhance employees' awareness and compliance. In addition, the Personal Data Protection Committee composed of Legal, Human Resources, and IT divisions convene on an annual basis to assist the implementation of and monitoring compliance with the rules.\n- \u25cf  Antitrust Compliance: Based on annual antitrust risk assessment results, TSMC identified functions with potential higher risk from an antitrust perspective. To enhance targeted functions' employee awareness of the importance of competition and antitrust laws and issues during daily operations, TSMC established antitrust training programs and conducted several antitrust trainings, via either face-to-face or on-line training sessions, for global sales personnel at Taiwan, North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Japan and mainland China areas, and employees in other relevant departments.\n- \u25cf  Insider Trading Compliance: To implement insider trading regulatory compliance and to strengthen employees' awareness and compliance with, in 2023, TSMC designated managers at Human Resources, Finance, Business Development and other Organizations as trainees - a total of 888 managers completed this insider trading on-line program (0.5 hour-length course), both completion rate  and exam pass rate reaching 100%.\n\n## 3.7 Internal Control System Execution Status\n\n## 3.7.1 Statement of Internal Control System\n\n## Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\n\n## Statement of Internal Control System\n\nFebruary 6, 2024\n\nBased on the findings of a self-assessment, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) states the following with regard to its internal control system during the year 2023:\n\n- 1.  TSMC's Board of Directors and management are responsible for establishing, implementing, and maintaining an adequate internal control system. Internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance over the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations (including profitability, performance and safeguarding of assets), reliability, timeliness, transparency and regulatory compliance of our reporting, and compliance with applicable rulings, laws and regulations.\n- 2.  An internal control system has inherent limitations. No matter how perfectly designed, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable assurance of accomplishing its stated objectives. Moreover, the effectiveness of an internal control system may be subject to changes due to extenuating circumstances beyond our control. Nevertheless, our internal control system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and TSMC takes immediate remedial actions in response to any identified deficiencies.\n- 3.  TSMC evaluates the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control system based on the criteria provided in the Regulations Governing the Establishment of Internal Control Systems by Public Companies (herein below, the 'Regulations'). The criteria adopted by the Regulations identify five key components of managerial internal control: (1) control environment, (2) risk assessment, (3) control activities, (4) information and communication, and (5) monitoring activities. Each component also includes several items which can be found in the Regulations.\n- 4.  TSMC has evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control system according to the aforesaid Regulations.\n- 5.  Based on the findings of such evaluation, TSMC believes that, on December 31, 2023, it has maintained, in all material respects, an effective internal control system (that includes the supervision and management of our subsidiaries), to provide reasonable assurance over our operational effectiveness and efficiency, reliability, timeliness, transparency and regulatory compliance of reporting, and compliance with applicable rulings, laws and regulations.\n- 6.  This Statement is an integral part of TSMC's annual report and prospectus, and will be made public. Any falsehood, concealment, or other illegality in the content made public will entail legal liability under Articles 20, 32, 171, and 174 of the Securities and Exchange Law.\n- 7.  This Statement was passed by the Board of Directors in their meeting held on February 6, 2024, with none of the ten attending directors expressing dissenting opinions, and the remainder all affirming the content of this Statement.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMark Liu,\n\nChairman\n\nC.C.

The Company's profits may be distributed by way of cash dividend, stock dividend, or a combination of cash and stock. Pursuant to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, distributions of profits shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. In addition, the ratio for stock dividends shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution. Distribution of stock dividends is subject to approval by the R.O.C.

During the period when the granted RSAs are deposited in a trust/custody account, each executive must enter into an agreement authorizing the  Company to, among others, negotiate, execute, modify, extend, rescind, and terminate the trust/custody agreement with the trustee/custodian, and give  instructions to deliver, use, and dispose of any of the properties under the trust/custody, on their behalf, with full power and authority.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Treatment of the Restricted Shares for  Which the Grantee Fails to Meet the  Vesting Conditions after Receiving or  Subscribing to the Shares | 1.  The Company will reclaim the granted RSAs and cancel the same at no extra cost to the Company, where an executive fails to meet the vesting conditions. 2.  Voluntary Separation, separation with a severance, or involuntary discharge: Any unvested RSAs will be forfeited on the effective date of separation due to  a voluntary separation, separation with a severance, or involuntary discharge of such executives. The Company will reclaim the RSAs granted to them and  cancel the same at no extra cost to the Company. 3.  Leave Without Pay: All the rights and obligations in connection with the unvested RSAs will not be affected as a result of executives taking extended leave  without pay. However, the actual number of shares that may be vested will not only be calculated according to the vesting conditions but also be prorated  based on the number of months of their service during the year prior to the applicable vesting day. If such executives are on leave without pay on any  vesting day, it shall be deemed that they fail to meet the vesting conditions, and the Company will reclaim the RSAs granted to them and cancel the same  at no extra cost to the Company. 4.  Retirement: All the rights and obligations in connection with the unvested RSAs will not be affected as a result of an employee's retirement. However, the  actual number of shares that may be vested shall be calculated according to the vesting condition, and the performance rating granted to them shall be  deemed 'S'. 5.  Employment Termination Due to Death or Physical Disability Caused by Occupational Accidents: The unvested RSAs shall be deemed immediately vested in  the case of death or physical disability due to an occupational accident, where the RSAs vested shall be based on the assumption that the Company's TSR  equals to the TSR of S&P 500 IT Index and there is no further adjustment for the Company's ESG achievements. In the case of death, the respective heir(s)  may apply for entitlement to those inheritable shares after completing all necessary legal procedures and providing relevant supporting documents.

Upon the grant of the RSAs, the RSAs shall be deposited in a trust/custody account. Before the vesting conditions are fulfilled, the employees cannot request the trustee/custodian to return to them the RSAs for any reasons or by any means.\n\n- 2.  During each vesting period, no employees granted RSAs may sell, pledge, transfer, give to another person, create any encumbrance on, or otherwise dispose of, any shares under the unvested RSAs.\n- 3.  Subject to the restrictions mentioned above, the rights of the employees with regard to the unvested RSAs granted under these Rules before the fulfillment of the vesting conditions, including but not limited to the entitlement to any distribution regarding dividends, bonuses and capital reserve, and the subscription right of the new shares issued for any capital increase, are the same as those of holders of common shares of the Company. The relevant matters shall be handled in accordance with the RSA trust/custody agreement.\n- 4.  Before the vesting conditions are fulfilled, the attendance, proposal rights, speech rights, voting rights and any other shareholder rights shall be exercised by the engaged trustee/custodian on the employees' behalf.\n- 5.  During each vesting period, if the Company conducts a capital reduction for cash return, capital reduction for loss offset, or other non-statutory capital reduction, the unvested RSAs shall be cancelled proportionally by the ratio of such capital reduction. If the Company conducts a capital reduction for cash return, the returned cash shall be deposited in a trust/custody account and shall not be delivered to the employees until the vesting conditions are fulfilled; otherwise, the cash will be returned to the Company.\n\n(Continued)\n\n0.00814%\n\n- 1.  The RSAs granted to an employee can only be vested if (a) the employee remains employed by the Company or the Company's subsidiaries on the last date of each vesting period; (b) during the vesting period, the employee may not breach any agreement with the Company or the Company's subsidiaries or violate the Company's or the Company's subsidiaries' work rules; and (c) certain employee performance metrics (a year-end performance rating of at least 'S' (Note) or above for the year immediately preceding the expiration of each vesting period) and the Company's business performance metrics are met. (Note: 'S' stands for 'Successful')\n- 2.  The maximum percentage of granted RSAs that may be vested each year shall be as follows: one-year anniversary of the grant: 50%; two-year anniversary of the grant: 25%; and three-year anniversary of the grant: 25%; provided that the actual percentage and number of the RSAs to be vested in each year will be calculated based on the achievement of the Company's business performance metrics, as detailed in the following points.\n- 3.  For eligible executive officers of the Company: The maximum number of RSAs that may be vested in each year will be set as 110%, among which 100% will be subject to a calculation based on the Company's relative TSR (Note) achievement (see table below) to determine the number of RSAs to be vested; this number will be further subject to a modifier to increase or decrease up to 10% based on the Compensation Committee's evaluation of the Company's ESG achievements. The number of shares so calculated should be rounded down to the nearest integral.\n\n## The Company's TSR Relative to the TSR of S&P 500 IT Index\n\nRatio of Shares to Be Vested\n\nAbove the Index by X percentage points\n\n50% + X * 2.5%, with the maximum of 100%\n\nEqual to the Index\n\n50%\n\nBelow the Index by X percentage points\n\n50% - X * 2.5%, with the minimum of 0%\n\nNote: TSR: Total Shareholder Return (including capital gains and dividends)\n\n- 4.  For eligible employees who are not executive officers of the Company and the Company's subsidiaries: The number of RSAs to be vested in each year will be calculated in accordance with the below table based on the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year prior to the vesting year. The number of shares so calculated should be rounded down to the nearest integral.\n\n|                         | Threshold   | Target   | Weighting   | Ratio of Shares to Be Vested                                            |\n|-------------------------|-------------|----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenue Growth          | 10%         | 15%      | One-third   | \u25cf  < Threshold: 0% \u25cf  = Threshold: 50% \u25cf  \u2267 Target: 100%                |\n| Gross Margin            | 50%         | 53%      | One-third   | \u25cf  < Threshold: 0% \u25cf  = Threshold: 50% \u25cf  \u2267 Target: 100%                |\n| Return on Equity  (ROE) | 20%         | 25%      | One-third   | \u25cf  Between Threshold and Target: as calculated  by interpolation method |\n\n2,110,000 shares\n\n0 share\n\nEmployee Restricted Stock Awards for Year 2022\n\n07/25/2022 /3,065,000 shares\n\n| Custody of the Restricted Employee  Shares                                                                                                    | 1.

Upon the grant of the RSAs, the RSAs shall be deposited in a trust/custody account. Before the vesting conditions are fulfilled, the employees cannot request the trustee/custodian to return to them the RSAs for any reasons or by any means.\n- 2.  During each vesting period, no employees granted RSAs may sell, pledge, transfer, give to another person, create any encumbrance on, or otherwise dispose of, any shares under the unvested RSAs.\n- 3.  Subject to the restrictions mentioned above, the rights of the employees with regard to the unvested RSAs granted under these Rules before the fulfillment of the vesting conditions, including but not limited to the entitlement to any distribution regarding dividends, bonuses and capital reserve, and the subscription right of the new shares issued for any capital increase, are the same as those of holders of common shares of the Company. The relevant matters shall be handled in accordance with the RSA trust/custody agreement.\n- 4.  Before the vesting conditions are fulfilled, the attendance, proposal rights, speech rights, voting rights and any other shareholder rights shall be exercised by the engaged trustee/custodian on the employees' behalf.\n- 5.  During each vesting period, if the Company conducts a capital reduction for cash return, capital reduction for loss offset, or other non-statutory capital reduction, the unvested RSAs shall be cancelled proportionally by the ratio of such capital reduction. If the Company conducts a capital reduction for cash return, the returned cash shall be deposited in a trust/custody account and shall not be delivered to the employees until the vesting conditions are fulfilled; otherwise, the cash will be returned to the Company.\n\n(Continued)\n\n0%\n\n- 1.  The RSAs granted to an employee can only be vested if (a) the employee remains employed by the Company or the Company's subsidiaries on the last date of each vesting period; (b) during the vesting period, the employee may not breach any agreement with the Company or the Company's subsidiaries or violate the Company's or the Company's subsidiaries' work rules; and (c) certain employee performance metrics (a year-end performance rating of at least 'S' (Note) or above for the year immediately preceding the expiration of each vesting period) and the Company's business performance metrics are met. (Note: 'S' stands for 'Successful')\n- 2.  The maximum percentage of granted RSAs that may be vested each year shall be as follows: one-year anniversary of the grant: 50%; two-year anniversary of the grant: 25%; and three-year anniversary of the grant: 25%; provided that the actual percentage and number of the RSAs to be vested in each year will be calculated based on the achievement of the Company's business performance metrics, as detailed in the following points.\n- 3.  For eligible executive officers of the Company: The maximum number of RSAs that may be vested in each year will be set as 110%, among which 100% will be subject to a calculation based on the Company's relative TSR (Note) achievement (see table below) to determine the number of RSAs to be vested; this number will be further subject to a modifier to increase or decrease up to 10% based on the Compensation and People Development Committee's evaluation of the Company's ESG achievements.

For eligible employees who are not executive officers of the Company and the Company's subsidiaries: The number of RSAs to be vested in each year will be calculated in accordance with the below table based on the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year prior to the vesting year.

Competition continues to intensify in the face of increasing industry consolidation and the commoditization of technology at more mature, conventional levels, and thus semiconductor companies must find ways to keep innovating in order to survive and prosper. One way to promote innovation is through active collaboration with external partners. At TSMC this is known as Open Innovation \u00ae , an 'outside in' approach to complement traditional 'inside out' methods. TSMC has chosen this path to stimulate innovation via its OIP initiative, which is a key part of the TSMC Grand Alliance.\n\nThe OIP initiative is a comprehensive design technology infrastructure that encompasses all critical IC implementation areas to lower design barriers and improve design cycle times and first-time silicon success rates. OIP promotes the speedy implementation of innovation within the semiconductor design community and its ecosystem partners using TSMC's process technology and OIP partners' solutions in design implementation and backend services.\n\nCrucial to OIP are ecosystem interfaces and collaborative components initiated and supported by TSMC to empower innovation throughout the supply chain and, in turn, drive the creation and sharing of new revenue and profits. TSMC's active accuracy assurance (AAA) initiative is key to OIP, providing the precision and quality required by the ecosystem interfaces and collaborative components.\n\nTSMC's Open Innovation \u00ae model brings together the creative thinking of customers and partners under the common goal of shortening each of the following: design time, time to volume production, time to market and, ultimately, time to revenue. The model features:\n\n- \u25cf  The foundry segment's earliest and most comprehensive electronic design automation (EDA) certification program, delivering timely design tool enhancement required by new process technologies.\n- \u25cf  The foundry segment's largest, most comprehensive and most robust silicon-proven IP (intellectual properties) and library portfolio.\n- \u25cf  Alliances that enable semiconductor designing in the Cloud for the benefit of scalability, agility and flexibility to meet various customer requirements for work models.\n- \u25cf  Alliances that provide design services to support customer demand regarding resources and capabilities, depending on the scope and various requirements in the semiconductor design stages and value chain.\n- \u25cf  Alliances to enable customers' system-level designs for integrating multiple chips/chiplets in 3D stacking and advanced packaging.\n- \u25cf  Participants consisting of 14 EDA partners, seven Cloud partners, 39 IP partners, 26 design center alliance (DCA) partners, nine value chain aggregator (VCA) partners and 22 partners in the new 3DFabric \u00ae Alliance.\n- \u25cf  A partner management portal to facilitate communication with ecosystem partners for efficient business productivity designed with a highly intuitive interface and accessible via a direct link from TSMC-Online.\n\nTSMC and partners work together proactively and engage much earlier and deeper than ever before in order to address the mounting design challenges of advanced technology nodes. Through this early and intensive collaboration, OIP is able to deliver the needed design infrastructure with timely enhancement of EDA tools, early availability of critical IPs and quality design services when customers need them. Taking full advantage of the process technologies once they reach production-ready maturity is critical to customer success. Hence, this helps achieve DTCO among TSMC process technologies, OIP design solutions and customer product designs.\n\nThe 2023 annual OIP Ecosystem Forum in North America demonstrated how TSMC and its ecosystem partners jointly develop design solutions on top of TSMC's advanced technologies through OIP. At the forum, TSMC made key presentations on its comprehensive 3nm technology family that continues the full-node PPA scaling trend, together with the offering of high-density and high-performance libraries and design solutions to support smartphone and high performance computing (HPC) design applications. The Company also made presentations on the readiness of analog cells that can help boost analog IP yields and analog design productivity, with the design solutions to enable EDA and design flow automation to support analog design migration. In response to the rising demand for more complex system level designs, TSMC collaborates with 3DFabric \u00ae alliance partners of 3DIC expertise in EDA, IP, DCA/VCA, memory, substrate, outsourcing semiconductor assembly testing (OSAT) and testing to provide\n\n3D chip stacking and 2.5D advanced packaging design solutions, together with EDA tools compliant to the 3Dblox open standard to facilitate integration of multiple chips/ chiplets in system-level designs using 3DFabric \u00ae technology services which include TSMC-SoIC \u00ae , InFO and CoWoS \u00ae .

The survey aimed to understand the strengths and opportunities for continuous improvement in employee experience at TSMC and to develop action plans that retain talent. The survey participants included global TSMC employees and its subsidiaries, except for VisEra due to its different industrial background. Overall, 65,123 employees participated in the survey, representing 89% of all TSMC employees.\n\nBased on the survey results in 2023, TSMC is perceived by its employees as possessing strong competitiveness in the market, exhibiting agility in responding to market changes, and being adept at delivering innovative products and services that create value for its customers. TSMC will continue to enhance the following 3 aspects:\n\n- \u25cf  Encourage colleagues to proactively share their ideas through an open management model in order to create a mutually respectful environment.\n- \u25cf  Enhance colleagues' sense of belonging and achievement by unleashing their potential, allowing them to enjoy their work, continuously learn, and grow.\n- \u25cf  Motivate and retain talent by providing more non-monetary rewards.\n\nTSMC's turnover rate was 3.7% in 2023 compared to 6.7% in 2022, both within a healthy range of less than 10%.\n\n## 5.6.11 Retirement Policy\n\nTSMC established its statutory defined benefit plan and supervisory committee of labor retirement reserve according to the Labor Standards Act, and also set up its statutory defined contribution plan according to Labor Pension Act, which became effective starting July 1, 2005. For each region, TSMC also established pension plans according to local standards and regulations. The previously mentioned supervisory committee not only holds quarterly meetings but also supervises affairs in connection with labor's retirement reserve fund. To meet legal requirements for disclosure of financial reporting and ensure sufficient funding levels, TSMC makes contributions based statutory requirements and also engages an actuarial consulting firm to assess the valuation of the defined benefit plan. Please refer to page 45-47 of the attached financial report for details. Thanks to the Company's sound financial condition, it is able to ensure the future viability of employee retirement benefits and solid pension contributions and payments, which encourages employees to make long-term career plans with and further deepen their commitment to TSMC.\n\n## 5.7 Material Contracts\n\nTSMC is not currently a party to any material contracts, other than those entered into in the ordinary course of its business.

Specifically, the Company does not safety related breaches or lapses, non-compliance with laws and regulations, or illegal acts such as fraud, bribery and corruption.\n\nFollowing a five-step risk management process - identification, assessment, response, monitoring and review, risks assessments are performed by key functional units to form an enterprise-level risk map and mitigation plans, which are presented to the Audit and Risk Committee. This process is supported by ongoing education and awareness efforts in fostering a risk-aware culture and building risk competencies. TSMC recognizes that its systems and processes provide reasonable but not absolute assurance and hence continually strives to improve its ability to manage and respond to risks and opportunities that remain relevant and effective.\n\n## \u25cf  TSMC's Key Risks\n\n| Strategic Risks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Operational Risks                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u25cf Industry developments \u25cf Changes in technology  \u25cf Decrease in demand and average selling price \u25cf Competition \u25cf Investment and capacity expansion                                                                                                                                                         | \u25cf  Natural and man-made disasters \u25cf  Project management, construction of new fabs \u25cf  Sales concentration \u25cf  Purchasing concentration \u25cf  Intellectual property rights \u25cf  Mergers and acquisitions |\n| Financial Risks \u25cf  regulations or implementation of new tax laws \u25cf                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | \u25cf  IT security \u25cf  Recruiting quality personnel \u25cf  Future R&D plans and expected R&D spending \u25cf                                                                                                   |\n| Economic risks including interest rate fluctuation, foreign exchange volatility, inflation, and amendments to tax  External financing \u25cf  High-risk or highly leveraged investments; lending, endorsements, and guarantees for other parties; and financial  derivative transactions \u25cf  Impairment charges | Change in corporate reputation and impact on the Company's crisis management \u25cf  Change in management                                                                                             |\n\n## Risk Management Governance Structure\n\nRisk management at TSMC involves both the Board of Directors and management in an effort to embed sound risk management practices in business decisions and operations across the Company. The Board of Directors is responsible for the governance of risk and has authorized the Audit and Risk Committee to review TSMC's ERM framework. At the managerial level, risk management governance structure includes Risk Management Steering Committee, Risk Management Executive Council, taskforces and the risk management division.\n\nAssisting the Audit and Risk Committee in establishing and overseeing a proactive and effective risk management system, the risk management division works with each function and fab in applying the ERM framework to assess and mitigate risks throughout TSMC by monitoring, implementing risk related policies and guidelines, as well as taking initiatives to support the implementation of ERM framework. Every six months, the risk management division reports to the Audit and Risk Committee on TSMC's key risks and mitigation efforts. The Audit and Risk Committee's chairperson then reports to the Board of Directors on the current risk profile and risk mitigation measures being taken.\n\n## \u25cf  Risk Management Governance Structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk management is a responsibility shared by both management and employees. All employees are required to be competent and accountable for managing risks related to their area of responsibility with clear risk ownership. TSMC Risk Management Academy is set up with the aim to equip and raise risk competencies for all levels of employees, including Board of Directors and management in support of an effective risk-aware culture embedding risk management as part of performance appraisal process promotes risk accountability and ownership. The roles and responsibilities of the risk management governance structure are defined as below:\n\n## Risk Management Steering Committee\n\n- \u25cf  Advises the Board in determining overall risk appetite, tolerance, strategy and resource allocation, taking into account current and prospective macroeconomic, technological, regulatory, environmental and social developments and trends.\n- \u25cf  Reviews and oversees the applicability and performances of the risk management framework, policy and procedures.\n- \u25cf  Provides advice and assurance to the Board by adopting a holistic view of the key risks that TSMC is exposed to and approves the prioritization of risk mitigations.\n- \u25cf  Sets the tone toward risk management from the top, provides sponsorship to initiatives and activities to nurture the desired risk culture, awareness and capabilities of effectively and sufficiently managing key risks and new type of risks, including clarifying risk ownership.\n- \u25cf  Ensures that risk management is incorporated into strategic business development and operational planning, day-to-day management and decision making.\n- \u25cf  Advises the Board on proposed transactions to address strategic risks and capitalize on opportunities.\n\n## Risk Management Executive Council\n\n- \u25cf  Identifies potential and emerging risks that may impact TSMC in achieving its objectives and/or the continued effectiveness and efficiency of its business operations.\n- \u25cf  Conducts risk assessments, defines mitigation plans, including incident management plans, provides sponsorship and allocates sufficient resources to enable timely and effective mitigation.\n- \u25cf  Leads and drives cross-functional taskforces, meetings or other activities to ensure that risks are adequately and effectively mitigated, including collaboration with risk management division and various other parties.\n- \u25cf  Defines key risk indicators (KRIs) to proactively monitor risk dynamics and respond in a timely and effective manner.\n- \u25cf  Builds a risk-aware culture and raises risk competency in fabs and divisions, including but not limited to training, exercises and continuous improvements.\n- \u25cf  Defines and facilitates action plans based on root cause analysis to prevent reoccurrences of major incidents, high-risk events and major findings raised from internal and external reviews.\n- \u25cf  Reports to the risk management steering committee on the progress, effectiveness, and lessons learned, and implements the decisions made by the committee.\n\n## Risk Management Taskforce\n\n- \u25cf  Identifies and assesses potential risks and threats that may prevent TSMC from achieving its business objectives and deploys appropriate mitigation measures.\n- \u25cf  Plans and executes risk prevention and mitigation in accordance with various scenarios.\n- \u25cf  Organizes and/or participates in cross-functional meetings, in addressing risks that span multiple disciplines or divisions/ fabs.\n- \u25cf  Participates in the implementation and execution of risk management initiatives and activities.\n- \u25cf  Reviews the investigation of major incidents, high-risk events and major findings raised from internal and external checks for division.

The Company is cognizant of the major risks of natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage, pandemic, cyberattacks, supply chain disruption, geopolitical tension, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment, and shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water, electricity and natural gas that could disrupt operations.\n\nTo mitigate the operational impact of crisis events, the risk management division implements pre-crisis risk assessment, response procedures and recovery plans. Exercises and drills are also conducted to validate emergency responses, crisis management, business continuity plans to enhance operational\n\npreparedness. In major incidents or crisis events, the crisis management guidelines are followed. The Central Crisis Command Centre (C4), headed by the CEO and comprised of senior executives across key functions, provides guidance and decision-making to ensure a constant readiness-to-respond capability, including timely responses and communication to key stakeholders.\n\n## 6.3.2 Strategic Risks\n\n## Risks Associated with Changes in Technology and Industry\n\n## \u25cf  Industry Developments\n\nThe electronics industries and semiconductor market are cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid fluctuations in product demand, which could impact TSMC's semiconductor foundry business. Variations in customer order levels may result in volatility in the Company's revenue and earnings.\n\nFrom time to time, the electronics and semiconductor industries have experienced significant and occasionally prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity. Because TSMC is, and will continue to be, dependent on the demand of electronics and semiconductor companies for its services, periods of downturns and overcapacity in the general electronics and semiconductor industries could lead to reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC's services. If TSMC is not able take appropriate actions, such as reducing its costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand, the Company's revenue, margins and earnings will likely suffer during periods of downturns and overcapacity.\n\n## \u25cf  Changes in Technology\n\nThe semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing. TSMC competes by developing process technologies using increasingly advanced nodes and manufacturing products with more functions. The Company also competes by developing new derivative technologies. If TSMC does not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or if the Company's competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional technologies, TSMC may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. For example, the global surge in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) has had a significant impact on customer demand for advanced semiconductor chips and the market dynamics in TSMC's industry; thus, TSMC's ability to continuously develop relevant\n\ntechnologies, products and services to meet these customer needs will be critical for the Company to effectively compete in this space. TSMC also believes that the effective use of AI in its internal operations is important to its long-term success. As the AI technologies are rapidly evolving, if TSMC is unable to deploy new AI technologies in its internal operations as effectively as its competitors, it may hurt the Company's competitive position. In addition, TSMC's customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are launched into the market. If TSMC is unable to meet these shorter product time-to-market, it risks losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the shift of the global technology market to consumer driven products, such as smartphones, and increasing competition and concentration of customers (all further discussed among these risk factors).\n\nAlso, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced technologies impose challenges for achieving expected product quality and product yield. If TSMC fails to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business or customer trust. If TSMC is unable to overcome the above factors, it may become less competitive and its revenue may decline significantly.\n\nRegarding the response measures for the above-mentioned risks, please refer to '2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy' on page 19-21 of this Annual Report.\n\n## \u25cf  IT Security\n\nEven though TSMC has established a comprehensive internet and computing security network, the Company cannot guarantee that its computing systems which control or maintain vital corporate functions, such as manufacturing operations and enterprise accounting, would be completely immune to crippling cyberattacks. In the event of a serious cyberattack, TSMC's systems may lose important corporate data or its production lines may be shut down pending the resolution of such attack. Major cyberattacks could also lead to loss or divulgence of trade secrets and other sensitive information, such as proprietary information of its customers and other stakeholders and personal information of its employees. While TSMC seeks to continuously review and assess its cybersecurity policies and procedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, it can't guarantee that it will not be susceptible to new and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. For example, as\n\nAI continues to evolve, cyber-attackers could also use AI to develop malicious codes and sophisticated phishing attempts.\n\nMalicious hackers may also try to introduce computer viruses, corrupted software or ransomware into TSMC's network systems to disrupt its operations, blackmail the Company to regain control of its computing systems, or spy on it for sensitive information. These attacks may result in TSMC having to pay damages for its delayed or disrupted orders or incur significant expenses in implementing remedial and improvement measures to further enhance its cybersecurity network, and may also expose the Company to significant legal liabilities arising from or related to legal proceedings or regulatory investigations associated with such breaches.\n\nTSMC has experienced in the past, and may in the future be subject to attacks by malicious software. TSMC has implemented and continually updated rigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent and minimize harm caused by such attacks. Such measures include establishing advanced portable virus scanning tools and new fab tool virus scanning including internal computer scanning to protect fab equipment, strengthening GIGAFAB \u00ae network architecture and network controls to prevent computer viruses from spreading among tools and fabs, installing advanced malware defense solutions for critical computers, building a defense shield in the Cloud, including new Cloud solution architecture to secure internet access, and enhancing Cloud solutions and public website security policy and framework, adopting advanced solutions against distributed denial-of-service attacks, introducing new technology for data protection, enhancing and certifying office computer security compliance, improving email phishing defense and implementing employee awareness testing. TSMC also established an integrated and automatic security operation platform, enabled the automation of cybersecurity event detection and response, enhanced internal security assessment automation, conducted external red team testing and practiced responses to ransomware attacks. For supply chain risk reduction, through collaboration, TSMC helps major suppliers improve their security, shares best practices at industry security events, and conducts supplier security onsite audits. Moreover, TSMC has collaborated with the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute (SEMI) to set up a Semiconductor Cybersecurity Committee to promote security standards (SEMI E187) as well as security assessment methodology for improving the resilience of the semiconductor supply chain, an action that was recognized by a 2023 SEMI International",

        "page_content": "Standards award. While these ongoing enhancements further improve Company's cybersecurity defense solutions, there can be no assurance that the Company is immune to cyberattacks.\n\nIn addition, TSMC employs certain third-party service providers for itself and its affiliates worldwide with whom it needs to share highly sensitive and confidential information to enable them to provide the relevant services. While TSMC requires such third-party service providers to strictly fulfill the confidentiality and/or internet security requirements in its service agreements with them, there is no assurance that each of them will comply with such obligations. Moreover, such third-party service providers may also be susceptible to cyberattacks. If TSMC or its service providers are not able to timely resolve the respective technical difficulties caused by such cyberattacks, or ensure the integrity and availability of its data (and data belonging to its customers and other third parties) or maintain control of its or its service providers' computing systems, the Company's commitments to its customers and other stakeholders may be materially impaired and its results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation may also be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## Risks Associated with Decrease in Demand and Average Selling Price\n\nA vast majority of the Company's revenue is derived from customers who use TSMC's products in high performance computing ('HPC'), smartphones, IoT, automotive, and digital consumer electronics. Any deterioration in or a slowdown in the growth of such end markets resulting in a substantial decrease in the demand for overall global semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC's products and services, could adversely affect the Company's revenue. Further, semiconductor manufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed cost assets once they are in operation. Because the Company owns most of its manufacturing capacities, a significant portion of its operating costs is fixed. In general, these costs do not decline when customer demand or TSMC's capacity utilization rates drop, and thus declines in customer demand, among other factors, may significantly decrease TSMC's margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, which can improve TSMC's margins. In addition, the historical trend of declining average selling prices ('ASP') of end-use applications places downward pressure on the prices of the components that go into such applications. Decreases in the ASP of end\n\nuse applications may increase pricing pressure on components produced by us, which, in turn, may negatively impact the Company's revenue, margin and earnings.\n\n## Risks Associated with Competition\n\nThe competition in the semiconductor foundry industry is fierce. The Company competes with other foundry service providers, as well as a number of integrated device manufacturers. Some of these companies may have access to more advanced or different technologies than TSMC. Other companies may have greater financial and other resources than TSMC, such as the possibility of receiving direct or indirect government subsidies, economic stimulus funds, or other incentives that may be unavailable to TSMC. The governments of the United States, China, Europe, South Korea and Japan provide various incentive programs to promote developments of their domestic semiconductor industries, such as the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act of 2022 (the 'U.S. CHIPS Act'), which provides financial incentives to incentivize the development of U.S. semiconductor industry. Although governments in certain of the countries or regions where TSMC is currently expanding or planning to expand its production capacity have extended or may in the future extend certain financial incentives to the Company, there is no assurance that TSMC will be able to receive such financial incentives at the levels TSMC anticipates or at all. Additionally, any financial incentives the Company receives may be subject to conditions imposed by the grantors, such as restrictions on the expansion of facilities in foreign countries of concern and on joint research and technology licensing efforts with foreign entities of concern on any technology or product that raises national security concerns, or the grantors could seek to recover any funds provided to TSMC, or cancel, reduce or deny TSMC's requested subsidies or grants in the future. This could materially increase TSMC's costs or otherwise adversely affect its operations.\n\nMoreover, the Company's competitors may, from time to time, also decide to undertake aggressive pricing initiatives in one or several technology nodes. The Company's competitors may also compete for its customers who seek to diversify their supply chains. These competitive activities may decrease TSMC's customer base, TSMC's pricing, or both. If TSMC is unable to compete effectively with such competitors on technology, manufacturing capacity, product quality, supply chain diversification and resilience, and customer satisfaction, it risks losing customers or business to such contenders.\n\n## Risks Associated with Changes in the Government Policies and Regulatory Environment\n\nTSMC management closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact TSMC's business and financial operations. During 2023 and as of the date of this Annual Report, the following changes or developments in governmental policies and regulations may influence the Company's business operations:\n\nThe manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC's products require the use of chemicals and materials that are subject to environmental, climate related, health and safety laws and regulations issued worldwide as well as international accords such as the Paris Agreement. Climate change related laws or regulations currently are too indefinite for the Company to assess the impact on our future financial condition with any degree of reasonable certainty. For example, the Taiwan 'Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act', which became effective on July 1, 2015, was amended and was renamed as 'Climate Change Response Act'. The amendments became effective in February 2023, which set a goal of reaching net-zero emissions in Taiwan by 2050 and also established a carbon fee system to collect carbon fees on direct and indirect emissions from emitters whose emissions reach certain thresholds. The government will start collecting carbon fees from 2025 but the rate for such fees has yet to be determined by the relevant authorities. We could be required to pay any incurred carbon fees since our emission levels exceed applicable thresholds pursuant to the current regulatory requirements, which will result in increased operating costs for us and affect us financially to a certain extent. We expect to see more of its relevant regulations promulgated by the regulators in the future. Also, the R.O.C. legislative authority is reviewing, at all times, various environmental issues to develop laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and climate related changes. The impact of such laws and regulations, as well as of the carbon fee, is indeterminable at the moment. It is not expected that other governmental policies or regulatory changes would materially impact TSMC's operations or financial condition.\n\n## 6.3.3 Operational Risks\n\n## Natural and Man-Made Disaster\n\nTSMC is committed to maintaining operational resilience in accordance with business continuity management standards that equips it with the capability to respond effectively to business disruption. Disruptions caused by natural and\n\nman-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage, pandemic, supply chain disruption, geopolitical tensions, cyberattacks, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment, shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water, electricity and natural gas, etc., could interrupt TSMC's operations.\n\nMost of TSMC's production facilities, as well as those of many of its suppliers, customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters and may face potential shortages of electricity and/or water, which could cause interruptions to TSMC's operations.\n\nThus, if one or more natural disasters result in a prolonged disruption to TSMC's operations or those of its customers or suppliers, or if any of its fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an unforeseen disruptive event, it could reduce TSMC's manufacturing capacity and cause the loss of important customers and thereby have an adverse, material impact on its operational and financial performance.\n\nTo cope with possible droughts resulted from severe climate change, TSMC implemented manufacturing process water saving, as well as building up industrial water recycling plants, using household water and cooperating with government to mitigate water shortage risk. As part of TSMC's business continuity plans, measures taken include water conservation measures, use of alternative water sources. Close monitoring of water situation including stress testing and exercises are carried out to validate our response plan.\n\nTSMC has occasionally suffered power outages, dips or surges caused by difficulties encountered by its electricity supplier or other power consumers on the same power grid. Some of these incidents have resulted in interruptions to TSMC's operations. Such outages, shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the governments. If TSMC is unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity to power its manufacturing fabs, its ability to fill customers' orders would be jeopardized. Moreover, TSMC has encountered and may continue to encounter increases in the prices of utilities. For example, effective from April 1, 2024, TSMC is subject to a higher electricity tariff rate in Taiwan, which is estimated to increase by 25%, as compared to the tariff rate applicable to",

        "page_content": "the Company in 2023. The increased prices for electricity could increase TSMC's manufacturing costs and therefore adversely impact TSMC's financial results.\n\nIf such events were to occur over prolonged periods of time, TSMC's operations and financial performance may be materially adversely affected. Moreover, TSMC's future capacity expansions in Taiwan and elsewhere could be curtailed by utility shortages.\n\nTSMC has further strengthened its business continuity management, which includes periodic risk assessments and mitigations, and the establishment of taskforces before emergency events. The taskforces define emergency response, crisis communication, recovery plans and preventative measures based on the thorough analysis of derivative effects and alternative solutions to ensure the impacts of people injury, business interruption, finance are minimized. TSMC reviews periodically its business continuity plans and refines them to reflect exercise results and implementation. In response to the impact of the earthquakes that occurs in Taiwan, TSMC continues to improve its earthquake emergency response, tool anchorage and seismic isolation facilities, and readiness for tool salvage and production recovery. These improvements have been integrated into new fab design. TSMC's business continuity procedures were further enhanced through close reference to ISO 22301 business continuity management system (BCMS).\n\nTSMC maintains a comprehensive risk management system dedicated to human safety, the conservation of natural resources and the protection of property. In order to cope effectively with emergencies and natural disasters, management at each facility has developed comprehensive plans and procedures that focus on risk prevention, emergency response, crisis management and business continuity. All TSMC manufacturing fabs have been ISO 14001 certified (environmental management) and ISO 45001 certified (occupational health and safety management). All manufacturing fabs in Taiwan have also been TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certified. New fabs will also attain the above certifications within 18 months after acquiring factory registration certification.\n\nTSMC and many of its suppliers use flammable and toxic materials in their manufacturing processes and are therefore subject to risks that cannot be completely eliminated arising from explosion, fire, or environmental influences. Although\n\nTSMC maintains multiple layers of risk prevention and protection, as well as fire and casualty insurance, TSMC's risk management and insurance coverage may not always be sufficient to cover all of its potential losses. If any of TSMC's fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion, fire or environmental causes, it could reduce the TSMC's manufacturing capacity leading to the loss of important sales and customers and have a negative impact on TSMC's financial performance. In addition to periodic fire-protection inspections and firefighting drills, TSMC has also carried out a corporate-wide fire risk mitigation project focused on managerial and hardware improvements.\n\nTSMC continues to monitor key disruptive threats to its business operations and adapt the plans to ensure operational resilience.\n\n## Risks Associated with Capacity Expansion\n\nTSMC performs long-term market demand forecasts for its products and services to manage its overall capacity. Based on its market demand forecasts, the Company has continued to add capacity to meet market needs for its products and services, including in Taiwan, in Arizona, U.S., in Nanjing, China, in Kumamoto, Japan and in Dresden, Germany.\n\nImplementing these capacity expansion plans will increase its costs, and the increases may be substantial. For example, the Company would need to build new facilities, purchase additional equipment and hire and train personnel to operate the new equipment. If TSMC does not increase its net revenue accordingly, its financial performance may be adversely affected by these increased costs.\n\nIn addition, market conditions are dynamic and TSMC's market demand forecasts may change significantly at any time. During periods of decreased demand, certain manufacturing lines or tools in some of the Company's manufacturing facilities may be suspended or shut down temporarily. However, if demand subsequently increases rapidly over a short period of time, TSMC may not be able to restore the capacity in a timely manner to take advantage of the upturn. In such circumstances, its financial performance and competitiveness may be adversely affected.\n\nIn order to mitigate the risk associated with capacity expansion, TSMC continuously watches for changes in market conditions and works closely with its customers. When market demand is not as expected, the Company tries to adjust its capacity\n\nplans in a timely manner to reduce the impact on its financial performance.\n\n## Risks Associated with Construction of New Fabs\n\nThe Company has multiple expansion projects that are currently underway, including the design and construction of new fabs worldwide. Global expansion has required and will continue to require considerable managerial, financial and other resources. The Company expects to face particular challenges in global expansion and operations, including but not limited to:\n\n- \u25cf  higher costs associated with construction of new fabs, establishing supply chains for various materials in different overseas locations, the impact on the Company's ability to sustain its current level of productivity and manufacturing efficiency provided by its ecosystem of interconnected semiconductor fabs, employees and suppliers in the R.O.C., and recruiting and retaining talent in various overseas locations;\n- \u25cf  labor shortages, interruptions in the supply chains for various materials, and construction issues, which could substantially delay the completion of the Company's expansion projects, and could further result in substantial additional costs or failure to meet its capacity expansion plans;\n- \u25cf  disruptions to the Company's operations caused by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage, pandemic, supply chain disruption, geopolitical tensions, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment and shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water, electricity, and natural gas, etc.;\n- \u25cf  scarcity of industrial-use land, which could limit the Company's future expansion of operations;\n- \u25cf  compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, and the risk of penalties if the Company's practices are deemed not to be in compliance;\n- \u25cf  challenges in managing information technology infrastructure in multiple locations and across different systems and risks of our information technology infrastructure succumbing to cyberattacks by third parties worldwide;\n- \u25cf  adverse changes relating to government grants or other government incentives \u037e\n- \u25cf  challenges in creating an inclusive workplace in new sites to embrace the cultural differences and managing the operation over large geographic distances;\n- \u25cf  limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties enforcing the Company's rights to intellectual property; and\n- \u25cf  exposure to different tax jurisdictions and potential adverse tax consequences.\n\nIf TSMC is unable to overcome the above challenges, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks Associated with Sales Concentration\n\nOver the years, the Company's customer profile and the nature of the Company's customers' business have changed dramatically. While TSMC generates revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide, TSMC's ten largest customers in 2021, 2022 and 2023 accounted for approximately, 71%, 68% and 70% of TSMC's net revenue in the respective year. TSMC's largest customer in 2021, 2022 and 2023 accounted for 26%, 23% and 25% of the Company's net revenue in the respective year. TSMC's second largest customer in 2021, 2022 and 2023 accounted for 10%, less than 10% and 11% of TSMC's net revenue in the respective year.\n\nA more concentrated customer base will subject TSMC's revenue to seasonal demand fluctuations from the Company's large customers, and cause different seasonal patterns in the Company's business. This customer concentration results in part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry with the structural shift to mobile and high performance computing (HPC) devices and applications and software that provide the content for such devices.\n\nThere are only a limited number of customers who are successfully exploiting this new business model paradigm. Also, TSMC has seen changes in the nature of its customers' business models in response to this new business model paradigm. For example, there is a growing trend among system companies designing their own semiconductors and working directly with the semiconductor foundries, which makes their products and services more marketable in a changing consumer market.\n\nAlso, since the global semiconductor industry has become increasingly competitive, some of TSMC's customers have engaged in industry consolidations in order to remain competitive. Such consolidations have taken the form of mergers and acquisitions. If more of TSMC's major customers consolidate, this will further decrease the overall number of the Company's customer pool. In addition, regulatory restrictions, such as export controls directed at TSMC's major customers, could impact the Company's ability to supply products to those customers or reduce those customers' demand for TSMC's products and services and thus impact their business operations.\n\nThe loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more of the Company's top customers including curtailments",

        "page_content": "due to increased competitive pressures, industry consolidation, changes in applicable regulatory restrictions, product designs, manufacturing sourcing or outsourcing policies or practices of these customers, the timing of customer inventory adjustments, or changes in its major customers' business models, may adversely affect TSMC's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Risks Associated with Purchasing Concentration \u25cf  Raw Materials\n\nTSMC's production operations require that it obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, gases, chemicals and photoresist, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific suppliers or by the semiconductor industry generally, have resulted in occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. Moreover, major natural disasters, trade barriers and political or economic turmoil, including military conflicts and inflation, occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw materials or increase their prices. Also, since TSMC procures some of its raw materials from sole-sourced suppliers, there is a risk that the Company's needs for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available. Importation and domestic production limitations may also limit the Company's ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials as well as materials of the necessary quality. In addition, recent trade tensions could result in increased prices or even unavailability of raw materials due to tariffs, export control or other non-tariff barriers. TSMC's revenue and earnings could decline if it is unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials. To reduce the supply chain risk and to manage costs effectively, TSMC commits resources toward developing new supply sources and developing a future capacity plan with qualified raw material suppliers. Furthermore, the Company continually encourages its suppliers to reduce their supply chain risk by decentralizing production plants to improve their cost competitiveness and to support TSMC global demands in a timely fashion.\n\nTSMC not only operates world-class manufacturing process and facilities but needs sufficient world-class high-quality raw materials. As a result, TSMC engages early and extensively with primary suppliers on managing quality and capacity issues so as to be prepared for any unexpected need to ramp up or curtail\n\nproduction. To streamline supply chain risk, the Company communicates early on with major material suppliers regarding quality and capacity topics and has formed a dedicated team for supplier plant onsite or remote audits to extend supply chain best practices to its upstream suppliers. In addition, in response to the rapid increase or decrease in production capacity of new products, TSMC has continued to improve its inventory monitoring system to achieve more accurate demand forecasts and ensure that the supply chain maintains sufficient inventory levels. The Company also performs supply chain risk assessments to ensure that critical suppliers meet various standards in labor, ethics, environmental, safety and health (ESH) practices and business continuity plans (BCPs).\n\n## \u25cf  Equipment\n\nThe Company's operations and ongoing expansion plans depend on its ability to obtain necessary equipment and related services available from a limited number of suppliers. As a result, TSMC may encounter the situation of limited supply and/or long delivery cycles. To better manage its supply chain, the Company evaluates and projects delivery lead times to minimize the impact of supply chain risks on operating costs. TSMC has also implemented various collaborative business models and risk management contingencies with suppliers to ensure supply and shorten the procurement lead time. To enhance its sourcing capabilities for its global sites, the company has also taken steps to strengthen its understanding of local regulations, policies, and supply chains. However, if TSMC is unable to acquire in a timely manner the equipment and parts it needs, it may fail to successfully implement capacity expansion plans and exploit time sensitive business opportunities. Additionally, ongoing trade tensions could result in increased prices for, or even unavailability of, key equipment, through delay or denial of necessary export licenses, adoption of additional export control measures and other tariff or non-tariff barriers. If TSMC is unable to obtain equipment in a timely fashion to fulfill its customers' demand for technology and production capacity, or unable to do so at a reasonable cost, its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n\n## Risks Associated with Intellectual Property Rights\n\nThe Company's ability to compete successfully and to achieve future growth depends in part on the continued strength of its intellectual property portfolio. While the Company actively enforces and protects our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that its efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of its proprietary\n\ntechnologies, software, trade secrets or know-how. Also, the Company cannot assure you that, as its business or business models expand into new areas, it will be able to develop independently the technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how necessary to conduct its business or that it can do so without unknowingly infringing the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, the Company may have to rely on, to a certain degree, licensed technologies and patent licenses from others. To the extent that the Company relies on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the future on terms it considers reasonable or at all. The lack of necessary licenses could expose the Company to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by its customers in instances where it has contractually agreed to indemnify its customers against damages resulting from infringement claims.\n\nThe Company has received, from time to time, communications from third parties, including non-practicing entities and semiconductor companies, asserting that TSMC's technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design IPs of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the nature of the industry, its market position, and the expansion of its manufacturing operations outside of Taiwan, the Company may receive an increased number of such communications in the future. The assertions made and lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing entities are particularly aggressive in their monetary demand and in seeking court-issued injunctions. Such lawsuits and assertions may increase TSMC's cost of doing business and may potentially be extremely disruptive if these asserting entities succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services offered by TSMC. Also, with the expansion of its manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.C jurisdictions, it has faced increased challenges in managing risks of intellectual property misappropriation. Despite our efforts to adopt robust measures to mitigate the risk of intellectual property misappropriation in such new jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee that the protection measures we adopted will be sufficient to prevent us from potential infringements by others, or at all.\n\nIf the Company fails to obtain or maintain certain technologies or intellectual property licenses or fails to prevent our intellectual property from being misappropriated and, if litigation relating to alleged intellectual property matters\n\noccurs, it could: (1) prevent the Company from manufacturing particular products or selling particular services or applying particular technologies; and (2) reduce our ability to compete effectively against entities benefiting from our misappropriated intellectual property, which could reduce its opportunities to generate revenue.\n\nThe Company has taken related measures to minimize potential loss of shareholder value arising from intellectual property claims and litigation filed against it. These measures include: strategically obtaining licenses from certain semiconductor and other technology companies as needed; timely securing intellectual property rights originating within and outside of TSMC for defensive and/or offensive protection of TSMC technology and business; and aggressively defending against baseless litigation.\n\n## Risks Associated with Litigious and Non-litigious Matters\n\nAs is the case with many companies in the semiconductor industry, the Company has received from time to time communications from third parties asserting that its technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights. These assertions have at times resulted in litigation by or against the Company and settlement payments by the Company. Irrespective of the validity of these claims, the Company could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or could suffer adverse effects on its operations. The Company is also subject to antitrust compliance requirements and scrutiny by governmental regulators in multiple jurisdictions. Any adverse results of such proceeding or other similar proceedings that may arise in those jurisdictions could harm TSMC's business and distract its management, and thereby have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or prospects, and subject the Company to potential significant legal liability.\n\nCurrently, TSMC's material legal proceeding is as follows:\n\nIn September 2022, Daedalus Prime LLC ('Daedalus') filed complaints in the U.S. International Trade Commission ('ITC') and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC, TSMC North America, and other companies infringe four U.S. patents. The ITC instituted an investigation in October 2022. In June 2023, Daedalus dropped two of the asserted patents in the ITC. Also in June 2023, Daedalus filed another complaint in the Eastern District",

        "page_content": "of Texas alleging that TSMC infringes five U.S. patents. In September 2023, the ITC granted the parties' joint motion to suspend the procedural schedule while the parties finalize the settlement agreement and then request termination of the ITC Investigation and related litigations. In October 2023, the parties jointly requested the ITC to terminate the investigation and Eastern District of Texas to dismiss the related litigations. In November 2023, the ITC investigation was terminated and the related litigations in the Eastern District of Texas were dismissed.\n\nOther than the matter described above, as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC is not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings.\n\n## Risks Associated with Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nIn 2023 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC had not conducted any merger or acquisition.\n\n## Risks Associated with Recruiting Quality Personnel\n\nTSMC relies on the continued services and contributions of its management team, as well as skilled technical and professional personnel. The Company's business could suffer from the inability to fulfill personnel needs with high quality professionals in a timely fashion caused by the loss of personnel, talent shortages, illegal talent poaching, immigration controls, or related changes in market demand for our products and services. Since there is fierce competition for talent recruitment, the Company cannot ensure timely fulfillment of its personnel demand.\n\nIn order to reduce the risk of talent recruitment, TSMC encourages job rotation and employs an on-the-job training and certification system. In this way, employees can continuously learn and enhance their work efficiency and effectiveness in the workplace. Moreover, TSMC creates multiple recruitment channels and continues to hire diverse top-notch, talented professionals from Taiwan and overseas. At the same time, the Company continues to expand industry-academic cooperation to meet outstanding talent at an early phase to recruit them in the future.\n\n## Future R&D Plans and Expected R&D Spending\n\nFor additional details, see '5.2.7 Future R&D Plans' on page 104-105 of this Annual Report.\n\n## Changes in Corporate Reputation and Impact on the Company's Crisis Management\n\nTSMC has established an excellent reputation worldwide based on its core values of integrity, commitment, innovation and customer trust. The Company's positive image also reflects outstanding operations, rigorous corporate governance and dedication to sustainable responsibility by serving as a good corporate citizen. TSMC continues to pursue innovation in economic, environmental and social dimensions.\n\nIn 2023, TSMC was honored with numerous awards and citations for achievements in various areas including operations, corporate governance, patents, profit growth, investor relations, environmental protection, and corporate sustainability. The Company was selected as a part of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 23 rd consecutive year. TSMC won first place in CommonWealth magazine's inaugural Talent Sustainability award and in the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy's Corporate Sustainability award for 2023. The Company was recognized as a Taiwan Top Ten Sustainability Exemplary in the Corporate Sustainability report, and for Climate Leadership, Circular Economy Leadership, Supply Chain Management, Sustainable Water Management and Information Security Leadership. The Carbon Disclosure Project chose TSMC as a Supplier Engagement Leader in 2022, ranking in the top 5% of the Taiwan Stock Exchange corporate governance evaluation. The Company was named a member of Fortune's 2023 World's Most Admired Companies and the Fortune Global 500; Forbes's World's Largest Technology Companies in 2023; PricewaterhouseCoopers' Global Top 100 Companies by market capitalization; and the 2023 Carbon Clean 200 TM list issued by the media research company Corporate Knights and the non-profit As You Sow organization. TSMC was honored to be a part of the World Benchmarking Alliance's SDG2000, the 2,000 Most Influential Companies, and included in Morgan Stanley Capital International's All Country World Index ESG Leaders, while being ranked AAA by MSCI Research in its ESG Indexes.\n\nTo promote sustainability, TSMC's ESG Steering Committee, led by Chairman Dr. Mark Liu, presented the fourth TSMC ESG Award in 2023, honoring internal organizations and divisions for tangible achievements in the Company's five ESG strategic directions: drive green manufacturing, build a responsible supply chain, create a diverse and inclusive workplace, develop talent, and care for the disadvantaged. At the same time, this\n\naward presentation encouraged all employees to propose new ideas for sustainability to be assessed for feasibility and potential incorporation in the Company's implementation plans. Compared to 1,880 sustainability proposals in the third year, the fourth annual ESG Award generated 3,166 innovative ideas, adding new energy to the Company's culture of sustainability.\n\nMindful of its global reputation, TSMC employs numerous preventative measures to address potential risks from earthquakes, fires, IT service disruption, yield loss, cyberattacks, supply chain disruption, pandemics, environmental events, and utility supply disruption. TSMC practices crisis management, implements recovery measures to deal with possible crisis events, maintains a crisis command center for control guidelines, and prepares emergency response procedures to ensure timely and prompt responses during a crisis. TSMC also performs regular exercises for crisis scenarios to ensure that crisis management procedures are comprehensive and valid. In 2023, TSMC received a rating of Low ESG Risk from the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings.\n\nTSMC's environment, safety and health committee holds monthly meetings to coordinate with relevant departments in each fab to conduct emergency response drills and continuously improve their notification and operational procedures to ensure clear channels of communication to stakeholders if a crisis arises, with the public relations division serving as the designated gateway for external communications.\n\nIn 2023, the Board of TSMC took steps to enhance its corporate governance by expanding and strengthening the functions and responsibilities of its committees. The 'Audit Committee' was renamed as the 'Audit and Risk Committee' to assist the Board in overseeing the quality and integrity of accounting, auditing, reporting, financial control practices, and risk management structure. TSMC also deepened the risk management mechanisms of its overseas subsidiaries by conducting risk management and business continuity management workshops and incident commander trainings. Business continuity plans are also rehearsed and validated through regular exercises to ensure timely and effective responses. These efforts aim to fortify operational resilience and raise risk awareness of operational preparedness across TSMC's global footprint.\n\nIf the above-mentioned crisis occurs, relevant personnel at TSMC's headquarters and global operating locations can deploy comprehensive emergency response measures to eliminate or minimize the impact on personnel safety, environment, property and operations. Responders also involve the public relations division from initial stage to ensure timely, clear and consistent external communication regarding the situation.\n\n## Risks Associated with Change in Management\n\nIn 2023 and as of the date of this Annual Report, there were no such risks for TSMC.\n\n## Risks Regarding Non-Compliance with Export Control,\n\n## Environmental and Climate Change Related Laws,\n\nRegulations and Accords, and Failure to Timely Obtain Requisite Approvals Necessary for Conducting Business Because TSMC engages in manufacturing activities in multiple jurisdictions and conducts business with its customers located worldwide, such activities are subject to a myriad of governmental regulations. For example, the manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC's products require the use of equipment that is subject to export control laws and regulations, as well as metals, chemicals, and materials that are subject to environmental, climate-related, health and safety, and humanitarian forced labor prohibition and conflict-free sourcing laws, regulations and guidelines issued worldwide. The Company's failure to comply with any such laws or regulations, as amended from time to time, and its failure to comply with any information and document sharing requests from the relevant authorities in a timely manner could result in:\n\n- \u25cf  significant penalties and legal liabilities, such as the denial of import or export permits or third party private lawsuits, criminal or administrative proceedings;\n- \u25cf  the temporary or permanent suspension of production of the affected products;\n- \u25cf  the temporary or permanent inability to procure or use certain production critical chemicals or materials;\n- \u25cf  unfavorable alterations in TSMC's manufacturing, fabrication and assembly and test processes;\n- \u25cf  challenges from its customers that place TSMC at a significant competitive disadvantage, such as loss of actual or potential sales contracts in case the Company is unable to satisfy the applicable legal standard or customer requirement;\n- \u25cf  restrictions on TSMC's operations or sales;",

        "page_content": "- \u25cf  loss of tax benefits, including termination of current tax incentives, disqualification of tax credit application and repayment of the tax benefits that the Company is not entitled to; and\n- \u25cf  damages to TSMC's goodwill and reputation.\n\nComplying with applicable laws and regulations, such as environmental and climate related laws and regulations, could also require TSMC, among other things, to do the following: (1) purchase, use or install remedial equipment; (2) implement remedial programs such as climate change mitigation programs and air pollution reduction plans; (3) modify its product designs and manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses such as paying any incurred carbon fees if the Company's emission levels exceed applicable thresholds, and obtaining renewable energy sources, renewable energy certificates or carbon credits, substitute raw materials or chemicals that may cost more or be less available for the Company's operations.\n\nTSMC's inability to timely obtain approvals necessary for the conduct of its business could impair its operational and financial results. For example, if the Company is unable to timely obtain environmental related approvals needed to undertake the development and construction of a new fab or expansion project, then such inability may delay, limit, or increase the cost of its expansion plans that could also in turn adversely affect its business and operational results. In light of increased public interest in environmental issues, TSMC's operations and expansion plans may be adversely affected or delayed in response to public concern and social environmental pressures even if the Company complies with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nTSMC believes that climate change should be regarded as a significant corporate risk that must be managed to improve competitiveness. For TSMC's climate change related risks and control measures, see the 'Climate Change and Energy Management' section under '7.2.1 Environmental Protection' on page 158-159 of this Annual Report.\n\n## 6.3.4 Financial Risks\n\n## Economic Risks\n\nAny future systemic political, economic or financial crisis or market volatility, including but not limited to interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, inflation or deflation or changes in economic, fiscal and monetary policies in\n\nmajor economies, could cause revenue or profits for the semiconductor industry as a whole to decline dramatically. If the economic conditions or financial conditions of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, the demand for its products and services may decrease and additional accounting related allowances may be required, which could reduce TSMC's operating and net income.\n\n## \u25cf  Interest Rate Fluctuation\n\nTSMC is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.\n\nThe objective of TSMC's investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires the Company to invest in investment grade securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The majority of TSMC's fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI') or amortized cost. For those fixed income investments classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, changes in their fair value are recognized through other comprehensive income; for those classified as financial assets at amortized cost, changes in their fair value are not reflected in asset values unless the assets are sold.\n\nTSMC has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.\n\nThe majority of TSMC's debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and, as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.\n\n## \u25cf  Foreign Exchange Volatility\n\nSubstantially all of TSMC's sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the NT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the Company's revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT\n\ndollars. For example, every one percent depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar would result in an approximately 0.4 percentage point decrease in the Company's operating margin based on its 2023 results.\n\nConversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly versus other major currencies, the demand for the products and services of TSMC's customers and for its goods and services will likely decrease, which will negatively affect the Company's revenue.\n\nTSMC uses foreign currency derivatives contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency denominated debts, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, investments in foreign subsidiaries, and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on its assets and liabilities.\n\nFluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar may affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's common shares and the market price of the Company's American Depositary Shares (ADSs) as well as any cash dividends paid in NT dollars on TSMC's common shares represented by ADSs.\n\n## \u25cf  Inflation\n\nTSMC is subject to the effects of inflation through increases in the cost of items such as raw materials and equipment used to produce its products, wage expenses and employee benefits, electricity costs, and costs in relation to construction of fabs. Although TSMC does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations to date, a high inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to maintain current levels of profit margin if the selling prices of its products and services do not increase with these increased costs.\n\n## Amendments to Tax Regulations or Implementation of New Tax Laws\n\nAny amendments to existing tax regulations or the implementation of any new tax laws in the jurisdictions in which TSMC operates its business may have an adverse effect on its net income.\n\nWhile the Company is subject to tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which it operates or conducts business, TSMC's principal operations are in the R.O.C. and it is exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government. The R.O.C. Controlled Foreign Company ('CFC') rules enacted in 2016 have been implemented since January 1, 2023, pursuant to which, certain profits retained at a CFC located in a low-tax jurisdiction would be taxable at its parent company in Taiwan. On the other hand, effective from January 1, 2023, the R.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation was amended such that eligible companies that develop innovative technologies domestically and possess leading position in global supply chain may claim investment tax credit of 25% on qualified R&D expenditure and 5% on procurement of machinery/equipment for advanced processes over a fiscal year. The Company is eligible for these new incentives pursuant to the R.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation. Further, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These changes may increase tax uncertainty and have an adverse effect on TSMC's operating results.\n\nIn order to control tax risk, the Company closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact its financial operations. TSMC has established risk management procedures to collect information, analyze potential tax implications, and develop countermeasures.\n\n## Risks Associated with External Financing\n\nIn times of market instability, sufficient external financing may not be available to the Company on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms to the Company, or at all. If sufficient external financing is not available when TSMC needs such financing to meet its capital requirements, the Company may be forced to curtail its expansion, modify plans or delay the deployment of new or expanded services until it obtains such financing.\n\n## Risks Associated with High-Risk/Highly Leveraged Investments; Lending, Endorsements, and Guarantees for Other Parties; and Financial Derivative Transactions\n\nIn 2023 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC made no high-risk or highly leveraged financial investments. All financial derivative transactions engaged by TSMC were strictly for hedging and not for trading or speculative purposes. All guarantees and intercompany loans provided by TSMC and",

        "page_content": "its subsidiaries were solely for TSMC and/or its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All guarantees and intercompany loans were in compliance with relevant rules and regulations.\n\nTo manage risks of various financial transactions, TSMC has established internal control policies and procedures based on sound financial and business practices, all in compliance with the relevant rules and regulations issued by the R.O.C. Financial Supervisory Commission. TSMC's policies and procedures include Procedures for Financial Derivatives Transactions, Procedures for Lending Funds to Other Parties, Procedures for Acquisition or Disposal of Assets, and Procedures for Endorsement and Guarantee.\n\n## Risks Associated with Impairment Charges\n\nUnder Taiwan-IFRSs, TSMC is required to evaluate its tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. If certain criteria are met, TSMC is required to record an impairment charge. TSMC is not able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may have a material adverse effect on the Company's net income.\n\nThe determination of an impairment charge at any given time is mainly based on the projected results of operations over several years subsequent to that time. Consequently, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when the Company's operating results are otherwise already depressed. See 'Note 5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY' in Annual Report section (II), Financial Statements for a discussion of how TSMC assesses if an impairment charge is required and, if so, how the amount is determined.\n\n## 6.3.5 Other Risks\n\nPotential Impact and Risks Associated with Sales of Significant Numbers of Shares by TSMC's Directors, and/ or Shareholders Who Own 10% or More of TSMC's Total Outstanding Shares\n\nThe value of TSMC shareholders' investment may be reduced by possible future sales of TSMC shares owned by major shareholders.\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, no single shareholder owned 10% or more of TSMC's total outstanding shares.\n\n## Risks of Trade Policies\n\nAs TSMC's revenue is primarily derived from sales to major economies in the world (please refer to '2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy' on page 19-21 of this annual report), any changes in the trade policies (such as the increase of tariffs on certain products, the implementation of import and export controls, and the adoption of other trade barriers) of such major economies can affect the sales of TSMC or its customers and thereby affect TSMC's operating results.\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. tightened its export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, 'Huawei'). To comply with relevant laws and regulations, TSMC has discontinued shipment of products to Huawei since September 2020. Since February 2022, there have been expansive sanctions and export controls imposed by several countries and regions against Russia, including certain individuals and entities, in connection with the military conflict in Ukraine. In October 2022 and October 2023, the U.S. adopted additional export controls over specified countries (including China) under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations ('U.S. EAR') on certain advanced computing integrated circuits ('ICs'), computer commodities that contain such ICs, and certain semiconductor manufacturing items, as well as controls on transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing end-uses. The new controls add new license requirements for items subject to the U.S. EAR where the items are destined to a semiconductor fabrication facility in China that fabricates ICs meeting specified advanced node parameters as well as for U.S. persons' activities supporting such facility or semiconductor manufacturing items. In October 2022, the Company secured a one-year general authorization from the U.S. government, which allows TSMC to maintain the Company's fab's operations in Nanjing, China. This general authorization has been renewed and extended to be effective until May 31, 2024. TSMC is also applying for a Validated End-User (the 'VEU') authorization for its Nanjing fab, which, once obtained, would be a permanent authorization that allows the Company to receive exports of eligible items from the U.S. without separate licenses. However, there is no assurance that TSMC will be able to obtain the VEU authorization for our Nanjing fab or that the obtained general authorization will not be terminated in the future. On the other hand, measures adopted by an affected country to counteract the impact of another country's actions or regulations could lead to significant legal liability to multinational corporations\n\nincluding our own. For example, in January 2021, China adopted a blocking statute that, among other matters, entitles Chinese entities incurring damages from a multinational's compliance with foreign laws to seek civil remedies.\n\nImposition of trade barriers, including protectionist measures, sanctions and import and export controls (including without limitation the export control measures mentioned in the foregoing paragraph), could increase TSMC's manufacturing costs, limit TSMC's access to certain supplies, make TSMC's pricing less competitive, and impact the sales of TSMC or its customers. In 2023 and as of the date of this annual report, our current results of operations have not been materially affected. Nevertheless, depending on future developments of global trade tensions, such relevant regulations, rules, or measures may have an adverse impact on the Company's business and operations, and TSMC may incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a result.\n\nTSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies and measures among the relevant major economies and will take corresponding responsive actions in accordance with subsequent developments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In so doing, the Company seeks maximum achievements as the leading technology and capacity provider of the global logic IC industry and strives to establish mutually beneficial interaction with all stakeholders employees, shareholders/investors, customers, suppliers/contractors, governments/associations and society as a whole - aiming to create sustainable value and to be a force for positive change.\n\n## Guidance for Implementing - ESG\n\nWith the vision of Uplifting Society, TSMC has formulated its ESG Policy as the overarching guiding principle for sustainable development, in which the ESG Matrix, established by the Company's founder Dr. Morris Chang, clearly defines the scope of its ESG responsibilities. TSMC strives to carry out its ESG commitment in seven areas: morality, business ethics, economy, rule of law, sustainability, work-life balance and happiness, and philanthropy. Actions that TSMC has taken to fulfill these commitments are integrity, law compliance, anti-corruption/anti-bribery/anti-cronyism, environmental protection/climate control/energy conservation, corporate governance, providing well-paying jobs, generating good shareholder return, employee work-life balance, encouraging innovation and a good work environment. TSMC also advances ESG through its Charity Foundation and Education and Culture Foundation to fulfill corporate citizenship responsibilities.\n\n## TSMC ESG Matrix\n\n| Society TSMC                                                 | Morality   | Business Ethics   | Economy   | Rule of Law   | Sustainability   | Work/Life  Balance  Happiness   | Philanthropy   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|\n| Integrity                                                    | V          | V                 |           |               |                  |                                 |                |\n| Law Compliance                                               |            |                   |           | V             |                  |                                 |                |\n| Anti-Corruption Anti-Bribery Anti-Cronyism                   | V          | V                 |           | V             |                  |                                 |                |\n| Environmental Protection Climate Control Energy Conservation |            |                   |           | V             | V                |                                 |                |\n| Corporate Governance                                         |            | V                 | V         | V             |                  |                                 |                |\n| Provide Well-Paying Jobs                                     |            |                   | V         |               |                  | V                               |                |\n| Good Shareholder Return                                      |            |                   | V         |               |                  |                                 |                |\n| Employees' Work-Life Balance                                 |            |                   |           |               |                  | V                               |                |\n| Encourage Innovation                                         |            | V                 | V         |               |                  |                                 |                |\n| Good Work Environment                                        |            |                   |           |               |                  | V                               |                |\n| TSMC Charity Foundation                                      |            |                   |           |               | V                | V                               | V              |\n| TSMC Education and Culture Foundation                        |            |                   |           |               | V                | V                               | V              |\n\n## ESG Management\n\nTSMC has established the ESG Steering Committee as the highest level of ESG decision-making, chaired by the Company's Chairman, while the Chairperson of the ESG Committee serves as executive secretary, and other members are senior executives from a wide variety of functions. All work together to examine material ESG issues in relation to the Company's operations, set the short-, medium- and long-term strategic directions that link to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThe ESG Committee functions to coordinate and integrate resources, and facilitate communication among various divisions, implementing the resolutions of the Company's ESG Steering Committee. The ESG Department, on behalf of the ESG Committee, works together with cross-organizational representatives to identify key sustainability issues in relation to the Company's operations and stakeholders' concerns. Task forces are formed to address various issues and frame adaptive strategies, goals and action plans. The ESG Committee holds quarterly meetings to track progress and ensure the strategies are implemented effectively in\n\ndaily operations. At the same time, every quarter the chairperson of the ESG Committee reports on the implementation of plans and results to the Board of Directors/Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, under whose supervision the ESG Committee continues to improve TSMC's sustainability management policies, strategies, and goal setting and deepen sustainable development.\n\nIn 2023, TSMC focused primarily on green manufacturing and supply chain management (including net zero emissions, renewable energy access and use, biodiversity strategy, and low-carbon value chain management), diverse and inclusive workplace, and talent development (including a series of activities promoting diversity and inclusion, conducting human rights due diligence, deepening high school students' science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs), and public welfare investments such as the Public Welfare Green Energy Project. TSMC also planned and oversaw ESG budgets for 2023 and 2024. The Company uses sustainability reports as an ESG management tool and updates themed reports such as the Climate and Nature Report, the UN's SDG Action Report, and the Materiality Analysis Report. In June 2024, TSMC will release its first Sustainability Impact Valuation Report, which includes social impact and environmental profit and loss analysis, and Human Rights Report to further expand sustainability transparency and drive towards a better future.\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nTSMC respects all stakeholders' rights and interests in sustainability issues and aims to foster interaction through diverse communication platforms. These channels include a dedicated ESG website, ESG mailbox, Investor mailbox, Employee Feedback Channels, Irregular Business Conduct Reporting System, and the Supply Chain Worker Grievance Channel. TSMC systematically manages and addresses stakeholders' concerns through identification, prioritization, and validation.\n\n## Stakeholders and Communication Channels in 2023\n\n| Stakeholders

TSMC received assurance from the DNV Business Assurance Co. Ltd. that the Company is in compliance with DNV VeriSustain TM Protocol, the GRI standards, SASB Standards, and the TCFD framework.\n\nAs the only semiconductor company selected for the Dow Jones Sustainability World Indices for the past 23 consecutive years, TSMC actively fulfills its corporate citizenship responsibilities and responds to the UN SDGs by setting long-term goals for 2030 and implementing corresponding actions. Anchored in the concept of SDG 17 Partnerships for the Goals, TSMC collaborates with internal and external stakeholders to create sustainable value in ESG aspects. Through mutual dialogue, cooperation, and participation, TSMC strengthens resource linkage and overall value chain influence, driving substantial positive change and building a better future for all.\n\n## 2023 ESG Awards and Ratings\n\n| Category    | Organization                            | Awards and Ratings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall ESG | Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) | \u25cf  Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 23 rd  consecutive year                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|             | MSCI ESG Indexes                        | \u25cf  MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index component \u25cf  MSCI ESG Research - AAA Ratings \u25cf  MSCI ACWI SRI Index component \u25cf  MSCI ACWI Islamic Index component \u25cf  MSCI Emerging Markets ESG Leaders Index                                                                                                                               |\n|             | Sustainalytics                          | \u25cf  Company ESG Risk Ratings: Low ESG Risk - Semiconductor Industry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|             | ISS ESG                                 | \u25cf  'Prime' Rated by ISS ESG Corporate Rating                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|             | FTSE4Good Index                         | \u25cf  FTSE4Good Emerging Index component \u25cf  FTSE4Good All-World Index component \u25cf  FTSE4Good TIP Taiwan ESG Index component                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|             | World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA)       | \u25cf  SDG2000 - The 2,000 Most Influential Companies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|             | S&P Global                              | \u25cf  The Sustainability Yearbook Award 2023 - Top 10% S&P Global ESG Score                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|             | Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy | \u25cf  Taiwan Top 10 Sustainability Exemplary Awards for the 8 th  consecutive year \u25cf  Corporate Sustainability Report Awards \u25cf  Circular Economy Leadership Awards \u25cf  Information Security Leadership Awards \u25cf  Supply Chain Leadership Awards \u25cf  Sustainable Water Management Leadership Awards \u25cf  Climate Leadership Awards |\n|             | Morningstar                             | \u25cf  The Best Sustainable Companies to Own in 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|             | The Financial Times and Statista        | \u25cf  Asia-Pacific Climate Leaders 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n\n(Continued)",

only meet legal requirements but should also align with internationally recognized best practices. The Company's ESH policies aim to achieve 'zero incidents' and 'environmental sustainability' and to make TSMC a world-class organization in environmental, safety and health management. The Company's strategies for attaining these goals are to comply with regulations, promote safety and health, strengthen recycling and pollution prevention, manage ESH risks, instill an ESH culture, establish a green supply chain, and fulfill its related corporate social responsibilities.\n\nAll TSMC and its subsidiaries' manufacturing facilities have received ISO 14001: 2015 certification for environmental management systems and ISO 45001: 2018 certification for occupational safety and health management systems. TSMC and its subsidiary fabs in Taiwan have each been certified by the Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System (TOSHMS). All the above\n\ncertifications are maintained and valid. Per TSMC policy, all new facilities are required to attain the aforementioned certifications within 18 months after receiving their facility operating license.\n\nTo reduce overall environmental, safety and health risks, TSMC strives for continuous improvement and actively seeks to enhance climate-change management, pollution prevention and control, power and resource conservation, waste reduction and recycling, safety and health management, and fire and explosion prevention, as well as to minimize the impact of earthquake damage.\n\nIn order to meet regulatory and customer requirements for the management of hazardous materials, TSMC has adopted the IECQ QC 080000 hazardous substance process management (HSPM) system. All TSMC fabs have been QC 080000 certified and have maintained validity since 2007. Through the establishment of QC 080000, TSMC ensures that its products comply with customer requirements and international regulations including the European Union's Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive, the EU's Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the 'halogen-free in electronic products' initiative, perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and related substances restriction standards. In addition, in 2016 TSMC started a project to minimize usage of the hazardous substance N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) and as a result by the end of 2022 NMP use in the Company's Taiwan fabs had been reduced by 97.2% compared to the use in 2016. In 2023, TSMC continued to further reduce NMP usage in its subsidiary fabs and expected to complete process replacement in 2024.\n\nIn 2011, TSMC began implementing the ISO 50001 energy management system for continuous improvement in energy conservation. In 2022, all TSMC and its subsidiaries' manufacturing facilities had received ISO 50001 Energy Management System certification and has maintained the certification validity until now except for TSMC Washington. TSMC Washington in the U.S. plans to receive this certification in 2024.\n\nAiming to establish the healthiest possible workplace, in 2017 TSMC formed a corporate-level health promotion committee led by executives at the vice president level to address on an ad-hoc basis occupational disease cases or other health issues. The committee members include site directors, managers of safety and health department, and representatives from\n\nwellness, HR and legal affairs divisions. External experts have also been invited to discuss the potential risks of occupational diseases in the semiconductor manufacturing process and prevention plans for such diseases. To mitigate health risks to employees, suppliers and contractors in the workplace, TSMC has adopted rigorous safety and health control measures focused on preventing occupational injuries and diseases and promoting employee safety, physical and mental health.\n\nTo minimize supply chain risk and fulfill corporate social responsibility, TSMC not only follows ESH best practices internally but also strives to improve the ESH performance of its suppliers and contractors through audits and counselling.\n\nTSMC uses priority work management and self-management to govern services provided by contractors. The Company requires contractors performing level-one high-risk operations to complete certification for technicians and to establish their own ISO 45001 safety and health management system. The emphasis on self-management nurtures the sense of responsibility, with the goal of promoting safety awareness and technical improvement for all contractors in the industry. For onsite contractor personnel, TSMC has standardized courses on safety and health and increased the frequency of such courses to improve training effectiveness and safety awareness. To ensure that the Company's safety protocols are accurately delivered to contractors on a timely basis, TSMC has established a digital platform for mutual communication so that onsite operational risks can be mitigated.\n\nTSMC collaborates with suppliers to manage the sustainability of the supply chain, including formulating supplier sustainability standards, drawing up audit plans, performing audits and tracking improvements, coaching and training, and additional instruction for suppliers with subpar performance. Strengthening the professional capabilities of suppliers in environmental protection, safety and health, fire response, and carbon inventory were key focuses in 2023. To achieve the goal, the Company held the environmental protection, safety and health workshops (57 participants from 52 suppliers), fire emergency response workshops (60 participants from 51 suppliers), supplier carbon inventory workshops (28 participants from 24 suppliers) and environmental protection, safety and health workshops for suppliers' senior managers (29 participants from 17 suppliers). In addition, for the past eight years suppliers have been invited to observe TSMC's annual emergency response drills (accumulated 195 participants from 190 suppliers) and the Company's environmental, safety and health sustainability forum focused on successful case sharing",

TSMC also conducts environmental, safety and health audits at supplier manufacturing sites and actively assists suppliers in improving their ESH performance. Finally, the Company requests that suppliers conduct a carbon emissions inventory and encourages them to implement measures to save energy, reduce carbon emissions, conserve water and reduce waste.\n\n## 7.2.1 Environmental Protection\n\n## Climate Change and Energy Management\n\n## \u25cf  Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nIn view of the potential financial risks of climate change on operations, in 2018 TSMC adopted TCFD recommendations released by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to identify risks and opportunities and further establish metrics and management targets based on the results identified.\n\n## Management Structure of TSMC Climate-related Risks and Opportunities\n\n| Category            | Management Strategy and Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Governance          | Board of Directors periodically reviews climate change related risks and opportunities \u25cf  ESG Steering Committee: TSMC's top organization in climate change management.

In response to threats presented by extreme weather, TSMC sets strategies and targets, ensures sound execution and strives to build a sustainable culture. In 2021, TSMC announced its long-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050, while setting the short-term goal of zero growth in emissions by 2025. By actively implementing emission reduction measures, the Company is working to return its carbon emissions to 2020 levels by 2030.\n\nThe Company actively participates in the initiatives of the World Semiconductor Council (WSC), and has leveraged its past experience to develop best practices, which have been fully adopted and implemented by the Company since 2012, to reduce perfluorinated compounds (PFC) emissions. In 2013, in accordance with the Ministry of Environment's regulation Early Actions for Carbon Credit of Greenhouse Gases Reduction, TSMC applied for recognition of GHG reduction from 2005 to 2011 and received 5.28 million tons of carbon dioxide credits in 2015. Those carbon credits can be used to offset GHG emissions of new manufacturing facilities regulated by Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act, which can support the Company's sustainable operations and mitigate climate-change risk.\n\nSince 2005, TSMC has completed the GHG inventory program and taken a complete inventory of its GHG emissions to gain ISO 14064 certification. The inventory shows that the major direct GHG emissions are PFCs, which are widely used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. The primary indirect GHG emission is electricity consumption. The analysis of the inventory data was performed not only to meet domestic regulatory reporting requirements but also to serve as a baseline reference for the Company's strategy to reduce GHG emissions. Since 2005, TSMC has also participated in the international disclosure and rating agency CDP to publicly disclose climate change information for 19 consecutive years and to continuously review and improve related management practices.\n\nIn response to the commitment of global climate summit Paris Agreement and the Republic of China's Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act promulgated in 2015, TSMC initiated a cross-functional platform for carbon management in 2016. The three areas of focus of this platform are legal compliance, emission reduction, and carbon credit acquisition. In addition to participating in official regulatory consultation and communications meetings, the Company also sets short-, medium- and long-term reduction targets through the Energy Saving and Carbon Reduction Committee led by the fab operations vice president. The measures are carried out by energy and carbon reduction teams of individual fabs. Because more than 80% of TSMC's GHG emissions come from electricity consumption, the Company emphasizes energy conservation and carbon reduction initiatives. TSMC has not only implemented energy-conserving designs in its manufacturing fabs and offices but has also continuously improved the energy efficiency in operating its facilities. These efforts simultaneously reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions and costs. As a result, TSMC has conserved 3.9 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of power since 2016. In February 2023, Taiwan renamed the 'Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act' to the 'Climate Change Response Act' and amended the provisions. Relevant laws and regulations are being formulated. TSMC will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact on the Company, so as to respond early.",

        "page_content": "Since 2018, TSMC began to aggressively negotiate the purchase of renewable energy with suppliers in Taiwan. Targeting a long-term commitment of 100% renewable energy, TSMC has committed to achieving 60% renewable energy by 2030. Since 2018, the overseas manufacturing fabs and offices have purchased renewable energy, REC and carbon credits to offset all carbon emissions caused by power consumption. All TSMC overseas sites achieved net zero emissions in 2023 again. Although development of renewable energy in Taiwan is in an early stage, TSMC has established a renewable energy task force and continues to communicate closely with government. In the hope that the collaboration would speed up renewable energy development in Taiwan, the Company has made recommendations to the government. TSMC continues to find renewable energy. By the end of 2023, the total installation capacity of renewable energy contracted reached 3.1GW (gigawatts). The renewable energy will be provided to TSMC gradually after the related business process has been completed. This is a clear manifestation of the Company's active support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nIn 2020, TSMC became the first semiconductor company to join RE100, the global corporate renewable energy initiative, and pledged that power consumption of all the Company's manufacturing plants and offices would be 100% supplied from renewable energy by 2050. In 2023, TSMC further announced the acceleration of the RE100 sustainability process in response to climate change and mitigation of climate impacts by moving up the original goal from 2050 to 2040.\n\n## TSMC GHG Reduction Target and Achievement Status\n\n| Strategy                                                                                                                      | 2030 Goal                                                                                                                                                  | 2023 Target and Achievement                                                                                                                                       | Achievement Status   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Continue to use best available technology to  reduce GHG emissions and become an industry  leader in low-carbon manufacturing | Reduce GHG emissions per unit product (metric  ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO 2 e)/12- inch equivalent wafer mask layer) by 30% (Base  year: 2020) | Reduced GHG emissions per unit product (metric  ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO 2 e)/12- inch equivalent wafer mask layer) increased by  31% (Target: -9%) | Unachieved (Note)    |\n\n## Air and Water Pollution Control\n\nThe Company has installed air and water pollution control equipment in each fab to meet regulatory emissions requirements. In addition, TSMC maintains backup pollution control systems, including emergency power supplies, to mitigate the risk of pollutant emissions in the event of equipment failure. The Company centrally monitors the operations of its air and water pollution control equipment 24 hours a day by rotating staff and treats system effectiveness as an important tracking item to ensure the quality of emitted air and discharged water.\n\nTo further enhance water resources management, TSMC has adopted and followed the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) standard, the sustainable water management standard. In 2022, TSMC AWS certified fabs (Note) in Taiwan's three science parks including Hsinchu, Central Taiwan and Southern Taiwan obtained AWS Platinum certification - the highest level available and it has maintained it platinum-level certification in subsequent years.\n\nFurthermore, the Company has upgraded the internal water platform (Water Map) to diverse water supply integration platform. In addition to improving use interface, the platform also includes diverse water use information like reclaimed water quality and quantity to fully grasp and manage the usage of water within the fab from all aspects, not only continuously tracks water reservoir capacity but also monitors in-house water quality and quantity. Based on the water balance diagram, it further integrates the water usage flow, flow rate, and recycling mechanisms to calculate the recovery rate, discharge rate, and water usage of each unit to improve water recycling rate. In 2023, TSMC continued to implement four major water saving measures: improving the water production rate of the system, reducing facility system water consumption, increasing the wastewater recycling of facilities, and decreasing water discharge loss from the system, and the overall system has increased recycled water use by 4.28 million cubic meters.\n\nThe goal of water management at TSMC is to optimize utilization of every drop of water. In addition to positively implementing process water-saving measures, TSMC collaborates with industrial, governmental, and academic organizations to invest in the development of water reclamation technology. Through participation in the professional committee activities of the Taiwan Science Park Association, TSMC shares water-saving experiences and professional knowledge with semiconductor industry peers to achieve the common goal of the entire park and ensure long-term water resource supply-demand balance. In order to further circulate the use of water resources and support the government's promotion of reclaimed water policy, TSMC launched the Southern Taiwan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant operation in September 2022, the first private water reclamation plant in Taiwan, and introduced reclaimed water into the semiconductor manufacturing process. In addition to reclaimed water supplied by TSMC's Southern Taiwan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant, TSMC's fabs in Southern Taiwan Science Park started using reclaimed water supplied by the Yongkang reclaimed water plant and the Anping reclaimed water plant when they started up in later 2022 and early 2023 respectively. The supply of above reclaimed water exceeded 62.5 thousand cubic meters per day in 2023. By the end of 2023, 1.261 million cubic meters of reclaimed water had been used in the semiconductor manufacturing process in TSMC's Tainan fabs, helping the Tainan fabs reduce city water usage by 21% and TSMC reach the replacement rate of reclaimed water up to 12%. TSMC commits to continuing to increase the utilization of reclaimed water in newly constructed fabs in the future.\n\n## TSMC Water Usage in Recent Two Years\n\n|   Year | Total Water Usage (m 3 )  (Note 1)   |   Unit Product Water Usage  (L/12-inch wafer-e-layer) |\n|--------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2023 | 113,610,463                          |                                                 176.4 |\n|   2022 | 104,681,272                          |                                                 137.3 |\n\n## TSMC Water Usage Reduction Target and Achievement Status\n\n| Strategy                                                                                                    | 2030 Goal                                                                                              | 2023 Target and  Achievement                                 | Achievement  Status   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Enforce climate  change mitigation  policies, implement  water conservation  and water shortage  adaptation | Reduce unit water  consumption (liter/12- inch equivalent wafer  mask layer) by 30%  (Base year: 2010) | Increased unit water  consumption by  25.24% (Target: -2.7%) | Unachieved  (Note 2)  |\n\nNote 1: Includes TSMC fabs in Taiwan and subsidiaries total use of city water and reclaimed water.\n\n## Waste Management and Recycling\n\nIn recent years, as TSMC continued to develop advanced processes and expand capacity rapidly both at home and overseas, waste production has increased due to the complexity of new process development, demand for reliable yield rates, and increasing use of raw materials.\n\nTo achieve the goal of sustainable resource utilization, TSMC has a designated unit responsible for waste recycling and disposal. The priorities are process waste reduction onsite and offsite recycling and regeneration, with incineration and landfill as the least desirable final option. In 2017, TSMC amended its articles of incorporation to add four business items for chemical materials to enhance waste process flow and reduce risks of improper waste disposal by commissioned agencies. It also set up onsite resource activation facilities to convert waste resources produced during manufacturing process into products to be used onsite or to sell to other industries. TSMC recycled copper sulfate waste, cobalt-containing liquid waste, sulfuric acid waste and ammonium sulfate waste, all of which were regenerated into products. The Company also developed a system of cryolite synthesis whereby hydrogen fluoride (HF) waste is recycled and regenerated into raw material that can be used in other industries. As a result, the Company has become a leader in waste resources regeneration. At the same time, TSMC's fabs in Taiwan achieved a 95% waste recycling rate for the ninth consecutive year, with a landfill rate below 1% for the 14 th consecutive year. Furthermore, TSMC's Taiwan fabs became the first semiconductor facilities in the world to jointly obtain the highest platinum rating for UL 2799 certification in 2023. This achievement builds on the success of TSMC's Fab 12 Phase 1 and Phase 2 in gaining the UL 2799 platinum certification in 2021. TSMC will continue to strive towards its goal of net-zero emission by 2050 reaffirming its commitment to the SDG 12.\n\n## TSMC Waste Quantity and Outsourced Unit Waste Disposal in Recent Two Years (Note 1)\n\n|   Year | Outsourced  General Waste  (ton) (Note 2)   | Outsourced  Hazardous Waste  (ton) (Note 2)   |   Outsourced Unit  Waste Disposal  (Note 3) (kg/12-inch  equivalent wafer  mask layer) |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2023 | 285,605                                     | 371,236                                       |                                                                                   1.17 |\n|   2022 | 342,804                                     | 401,215                                       |                                                                                   0.99 |",

The Company carefully selects waste disposal and recycling vendors that are certified and have required permits. TSMC regularly checks the onsite operational status, disposal declaration forms, operational records, etc., to compare with actual reuse and disposal, and takes proactive steps to strengthen vendor auditing. For example, all waste transportation contractors have agreed to join the GPS Satellite Fleet so that the cleanup transportation routes and abnormal stays for all trucks can be traced. All waste recycling and disposal vendors have installed closed-circuit TV systems at operating sites to monitor and audit waste handling. At the same time, to further guarantee proper waste handling, in 2022 TSMC built the system of waste intelligent fast track (S.W.I.F.T.) and completed five different types of waste treatment vendors for pilot testing. As of 2023, 29% of waste treatment vendors have instituted S.W.I.F.T. and TSMC intends to roll it out to all waste treatment vendors in 2030. Using AI technology in lieu of in-person on-site spot checks increases inspection efficiency 65-fold and reduces manual inspection by 13,000 hours each year. In addition, TSMC conducts ongoing surveys of recycled product tracking and requires all recycling contractors to report their recycled product sales monthly to track waste flow and ensure that actions are taken to adhere to lawful and proper waste recycling and treatment.\n\n## Environmental Accounting\n\nThe purpose of TSMC's environmental accounting system is to identify and quantify environmental costs for internal management. At the same time, the Company also calculates and evaluates the savings or economic benefits of environmental protection programs so as to continuously promote economically effective programs. While environmental expenses are expected to continue to rise, environmental accounting can help manage these costs more effectively. TSMC's environmental accounting measures various environmental costs, establishes independent environmental account codes, and provides the data to all units for use in annual budgeting. The Company's economic benefit evaluation calculates cost savings for energy conservation, water or waste reductions and recycling benefits in accordance with its environmental protection programs. The benefits disclosed in this report include real income from projects such as waste recycling as well as savings from major environmental projects. In 2023, the total benefits of environmental protection programs of TSMC fabs including waste recycling exceeded NT$3,160 million.\n\n## 2023 Environmental Cost of TSMC Fabs in Taiwan\n\nUnit: NT$ thousands\n\n| Classification                                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Expense                                           | Investment                                        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.

        "page_content": "## 7.2.3 Safety and Health\n\n## Safety and Health Management\n\nTSMC's safety and health management complies with local and international standards and adheres to the management approach of Plan, Do, Check, Act to prevent accidents, promote employee safety and health, and protect Company assets. All TSMC fabs in Taiwan have received Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System (TOSHMS) certification since 2009. In 2018, the International Organization for Standardization released ISO 45001: 2018, replacing OHSAS 18001, with major changes in the expansion of the scope, support and participation of the leadership, collection and planning of internal and external issues, the expectations and demands of stakeholders, the assessment of risk inspections, communication and consultation with non-managers, the application of performance indicators, and the evaluation of corrective and preventive actions. Meanwhile, ISO 45001 ensures the spirit of the system can be effectively implemented at the management level through management review, internal audit, automatic check, and security patrol to identify safety concerns and opportunities for improvement. All Company fabs in Taiwan received ISO 45001 certification for occupational health and safety in 2019 and all TSMC subsidiaries obtained the certification in 2020. All the above certifications have been maintained. New facilities, including TSMC Arizona, Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing, Inc. (JASM), are required to receive aforementioned certifications within 18 months upon receiving facility license per TSMC's internal policy.\n\nIn addition to accident prevention, TSMC has established emergency response procedures to protect employees and contractors if a disaster should occur, as well as to prevent and/or reduce the negative impact on the community and the environment. TSMC communicates regularly with suppliers to ensure that the potential risk in operating production equipment is minimized and that safety control procedures are followed rigorously during installation. The Company places stringent controls on high-risk operations and also evaluates the seismic tolerance of its facilities and equipment to reduce the risk of earthquake damage.\n\nFor epidemics, TSMC has established corporate-level prevention committees and procedures for emergency response to outbreaks of infectious diseases.\n\n## Working Environment and Employee Safety and Health Protection\n\nThe Company's ESH policy is focused on establishing a safe working environment, preventing occupational injury and illness, keeping employees healthy, enhancing every employee's awareness and sense of accountability to ESH, and building a strong ESH culture.\n\nThere were a total of 48 occupational injuries at TSMC in 2023, involving 48 people, representing approximately 0.07% of the total number of employees. The disabling injury frequency rate (FR) was 0.35, under the 0.4 target, and the disability injury severity rate (SR) was 4, not meeting the target of less than 4. TSMC is reviewing potential improvement measures, such as the promotion of safety culture-related posters or animations to strengthen employee safety awareness. By implementing interactive communication training courses on safety culture, TSMC can integrate safety into daily life and encourage employees to proactively discuss safety-related issues. To reduce sports injuries, it is mandatory for the welfare committee and departments to conduct risk identification and hazard reminders before organizing sports activities. The Company continuously observes operations and conducts compliance inspections to identify potential injury risks in the workplace and implement improvement measures to enhance workplace safety. In addition to regular reviews, the caring program for employees has been enhanced and managers have been directed to pay closer attention to the physical and mental state of employees to ensure their safety and health while at work.\n\nTSMC safety and health management operations apply to the following:\n\n## \u25cf  Equipment Safety and Health Management\n\nIn addition to meeting regulatory requirements and internal standards, as well as mitigating ESH-related risks when building or expanding facilities, TSMC also maintains procedures governing new equipment and raw materials, requires safety approvals for bringing new tools online, updates safety rules, and implements seismic protection and other safety measures.\n\nTSMC requires that all new tools meet SEMI-S8 requirements and that appropriate supplementary control measures be taken to reduce ergonomic risk. Moreover, the Company endeavors to automate the transportation of 300mm front-opening unified pods (FOUPs) to prevent cumulative physical injury caused by repetitive manual handling of this equipment. TSMC 300mm fabs have all converted to automatic transportation control.\n\n## \u25cf  Environmental, Safety and Health Evaluation of New Tools and New Chemical Substances\n\nAs a technology leader in the global semiconductor industry, TSMC operates increasingly diversified process tools and introduces new chemicals in the R&D stage.

A total of 417 cases of new tools and chemical substances were approved by the new tool and new chemical review committee in 2023 after they were evaluated and reviewed in accordance with the aforementioned standards and before entering TSMC.\n\n## \u25cf  General Safety Management, Training and Audit\n\nAll TSMC manufacturing facilities hold environmental, safety and health committee meetings on a monthly basis. TSMC has adopted multiple preventive measures such as controls on high-risk work, contractor management, chemical safety management, personal protective equipment requirements, and safety audit management. In addition, the Company maintains detailed disaster response procedures and performs regular drills designed to minimize injuries to employees and damage to property, as well as the impact on society and the environment in the event of a disaster.\n\nTSMC Safety-related Training and Promotion in Recent Two Years\n\n|   Year | Total Number of Employees Who Have Completed  Safety-related Training   |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2023 | 297,403                                                                 |\n|   2022 | 271,702                                                                 |\n\n## \u25cf  Working Environment Hazardous Factors Management\n\nTSMC conducts workplace hazard assessments to provide a comfortable, safe workplace for employees. The Company also educates employees and requires them, when appropriate, to use personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent hazardous exposures.\n\nThe Company performs semi-annual workplace environment assessments of physical and chemical hazards, including CO 2 concentration, illumination, noise, and hazardous chemical substances as regulated by local laws. In addition, TSMC performs exposure assessments and uses hierarchy\n\nmanagement control for chemicals with potential health hazards. If abnormal measurements occur, events happen, or an exposure assessment indicates there is an adverse health effect on employees, ESH professionals immediately conduct onsite observation and intervention to reduce the risk of hazardous factors exposure to acceptable levels.\n\n## \u25cf  Health Promotion Program\n\nIn order to establish the healthiest possible workplace and reduce the incidence of occupational disease, TSMC formed a corporate-level committee to carry out health promotion programs covering three key areas:\n\n- 1.  Exposure and health risk assessment: develop an exposure assessment system to identify high health risk employees.\n- 2.  Hazardous training and notification: use standardized training materials for employees and contractors in all TSMC fabs. Inform them of the health risks and prevention measures at the workplace before they begin working or providing any services there.\n- 3.  Strengthening management of chemicals with significant health risks: request suppliers that all materials they provide to TSMC comply with applicable laws including clear disclosure of any hazardous substances. Perform sampling of raw materials used in the manufacturing process to confirm that they do not contain any carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic-reproductive materials as claimed on supplier's safety data sheet (SDS).\n\n## \u25cf  Emergency Response\n\nThe planning and execution of an effective emergency response requires identifying potential high-risk events via risk assessment and being prepared for various scenarios. It should focus on continuous improvements and drills covering all potentially serious events. TSMC's emergency response plans include procedures for rapid-response crisis management and disaster recovery for potential incidents.\n\nAll TSMC fabs conduct major annual emergency response exercises and evacuation drills. TSMC's onsite service contractors are also required to participate in emergency response planning and exercises to ensure cooperation in handling accidents and to effectively minimize any damage caused by disasters. In 2023, the Company held 132 evacuation drills and 36 fire drills. At least every two years, each fab director invites fab management and support functions to participate in business continuity drills for potentially high-risk events such as earthquake, fire and flood (at the Tainan site). Since 2018, TSMC has conducted complex accident emergency response drills, which include simultaneous scenarios for earthquake, fire and chemical spills to ensure rapid response",

        "page_content": "to emergencies so that losses can be minimized in the event of a real disaster. In 2020, TSMC took the lead in the industry to introduce the all-hazard approach as recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to conduct disaster prevention exercises.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, TSMC added tabletop exercises to disaster prevention training in an effort to minimize the risks of group infections that may arise as a result of full-scale exercises. The inclusion of tabletop exercises also aids in the verification of full-scale exercise procedures to make disaster response more comprehensive, thus effectively mitigating the impact of various types of disasters on business continuity in the future. As of 2023, in addition to 644 sessions of tabletop exercises, 91 full-scale exercises had also been completed.\n\nIn addition to the regular emergency response drills held by engineering and facilities departments each quarter, the Company's laboratory, canteen, dormitory, and shuttle bus personnel also hold emergency response drills to prepare for events such as earthquakes, chemical spills, ammonia release, fires and traffic accidents.\n\n## \u25cf  Emerging Infectious Disease Response\n\nTSMC has a dedicated corporate ESH organization to monitor emerging infectious diseases around the world, to assess any potential impact on the workplace, and to provide an appropriate strategic response plan. In previous outbreaks such as SARS in 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and MERS in 2015, as well as with COVID-19 from 2019 to 2023, TSMC followed the Taiwan CDC's (Center for Disease Control) rules and convened the corporate influenza response committee to develop the Company's strategies. These strategies included educating employees in prevention and response, publishing guidelines for managers, establishing guidelines for employee sick leave, and installing alcohol-based hand sanitizers at appropriate locations. The Committee also monitors the status of employee leave due to illness and, at the same time, develops a continuity plan to address manpower shortages and minimize business impact. For example during the COVID-19 outbreak, in order to protect the health of TSMC employees, their families, and work partners, employees were encouraged to be fully vaccinated if in healthy condition. In addition, TSMC reviewed the situation from time to time and formulated appropriate preventive measures such as daily body temperature checks and updated vaccination information before entering Company facilities and continued to follow epidemic prevention recommendations such as mask wearing, frequent hand washing and social distancing.\n\n## \u25cf  Employee Physical and Mental Health Enhancement\n\nTSMC believes that employee physical and mental health is not only fundamental to maintaining sound business operations but is also an important part of a corporation's responsibility. To preserve and promote the physical and mental health of its employees, TSMC fosters collaboration among the onsite industrial safety and environmental protection department, the onsite medical personnel of the health center, and physicians of occupational medicine. TSMC strives to reduce cerebral and cardiovascular conditions or injuries that might be induced or aggravated by overwork, night work or shift work. The Company conducts programs for maternal health protection and for prevention of cumulative trauma disorders as well. TSMC devotes significant resources to mental health awareness, focused not only on hazards at work but also on employee health in general. In 2023, planned personal health management activities included: (1) 497 female employees participated in the maternal health program, and the completion rate was 100%. 496 of them were at first degree risk, where there was no potential harm to the mother or infant. One female employee was assessed as second degree risk, with potential harm to the mother or infant, but after proper adjustments to her work duties, her risk was downgraded to first degree. (2) Through analysis of historical cerebral and cardiovascular cases of its employees, TSMC sharpened the disease assessment criteria used by contracted doctors, and, in combination with internal annual health examination reports and work scheduling information, the Company was able to identify 2,830 employees with middle to high risk for cerebral and cardiovascular diseases. These employees were provided with health education and medical assistance. Also, they and their managers received recommended changes in working hours and shifts to reduce health risks. (3) 170 employees were identified as high risk for cumulative trauma disorders, including one who might also have job-related risks, and the Company adjusted working conditions accordingly to reduce potential risks. (4) As obesity has been considered as a precursor to hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension and insomnia, TSMC has held health promotion programs for several consecutive years. In 2023, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and catering to the younger generation's preference for social and video media, apart from physical weight loss activities (5,782 participants; total weight loss reached 5,263 kg),TSMC conducted a series of online interactive activities including: (a) Fourteen sessions of 'Health Lecture Online' with 7,142 attendees in total; (b) Nine health workshops with a total of 238 person-times; (c) Activities of World Mental Health Day with a total of 2,189 attendees. The above activities have all received positive\n\nfeedback from employees. In the future, the Company will continue to implement relevant promotional activities to take care of the health of employees.\n\n## 7.2.4 Supplier Management\n\n## Management Aspect\n\nFor better supply chain management, TSMC is committed to communicating with and encouraging its suppliers and contractors to increase their quality, cost effectiveness and delivery performance, and make continuous improvement in supply chain sustainability. Through regular communication with senior managers, site audits and experience sharing, the Company collaborates with major suppliers and contractors to enhance partnerships and ensure continued improvement of performance and increased joint contributions to society. As noted above, contractors performing high-risk activities must lay out clearly defined safety precautions and preventative measures. In addition, contractors working on high-risk engineering projects must establish ISO 45001 or OHSAS 18001 systems and the workers must successfully complete work-related skill training. All contractors performing high-risk activities obtained ISO 45001 certification before the end of 2021.\n\n## Supply Chain Sustainability\n\nTSMC works with suppliers in several fields of sustainable development, such as greening the supply chain, carbon management for climate change, mitigation of fire risk, ESH management and business continuity plans in the event of a natural disaster.\n\nSince becoming a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in 2015, TSMC has completed implementation of the RBA code of conduct throughout the Company by performing self-assessments at its facilities worldwide and reviewing policies and procedures in the areas of labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems.\n\nTo enhance supply chain sustainability and streamline risk management, the Company is committed to collaborating with its suppliers to maintain full compliance with Taiwan's environmental, safety, health and fire protection regulations. TSMC developed a supplier's code of conduct, which affirmed basic labor rights and standards for health, safety, environment, ethics and management systems. TSMC works with suppliers to evaluate the risk and impact on the economy, the environment, and society and to make continuous improvement. The Company has helped boost suppliers' performance of sustainability through experience sharing and\n\ntraining and hopes to establish a world-class semiconductor supply chain that exceeds international standards and serves as a global benchmark.\n\nTSMC is subject to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure rule on conflict minerals released under Rule 13p-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a recognized global leader in the high-tech supply chain, the Company acknowledges its corporate social responsibility to ensure procurement of conflict-free minerals in an effort to recognize humanitarian and ethical social principles that protect the dignity of all people. To this end, TSMC has implemented a series of compliance safeguards in accordance with leading industry practices such as adopting the due diligence framework in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s Model Supply Chain Policy for a Responsible Global Supply Chain of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas, issued in 2011.\n\nTSMC is a strong supporter of the RBA and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). As a member of RBA, TSMC requires suppliers source conflict-free minerals through their jointly developed Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). Since 2011, TSMC has asked its suppliers to disclose and make timely updates on smelters information. The Company encourages suppliers to source minerals from facilities or smelters that have received a 'conformant' designation by a recognized industry group (such as the RMI) and also requires those who have not received such designation to become compliant with RMI or an equivalent third-party audit program. TSMC requires the use of conflict-free tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in its products.\n\nTSMC will continue to conduct the supplier survey annually and require suppliers to improve and expand their disclosure to fulfill regulatory and customer requirements. For further information, see the Company's Form SD filed with the U.S. SEC. (https://investor.tsmc.com/english/sec-filings)\n\n## 7.3 TSMC Education and Culture Foundation\n\nIn 2023, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation focused on three major areas: cultivation of the younger generation, educational collaboration, and promoting arts and culture. In order to meet these objectives, the Foundation committed NT$99 million to work towards achieving three of the United Nations 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs): SDG 4 Quality Education, SDG 5 Gender Equality, and SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities. Foundation activities included organizing trips to science and arts museums for students from rural areas to broaden their horizon,",

        "page_content": "empowering teachers in rural areas to elevate students' literacy, and hosting popular science camps for young women from senior high school so as to spark their interest in STEM fields. In doing so, the Foundation contributed to sustainable development and created a positive impact on our society.\n\n## Create Diverse Platforms, Encourage the Young to Explore More Opportunities\n\nThe TSMC Education and Culture Foundation has long dedicated itself to young people's development. Hence the Foundation regularly organizes science and humanity learning platforms in the various forms of competitions, camps and lectures to spark young students' interest in the humanities and science. The Foundation joins forces with several educational institutes and media outlets to tap into great potential of the younger generation.\n\nFor the eighth TSMC Udreamer, themed 'sowing a seed of dreams,' the Foundation held a special exhibition that combined the dream-building journey of popular science writer Rui-Ming Wang (Fat Fat Tree) and organized events such as a guided ecological tour of the Botanical Garden, lectures and fairs as a way to inspire the younger generation to pursue their dreams. More than 5,000 person-times participated in this series of events reaching a historical high. In addition the Foundation launched the TSMC Udreamer mentorship program whereby 15 TSMC employees joined the mentorship effort to accompany competition teams along their nine-month journey of a dream-building project through professional training workshops and regular experience sharing to help the students be connected with the society and fully realize their potential through a multi-dimensional educational philosophy and design.\n\nFor artistic education to take root in children at an early age, the Foundation teamed up with the Sun Yun-Suan Foundation and the Mandarin Daily News to organize the first TSMC Penmanship Competition, thereby encouraging students to understand the beautiful lines embedded in Chinese characters by utilizing tools found in everyday life and to further enhance their own sense of beauty. The first competition was well-received and drew 4,824 entries. In addition to the Penmanship Competition, the Foundation continued to further develop the art of Chinese calligraphy and seal-carving. The 16 th TSMC Youth Calligraphy and Seal-Carving Competition drew its inspiration from calligraphic characters seen in everyday life on billboards and signboards in the streets, urging the public to observe and appreciate Taiwan's unique signboards in Chinese characters. The Foundation invited\n\ntwo artists, Jun-Lin Ye and Liang-Zhi Ke, for a face-to-face conversation to share their knowledge of font design and calligraphy. The two artists also discussed the information embedded in and aestheticism conveyed through the Chinese characters on signboards. Their talks addressed the essence and beauty of the art of Chinese characters, increasing the public's knowledge of and interest in the arts of calligraphy and seal-carving.\n\nThe TSMC Youth Literature Award, co-organized by TSMC Education and Culture Foundation and the United Daily, celebrated its 20 th anniversary in 2023 and received 13,752 entries. As part of the celebration, the Foundation also held three special literary events: Online Book Exhibitions of Past Award Winners, Risingsun Awards, and Documentary of Portraits of TSMC Youth Literary Writers. The Risingsun Awards grants its award to the most representative works of fiction, essays and contemporary poems as selected by a panel of judges of writers, Wen-Yin Zhong, Yu-Hui Liao and Wen-Wei Xu, from the published works of former TSMC Youth Literature Award winners and upcoming literary stars, which included 22 novels, 15 essays and 17 contemporary poems. The final Risingsun Awards were granted to the tenth award winner Zhen-Fu Xu, the first award winner Jie-An Chen, and the third award winner Zi-Xuan Zhuang. Judging from the list of the winners, it can be said that the literary seeds sown by the TSMC Youth Literature Award over the past 20 years are now growing into a flourishing garden of literature.\n\nApart from the humanities, TSMC Education and Culture Foundation has long promoted popular science education, sponsoring a wide range of science competitions and camps. The Foundation continued its partnership with Center for the Advancement of Science Education of National Taiwan University to hold the TSMC Cup: Competition of Scientific Short Talk, which included two events: competition for expressing scientific innovation and essay awards on reading popular science books, which aim to encourage young students to read popular science books and watch related videos. The events hope to enhance students' capacity to convey scientific knowledge through internalizing skills of analyzing and discussing science with dialectical logic. The competition for expressing scientific innovation, expanded its scope in 2023 and, as a result, not only did students in Taiwan enter the competition, but teams from as far as Malaysia also participated. More than 400 people took part in the two competitions. The Foundation has long funded the three major science camps for gifted students in Taiwan, Chien-Shiung Wu science camp, Ta-You Wu science camp and Marie Curie\n\n(formerly Madame Curie) science camp as a way to cultivate domestic talent in fundamental science. The TSMC Female Scientists Tour, on the other hand, focused on kindling female high school seniors' passion for science. Each year, young women from 12 senior high schools in Taiwan are invited to visit science museums, participate in science workshops and attend talks by female scientists, who can encourage female students to keep on exploring the STEM fields by relating their own education and work experience.\n\n## Work in Tandem with Educational Partners, Realize Quality Education\n\nThe TSMC Education and Culture Foundation works in tandem with public and private educational institutions - schools, NGOs and state-funded arts and educational institutes - to pool available resources and focus on the real needs of the society so as to reach those who need but have no accessible resources and allow quality education to be realized in every corner of Taiwan.\n\nIn 2021 the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation launched a five-year Teaching & Learning Project, in partnership with CommonWealth Magazine Education Foundation and Prof. Hwawei Ko Reading Research Center of National Tsing Hua University. The project aims to improve the measurement and evaluation of learning effectiveness through empowering teachers, to enhance teachers' literacy teaching capacity through technological integration, and to assist teachers in teaching reading comprehension. As the project reached its third year, the teaching plan was adjusted in accordance with actual practice so that the project would better fit the teachers' needs. In doing so, the Teaching & Learning Project gradually transformed from a one-way resource into a two-way communication activity and therefore provided more solid support for school teachers in rural areas. So far 127 teachers and 1,341 students have participated in the project. The Foundation also continued its collaboration with Junyi Academy to develop and promote online courses that cater to the real needs of teachers and students in rural areas and narrowing the gap of available sources between the urban and rural areas. The Foundation also funded scholarships and sponsored free laptops for 101 outstanding students from disadvantaged backgrounds at five national universities: National Central University, National Tsing Hua University, National Chung Cheng University, National Cheng Kung University, and National Sun Yat-sen University so that students from disadvantaged backgrounds can be free of financial worries and focus on their academic performance.\n\nA three-way partnership with the Foundation, the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO), and Taipei National University of the Arts was launched and continued to promote the Music sans frontier Educational Project, which invited internationallyrenown conductor Shao-Chia Lu and NSO's music director Jun Markl to university campuses to broaden music students' horizons. The initiative further arranged internships at the orchestra for the students enrolled in the class as a way to enrich their stage experience. The Foundation also carried on its collaboration with GuoGuang Opera Company to continue its three-year 'on-campus project: Passing on Traditional Theatre Heritage,' starting from 2021. This project offers a year-long course at both National Tsing Hua University and Tunghai University for three years consecutively. The course contents included the knowledge of the theater, Peking Opera analysis and appreciation, Peking Opera performance demonstration, showcasing and combining theoretical knowledge and hands-on performance practices, guiding 115 number of students to learn about and experience the beauty of theater. A public performance is scheduled at the end of this 3-year project that showcases the course's teaching and learning is scheduled to take place at the Main Theater of Taiwan Traditional Theatre Center in 2024. In 2023, TSMC Theater Lectures also broadened its scope. In addition to its partnership in passing on traditional theater with GuoGuang Opera Company, two other theater companies - Taiwan Kunju Opera Theatre and Hsing Legend Youth Theatre - came together to organize events specially designed for high school seniors in Hsinchu, Taichung and Tainan. 1,620 person-times participated in the events, which fostered the appreciation and understanding of traditional theater.\n\nIn 2023, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation enhanced the contents of the TSMC Aesthetics Trip and the TSMC Science Trip from museum trips to in-depth educational courses. The trips still offer students guided tours to important permanent exhibitions at arts and science museums, but they now also offer lectures on art appreciation, hands-on workshops and science workshops with trained lecturers. The lectures guide primary students from rural areas to experience and learn in depth subjects on historical culture and artifacts, arts and aesthetics, architectural landscape and science. Finally, in order to assist junior high school students to appreciate the beauty of literature, the Foundation continued its partnership with Unitas literary magazine to organize the third TSMC Youth Literature Camp at the Emei Junior High School in Hsinchu. The Camp expanded to be an event lasting four days and three nights with the goal of improving literary education for junior high school students and guiding them to appreciate the",

Among the performances, Youthful Whispering, a piece of a dance theater, was choreographed by a youth-run theater company from Hsinchu Plan B Theatre. Fifteen rising stars, selected from roughly 100 who auditioned, were trained intensively over the course of four months. The performers' youthful vivacity and physical rhythm exhibited explosive theatrical energy at their performance at the Moat Park in Hsinchu city and received loud applause and shouts of Bravo! from the 3,000 person-times strong audience from the local community. As part of the effort to promote exquisite performances, there were two other programs: the xiangsheng (traditional Chinese comic dialogues) Qu, Blooming into 30-Year Brilliance, performed by both second and third generation xiangsheng artists. The fact that the piece is taught hands-on to the third generation of young xiangsheng artists such as Ming-Han Song and Yin-Xie Wu by the second generation xiangsheng artists such as De-Gang Zhu, Guang-Yao Fan, and Yi-Jun Ye at the 30-year-old Taipei Qu Company is particularly meaningful as the process embodies the act of passing on tradition. The popular Berliner Barock Solisten, founded by leading members of the Berliner Philharmoniker, together with Yu-Chien Tseng, the prize-winning violinist of the international Tchaikovsky Competition, brought to the audience world-class performances of classical music. The 2023 TSMC Hsinchu Arts Festival organized 47 exquisite performances and exhibitions throughout, attended by over 52,000 person-times community members.\n\nIn addition to fine performances and exhibitions, the Foundation also funds radio programs, helping the public appreciate the beauty of theater and literature. The Stories of Peking Opera radio program on Sound of IC radio station, co-hosted by An-Qi Wang the artistic director of GuoGuang\n\nOpera Company and Prof. Shih-Lung Lo at the Department of Chinese Literature of National Tsing Hua University, introduced the public to fine and elegant theater through analyzing texts and the history of theater and interviewing theater maestros. This program was nominated for the Best Host of Arts and Culture at the 58th Golden Bell Awards. On another front, Yi-Yun Xin, a master in classic Chinese literature who has been presenting a radio lecture on Chinese classics on Sound of IC radio station since 2008, presented a new program in 2023, Yi-Yun Xin on Chinses Fu Verse, focusing on Chinese classical Fu verse and sharing the beauty of classic literature with the audience 1.62 million person-times tuned in to listen to the two programs: Stories of Peking Opera and Yi-Yun Xin on Chinese Classical Fu Verse.\n\nAs a way to enrich university campuses with arts and culture, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation organizes the annual TSMC Lectures series at the end of each year. The lectures series invites renowned scholars in the humanities to introduce the public and college students to the richness of literature, history and philosophy. In 2023, the series specifically invited Yu-Shan Wu, academician at and founder of Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, to discuss Russia-Ukraine War. By analyzing the historical roots and the power dynamics between large and small countries, academician Wu offered a systematic analysis of this international war and what can be learned from it. Nearly a thousand community members attended the lectures.\n\n## 7.4 TSMC Charity Foundation\n\nEstablished in 2017 and led by its chairperson Sophie Chang, the TSMC Charity Foundation (the Foundation) focuses on empowering communities in rural and suburban areas in three ways: education empowerment, taking care of the elderly, and protecting the environment. Internally, the Foundation calls on TSMC volunteers' onsite/online services to address social inequalities and leverages its industrial network advantages to strengthen cooperation with local governments, enterprises and universities externally. Both the Foundation and the TSMC volunteers were committed to providing educational, medical and social welfare resources to children in rural schools or disadvantaged educational institutions, as well as to their families who were in urgent need of financial support, to help cultivate long-term career capabilities and improve their quality of life independently. The Foundation continued to operate the Sending Love platform to strengthen the cooperation among enterprises, local governments and universities so as to strengthen local services and jointly uplift society.\n\nIn 2023, the Foundation demonstrated its dedication to investing in public welfare and expanding projects to improve its scope of services:\n\n## \u25cf  Education Empowerment\n\nThe Foundation continuously provides educational and living assistance to institutes in need and to children in rural areas, including volunteer services, economic support, food supplies and the purchase of digital learning equipment and materials. From 2022, the Foundation focused on rural students' employability. In 2023, the Foundation worked with six city governments to organize job fairs for senior high and vocational high school students, with career exploration and job placement designed as the main highlights. The aim was to focus resources on these two issues to help students identify certain targets early on and discover even more diverse career options, which eventually benefited more than 12,000 participants. In helping rural students obtain the skills to work locally, four enterprises, IKEA, LDC Hotels & Resorts Group, Howard Resort Xitou Hotel, and Panasonic Taiwan Co., Ltd., joined in 2023 to give training to seven senior vocational high schools and extended job offers to 68 students. The Foundation also spread the acknowledgement of vocational education by organizing a junior high school vocational expo and parent-child career workshops, as well as collaborating with 104 JOB BANK to promote the Road to Employment Program, inviting 104 professionals to appear on film and share their career stories. A dedicated website was also built to showcase these stories, encouraging students to use them as a reference in choosing their career paths.\n\nThe Foundation assisted 31,133 students from rural areas in 2023. TSMC volunteers used their professional knowledge to develop science popularization AI lesson plans with ideas generated by ChatGPT, which were later modularized and promoted to 35 science education activities by the Foundation, benefiting a total of 1,093 children.\n\nThe Foundation's Sending Love platform initiative visited and screened disadvantaged individuals in need of financial support and also provided financial assistance and daily necessities made possible by internal and external donations from TSMC to improve the living conditions of highly vulnerable and disadvantaged families. As of 2023, the Foundation had supported a total of 295 families.\n\n## \u25cf  Taking Care of the Elderly\n\nThe Foundation collaborates with Network of Compassion partners to enhance the health and welfare of solitary elders by connecting them with social welfare groups and medical\n\nunits. In 2022, the Foundation cooperated with National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and Guandau Hospital to establish a smart exercise club for the elderly, and introduce the TSMC volunteer services to prevent disability and delay aging through exercise. In 2023, the Foundation launched the adaptability assessment system for TSMC volunteers. The system not only provides guidance for employees to join the volunteer team but also encourages retired colleagues to explore themselves. With the Foundation's volunteer training programs, the TSMC retired colleagues can contribute their experience and knowledge to society, thus better managing their next stage of life.\n\n## \u25cf  Protecting the Environment\n\nThe Foundation helped disadvantaged social welfare institutes to increase the use of green energy and save power, while also continuing to implement the Cherish Food program to reduce resource waste. The Green Energy for the Disadvantaged project was launched in 2021, and by 2023 the Foundation had installed solar panels at seven social welfare institutes, which can supplement these institutes' operating expenses by selling green energy. The LED Lighting Replacement program helped 240 schools to reduce electricity costs by at least 30% with energy-saving lights. In the Cherish Food program, the Foundation continued to work with many food companies to donate out-of-spec foods to 150 disadvantaged social welfare institutes in order to provide children with after-school snacks, thereby reducing food waste. Current collaborators include Chi Mei Frozen Food Co., Ltd., Hunya Food Co., Ltd., Laurel Corporation, Lian-Hwa Foods Corp., Hsin Tung Yang Co., Ltd., and Lao Xie Zhen Co., Ltd.\n\n## 7.5 TSMC i-Charity\n\nThe TSMC i-Charity platform, launched in 2014, is an interactive intranet site that employees use to propose charity projects, share project results, provide suggestions and responses, and conduct timely funding of activities to give back to society.\n\nIn 2023, a total of 62,351 people donated more than NT$71.68 million to support programs such as Lighting Up the Rural Learning Dream, Delivery of Fruit and Vegetables from Sheltered Farms, and four regular fundraising projects in helping baseball sports and academic education in rural areas and other fundraising projects.\n\nThe TSMC i-Charity platform has accumulated more than NT$343 million in donations since its inception in 2014. TSMC continues to carry out its social commitments and encourages its employees to care for and give back to society in various ways.",

        "page_content": "Key audit matter for the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 is stated as follows:\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (PP&E) -commencement of depreciation related to PP&E classified as equipment under installation and construction in progress (EUI/CIP)\n\nRefer to Notes 4, 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Company's evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on when depreciation is recognized.\n\nGiven the subjectivity in determining the date to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company's judgmen ts and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment. Consequently, the validity of commencement of depreciation related to PP&E classified as EUI/CIP is identified as a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures related to the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP included the following, among others:\n\n- 1. We read the Company's policy and understood the criteria used to determine when to commence depreciation.\n- 2. We tested the effectiveness of the controls over the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP.\n- 3. We sampled the year-end balance of EUI/CIP and performed the following for each selection:\n- a. Evaluated  whether  the  selection  did  not  meet  the  criteria  specified  by  the  Company  for commencement of depreciation.\n- b. Observed the assets and evaluated their status.\n- 4. We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation during the year.\n- 5. We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation subsequent to year end.\n\n## Other Matter\n\nWe have also audited the parent company only financial statements of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 on which we have issued an unmodified opinion.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and the IFRS, IAS, IFRIC, and SIC endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China, and for such internal control as management\n\n- 5 -",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal contro l.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date o f our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n- 6 -",

GENERAL\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), a Republic of China (R.O.C.) corporation, was incorporated on February 21, 1987. TSMC is a dedicated foundry in the semiconductor industry which engages mainly in the manufacturing, sales, packaging, testing and computer-aided design of integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices and the manufacturing of masks.\n\nOn September 5, 1994, TSMC's shares were listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE). On October 8, 1997, TSMC listed some of its shares of stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADSs).\n\nThe address of its registered office and principal place of business is No. 8, Li-Hsin Rd. 6, Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan. The principal operati ng activities of TSMC's subsidiaries are described in Note 4.\n\n## 2.  THE AUTHORIZATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements were approved and authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on February 6, 2024.\n\n## 3.  APPLICATION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS\n\n- a. Initial  application  of  the  amendments  to  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS), IFRIC Interpretations (IFRIC), and SIC Interpretations (SIC) (collectively, 'IFRS Accounting Standards') endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)\n\nExcept for the following, the initial application of the amendments to the IFRS Accounting Standards endorsed and issued into effect by the FSC did not have a material impact on the accounting policies of TSMC and its subsidiaries (collectively as the 'Company'):\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 'International Tax Reform -Pillar Two Model Rules'\n\nThe amendments introduce a temporary exception to the requirements in IAS 12 by stipulating that the Company should neither recognize nor disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. The amendments also require the Company to disclose that it has applied the exception and separately disclose its current tax expense (income) related to Pillar Two income taxes. In addition, for periods in which Pillar Two legislation is enacted or substantively enacted but not yet in effect, the Company should disclose qualitative and quantitative information that helps users of financial statements understand the Company's exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. The requirement that the Company applies the exception and the requirement to disclose that fact is applied immediately upon issuance of the amendments in May 2023. The remaining disclosure requirements are applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, but not for any interim period ending on or before December 31, 2023.\n\n- 14 -",

The related impact will be disclosed when the Company completes its evaluation.\n\n## 4.  SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\n\nFor the convenience of readers, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated into English from the original Chinese version prepared and used in the R.O.C. If there is any conflict between the English version and the original Chinese version or any difference in the interpretation of the two versions, the Chinese-language consolidated financial statements shall prevail.\n\n## Statement of Compliance\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and the IFRS Accounting Standards endorsed by the FSC with the effective dates (collectively, 'Taiwan -IFRS Accounting Standards').\n\n## Basis of Preparation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\n## The basis for the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of TSMC and entities controlled by TSMC (its subsidiaries).\n\nIncome and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Company.\n\n- 15 -",

Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the parent.\n\nWhen the Company loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between:\n\n- a. the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest at the date when control is lost; and\n- b. the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interest.\n\nThe Company shall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate.\n\n## The subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe detail information of the subsidiaries at the end of reporting period was as follows:\n\n|                  |                                                                   |                                                                                                                   | Establishment                    | Percentage of Ownership   | Percentage of Ownership   |        |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------|\n| Name of Investor | Name of Investee                                                  | Main Businesses and Products                                                                                      | and Operating  Location          | December 31,  2023        | December 31,  2022        | Note   |\n| TSMC             | TSMC North America                                                | Sales and marketing of integrated  circuits and other semiconductor  devices                                      | San Jose, California,  U.S.A.    | 100%                      | 100%                      | -      |\n|                  | TSMC Europe B.V.

The functional currency of TSMC and presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements are both New Taiwan Dollars (NT$). In  preparing the consolidated financial statements, the operating results and financial positions of each consolidated entity are translated into NT$.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of each individual consolidated entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Such exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are also recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.\n\nFor the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations are translated into NT$ using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (attributed to noncontrolling interests as appropriate).\n\n## Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities\n\nCurrent assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash, sold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are obligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year from the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.\n\n- 17 -",

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial Assets\n\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were classified in the same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.\n\n## a. Category of financial assets and measurement\n\nFinancial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI, and financial assets at amortized cost.\n\n## 1)  Financial asset at FVTPL\n\nFor certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset.\n\n## 2)  Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI\n\nDebt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, are measured at FVTOCI.\n\nInterest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment gains or losses on investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss. Other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to profit or loss when these debt instruments are disposed.\n\n## 3)  Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI\n\nOn initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate investments in equity investments that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI.\n\n- 18 -",

Impairment of financial assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI.\n\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\nThe Company recognizes an impairment loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding  adjustment  to  their  carrying  amount  through  a  loss  allowance  account,  except  for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, for which the loss allowance is recognized in other comprehensive income and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\n## c. Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another entity.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss.

Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured either at amortized cost using effective interest method or at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is either held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities other than those held for trading purposes and designated as at FVTPL are subsequently measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe Company derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company's obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative financial instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.\n\n## Hedge Accounting\n\n## a. Fair value hedge\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as interest rate futures contracts, to partially hedge against the fair value change caused by interest rates fluctuation in the Company's fixed income investments. Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognized in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged items that are attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n- 20 -",

Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as forward contracts, to partially hedge its foreign  exchange  rate  risks  or  interest  rate  risks  associated  with  certain  highly  probable  forecast transactions (capital expenditures or issuance of debts). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income. When forecast transactions actually take place, the accumulated gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are transferred from equity to the initial cost of the hedged items, or reclassified to finance costs of hedged items in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss. The gains or losses from hedging instruments relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria; for instance, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\n\n## c. Hedges of net investments in foreign operations\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as bank loans denominated in foreign currency, as a hedge of net investments in foreign operations to manage the exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations due to currency fluctuations. Any gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of foreign currency translation reserve. The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge, which were accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve, are reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at standard cost and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price of inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method are investments in associates.\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nThe operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the assoc iate as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.\n\nAny excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n- 21 -",

        "page_content": "When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.\n\nThe Company discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the Company ceases to have significant influence over an associate. When the Company retains an interest in the former associate, the Company measures the retained interest at fair value at that date. The difference between the carrying amount of the associate at the date the equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from disposing of a part interest in the associate is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the associate. In addition, the Company shall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate on the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. If the Company's ownership interest in an associate is reduced as a result of disposal, but the investment continues to  be an  associate, the Company should reclassify to profit or loss only a proportionate amount of the gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nWhen the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the Company's proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate. The Company records such a difference as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the Company's ownership interest is reduced due to the additional subscription to the shares of associate by other investors, the proportionate amount of the gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate shall be reclassified to profit or loss on the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\nWhen a consolidated entity transacts with an associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the associate are recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not owned by the Company.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated impairment. Costs include any incremental costs that are directly attributable to the construction, acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment or borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognized impairment loss. Such assets are classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other identical categories of property, plant and equipment, commences when the assets are available for their intended use.\n\nDepreciation is recognized so as to write off the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful lives, and it is computed using the straight-line method mainly over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements - 20 years; buildings (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 10 to 20 years; machinery and equipment (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) 5 years; and office equipment - 5 years. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. Land is not depreciated.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n- 22 -",

The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement date, plus an estimate of costs needed to restore the underlying assets. Subsequent measurement is calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for changes in lease liabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets.\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rates.\n\nSubsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther separately acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period; patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method\n\n- 23 -",

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company's cash -generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers' specified locations.\n\nRevenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally made and adjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\n\n- 24 -",

Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\n## Short-term employee benefits\n\nLiabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nFor defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations.\n\nDefined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nNet defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company's defined benefit plan.\n\n## Treasury Stock\n\nTreasury stock represents the outstanding shares that the Company buys back from market, which is stated at cost and shown as a deduction in shareholders' equity. When the Company retires treasury stock, the treasury stock account is reduced and the common stock as well as the capital surplus - additional paid-in capital are reversed on a pro rata basis. When the book value of the treasury stock exceeds the sum of the par value and additional paid-in capital, the difference is charged to capital surplus - treasury stock transactions and to retained earnings for any remaining amount.\n\n## Share-based payment arrangements\n\n- a. Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements\n\nRestricted shares for employees are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the fair value at the grant date and the Company's best estimate of the number expected to ultimately vest, with a corresponding increase in other equity - unearned employee benefits.\n\nWhen restricted shares for employees are issued, other equity - unearned employee benefits is recognized on the grant date, with a corresponding increase in capital surplus - restricted shares for employees. Dividends paid to employees on restricted shares which do not need to be returned if employees resign in the vesting period are recognized as expenses upon the dividend declaration with a corresponding adjustment in retained earnings.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of restricted shares for employees that are expected to vest. The impact from such revision is recognized in profit or loss so that the cumulative expenses reflect the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to capital surplus - restricted shares for employees.\n\n- 25 -",

At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Taxation\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\n\n## Current tax\n\nIncome tax on unappropriated earnings (excluding earnings from foreign consolidated subsidiaries) is expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation of earnings which is the year subsequent to the year the earnings are generated.\n\nAdjustments of prior years' tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year's tax provision.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\n\n## Current and deferred tax for the year\n\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\n\n- 26 -",

Government grants that are receivables as compensation for expenses already incurred are deducted from incurred expenses in the period in which they become receivables.\n\n## 5.  MATERIAL  ACCOUNTING  JUDGMENTS  AND  KEY  SOURCES  OF  ESTIMATION  AND UNCERTAINTY\n\nIn the application of the aforementioned Company's accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions  are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.\n\n## Material Accounting Judgments\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.\n\n## Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)\n\nAs described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available  for  their  intended  use  involves  subjective  judgments  and  assumptions  about  the  conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.\n\n## Judgments on Lease Terms\n\nIn determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from  the  commencement  date  until  the  exercise  date  of  the  option.  Main  factors  considered  include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the lessee's operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.\n\n## Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty\n\n## Estimation of Sales Returns and Allowances\n\nSales  returns  and  other  allowance  is  estimated  and  recorded  based  on  historical  experience  and  in consideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.\n\n- 27 -",

The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.\n\n## Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill\n\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue  and  expenses  related  to  the  specific  asset  groups  with  the  consideration  of  the  nature  of semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.\n\n## Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\n\n## Determination of Lessees' Incremental Borrowing Rates\n\nIn determining a lessee's incremental borrow ing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company mainly takes into account the market riskfree rates, the estimated lessee's credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.\n\n## 6.

The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%. The forward contracts have maturities of 12 months or less.\n\nOn the basis of economic relationships, the Company expects that the value of forward contracts and the value of hedged transactions will change in opposite directions in response to movements in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.\n\nThe main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the effect of the counterparty's own credit risk on the fair value of forward contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, refer to Note 20(d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments, the amount transferred to initial carrying amount of hedged items and the amount reclassified to finance costs of hedged items.\n\n- 32 -",

No other sources of ineffectiveness have emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, refer to Note 20 (d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments.\n\nThe following tables summarize the information relating to the hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\n\n## December 31, 2023\n\n| Hedging Instruments   | Contract  Amount  (In Thousands)   | Annual  Interest Rate   | Maturity     | Balance in  Other Equity  (Continuing  Hedges)   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Bank loans            | JPY124,500,000                     | 0%                      | Due by April | $  618,180                                       |\n\n2024\n\nThe effect for the years ended December 31, 2023 is detailed below:\n\n| Hedging Instruments/Hedged Items      | Change in  Value Used for  Calculating  Hedge Ineffectiveness  Year Ended  December 31,  2023   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hedging Instruments                   |                                                                                                 |\n| Bank loans                            | $  618,180                                                                                      |\n| Hedged Items                          |                                                                                                 |\n| Net investments in foreign operations | $ (618,180)                                                                                     |\n\n- 33 -",

These accounts receivable are classified as at FVTOCI because they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.\n\nIn principle, the payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 15-30 days from the end of the month when the invoice is issued. Aside from recognizing impairment loss for credit-impaired accounts receivable, the Company recognizes loss allowance based on the expected credit loss ratio of customers by different risk levels with consideration of factors of historic al loss ratios and customers' financial conditions, competitiveness and business outlook. For accounts receivable past due over 90 days without collaterals or guarantees, the Company recognizes loss allowance at full amount.\n\n## Aging analysis of notes and accounts receivable\n\n|                         | December 31,  2023   | December 31,  2022   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Not past due            | $  183,188,499       | $  205,053,142       |\n| Past due                |                      |                      |\n| Past due within 30 days | 18,641,148           | 24,516,277           |\n| Past due over 31 days   | 15,821               | 518,114              |\n| Less: Loss allowance    | (531,554)            | (331,646)            |\n\nAll of the Company's accounts receivable classified as at FVTOCI were not past due.\n\n## Movements of the loss allowance for accounts receivable\n\n|                                 | Years Ended December 31   | Years Ended December 31   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                 | 2023                      | 2022                      |\n| Balance, beginning of year      | $  331,646                | $  347,020                |\n| Provision (Reversal)            | 199,922                   | (15,449)                  |\n| Effect of exchange rate changes | (14)                      | 75                        |\n| Balance, end of year            | $  531,554                | $  331,646                |\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the changes in loss allowance were mainly due to the variations in the balance of accounts receivable of different risk levels.\n\n- 34 -",

Pursuant to the Act, TSMC and VisEra Tech have made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee's monthly salary to employees' pension accounts. Furthermore, TSMC North America, TSMC Europe, TSMC Japan, TSMC JDC, TSMC 3DIC, TSMC China, TSMC Nanjing, TSMC Arizona, JASM, TSMC Technology and TSMC Canada also make monthly contributions at certain percentages of the basic salary of their employees. Accordingly, the Company recognized expenses of NT$5,365,458 thousand and NT$4,550,387 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## b. Defined benefit plans\n\nTSMC has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee's length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee's name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of March of the next year. The Funds are operated and managed by the government's designated authorities; as such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Funds.\n\nAmounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:\n\n|                                                                               | Years Ended December 31   | Years Ended December 31   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                               | 2023                      | 2022                      |\n| Current service cost                                                          | $  139,101                | $  134,376                |\n| Net interest expense                                                          | 142,291                   | 74,265                    |\n| Components of defined benefit costs recognized in profit or loss              | 281,392                   | 208,641                   |\n| Remeasurement on the net defined benefit liability:                           |                           |                           |\n| Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net  interest expense)   | (16,252)                  | (429,948)                 |\n| Actuarial loss arising from experience adjustments                            | 68,342                    | 1,413,760                 |\n| Actuarial (gain) loss arising from changes in financial  assumptions          | 571,266                   | (160,752)                 |\n| Components of defined benefit costs recognized in other  comprehensive income | 623,356                   | 823,060                   |\n| Total                                                                         | $  904,748                | $  1,031,701              |\n\nThe pension costs of the aforementioned defined benefit plans were recognized in profit or loss by the following categories:\n\n|                                     | Years Ended December 31   | Years Ended December 31   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                     | 2023                      | 2022                      |\n| Cost of revenue                     | $  182,333                | $  135,125                |\n| Research and development expenses   | 76,120                    | 55,632                    |\n| General and administrative expenses | 19,248                    | 15,129                    |\n| Marketing expenses                  | 3,691                     | 2,755                     |\n|                                     | $  281,392                | $  208,641                |\n\n- 45 -",

Labor Standards Law, the Company is exposed to the following risks:\n\n- 2)  Interest risk: A decrease in the government bond interest rate will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the debt investments of the plan assets.\n- Assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rate at the end of the reporting period contributed to a decrease of 0.5% (and not below 0.0%) in the discount rate and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$757,663 thousand and NT$766,692 thousand as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n- 3)  Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation.\n- Assuming the expected salary rate increases by 0.5% at the end of the reporting period and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$735,167 thousand and NT$746,933 thousand as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\nFurthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability.\n\nThe Company expects to make contributions of NT$991,646 thousand to the defined benefit plans in the next year starting from December 31, 2023. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 8 years.\n\n- 47 -",

Retained earnings and dividend policy\n\nTSMC's Articles of Incorporation provide that, earnings distribution may be made on a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by TSMC's Board of Directors and reported to TSMC's shareholders in its meeting. When allocating earnings, TSMC shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals TSMC's paid -in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and TSMC's Articles of Incorporation.\n\nTSMC's Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of TSMC may be distributed by way of ca sh dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.\n\nThe legal capital reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.\n\nPursuant to existing regulations, the  Company is required to set aside an additional special capital reserve equivalent to the net debit balance of the other components of stockholders' equity, such as the accumulated balance of the foreign currency translation reserve, the effectiveness of hedges of net investments in foreign operations, unrealized valuation gain or loss from fair value through other comprehensive income financial assets, gain or loss from changes in fair value of hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, etc. For the subseque nt decrease in the deduction amount to stockholders' equity, any special reserve appropriated may be reversed to the extent that the net debit balance reverses.\n\nThe appropriations of 2023, 2022 and 2021 quarterly earnings have been approved by TSMC's Boar d of Directors in its meeting, respectively. The appropriations and cash dividends per share were as follows:\n\n| Resolution Date of TSMC's      Board of Directors in its      meeting   | Fourth Quarter    Third Quarter    Second Quarter    of 2023  February 6,    2024   | of 2023  November 14,  2023            | of 2023  August 8,  2023   | First Quarter of 2023 May 9, 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Special capital reserve                                                 | $                                                                                   | 28,020,822      $  (17,228,363)      $ | (6,365,562)      $         | 3,273,452                           |\n| Cash dividends to shareholders                                          | $  90,762,248      $                                                                | 90,762,248      $                      | 77,796,213      $          | 77,796,213                          |\n| Cash dividends per share (NT$)                                          | $  3.50                                                                             | $  3.50                                | $  3.00                    | $  3.00                             |\n\n- 49 -",

Financial risk management objectives\n\nThe Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk with the objective to reduce the potentially adverse effects the market uncertainties may have on its financial performance.\n\nThe plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee and/or Board of Directors in accordance with procedures required by relevant regulations or internal controls. During the implementation of such plans, the Company must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide guiding principles for overall financial risk management and segregation of duties.\n\n## c. Market risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nSubstantially all the Company's sales are denominated in U.S. do llars and over half of its capital expenditures and equity investments are denominated in currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchanges rate of NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. The Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts and non-derivative financial instruments, such as currency forwards, currency swaps and bank loans denominated in foreign currency, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, certain forecasted transactions, and net investments in foreign operations. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company's total monetary assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% would have decreased its net income by NT$891,039 thousand and NT$1,704,553 thousand, respectively, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.\n\n- 63 -",

        "page_content": "The majority of the Company's fixed income investments are fixed -rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at FVTOCI and amortized cost. Those classified as FVTOCI may have their fair value adversely affected due to an increase in interest rates, but for those classified as amortized cost, their carrying amount will not be affected by changes in interest rates. At the same time, if interest rates fall, cash and cash equivalents may generate less interest income than expected. The Company has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company's fixed income investm ents at the end of the reporting period, interest rates increase of 100 basis points (1.00%) across all maturities would have decreased the Company's other comprehensive income by NT$3,841,994 thousand and NT$3,831,326 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe majority of the Company's debt is fixed -rate and measured at amortized cost and as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.\n\n## Other price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to mutual funds and equity price risk arising from financial assets at FVTPL and FVTOCI.\n\nAssuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the mutual funds and equity investments at the end of the reporting period, the net income would have decreased by NT$1,073,397 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the other comprehensive income would have decreased by NT$954,925 thousand and NT$631,530 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## d. Credit risk management\n\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty may default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities, primarily accounts receivable, and from investing activities, primarily deposits, fixed-income investments and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed separately for business related and financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company's maximum credit risk exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.\n\n## Business related credit risk\n\nThe Company's accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company's outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has procedures to monitor and manage credit risk exposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit risk. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's ten largest customers accounted for 91% and 82% of accounts receivable, respectively. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the remaining accounts receivable not material.\n\n## Financial credit risk\n\nThe Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment grade credit ratings and by limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty. The Company regularly monitors and reviews the limit applied to counterparties and adjusts the limit according to market conditions and the credit standing of the counterparties.\n\nThe objective of the Company's investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires securities to be\n\n- 64 -",

The changes were mainly due to increased investment amount and adjusted investment portfolio.\n\n## e. Liquidity risk management\n\nThe objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its business operations over the next 12 months. The Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at FVTOCI-current, financial assets at amortized cost-current and sufficient cost-efficient funding.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  the  maturity  profile  of  the  Company's  financial  liabilities  based  on contractual undiscounted payments, including principal and interest.\n\n|                                                                                                               | Less Than    1 Year   | 1-3 Years   | 3-5 Years   | More Than    5 Years   | Total         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|------------------------|---------------|\n| December 31, 2023                                                                                             |                       |             |             |                        |               |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities                                                                          |                       |             |             |                        |               |\n| Hedging financial liabilities-bank  loans                                                                     | $  27,290,400         | $  -        | $  -        | $  -                   | $  27,290,400 |\n| Accounts payable (including related  parties)                                                                 | 57,293,057            | -           | -           | -                      | 57,293,057    |\n| Payables to contractors and  equipment suppliers                                                              | 171,484,616           | -           | -           | -                      | 171,484,616   |\n| Accrued expenses and other current  liabilities                                                               | 241,118,948           | -           | -           | -                      | 241,118,948   |\n| Bonds payable                                                                                                 | 24,890,500            | 224,062,937 | 303,525,276 | 583,364,167            | 1,135,842,880 |\n| Long-term bank loans                                                                                          | 2,371,296             | 3,889,029   | 585,094     | -                      | 6,845,419     |\n| Lease liabilities (including those  classified under accrued expenses  and other current liabilities)  (Note) | 3,181,651             | 5,248,337   | 4,662,868   | 21,754,375             | 34,847,231    |\n| Others                                                                                                        | -                     | 165,188,432 | 6,303,135   | 2,908,666              | 174,400,233   |\n|                                                                                                               | 527,630,468           | 398,388,735 | 315,076,373 | 608,027,208            | 1,849,122,784 |\n\n(Continued)\n\n- 65 -",

On December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company uses unobservable inputs derived from discount for lack of marketability of 10%. When other inputs remain equal, the fair value will decrease by NT$52,704 thousand and NT48,704 thousand, respectively, if discounts for lack of marketability increase by 1%.\n\nFor the remaining few investments, the market approach is used to arrive at their fair values, for which the recent financing activities of investees, the market transaction prices of the similar companies and market conditions are considered.\n\nIn addition, the fair values of convertible preferred stocks and convertible bonds are prior transaction prices.\n\n- 3)  Fair value of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value\n\nExcept as detailed in the following table, the Company considers that the carrying amounts of financial instruments in the consolidated financial  statements that are not measured at fair value approximate their fair values.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe table below sets out the fair value hierarchy for the Company's financial assets and liabilities which are not required to be measured at fair value:\n\n|                                     | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                     | Carrying            | Fair Value          | Fair Value          | Fair Value          |\n|                                     | Amount              | Level 1             | Level 2             | Total               |\n| Financial assets                    |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Financial assets at amortized costs |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Corporate bonds                     | $  113,785,324      | $  -                | $  113,694,397      | $  113,694,397      |\n| Commercial paper                    | 18,371,705          | -                   | 18,385,329          | 18,385,329          |\n| Government bonds/Agency             |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| bonds                               | 13,803,559          | 2,751,893           | 11,053,234          | 13,805,127          |\n|                                     | $  145,960,588      | $  2,751,893        | $  143,132,960      | $  145,884,853      |\n|                                     |                     |                     |                     | (Continued)         |\n\n- 69 -",

SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND UNRECOGNIZED COMMITMENTS\n\nSignificant contingent liabilities and unrecognized commitments of the Company as of the end of the reporting period, excluding those disclosed in other notes, were as follows:\n\n- a. Under a technical cooperation agreement with Industrial Technology Research Institute, the R.O.C. Government or its designee approved by TSMC can use up to 35% of TSMC's capacity provided TSMC's outstanding commitments to its customers are not prejudiced. The term of this agreement is for five years beginning from January 1, 1987 and is automatically renewed for successive periods of five years unless otherwise terminated by either party with one year prior notice. As of the end of reporting period, the R.O.C. Government did not invoke such right.\n- b. Under a Shareholders Agreement entered into with Philips and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. on March 30, 1999, the parties formed a joint venture company, SSMC, which is an integrated circuit foundry in Singapore. TSMC's equity int erest in SSMC was 32%. Nevertheless, in September 2006, Philips spun-off its semiconductor subsidiary which was renamed as NXP B.V. Further, TSMC and NXP B.V. purchased  all  the  SSMC  shares  owned  by  EDB  Investments  Pte  Ltd.  pro  rata  according  to  the Shareholders Agreement on November 15, 2006. After the purchase, TSMC and NXP B.V. currently own approximately 39% and 61% of the SSMC shares, respectively. TSMC and NXP B.V. are required, in the aggregate, to purchase at least 70% of SSMC's capacity, but TSMC al one is not required to purchase more than 28% of the capacity. If any party defaults on the commitment and the capacity utilization of SSMC falls below a specific percentage of its capacity, the defaulting party is required to compensate SSMC for all related unavoidable costs. There was no default from the aforementioned commitment as of the end of reporting period.\n- c. In September 2022, Daedalus Prime LLC ('Daedalus') filed complaints in the U.S. International Trade Commission ('ITC') and the U.S. Distric t Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC, TSMC  North  America,  and  other  companies  infringe  four  U.S.  patents.  The  ITC  instituted  an investigation in October 2022. In June 2023, Daedalus dropped two of the asserted patents in the ITC. Also in June 2023, Daedalus filed another complaint in the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC infringes five U.S. patents. In September 2023, the ITC granted the parties' joint motion to suspend the procedural schedule while the parties finalize the settlement agreement and then request termination of the ITC Investigation and related litigations. In October 2023, the parties jointly requested the ITC to terminate the investigation and Eastern District of Texas to dismiss the related litigations. In November 2023, the ITC investigation was terminated and the related litigations in the Eastern District of Texas were dismissed.\n- d. TSMC entered into long-term purchase agreements of materials and supplies and agreements of waste disposal with multiple suppliers. The relative minimum fulfillment quantity and price are specified in the agreements.\n- e. TSMC entered into a long-term purchase agreement of equipment. The relative fulfillment quantity and price are specified in the agreement.\n- f. TSMC  entered  into  long-term  energy  purchase  agreements  with  multiple  suppliers.  The  relative fulfillment period, quantity and price are specified in the agreements.\n- g. Amounts available under unused letters of credit as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were NT$433,994 thousand and NT$383,974 thousand, respectively.\n- h.

Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on when depreciation is recognized.\n\nGiven the subjectivity in determining the date to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company's judgments and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment. Consequently, the validity of commencement of depreciation related to PP&E classified as EUI/CIP is identified as a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures related to the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP included the following, among others:\n\n- 1. We read the Company's policy and understood the criteria used to determine when to commence depreciation.\n- 2. We tested the effectiveness of the controls over the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP.\n- 3. We sampled the year-end balance of EUI/CIP and performed the following for each selection:\n- a. Evaluated whether the selection did not meet the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation.\n- b. Observed the assets and evaluated their status.\n- 4. We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation during the year.\n- 5. We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation subsequent to year end.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management  and Those Charged with Governance for the Parent Company Only Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the parent company only financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of parent company only financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  parent  company  only  financial  statements,  management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance (including members of the Audit and Risk Committee) are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Parent Company Only Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the parent company only financial statements as a whole are f ree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement  when  it  exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these parent company only financial statements.\n\n- 114 -",

        "page_content": "As part of an audit in accordance with  the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China,  we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the parent company only financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of managem ent's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the parent company only financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusi ons are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the parent company only financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the parent company only financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- 6. Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the parent company only financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the parent company only financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n- 115 -",

GENERAL\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (the 'Company' or 'TSMC'), a Republic of China (R.O.C.) corporation, was incorporated on February 21, 1987. The Company is a dedicated foundry in the semiconductor industry which engages mainly in the manufacturing, sales, packaging, testing and computeraided design of integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices and the manufacturing of masks.\n\nOn September 5, 1994, the Company's shares were listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE). On October 8, 1997, the Company listed some of its shares of stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADSs).\n\nThe address of its registered office and principal place of business is No. 8, Li-Hsin Rd. 6, Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan.\n\n## 2.  THE AUTHORIZATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe accompanying parent company only financial statements were approved and authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on February 6, 2024.\n\n## 3.  APPLICATION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS\n\n- a. Initial  application  of  the  amendments  to  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS), IFRIC Interpretations (IFRIC), and SIC Interpretations (SIC) (collectively, 'IFRS Accounting Standards') endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)\n\nExcept for the following, the initial application of the amendments to the IFRS Accounting Standards endorsed and issued into effect by the FSC did not have a material impact on the accounting policies of the Company:\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 'International Tax Reform - Pi llar Two Model Rules'\n\nThe amendments introduce a temporary exception to the requirements in IAS 12 by stipulating that the Company should neither recognize nor disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. The amendments also require the Company to disclose that it has applied the exception and separately disclose its current tax expense (income) related to Pillar Two income taxes. In addition, for periods in which Pillar Two legislation is enacted or substantively enacted but not yet in effect, the Company should disclose qualitative and quantitative information that helps users of financial statements understand the Company's exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. The requirement that the Company applies the exception and the requirement to disclose that fact is applied immediately upon issuance of the amendments in May 2023. The remaining disclosure requirements are applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, but not for any interim period ending on or before December 31, 2023.\n\n- 123 -",

The related impact will be disclosed when the Company completes its evaluation.\n\n## 4.  SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\n\nFor the convenience of readers, the accompanying parent company only  financial statements have been translated into English from the original Chinese version prepared and used in the R.O.C. If there is any conflict between the English version and the original Chinese version or any difference in the interpretation of the two versions, the Chinese-language parent company only financial statements shall prevail.\n\n## Statement of Compliance\n\nThe accompanying parent company only financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the Regulations Gover ning the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers (the 'Accounting Standards Used in Preparation of the Parent Company Only Financial Statements').\n\n## Basis of Preparation\n\nThe accompanying parent company only financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.\n\nWhen preparing the parent company only financial statements, the Company account for subsidiaries and associates by using the equity method. In order to agree with the amount of net income, other comprehensive income and equity attributable to shareholders of the parent in the consolidated financial statements, the differences of the accounting treatment between the parent company only basis and the consolidated basis are adjusted under the heading of investments accounted for using equity method, share of profits of subsidiaries and associates and share of other comprehensive income of subsidiaries and associates in the parent company only financial statements.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nIn preparing the parent company only financial statements, transactions i n currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Such exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in\n\n- 124 -",

Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are also recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.\n\nFor the purposes of presenting parent company only financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations are translated into NT$ using exchange rates prevailing at the end of eac h reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.\n\n## Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities\n\nCurrent assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash, sold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are obligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year from the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents, for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, consist of highly liquid time deposits and investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities shall be recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair values. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial Assets\n\nThe classification  of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were classified in the same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.\n\n## a. Category of financial assets and measurement\n\nFinancial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI and financial assets at amortized cost.\n\n- 1)  Financial asset at FVTPL\n\nFor certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising from\n\n- 125 -",

The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset.\n\n## 2)  Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI\n\nOn initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate investments in equity investments that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI.\n\nInvestments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in other equity.\n\nDividends on these investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss when the C ompany's right to receive the dividends is established , unless the Company's rights clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.\n\n## 3)  Measured at amortized cost\n\nCash and cash equivalents,  commercial paper, notes and accounts receivable (including related parties), other receivables, refundable deposits and temporary payments (including those classified under other current assets and other noncurrent assets) are measured at amortized cost.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, financial assets measured at amortized cost  are measured at amortized cost, which equals to carrying amount determined by the effective interest method less any impairment loss.\n\n## b. Impairment of financial assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable).\n\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\nThe  Company  recognizes an impairment loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account.\n\n## c. Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another entity.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference between the asset 's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained earnings, without recycling through profit or loss.\n\n- 126 -",

Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured either at amortized cost using effective interest method or at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is either held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities other than those held for trading purposes and designated as at FVTPL are subsequently measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe Company derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company's obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative financial instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.\n\n## Hedge Accounting\n\n## a. Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as forward exchange contracts, to partially hedge its foreign exchange rate risks associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions (capital expenditures). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income. When forecast transactions actually take place, the accumulated gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are transferred from equity to the initial cost of the hedged items. The gains or losses from hedging instruments relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n- 127 -",

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as bank loans denominated in foreign currency, as a hedge of net investments in foreign operations to manage the exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations due to currency fluctuations. Any gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of foreign currency translation reserve. The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge, which were accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve, are reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at standard cost and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price of inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method include investments in subsidiaries and associates.\n\n## Investment in subsidiaries\n\nA subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the Company.\n\nUnder the equity method, an investment in a subsidiary is initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the subsidiary as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognized its share in the changes in the equity of subsidiaries.\n\nChanges in the Company's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Company losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. Any difference between the carrying amount of the subsidiary and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity.\n\nWhen the Company loses control of a subsidiary, any retained investment of the former subsidiary is measured at the fair value at that date. A gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and calculated as the difference between (a) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest at the date when control is lost; and (b) the previous carrying amount of the investments in such subsidiary. In addition, the Company shall account for all amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the subsidiary had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities.\n\nWhen the Company transacts with its subsidiaries, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the subsidiar ies are recognized in the Company's parent company only financial statements only to the extent of interests in the subsidiaries that are not owned by the Company.\n\n- 128 -",

Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nThe operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these parent company only financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized in the statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.\n\nAny excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is inc luded within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.\n\nWhen the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the Company's proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate. The Comp any records such a difference as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the Company's ownership interest is reduced due to the additional subscription to the shares of associate by other investors, the proportionate amount of the gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate shall be reclassified to profit or loss on the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\nWhen the Company transacts with an associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the associate are recognized in the Company's parent company only financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not owned by the Company.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated impairment. Costs include any incremental costs that are directly attributable to the construction, acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment or borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognized impairment loss. Such assets are classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other identical categories of property, plant and equipment, commences when the assets are available for their intended use.\n\nDepreciation is recognized so as to write off the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful lives, and it is computed using the straight-line method mainly over the following estimated useful lives: buildings (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 10 to 20 years; machinery and equipment (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 5 years; and office equipment - 5 years. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each\n\n- 129 -",

Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Leases\n\nFor a contract that contains a lease component and non-lease component, the Company may elect to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\n## The Company as lessor\n\nRental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## The Company as lessee\n\nExcept for payments for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (leases of machinery and equipment and others) which are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement date of the lease.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement date, plus an estimate of costs needed to restore the underlying assets. Subsequent measurement is calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for changes in lease liabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are presented separately in the parent company only balance sheets.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets.\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate s.\n\nSubsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the parent company only balance sheets.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\n- 130 -",

        "page_content": "## Other intangible assets\n\nOther separately acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period; patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\n## Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash generating unit may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company's cash generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit. If the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such cash-generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers' specified locations.\n\n- 131 -",

Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally made and adjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\n\nIn principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 15-30 days from the end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\n## Short-term employee benefits\n\nLiabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nFor defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations.\n\nDefined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nNet defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company's defined benefit plan.\n\n## Treasury Stock\n\nTreasury stock represents the outstanding shares that the Company buys back from market, which is stated at cost and shown as a deduction in shareholders' equity. When the Company retires treasury stock, the treasury stock account is reduced and the common stock as well as the capital surplus - additional paid-in capital are reversed on a pro rata basis. When the book value of the treasury stock exceeds the sum of the par value and additional paid-in capital, the difference is charged to capital surplus - treasury stock transactions and to retained earnings for any remaining amount.\n\n## Share-based payment arrangements\n\n- a. Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements\n\nRestricted shares for employees are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the fair value at the grant date and the Company's best estimate of the number expected to ultimately vest, with a corresponding increase in other equity - unearned employee benefits.\n\nWhen restricted shares for employees are issued, other equity - unearned employee benefits is recognized on the grant date, with a corresponding increase in capital surplus - restricted shares for employees. Dividends paid to employees on restricted shares which do not need to be returned if employees resign in  the vesting period are recognized as expenses upon the dividend declaration with a corresponding adjustment in retained earnings.\n\n- 132 -",

The impact from such revision is recognized in profit or loss so that the cumulative expenses reflect the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to capital surplus - restricted shares for employees.\n\n## b. Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements\n\nFor cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognized for the services acquired, measured at the fair value of the liability incurred. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Taxation\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\n\n## Current tax\n\nIncome tax on unappropriated earnings is expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation of earnings which is the year subsequent to the year the earnings are generated.\n\nAdjustments of prior years' tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year's tax provision.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the parent company only financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\n\n## Current and deferred tax for the year\n\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\n\n- 133 -",

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY\n\nIn the applicatio n of the aforementioned Company's accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.\n\n## Material Accounting Judgments\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.\n\n## Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)\n\nAs described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available  for  their  intended  use  involves  subjective  judgments  and  assumptions  about  the  conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.\n\n## Judgments on Lease Terms\n\nIn determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from  the  commencement  date  until  the  exercise  date  of  the  option.  Main  factors  considered  include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the lessee's operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.\n\n## Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty\n\n## Estimation of Sales Returns and Allowances\n\nSales  returns  and  other  allowance  is  estimated  and  recorded  based  on  historical  experience  and  in consideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.\n\n## Valuation of Inventory\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses  estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe  Company  estimates  the  net  realizable  value  of  inventory  for  normal  waste,  obsolescence  and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.\n\n- 134 -",

Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.\n\n## Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\n\n## Determination of Lessees' Incremental Borrowing Rates\n\nIn determining a lessee's incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company mainly takes into account the market riskfree rates, the estimated lessee's credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.\n\n## 6.

These accounts receivable are classified as at FVTOCI because they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.\n\nIn principle, the payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 15-30 days from the end of the month when the invoice is issued. Aside from recognizing impairment loss for credit-impaired accounts receivable, the Company recognizes loss allowance based on the expected credit loss ratio of customers by different risk levels with consideration of factors o f historical loss ratios and customers' financial conditions, competitiveness and business outlook. For accounts receivable past due over 90 days without collaterals or guarantees, the Company recognizes loss allowance at full amount.\n\n## Aging analysis of notes and accounts receivable\n\n|                         | December 31,  2023   | December 31,  2022   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Not past due            | $  33,618,149        | $  40,353,856        |\n| Past due                |                      |                      |\n| Past due within 30 days | 469,269              | 1,268,778            |\n| Past due over 31 days   | -                    | 19,888               |\n| Less: Loss allowance    | (530,139)            | (330,686)            |\n|                         | $  33,557,279        | $  41,311,836        |\n\n- 138 -",

Pursuant to the Act, the Company has made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee's monthly salary to employees' pension accounts. Accordingly, the Company recognized expenses of NT$4,154,345 thousand and NT$3,663,757 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## b. Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Company has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee's length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee's name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of March of the next year. The Funds are operated and managed by the government's designated authorities; as such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Funds.\n\nAmounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:\n\n|                                                                               | Years Ended December 31   | Years Ended December 31   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                               | 2023                      | 2022                      |\n| Current service cost                                                          | $  139,101                | $  134,376                |\n| Net interest expense                                                          | 142,291                   | 74,265                    |\n| Components of defined benefit costs recognized in profit or loss              | 281,392                   | 208,641                   |\n| Remeasurement on the net defined benefit liability:                           |                           |                           |\n| Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net  interest expense)   | (16,252)                  | (429,948)                 |\n| Actuarial loss arising from experience adjustments                            | 68,342                    | 1,413,760                 |\n| Actuarial (gain) loss arising from changes in financial  assumptions          | 571,266                   | (160,752)                 |\n| Components of defined benefit costs recognized in other  comprehensive income | 623,356                   | 823,060                   |\n| Total                                                                         | $  904,748                | $  1,031,701              |\n\nThe pension costs of the aforementioned defined benefit plans were recognized in profit or loss by the following categories:\n\n|                                     | Years Ended December 31   | Years Ended December 31   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                     | 2023                      | 2022                      |\n| Cost of revenue                     | $  182,333                | $  135,125                |\n| Research and development expenses   | 76,120                    | 55,632                    |\n| General and administrative expenses | 19,248                    | 15,129                    |\n| Marketing expenses                  | 3,691                     | 2,755                     |\n|                                     | $  281,392                | $  208,641                |\n\n- 149 -",

As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation.\n- Assuming the expected salary rate increases by 0.5% at the end of the reporting period and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$735,167 thousand and NT$746,933 thousand as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\nFurthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability.\n\nThe Company expects to make contributions of NT$991,646 thousand to the defined benefit plans in the next year starting from December 31, 2023. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 8 years.\n\n- 151 -",

Retained earnings and dividend policy\n\nThe Company 's Articles of Incorporation provide that, earnings distribution may be made on a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by the Company's Board of Directors and reported to the Company's shareholders in its meeting. When allocating earnings, the Company shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals the Company's paid -in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and the Company 's Articles of Incorporation .\n\nThe Company's Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of the Company may be distributed by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.\n\nThe legal capital reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.\n\nPursuant to existing regulations, the Company is required to set aside an additional special capital reserve equivalent to the net debit balance of the other components of stockholders' equity, such as the accumulated balance of the foreign currency translation reserve,  the effectiveness of hedges of net investments in foreign operations, unrealized valuation gain or loss from fair value through other comprehensive income financial assets and gain or loss from changes in fair value of hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, etc. For the subsequent decrease in the deduction amount to stockholders' equity, any special reserve appropriated may be reversed to the extent that the net debit balance reverses.\n\nThe appropriations of 2023, 2022 and 2021 q uarterly earnings have been approved by the Company's Board of Directors in its meeting, respectively.

Financial risk management objectives\n\nThe Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk with the objective to reduce the potentially adverse effects the market uncertainties may have on its financial performance.\n\nThe plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee and/or Board of Directors in accordance with procedures required by relevant regulations or internal controls. During the implementation of such plans, the Company must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide guiding principles for overall financial risk management and segregation of duties.\n\n## c. Market risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nSubstantially all the Company's sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures and equity investments are denominated in currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchanges rate of NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT\n\n- 166 -",

        "page_content": "dollars, would have an adverse impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollar. The Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts and non-derivative financial instruments, such as currency forwards, currency swaps and bank loans denominated in foreign currency, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, certain forecasted transactions, and net investments in foreign operations. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company ' s total monetary assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% would have decreased its net income by NT$726,145 thousand and NT$1,649,664 thousand, respectively, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its bank deposits and bank loans. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earn ed on the Company's bank deposits, as well as the interest paid on its bank loans. Because all of the Company's bonds issued are fixed -rate and measured at amortized cost, changes in interest rates would not affect the future cash flows or the carrying amount.\n\n## Other price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from financial assets at FVTOCI.\n\nAssuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the equity investments at the end of the reporting period for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the other comprehensive income would have decreased by NT$76,876 thousand and NT$89,297 thousand, respectively.\n\n## d. Credit risk management\n\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty may default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses  to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities, primarily accounts receivable, and from investing activities, primarily deposits, fixed-income investments and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed separately for business related and financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company's maximum credit risk exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.\n\n## Business related credit risk\n\nThe Company's accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company's outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has procedures to monitor and manage credit risk exposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit risk. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's ten largest cus tomers accounted for 85% and 69% of accounts receivable, respectively. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the remaining accounts receivable not material.\n\n## Financial credit risk\n\nThe Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment grade credit ratings and by limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty. The Company regularly monitors and reviews the limit applied to counterparties and adjusts the limit according to market conditions and the credit standing of the counterparties.\n\n- 167 -",
