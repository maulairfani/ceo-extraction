Organization of the Siemens Group and basis of presentation\n\nSiemens is a technology group that is active in nearly all countries of the world, focusing on the areas of automation and digitalization in the process and manufacturing industries, intelligent infrastructure for buildings and distributed energy systems, smart mobility solutions for rail transport, and medical technology and digital healthcare services.\n\nSiemens comprises Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (Siemens AG), a stock corporation under the Federal laws of Germany, as the parent company, and its subsidiaries. Our Company is incorporated in Germany, with our corporate headquarters situated in Munich. As of September 30, 2023, Siemens had around 320,000 employees.\n\nAs  of  September  30,  2023,  Siemens  has  the  following  reportable  segments: Digital  Industries , Smart  Infrastructure , Mobility and Siemens Healthineers , which together form our 'Industrial Business' and Siemens Financial Services (SFS) , which supports the activities of our industrial businesses and also conducts its own business with external customers. Furthermore, we report results for Portfolio Companies , which comprises businesses that are managed separately to improve their performance.\n\nOur reportable segments and Portfolio Companies may do business with each other, leading to corresponding orders and revenue. Such orders and revenue are eliminated on Group level.\n\n## Non-financial matters of the Group and Siemens AG\n\nSiemens has policies for environmental, employee and social matters, for the respect of human rights, and anti-corruption and bribery matters, among others. Our business model is described in chapters 1 and 3 of this Combined Management Report. Reportable information that is necessary for an understanding of the development, performance, position and the impact of our activities on these matters is included  in  this  Combined  Management  Report,  in  particular  in  chapters  3  through  7.  Forward-looking  information,  including  risk disclosures,  is  presented  in  chapter  8.  Chapter  9  includes  additional  information  that  is  required  to  be  reported  in  the  Combined Management Report related to the parent company Siemens AG. EU Taxonomy disclosures are outlined in chapter 11.\n\nAs  supplementary  information,  amounts  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  the  Annual  Financial  Statements  of Siemens AG related to such non-financial matters, and additional explanations thereto, are included in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2023, Notes 17, 18, 22, 26 and 27, and in the Notes to the Annual Financial Statements for fiscal 2023, Notes 16, 17, 20, 21 and 25. In order to inform the users of the financial reports in a focused manner, these disclosures are not subject to a specific non-financial framework - in contrast to the disclosures in our separate 'Sustainability report 2023' document, which are based on the standards developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Said document also includes detailed information on DEGREE, Siemens' sustainability framework. With DEGREE, Siemens intends to manage and track its progress on selected ambitions in the environmental, social and governance areas.",

Financial performance system\n\n## 2.1 Revenue growth\n\nIn the Siemens Financial Framework we aim to achieve a revenue growth range of 5% to 7% per year on a comparable basis over a cycle of three to five years. Our primary measure for managing and controlling our revenue growth is comparable growth, because it shows the development in our business net of currency translation effects, which arise from the external environment outside of our control, and portfolio effects, which involve business activities which are either new to or no longer a part of the respective business.\n\nCurrency translation effects are the difference between revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the current period and revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the comparison period. For calculating the percentage change year-over-year, this absolute difference is divided by revenue for the comparison period. A portfolio effect arises in the case of an acquisition  or  a  disposition  and  is  calculated  as  the  change  year-over-year  in  revenue  related  to  the  transaction.  For  calculating  the percentage change, this absolute change is divided by revenue for the comparison period. Any portfolio effect is excluded for the twelve months following the relevant transaction after which both current and past reporting periods fully reflect the portfolio change. For orders, we apply the same calculations for currency translation and portfolio effects as described above.\n\n## 2.2 Profitability and capital efficiency\n\nWithin the Siemens Financial Framework, we aim to achieve over a cycle of three to five years margins that are comparable to those of our relevant competitors. Therefore, we have defined profit margin ranges for our industrial businesses which also consider the profit margins of their respective relevant competitors. Profit margin is defined as profit of the respective business divided by its revenue.\n\nFor our industrial businesses, profit represents EBITA adjusted for amortization of intangible assets not acquired in business combinations.\n\nWe have set the following margin ranges:\n\n|                                            | Margin range   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Digital Industries                         | 17 - 23%       |\n| Smart Infrastructure                       | 11 - 16%       |\n| Mobility                                   | 10 - 13%       |\n| Siemens Healthineers                       | 17 - 21%       |\n| Siemens Financial Services (ROE after tax) | 15 - 20%       |\n\nFor Siemens Healthineers, we present the margin range we expect as that company's majority shareholder.\n\nIn line with common practice in the financial services business, our financial indicator for measuring capital efficiency at SFS is return on equity after tax, or ROE after tax. ROE is defined as SFS' profit after tax, divided by its average allocated equity.\n\nPrimary measure for managing and controlling profit and profitability at Group level: Net income is the primary driver of basic earnings per share from net income (EPS) as well as of EPS before purchase price allocation accounting (EPS pre PPA) which is used for our capital market communication. EPS pre PPA is defined as basic earnings per share from net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and related income taxes. As with EPS, EPS pre PPA includes the amounts attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG. We aim to achieve high-single-digit annual growth in EPS pre PPA over a cycle of three to five years.\n\nWe seek to work profitably and as efficiently as possible with the capital provided by our shareholders and lenders. For purposes of managing and controlling our capital efficiency, we use return on capital employed, or ROCE, as our primary measure in our Siemens Financial Framework. Our goal is to achieve a ROCE within a range of 15% to 20% over a cycle of three to five years.\n\n## 2.3 Capital structure\n\nSustainable  revenue  and  profit  development  is  supported  by  a  healthy  capital  structure.  Accordingly,  a  key  consideration  within  the Siemens Financial Framework is to maintain ready access to the capital markets through various debt products and preserve our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. Our primary measure for managing and controlling our capital structure is the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA (continuing operations). This financial measure indicates the approximate amount of time in years that would be  needed  to  cover  Industrial  net  debt  through  income  from  continuing  operations,  without  taking  into  account  interest,  taxes, depreciation and amortization. We aim to achieve a ratio of up to 1.5.\n\n## 2.4 Liquidity and dividend\n\nWe intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders. In the Siemens Financial Framework, we strive for a dividend per share that exceeds the amount for the preceding year, or at least matches it.\n\nAs in the past, we intend to fund the dividend payout from Free cash flow. Our primary measure to assess our ability to generate cash, and ultimately to pay dividends, is the cash conversion rate for the Siemens Group, defined as the ratio of Free cash flow (continuing and discontinued operations) to net income. Over a cycle of three to five years, we aim to achieve a cash conversion rate of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate.\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Managing Board, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, will submit the following proposal to allocate the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for fiscal 2023: to distribute a dividend of \u20ac4.70 on each share of no par value entitled to the dividend for fiscal 2023 existing at the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting; the remaining amount is to be carried",

        "page_content": "## 3. Segment information\n\n## 3.1 Overall economic conditions\n\nOverall, calendar 2023 was characterized by many headwinds for the global economy. Global economic development continued to slowly recover from the negative shocks of the previous years: the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) with its disruptions on global demand and supply chains; war in Ukraine and the following commodity price explosions, especially for European energy; spiraling inflation and severe financial tightening which caused some turbulence in the banking sector and financial markets. After calendar 2022, in which global gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 3.1%, calendar 2023 is expected to show global GDP increasing by 2.6%, which shows a remarkable resilience of the global economy, given the number of big negative shocks of the previous year.\n\nIn the post-pandemic world, consumption patterns of households continued to normalize. In particular, the shift to goods from services triggered by COVID-19 ended and then reversed, with a strong rebound of the service sector including tourism, and a normalization of goods demand. In addition, in light of much higher interest rates many firms started to reduce their inventory levels, which they had previously elevated as a precautionary measure to ensure production and delivery during periods of supply chain bottlenecks. Accordingly, both global goods demand and trade were significantly weaker in calendar 2023.\n\nThese trends were primary contributors for the significant slowdown of the Chinese economy during calendar 2023, after it started very dynamically  in  the  first  quarter  of  calendar  2023  following  lifting  of  severe  COVID-19  lockdowns.  Another  main  contributor  for  the slowdown was the intensification of the country's real estate crisis. Hence, China's GDP is expected to grow by only 5% in calendar 2023, which is regarded as low because under multiple lockdowns in calendar 2022, China delivered GDP growth of only 3% and some catchingup in 2023 was expected.\n\nThe U.S. economy was a positive surprise. Although monetary policy was substantially tightened and the main policy interest rate was increased to 5.5%, consumption and investment were strong and GDP is expected to expand by 2.5% in calendar 2023. In particular the labor market was robust and unemployment remained at historic lows. Despite the strong economy, inflation and core inflation rates declined substantially. By end of calendar 2023, consumer price inflation is expected to be approximately 3%, after it reached nearly 6.5% at the end of calendar 2022. Receding global commodity and energy prices and the dissolvement of supply chain bottlenecks both helped ease inflation while tighter monetary policy had the desired effect of anchoring inflation expectations. This helped the U.S. avoid a pricewage-price spiral which could have led to structurally higher inflation rates.\n\nWhile the U.S. showed stronger economic growth than expected, the European Union (E.U.) experienced the difficulties that were widely expected. The drastic increase of energy prices in calendar 2022, a result of the war in Ukraine, had a severe negative impact, especially on energy-intensive industries. Strong increases in inflation rates led the European Central bank to increase the main policy interest rate to 4.5% which weighed on fixed investment, especially in the real estate sector. Moreover, the global manufacturing and trade slowdown mentioned above weighed on the E.U., due in particular to the high concentration of manufacturing and export industries in Germany, the region's largest economy. GDP growth in calendar 2023 is expected to be 0.4% in the E.U. and -0.4% in Germany. Only the service sector, in particular tourism, supported the overall E.U. economy.\n\nThe partly estimated figures presented here for GDP are based on an S&P Global report dated October 15, 2023.\n\n## 3.2 Digital Industries\n\nDigital Industries offers a comprehensive product portfolio and system solutions for automation used in discrete and process industries; these offerings include automation systems and software for factories, numerical control systems, servo motors, drives and inverters and integrated automation systems for machine tools and production machines. Digital Industries also provides process control systems, machine-to-machine communication products, sensors (for measuring pressure, temperature, level, flow rate, distance or shape) and radio  frequency  identification  systems.  Furthermore,  Digital  Industries  offers  production  and  product  lifecycle  management  (PLM) software, and software for simulation and testing of mechatronic systems. These leading software offerings are supplemented by an electronic design automation (EDA) software portfolio; the Mendix cloud-native low-code application development platform, which allows customers to significantly reduce app development times through visual representation of underlying code; and digital marketplaces for the global electronics value chain, such as Supplyframe and Pixeom. Digital Industries also provides customers with lifecycle and datadriven services.\n\nTaken together, Digital Industries' offerings enable customers to optimize entire value chains from product design and development through production and post-sale services. With its advanced software solutions in particular, Digital Industries supports customers in their evolution towards the 'Digital Enterprise,' resulting in increased flexibility and efficiency of production processes and reduced time to market for new products. The most important customer markets include the automotive industry, the machine-building industry, the pharmaceutical and chemicals industry, the food and beverage industry and the electronics and semiconductor industry. Digital Industries serves its customers through a common regional sales organization spanning all its businesses, using various sales channels depending on the type of customer and industry and also enhancing customer choice across all channels. Changes in customer demand, especially for standard products, are driven strongly by macroeconomic cycles, and can lead to significant short-term fluctuation in Digital Industries' profitability. Volume from large contracts in the software business, particularly for EDA, may also result in strong fluctuations in quarterly volume and profitability. In fiscal 2023, Digital Industries continued to transition parts of its software business, particularly PLM, from largely upfront revenue recognition towards Software as a Service (SaaS), which yields more predictable recurring revenue and offers growth  opportunities  by  opening  access  to  new  customers,  especially  small  and  medium-sized  companies  seeking  to  reduce  costs associated with owning complex IT infrastructure. The transition held back revenue growth rates and profit margin development in the software business in fiscal 2023 and Digital Industries expects continued impacts until completion of the transition. Competition with Digital  Industries'  business  activities  comes  primarily  from  multinational  corporations  that  offer  a  relatively  broad  portfolio  and  from smaller companies active only in certain geographic or product markets.\n\nDigital Industries sees three trends influencing its business and providing long-term growth opportunities. Producers of investment goods in today's increasingly digital environment must modernize their production capacity, particularly to increase production flexibility and reduce time to market. This environment also spurs producers to complement their core products with vertical solutions and service",

Through various collaborations, Digital Industries is developing industrial-grade AI solutions. With Intrinsic, an Alphabet company, Digital Industries collaborates to accelerate the integration of AI-based robotics and automation technology. Digital Industries and Microsoft are harnessing generative AI to help industrial companies drive innovation and efficiency across the entire product lifecycle. Also in fiscal 2023, Digital Industries introduced several innovations based on cloud and edge technologies such as Simcenter Cloud HPC, which provides instant-on, rapidly scalable cloud-based high performance computing for complex simulation studies, hosted on Amazon Web Services; and Industrial Edge Management System for Kubernetes clusters, which addresses IT users in production and aims to save IT resources, energy, and costs. Major investments of Digital Industries in fiscal 2023 relate to its own factory automation, motion control and process automation businesses, to further automate and digitalize facilities particularly in Germany, China and Singapore.\n\n|                            | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   | % Change   |\n|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)         | 2023          | 2022          | Actual     | Comp.      |\n| Orders                     | 20,620        | 25,283        | (18)%      | (17)%      |\n| Revenue                    | 21,919        | 19,517        | 12%        | 15%        |\n| therein: software business | 5,067         | 4,691         | 8%         | 10%        |\n| Profit                     | 4,947         | 3,892         | 27%        |            |\n| Profit margin              | 22.6%         | 19.9%         |            |            |\n\nFollowing extraordinary demand in fiscal 2022, which included proactive customer purchasing, orders at Digital Industries came in lower in its automation businesses. The short-cycle factory automation and the motion control businesses were affected most strongly due particularly to destocking at customers. These declines were partly offset by significant growth in the software business, due to large contract wins in both the PLM and the EDA businesses. Revenue rose on increases in all businesses due in part to conversion from the order backlog which had expanded significantly in the previous fiscal year. The strongest revenue growth contributions came from the factory automation and the process automation businesses. Overall, growth in the automation businesses was supported by improved availability of components year-over-year. Revenue growth in the software business was led by the EDA business while year-over-year growth in PLM was held back by the transition to SaaS. On a geographic basis, orders remained stable in the Americas region, but came in lower in the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East and in the region Asia, Australia due mainly to weaker demand in China. Revenue grew in all regions with the strongest contribution coming from the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East. Profit and profitability at Digital Industries rose on strong improvements in all automation businesses, supported by higher capacity utilization and a more favorable business mix including improved availability of components for high-margin products. Profit in the software business declined due to increased expenses related to cloud-based activities including severance charges, which for Digital Industries overall rose to \u20ac109 million, up from \u20ac64 million in the prior year.\n\nAt the beginning of fiscal 2024, business activities in the areas of low-voltage and geared motors and motor spindles, previously part of Digital Industries' motion control business, were transferred to Portfolio Companies. If the transfer to Portfolio Companies had already existed at the beginning of fiscal 2023, Digital Industries would have posted orders of \u20ac19.387 billion, revenue of \u20ac20.636 billion, profit of \u20ac4.833 billion and a profit margin of 23.4%. At the beginning of fiscal 2024, Digital Industries' order backlog amounted to \u20ac11 billion, of which \u20ac8 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024.\n\nIn  fiscal  2023, markets served  by  Digital  Industries  overall  grew  significantly.  However,  after  a  strong  start,  growth  momentum increasingly slowed over the course of the fiscal year. This was particularly evident in China. On a geographic basis, all regions contributed to growth, led by the regions Americas and Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East. While global supply chain constraints eased, high price inflation  led  central  banks  to  increase  interest  rates,  which  together  with  high  energy  costs  impacted  manufacturing  industries.  This impacted  predominantly  consumer-  and  building-related  industries  whereas  production  of  investments  goods  still  benefited  from converting high order backlogs into current revenue. The entire manufacturing industry experienced a destocking of inventories as a countereffect of proactive ordering in the previous fiscal year. This was most evident in distributor channels and resulted in a significant decline in orders for automation equipment. Discrete industries, which are closer to consumer spending than process industries, were impacted earlier and more strongly than process industries, which are more project-based. The global automotive industry recovered throughout the year following a weak prior year, and benefited from improved supply chain conditions. Production of electric vehicles continued to increase. On a geographic basis, China, Japan, the U.S. and countries of the European Union saw a strong catchup of production mainly in the first half of the fiscal year. The machine-building industry grew strongly in the first half of fiscal 2023 but growth in major countries such as China, Germany, Japan and countries of the European Union came to a halt or market volume even declined in the second half of the fiscal year due to less favorable investment conditions caused by rising interest rates and a more cautious investment sentiment in consumer industries. Within the pharmaceutical and the chemicals industries, the pharmaceutical industry grew throughout the fiscal year, but with slower momentum towards the end of the fiscal year. In contrast, production in the chemicals industries declined in fiscal 2023. This was particularly evident within the countries of the European Union due mainly to high energy costs. The food and beverage industry grew strongly at the beginning of the fiscal year, driven by strong price increases. In the second half of the fiscal year, growth slowed considerably, reflecting weaker consumer spending. The market for electronics and semiconductors declined markedly at the beginning of fiscal 2023 but began to stabilize during the second half of the fiscal year. The decline, which was particularly evident in countries such as Taiwan and Korea with a focus on semiconductor production, was due among other factors to shrinking consumer",

For  fiscal  2024,  markets  served  by  Digital  Industries  are expected to grow markedly slower than in fiscal 2023. While industrial software markets are expected to grow clearly, short-cycle markets served by Digital Industries are expected to contract slightly. Among other factors, rebalancing of supply chains, trade conflicts, effects from geopolitical tensions, cautious consumer spending and downsizing of inventories, mainly in distribution channels, are expected to weigh on market growth.\n\n## 3.3 Smart Infrastructure\n\nSmart Infrastructure offers products, systems, solutions, services and software to support the global transition from fossil to renewable energy sources, and the associated transition to smarter, more sustainable buildings and communities.

        "page_content": "Smart Infrastructure showed very strong performance in fiscal 2023. Orders increased clearly compared to the high prior-year level, which included proactive purchasing by customers. Growth was mainly driven by the electrification business and included a number of larger contract wins from data center, semiconductor, power distribution and battery manufacturing customers. Revenue rose in all businesses, with the strongest growth contributions coming from the electrification and the electrical products businesses. On a geographic basis, orders and revenue rose in all three reporting regions. The strongest growth contribution came from the Americas region, driven by the U.S., while growth in the Asia, Australia region was held back by declines in China, which were due mainly to negative currency translation effects. Profit also rose in all businesses. Growth in profit and profitability was driven by the electrical products and the electrification businesses due to higher revenue, by increased capacity utilization and by cost reductions achieved through the execution of Smart Infrastructure's competitiveness program. Severance charges were \u20ac50 million, up from \u20ac28 million a year earlier. At the end of fiscal 2023, Smart Infrastructure's order backlog was \u20ac16 billion, of which \u20ac10 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024.\n\nOverall, markets served by Smart Infrastructure grew clearly in fiscal 2023. Market dynamics were influenced by a further recovery from COVID-19-related effects; easing of supply chain and logistics constraints, which resulted in shorter lead times for order fulfillment; strong price  inflation;  and  effects  from  the  war  in  Ukraine.  Furthermore,  rising  interest  rates  burdened  building  construction  markets.  On  a geographic basis, all reporting regions contributed to growth. Price inflation affected all regions and was particularly high in the U.S. While on the one hand rising interest rates impacted growth in the U.S., economic activity was boosted by stimulus programs on the other hand. In China, the recovery from lockdown measures was significantly weaker than expected, which also impacted growth dynamics in other countries, while Europe was most strongly affected by the war in Ukraine and high energy prices. Grid markets grew clearly, driven by demand for integration  of  energy  from  renewable  resources.  Industrial  markets  also  grew  clearly  on  strong  demand  in  the  battery, semiconductor, and automotive industries. The buildings market overall also grew but activity in the commercial building market rose only moderately. In fiscal 2024, markets served by Smart Infrastructure are expected to grow clearly but at a slower pace than in fiscal 2023 due to a substantially lower effect from price inflation and a cooling of the general economic environment. While growth is expected to be weak in residential and commercial building markets and in some industrial markets, continued robust demand is expected for data centers and power distribution. Overall, market development in fiscal 2024 is expected to continue to be influenced by rebalancing of supply chains, trade conflicts and effects from geopolitical tensions.\n\n## 3.4 Mobility\n\nMobility combines all Siemens businesses in the area of rail passenger and rail freight transportation. Within its rolling stock business, its offerings encompass vehicles and selected components for urban and regional transport such as metro systems, trams and light rail, and commuter trains as well as trains and passenger coaches for intercity and long-distance services, such as high-speed rail. Rolling stock offerings furthermore include locomotives and solutions for automated transportation such as automated people movers. Offerings in its rail  infrastructure  business  include  products  and  solutions  for  rail  automation,  such  as  automatic  train  control  systems,  interlocking, operations control and telematic systems, digital station solutions and railway communication systems, signaling on-board and signaling crossing products and yard and depot solutions; and for electrification such as AC and DC traction power supply, contact lines and network control. With its service business, Mobility provides maintenance and digital services, among others, for rolling stock and rail infrastructure throughout the entire lifecycle. In its turnkey business, it bundles consulting, planning, financing, construction, service and operation of complete mobility systems. Mobility's software business comprises train planning systems, trip planning, mobile ticketing, Mobility as a Service (MaaS) platforms, on-demand transportation and fleet management, data analytics, and inventory and reservation management.\n\nMobility sells its products, systems and solutions through its worldwide network of sales and execution units. The principal customers of Mobility are public and state-owned companies in the transportation and logistics sectors, so its markets are driven primarily by public spending. Customers usually have multi-year planning and implementation horizons, and their contract tenders therefore tend to be independent of short-term economic trends. Large contracts in the rolling stock and the rail infrastructure business are often awarded together  with  service  contracts,  which  start  to  generate  revenue  only  after  the  respective  products  and  solutions  have  been  put  in operation,  which  can  be  a  number  of  years  after  the  contract  award.  Mobility's  principal  competitors  are  multinational  companies. Consolidation among Mobility's competitors is continuing and may lead to increased competitive pressure within the rail transport industry and also to fewer sourcing options for rail customers.\n\nThe main trends driving Mobility's markets are urbanization, decarbonization and digitalization. Increasing populations in urban centers need daily mobility that is simpler, faster, and more flexible, reliable and affordable. At the same time, cities and national economies face the challenge of cutting CO2 and noise emissions and reducing space requirements and costs of transportation. The pressure on mobility providers to meet all these needs is expected to rise continuously. Furthermore, improving availability, connectivity, and sustainability of rail infrastructures increasingly requires digital solutions, which generates growth opportunities for providers of such solutions. IoT systems and new software-based solutions such as MaaS are expected to become major growth enablers for the rail industry. Overall trends towards urbanization,  decarbonization  and  digitalization  persist  and  many  countries  have  been  allocating  significant  funds  to  rail  and  public transport operators to address these trends.\n\nMobility's R&D  strategy is  focused  on  reducing  life-cycle  costs  of  rail  infrastructure  and  rolling  stock,  securing  system  availability, increasing network capacity of rail infrastructure, optimizing the processes of rail operators and improving passenger experience. With Siemens Xcelerator, Mobility intends to make software more modular and increasingly move it to the cloud. At the same time, Mobility intends  to  enhance  connectivity  of  hardware  and  software  and  provide  open  application  programming  interfaces.  Thereby  Mobility accelerates the pace and impact of digital innovation, which in turn benefits owners, operators, and customers of rail transport. Mobility's major R&D areas include the development of efficient vehicle platforms with optimized lifecycle cost; eco-friendly, alternative power supplies for trains; the Railigent X open application suite for maintenance of rail assets; smart connected products; the Distributed Smart Safe System (DS3), which allows for hardware-independent and cloud-enabled signaling; automatic train operation for European Train Control System (ETCS); safe artificial intelligence for driverless trains; air-free brake systems, 5G for wireless-based activities; the Mobility Software Suite X for operators and passengers; and cyber security. Mobility's investments focus mainly on maintaining or enhancing its production facilities, on meeting project demands, and on enhancing its depot services.",

Contract wins in fiscal 2023 were highlighted by an order worth \u20ac2.9 billion for locomotives and associated maintenance in India, a \u20ac2.5 billion order for the first line of a turnkey rail system in Egypt and a \u20ac2.1 billion order for suburban trains in Germany. Order intake a year earlier included among others an  order  worth  \u20ac1.5  billion  for  high-speed  trains  in  Germany. Revenue rose  on  growth  in  nearly  all  businesses  with  the  strongest contribution coming from the rolling stock business, and was supported by improved availability of components. On a geographic basis, revenue grew in all three reporting regions. Nominal volume development was held back by the fiscal 2022 divestment of Yunex Traffic, resulting in a portfolio effect which took four percentage points from order growth and five percentage points from revenue growth in the current period. As with revenue, profit and profitability rose in nearly all businesses. Profit in fiscal 2023 included a positive \u20ac0.2 billion in trailing effects related to the winding down of business activities in Russia a year earlier, which burdened prior-year profit by \u20ac0.6 billion in impairments and other charges. In addition, profit in fiscal 2022 included impacts from supplier delays and COVID-19 effects. These burdens were largely offset by a gain of \u20ac0.7 billion from the sale of Yunex Traffic. Severance charges were \u20ac25 million, compared to \u20ac27 million a year earlier. Mobility's order backlog rose to \u20ac45 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac11 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024.\n\nMarkets served by Mobility grew significantly in fiscal 2023, supported by long-term trends such as urbanization, decarbonization and increasing demand for digital solutions. Market dynamics in fiscal 2023 also benefited from receding material shortages and easing of supply chain constraints. On a geographic basis, all regions contributed to market growth, highlighted by large and very large orders in Germany, the U.S., Egypt and India, among others. The market for rolling stock included large orders for high-speed trains, commuter trains  and  locomotives in Europe, India and Egypt. Growth in North America included major investments in new and existing fleets, especially for urban transport. Growth in the rail infrastructure market was driven mainly by digitalization, deployment of ETCS technology and track electrification, for example with projects in Europe and Asia. For fiscal 2024, markets served by Mobility are expected to grow clearly, benefiting from the above-mentioned trends and with all reporting regions contributing to growth. Market expansion is expected to  be  supported  by  a  large  number  of  public  investment  programs.  Mobility  anticipates  that  rail  operators  in  Europe,  particularly  in Germany and in the U.K., will continue making significant investments in rolling stock and advanced rail infrastructure solutions and that customers in the Middle East and Africa will tender large turnkey projects, especially in North Africa and the Middle East such as in in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Markets in the U.S. are expected to remain strong, especially due to ongoing investments in rolling stock, particularly for mainline and light rail transport; within the infrastructure market demand is expected to continue for mass transit including communications-based train control technology and from a developing market for rail freight solutions. In Asia, markets in India are expected to grow strongly with investments in mainline transport (high-speed trains, freight infrastructure, rolling stock fleet renewals and expansions of large commuter rail and locomotive tenders), urban metros and rail electrification driving growth.\n\n## 3.5 Siemens Healthineers\n\nSiemens as majority shareholder holds just over 75% of the shares of the publicly listed Siemens Healthineers AG, Germany. Siemens Healthineers is a global provider of healthcare products, solutions and services. It develops, manufactures, and sells a diverse range of diagnostic  and  therapeutic  products  and  services  to  healthcare  providers.  In  addition,  Siemens  Healthineers  also  provides  clinical consulting services, as well as an extensive range of training and service offerings. This comprehensive portfolio supports customers along the  entire  care  continuum,  from  prevention  and  early  detection  through  to  diagnosis,  treatment,  and  follow-up  care.  The  customer spectrum ranges from public and private healthcare providers, including hospitals and hospital systems, public and private clinics and laboratories,  universities,  physicians/joint  medical  practices,  public  health  agencies,  public  and  private  health  insurers,  through  to pharmaceutical companies and clinical research institutes. The imaging business provides imaging products, services, and solutions as well as digital offerings. Its most important products are devices for magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, X-ray, molecular imaging, and ultrasound. The diagnostics business comprises in-vitro diagnostic products and services that are offered to healthcare providers in the fields of laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics. The Varian business provides multi-modality cancer care technologies along with solutions and services to oncology departments in hospitals and clinics. The portfolio of the advanced therapies business consists of highly integrated products, services, and solutions across multiple clinical fields that are designed to support image-guided minimally invasive treatments, in areas such as cardiology, interventional radiology, and surgery. Competition in the imaging, Varian and advanced therapies businesses  consists  mainly  of  a  small  number  of  large  multinational  companies,  while  the  diagnostics  market  is fragmented with a variety of global players that compete with each other across market segments and also with several regional players and specialized companies in niche technologies. Markets of Siemens Healthineers are characterized by long-term stability, though, over the  long  term,  these  markets  may  also  experience  shorter-term  fluctuations  arising  from  macroeconomic  and  health  political developments,  such  as  changes  in  health  policy,  regulation  or  reimbursement  systems.  Because  a  substantial  portion  of  Siemens Healthineers' revenue stems from recurring business, growth opportunities can be pursued from a stable foundation of profit.\n\nThe addressable markets of Siemens Healthineers are shaped by four major trends . The first is demographic developments, in particular the growing and aging global population. This trend poses major challenges for global healthcare systems and, at the same time, offers an opportunity for healthcare providers as the demand for cost-efficient healthcare solutions increases. The second trend is economic development in emerging countries,  which  opens  up  improved  access  to  healthcare  for  many  people.  Significant  investment  in  the expansion of private and public healthcare systems will persist, driving overall demand for healthcare products and services and hence market growth. The third trend is the increase in non-communicable diseases as a consequence of an aging population and environmental and lifestyle-related changes. This trend results in far more patients with multiple morbidities, increasing the need for new ways to detect and  treat  diseases  in  a  timely  manner.  The  fourth  global  trend,  the  transformation  of  healthcare  providers  such  as  hospitals  and",

        "page_content": "laboratories, results from a combination of societal and market forces that are driving healthcare providers to operate and organize their businesses differently. This development is driven partly by staff shortages, society's increasing resistance to healthcare costs, the growing professionalization of health insurance and governmental healthcare systems, burdens from chronic diseases and the rapid scientific progress.  The  growing  cost  pressure  will  continue  to  drive  new  remuneration  models  for  healthcare  services  such  as  value-based reimbursement instead of treatment-based reimbursement. As a result of these factors, there's a trend of consolidation of healthcare providers into networks. The aim of the resulting larger clinic and laboratory chains, often operating internationally and acting increasingly like  large  corporations are systematic improvements in quality, while at the same time reducing costs. This development leads to an increased demand for standardized and scalable systems and solutions as well as new business models.\n\nR&D activities at  Siemens  Healthineers  are  aimed  at  offering  innovative  and  sustainable  solutions  for  diagnostics  and  therapy  to  its customers. Artificial intelligence, sensors, and robotics are focal points of the R&D activities at Siemens Healthineers. A growing share of the R&D activities is devoted to improving the sustainability of the products. Furthermore, the systems of Siemens Healthineers regularly receive extensive software releases to improve user friendliness and add innovative applications. Investments at Siemens Healthineers were mainly for spending for factories to expand manufacturing and technical capabilities, in particular in the U.S. and China, for measures related to improving operational efficiency and for additions to intangible assets, including capitalized development expenses for products within the Atellica product line.\n\n|                    | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   | % Change   |\n|--------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac) | 2023          | 2022          | Actual     | Comp.      |\n| Orders             | 24,499        | 25,556        | (4)%       | (2)%       |\n| Revenue            | 21,681        | 21,715        | 0%         | 1%         |\n| Profit             | 2,527         | 3,369         | (25)%      |            |\n| Profit margin      | 11.7%         | 15.5%         |            |            |\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Siemens Healthineers recorded a decrease of orders, while revenue was on the prior-year level. While the imaging and Varian businesses in particular delivered growth in both orders and revenue, this was offset by a substantial decline in the diagnostics business. On a geographic basis, revenue was on the prior-year level in all regions; in the Asia, Australia region reported revenue was held back by negative currency translation effects. Profit declined primarily due to substantially lower revenue from rapid coronavirus antigen tests in the diagnostics business, which also recorded charges of \u20ac0.2 billion related to its transformation program. In addition, profitability was burdened by impairments and other charges totaling \u20ac0.3 billion due to a management decision to refocus certain activities in the advanced therapies business. The imaging and Varian businesses increased their profit contributions on higher revenue. Severance charges were \u20ac167 million in fiscal 2023, compared to \u20ac71 million a year earlier. The order backlog for Siemens Healthineers was \u20ac34 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac11 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024.\n\nIn general, the addressable global markets of Siemens Healthineers excluding rapid coronavirus antigen tests grew moderately in fiscal 2023. From a regional perspective, the Asia, Australia region saw market growth in most businesses; in China, government subsidy programs, among others, including the program of lending incentives associated with the economic stimulus package, had a positive effect on investment by healthcare providers. In the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East, government subsidy programs, among others, were able to support growth in most businesses. In the U.S., market growth was recorded in all businesses. Globally, higher volume in the market for the imaging business was generated thanks to the high level of order backlogs resulting from demand catch-up effects, on the one hand, and investments in diagnostic imaging equipment in reaction to announced price hikes, on the other hand. The imaging market is expected to grow moderately overall in fiscal 2024, driven mainly by pent-up demand for the major imaging modalities. Within the diagnostics business, demand for rapid coronavirus antigen tests declined sharply after the COVID-19 pandemic ceased to be a global health emergency and the incidence of COVID-19 infections subsided. The market for the diagnostics business is expected to achieve slight growth in fiscal 2024, excluding COVID-19 testing. In the market for Varian, overall market growth, especially in the U.S. and Western Europe, was boosted mainly by increasing demand for product innovations and services as well as by an intact replacement market. For this  reason,  the  market  for  Varian  is  expected  to  grow  clearly  in  fiscal  2024.  For  advanced  therapies  business,  government  subsidy programs, including lending incentives enacted as part of the economic stimulus package in China along with EU investment programs, positively influenced market development. The expectation for the advanced therapies business is that the market will continue to grow moderately in fiscal 2024.\n\n## 3.6 Siemens Financial Services\n\nSiemens Financial Services provides financing solutions for Siemens' customers as well as other companies in the form of debt and equity investments.

In the prior period, earnings before taxes were burdened by \u20ac0.2 billion in connection with the sale of the financing and leasing business in Russia at the end of the fiscal year. The equity business recorded strong results. While both periods under review included gains from the sales of equity investments, fiscal 2022 additionally included higher gains from fair value measurements of investments and gains from energy-related investments in connection with rising prices in global energy markets.\n\nNet cash from operations (defined as the sum of cash flows from operating and investing activities) amounted to \u20ac(733) million compared to \u20ac(616) million in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, net cash from operations comprised Free cash flow of \u20ac852 million and \u20ac985 million, respectively, while remaining cash flows from investing activities, including from changes in receivables from financing activities, comprised \u20ac(1,585) million and \u20ac(1,601) million, respectively.\n\nDespite the increase in receivables from financing activities, total assets decreased since the end of fiscal 2022 due primarily to negative currency translation effects.\n\nSFS's business scope and capital allocation is focused on areas of intense domain know-how closely aligned with Siemens' customers and markets, particularly for Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure and Mobility. Accordingly, SFS is influenced by the business development of the markets served by the industrial businesses, among other factors, including macroeconomic effects such as inflation or recession which could impact the credit risk of customers. In addition to its high level of diversification across industries, SFS has a strong regional footprint in investment-grade countries, with the highest share in the U.S. SFS intends to maintain a highly diversified portfolio across regions, while participating in the strong economic development of selected Asian markets.\n\n## 3.7 Portfolio Companies\n\nPortfolio  Companies comprise  businesses  which  deliver  a  broad  range  of  customized  and  application-specific  products,  software, solutions, systems and services for different industries including oil and gas, chemical, mining, cement, logistics, energy, marine, water and fiber. Unrealized potential within these businesses requires adjustment in their approach using defined measures including internal re-organization, digitalization, cost improvements, and optimizing procurement, production and service activities. After achieving certain threshold performance targets, businesses may be combined with another business in the same industry, sold, placed into an external private equity partnership, or exited via a public listing.\n\nAt the end of fiscal 2023, Portfolio Companies consisted mainly of three separately managed units: Large Drives Applications offers electric motors, converters and mining solutions. Siemens Logistics offers sorting technology and solutions focused on handling baggage and cargo in airports. Siemens Energy Assets comprises certain regional business activities of the former Gas and Power segment; as part of the Siemens Energy carve-out these activities remained so far with Siemens due to country-specific regulatory restrictions or economic considerations.\n\nDemand within  the  industries  served  by  Portfolio  Companies  mainly  shows  a  delayed  response  to  changes  in  the  overall  economic environment. Financial results are strongly dependent, however, on customer investment cycles in their key industries. In commoditybased industries such as oil and gas or mining, these cycles are driven mainly by commodity price fluctuations rather than changes in produced volumes. The heterogonous industrial customer base of the separately managed units requires a dedicated sales approach based on in-depth understanding of specific industries and customer requests, resulting in the use of various sales and marketing channels for Portfolio Companies.\n\n|                    | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   | % Change   |\n|--------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac) | 2023          | 2022          | Actual     | Comp.      |\n| Orders             | 4,016         | 3,995         | 1%         | 15%        |\n| Revenue            | 3,313         | 3,234         | 2%         | 19%        |\n| Profit             | 343           | 1,520         | (77)%      |            |\n| Profit margin      | 10.3%         | 47.0%         |            |            |\n\nIn fiscal 2023, orders and revenue increased in all businesses. While order growth was driven by higher volume from larger orders, most evidently at the Airport Logistics business of Siemens Logistics, revenue increased mainly at Large Drives Applications in part due to strong conversion of the order backlog. Primarily due to the sale of the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, portfolio effects took eleven and 13 percentage points from orders and revenue, respectively. The strong profit was driven by Siemens Energy Assets and Large Drives Applications. Additionally, Portfolio Companies recorded a gain of \u20ac0.1 billion from the sale of the Commercial Vehicles business. For comparison, profit in fiscal 2022 included a gain of \u20ac1.1 billion from the sale of the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics and a revaluation gain of \u20ac0.3 billion in connection with the sale of the equity investment in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH. Portfolio Companies recorded lower severance charges of \u20ac12 million, down from \u20ac20 million in fiscal 2022.",

After the post-pandemic recovery, a normalizing growth momentum is expected in most end-customer vertical markets in fiscal 2024.\n\nAt the beginning of fiscal 2024, Large Drives Applications and certain business activities which were transferred from Digital Industries are combined in the areas of low- to high-voltage motors, geared motors, medium-voltage converters and motor spindles under a new separately managed unit, Innomotics. If the transfer from Digital Industries had already existed at the beginning of fiscal 2023, Portfolio Companies would have posted orders of \u20ac5,317 million, revenue of \u20ac4,699 million, profit of \u20ac457 million and a profit margin of 9.7%. Portfolio Companies' order backlog amounted to \u20ac5 billion at the beginning of fiscal 2024, of which \u20ac3 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024.\n\n## 3.8 Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Profit\n\n|                                                                     | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                  | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Siemens Energy Investment                                           | 668           | (2,911)       |\n| Siemens Real Estate                                                 | 67            | 118           |\n| Innovation                                                          | (195)         | (190)         |\n| Governance                                                          | (451)         | (582)         |\n| Centrally carried pension expense                                   | (104)         | (113)         |\n| Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations | (865)         | (990)         |\n| Financing, eliminations and other items                             | (256)         | (474)         |\n| Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements                 | (1,135)       | (5,141)       |\n\nThe result for Siemens Energy Investment was driven by a gain of \u20ac1.6 billion from a partial reversal of an impairment on Siemens' stake in Siemens Energy AG (fiscal 2022 included an impairment of \u20ac2.7 billion), a gain of \u20ac0.3 billion resulting from the transfer of a stake in Siemens Energy AG to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V., and a gain of \u20ac0.2 billion which was recorded in connection with a capital increase by Siemens Energy AG in which Siemens did not participate. These gains were partly offset by Siemens' share of Siemens Energy's after-tax loss and expenses from amortization of assets resulting from purchase price allocation totaling \u20ac1.5 billion (fiscal 2022: totaling \u20ac0.2 billion).\n\nFinancing, eliminations and other items included a revaluation loss of \u20ac0.2 billion on the stake in Thoughtworks Holding Inc. (fiscal 2022: a loss of \u20ac0.3 billion). For comparison, fiscal 2022 included also impacts totaling \u20ac0.5 billion at Corporate Treasury, resulting from the  sale  of  Siemens'  financing  and  leasing  business  in  Russia,  as  well  as  a  loss  of  \u20ac0.1  billion  resulting  from  applying  hyperinflation accounting. These effects were partly offset in fiscal 2022 by a gain of \u20ac0.5 billion in connection with an investment accounted for using the equity method mainly due to fair value measurement.",

Severance  charges  for  continuing  operations  were  \u20ac430  million,  of  which  \u20ac351  million  were  in  Industrial  Business.  In  fiscal  2022, severance charges for continuing operations were \u20ac272 million, of which \u20ac190 million were in Industrial Business.\n\nThe tax rate in fiscal 2023 was 24% (fiscal 2022: 38%), benefiting from tax-free gains in relation to the partial reversal of an impairment on Siemens' stake in Siemens Energy AG and the contribution of a stake in Siemens Energy AG to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. Moreover, the gain recorded in connection with the capital increase by Siemens Energy AG was also tax-free. These positive influences on the tax rate were partly offset by our participation in the after-tax loss at Siemens Energy, which was not tax-deductible. As a result, the increase in Income from continuing operations was 93%.\n\nThe increase in Basic EPS and in EPS pre PPA reflects the increase of Net income attributable to Shareholders of Siemens AG, which was \u20ac7,949 million in fiscal 2023 compared to \u20ac3,723 million in fiscal 2022, combined with a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding. Our investment in Siemens Energy AG contributed \u20ac0.84 to the increase of EPS pre PPA.\n\nAt 18.6%, ROCE was back in the target range established in our Siemens Financial Framework. The increase year-over-year was due primarily to sharply higher income before interest after tax.\n\n## 4.3 Research and development\n\nIn fiscal 2023, we reported research and development expenses of \u20ac6.2 billion, compared to \u20ac5.6 billion in fiscal 2022. The resulting R&D intensity, defined as the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue, was 8.0% (fiscal 2022: 7.8%). Additions to capitalized development expenses amounted to \u20ac0.3 billion as in the prior year. As of September 30, 2023, Siemens worldwide held approximately 45,000 granted patents in its continuing operations. On average, we had 50,029 R&D employees in fiscal 2023.\n\nOur research and development activities are ultimately geared to developing innovative, sustainable solutions for our customers - and our businesses - while also strengthening our own competitiveness. Joint implementation by the operating units and Technology, our central R&D department, ensures that research activities and business strategies are closely aligned with one another, and that all units benefit equally and quickly from technological developments.\n\nSiemens' core technologies have been determined to be critical for our Company's long-term success and that of our customers. They are bundled in eleven technology areas: additive manufacturing and materials (from fiscal 2024 on: advanced manufacturing and circularity), cybersecurity and trust, data analytics and artificial intelligence, power electronics, simulation and digital twin, sustainable energy and infrastructure, future of automation, integrated circuits and electronics, connectivity and edge, software systems and processes, and user experience.\n\nWe advance technologies also through our open innovation concept. We work closely with scholars from leading universities, research institutions and academic start-ups, not only under bilateral cooperation agreements but also in publicly funded collective projects. Our focus here is on our strategic research partners and in particular the Siemens Research and Innovation Ecosystems, which we maintain at 16 locations worldwide.\n\nSiemens' global venture capital unit, Next47, provides capital to help start-ups expand and scale. It serves as the creator of next-generation businesses for Siemens by building, buying and partnering with innovative companies at any stage. Next47 is focused on anticipating how emerging technologies will influence our end markets. This foreknowledge enables our Company and our customers to grow and thrive in the age of digitalization.",

The latter was a major factor also for the decrease of other financial assets , along with decreased positive fair values of derivative financial instruments.\n\nInventories increased in all industrial businesses, with the build-up most evident at Mobility and Siemens Healthineers.\n\nThe decrease of other intangible assets resulted mainly from negative currency translation effects and from impairments recorded at Siemens Healthineers.\n\nOur investment in Siemens Energy AG was the main factor for the decrease of investments accounted for using the equity method .

This was partly offset by the repayment of euro, U.S. dollar and British pound instruments totaling \u20ac4.6 billion.\n\nLong-term debt decreased due primarily to the above-mentioned reclassifications and currency translation effects of \u20ac1.9 billion on bonds issued in the U.S. dollar and British pound. Set against this were mainly increases of \u20ac2.5 billion from the issuance of euro bonds.\n\nThe contribution of a stake in Siemens Energy AG to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. led to a decrease of provisions for pensions and similar obligations . Additional major effects resulted from returns on plan assets and actuarial gains and losses. For further information see Note 17 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for fiscal 2023.\n\nThe main factors for the decrease in total equity attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG were a negative other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, of \u20ac4.0 billion resulting mainly from currency translation; dividend payments of \u20ac3.4 billion (for fiscal 2022); and changes in equity totaling \u20ac1.6 billion resulting from an equity transaction at Siemens Energy AG. These factors were largely offset by \u20ac7.9 billion in net income attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG. In fiscal 2023, Siemens cancelled 50 million treasury shares, thereby reducing issued capital by \u20ac150 million and retained earnings by \u20ac5.1 billion.\n\n## Capital structure ratio\n\nOur capital structure ratio as of September 30, 2023 decreased to 0.6 from 1.0 a year earlier. The change was due to a decrease in Industrial net debt and a higher EBITDA.\n\n## Debt and credit facilities\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we recorded, in total, \u20ac40.9 billion in notes and bonds, \u20ac2.2 billion in loans from banks, \u20ac0.5 billion in other financial indebtedness and \u20ac2.9 billion in lease liabilities. Notes and bonds were issued mainly in the U.S. dollar and the euro, and to a lesser extent in the British pound.\n\nWe have credit facilities totaling \u20ac7.5 billion which were unused as of September 30, 2023.\n\nFor further information about our debt see Note 16 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2023.

This included primarily Siemens' obligations from performance and credit guarantees in connection with the Siemens Energy business, for which Siemens has reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy.\n\nIn addition to these commitments, there are contingent liabilities of \u20ac0.4 billion which result mainly from other guarantees and legal proceedings. Other guarantees include \u20ac0.1 billion, for which Siemens has reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy.\n\nIrrevocable loan commitments amounted to \u20ac3.9 billion. A considerable portion of these commitments resulted from asset-based lending transactions, meaning that the respective loans can be drawn only after the borrower has provided sufficient collateral.\n\nFor further information about our commitments and contingencies see Notes 21 and 25 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2023.\n\n## Share buyback\n\nThe share buyback program announced on June 24, 2021 with a volume of up to \u20ac3 billion ending September 15, 2026, at the latest, began on November 15, 2021. This buyback is executed based on the authorization provided by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020. In fiscal 2023, Siemens repurchased 6,853,091 shares under this share buyback program. On November 16, 2023 we announced a share buyback of up to \u20ac6 billion for up to five years.\n\n## 6.2 Cash flows\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                                      | Fiscal year  2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Cash flows from operating activities                                                    |                     |\n| Net income                                                                              | 8,529               |\n| Change in operating net working capital                                                 | (2,165)             |\n| Other reconciling items to cash flows from operating activities - continuing operations | 5,918               |\n| Cash flows from operating activities - continuing operations                            | 12,281              |\n| Cash flows from operating activities - discontinued operations                          | (41)                |\n| Cash flows from operating activities - continuing and discontinued operations           | 12,239              |\n| Cash flows from investing activities                                                    |                     |\n| Additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment                        | (2,218)             |\n| Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired                                        | (407)               |\n| Purchase of investments and financial assets for investment purposes                    | (723)               |\n| Change in receivables from financing activities of SFS                                  | (1,461)             |\n| Other disposals of assets                                                               | 1,351               |\n| Cash flows from investing activities - continuing operations                            | (3,458)             |\n| Cash flows from investing activities - discontinued operations                          | 281                 |\n| Cash flows from investing activities - continuing and discontinued operations           | (3,176)             |\n| Cash flows from financing activities                                                    |                     |\n| Purchase of treasury shares                                                             | (884)               |\n| Re-issuance of treasury shares and other transactions with owners                       | (404)               |\n| Issuance of long-term debt                                                              | 2,470               |\n| Repayment of long-term debt (including current maturities of long-term debt)            | (5,252)             |\n| Change in short-term debt and other financing activities                                | 300                 |\n| Interest paid                                                                           | (1,208)             |\n| Dividends paid to shareholders of Siemens AG                                            | (3,362)             |\n| Dividends attributable to non-controlling interests                                     | (389)               |\n| Cash flows from financing activities - continuing operations                            | (8,730)             |\n| Cash flows from financing activities - discontinued operations                          | (1)                 |\n| Cash flows from financing activities - continuing and discontinued operations           | (8,731)             |\n\nIndustrial Business recorded cash inflows from operating activities that exceeded its profit, with the highest contribution from Digital Industries.

Within the industrial businesses, ongoing investments related mainly to technological innovations; maintaining, extending and digitalizing our capacities for designing, manufacturing and marketing new solutions; improving productivity; and replacements of fixed assets. These investments amounted to \u20ac1.7 billion in fiscal 2023. The remaining portion related mainly to Siemens Real Estate, including significant amounts for projects such as new office buildings in Germany and Spain. Siemens Real Estate is responsible for uniform and comprehensive management of Company real estate worldwide (except for Siemens Healthineers) and supports the industrial businesses and corporate activities with customer-specific real estate solutions.\n\nWith regard to capital expenditures, we expect a significant increase in fiscal 2024. In the context of the \u20ac2 billion investment strategy presented in fiscal 2023 to strengthen growth, innovation and resilience, significant amounts will be invested in the coming years for the construction and expansion of high-tech production facilities in the U.S., China and Singapore. As part of this investment strategy, Siemens also announced the establishment of its new Technology Campus in Erlangen, Germany, to expand development and manufacturing capacities. In addition, up to \u20ac0.6 billion are to be invested in Siemensstadt Square. This project, initiated in fiscal 2019, aims to transform Siemens' existing industrial area in Berlin into a modern urban district supporting a diverse range of purposes, including strengthening key technologies. Further investments are planned in relation to new office buildings, including Siemens Campus Erlangen. Furthermore, we continue to invest in attractive innovation fields through Next47, our global venture capital unit.",

        "page_content": "## 7. Overall assessment of the economic position\n\nOverall,  global  economic  development  in  fiscal  2023  was  mixed  and  characterized  by  a  number  of  headwinds.  In  this  environment, Siemens delivered a very strong performance in all its businesses due to its strategic positioning relative to long-term trends such as automation, electrification and digitalization. With our offerings, we help increase resource efficiency and the decarbonization of industry, transport and building infrastructures and make manufacturing more resilient and flexible. We expect these trends to continue to drive our growth in the coming years.\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, we made further progress in focusing our business portfolio by selling our Commercial Vehicles business. Furthermore, we began forming a new motors and large drives company under the name Innomotics by combining our existing business activities in the areas of low- to high-voltage motors, geared motors, medium-voltage converters and motor spindles. Also, we further reduced our stake in Siemens Energy AG to 25.1% and transferred shares to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. To boost future growth and drive innovation, we announced a \u20ac2 billion investment strategy mainly for new manufacturing capacity as well as innovation labs and education centers. We also expanded our open digital business platform, Siemens Xcelerator, by introducing Industrial Operations X, which includes a broad range of interoperable offerings for more adaptive production, and by adding new cloud-based applications for Building X, our suite for smart and sustainable buildings.\n\nFiscal 2023 was another very successful year for Siemens. We achieved excellent financial results in a volatile market environment, which on the one hand included destocking by customers and distributors following previously proactive purchasing, particularly in our shortcycle businesses, and on the other hand included improved supply chain conditions, which accelerated revenue conversion from our high order backlog. We raised our outlook during the fiscal year after the first and the second quarters. We then reached or exceeded all the targets set for our primary measures for fiscal 2023. We achieved revenue growth of 11% net of currency translation and portfolio effects and delivered EPS pre PPA of \u20ac10.77. Excluding Siemens Energy Investment, EPS pre PPA was \u20ac9.93. ROCE increased to 18.6%, our capital structure ratio came in at 0.6, and the cash conversion rate was 1.17.\n\nOrders rose 7% year-over-year to \u20ac92.3 billion, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.19, thus fulfilling our expectation of a ratio above 1. Order growth was driven by sharply higher volume from large orders at Mobility, including an order worth \u20ac2.9 billion for locomotives and associated maintenance in India and a \u20ac2.5 billion order for the first line of a turnkey rail system in Egypt, and by clear growth in Smart Infrastructure led by the electrification business. Orders in Digital Industries came in lower as the destocking trend mentioned above had a significant effect on its automation businesses.\n\nRevenue was higher in nearly all our industrial businesses and rose to \u20ac77.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries contributed double-digit growth with all businesses posting increases. Revenue growth at Smart Infrastructure was led by the electrification  and  the  electrical  products  businesses,  while  at  Digital  Industries  the  factory  automation  and  the  process  automation businesses contributed the strongest growth. Revenue growth at Mobility was led by a significant increase in the rolling stock business. Revenue at Siemens Healthineers remained on the prior-year level as growth particularly in the imaging and Varian businesses was offset by a decline in the diagnostics business. Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects, revenue for Siemens rose 11%. We thus exceeded the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report for fiscal 2022, which was to achieve comparable revenue growth in the range of 6% to 9%, and reached the upper end of our subsequently raised outlook, which was to achieve 9% to 11% in comparable revenue growth.\n\nProfit Industrial Business exceeded the record high of a year earlier and rose 11% to \u20ac11.4 billion. All industrial businesses except Siemens Healthineers  increased  their  profit  year-over-year.  The  strongest  increase  came  from  Smart  Infrastructure  on  improvements  in  all  its businesses, led by the electrical products and the electrification businesses. Growth at Digital Industries was driven by the automation businesses, only partly offset by a decline in profit in the software business due mainly to higher expenses related to cloud-based activities. Profit at Mobility increased in nearly all businesses and included positive trailing effects related to the winding down of business activities in Russia a year earlier. Profit at Siemens Healthineers came in lower on declines in the diagnostics business, due primarily to sharply lower revenue from rapid coronavirus antigen tests as well as charges related to its transformation program and charges related to refocusing certain activities in the advanced therapies business.\n\nThe profit margin of our Industrial Business rose to 15.4%, up from 15.1% a year earlier, reaching its highest level ever. Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure achieved the strongest increases and also contributed the highest margins: 22.6% and 15.4%, respectively. The profit margin for Mobility rose slightly to 8.4%, while the profit margin at Siemens Healthineers declined to 11.7%.\n\nEarnings before taxes at SFS increased significantly due mainly to higher earnings before taxes in the debt business, which in the prior fiscal year included a \u20ac0.2 billion impact in connection with the sale of the financing and leasing business in Russia. Return on equity after tax for SFS increased to 16.3%. Profit at Portfolio Companies included a \u20ac0.1 billion gain from the sale of the Commercial Vehicles business but came in sharply lower compared to the prior fiscal year which had included a \u20ac1.1 billion gain from the sale of the mail and parcelhandling business of Siemens Logistics and a \u20ac0.3 billion revaluation gain in connection with the sale of our stake in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH. Results within Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements benefited from positive effects related to Siemens Energy Investment, including \u20ac1.6 billion from a partial reversal of the prior-year \u20ac2.7 billion impairment on Siemens' stake in Siemens Energy AG. These positive effects were partly offset by Siemens' share of Siemens Energy's after-tax loss.\n\nNet income nearly doubled year-over-year to a historic high of \u20ac8.5 billion and corresponding basic EPS more than doubled to \u20ac10.04. EPS pre PPA increased to \u20ac10.77. Excluding a positive \u20ac0.84 per share related to Siemens Energy Investment, EPS pre PPA was \u20ac9.93. We thus exceeded the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report for fiscal 2022, which was to achieve EPS pre PPA in a range of \u20ac8.70 to \u20ac9.20, and exceeded our forecast made after the third quarter of fiscal 2023, which was for EPS pre PPA excluding Siemens Energy Investment in the range of \u20ac9.60 to \u20ac9.90.\n\nROCE for fiscal 2023 rose to 18.6%, up from 10.0% in fiscal 2022. This increase was due to sharply higher income before interest after tax year-over-year. We thus exceeded the forecast for ROCE provided in our Combined Management Report 2022, which was to come close to or reach the lower end of our target range of 15% to 20%.\n\nWe evaluate our capital structure using the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA. Due to a combination of a decrease in Industrial net debt and higher EBITDA year-over-year, this ratio declined to 0.6. We thus achieved the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report 2022, which was to achieve a ratio of up to 1.5.",

We thus achieved a cash conversion rate that contributed strongly to the average required to reach our target of 1 minus annual comparable revenue growth rate over a cycle of three to five years.\n\nWe intend to continue providing an attractive shareholder return. The Siemens Managing Board, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, proposes a dividend of \u20ac4.70 per share, up from \u20ac4.25 per share a year earlier.",

        "page_content": "## 8. Report on expected developments and associated material opportunities and risks\n\n## 8.1 Report on expected developments\n\n## 8.1.1 Worldwide economy\n\nThe global economy showed remarkable resilience in calendar 2023, given the number of headwinds and negative economic shocks from the  previous  year.  Nevertheless,  these  shocks  still  have  adverse  implications  for  economic  growth  in  calendar  2024,  especially  the dampening effects of tighter financial conditions. Accordingly, in calendar 2024 the global economy is expected to further slow down to 2.3% GDP growth, after 2.6% in calendar 2023. Given the high number of active and potential geopolitical conflicts, the outlook is subject to a high level of uncertainty.\n\nIn the E.U., GDP is expected to increase by 0.8% in calendar 2024, after an anticipated growth of 0.4% in calendar 2023. The effects of the energy crisis still show negative impacts, especially in energy-intensive industries. Tighter monetary policy - the European Central Bank lifted the main policy interest rate to 4.5% in just over one year - also held back growth, particularly in the construction industry. The German economy is most impacted due to its proportionally large manufacturing sector and is expected to grow by only 0.5% in calendar 2024.\n\nThe U.S. economy is expected to decelerate to a soft landing. After unexpectedly strong GDP growth (expected to be +2.5%) in calendar 2023, caused mainly by a very strong services sector while industry was weak, growth in calendar 2024 is expected to slow down to 1.6%. Tighter financial conditions - the Federal Reserve increased the main policy interest rate to 5.5% and longer-term interest rates also increased substantially - will unfold their full effect next year. Hence, a short and shallow recession during calendar 2024, while not our baseline assumption, is also possible and expected by some economists. Consumer spending is expected to continue as a primary growth driver, while government investment programs (CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act) play a supporting role for the economy as they spur business investment.\n\nGDP in China is expected to grow at only 4.6% in calendar 2024, after an anticipated growth of 5.0% in calendar 2023. The correction in the real estate sector will continue to weigh on GDP growth. During calendar 2024 global goods demand, world trade and industrial production are expected to modestly increase again. The main assumption behind this expectation is further normalization for two critical factors: consumer spending and the inventory policies of companies. Both weighed on industrial output in calendar 2023 but are expected to modestly support growth of the Chinese economy in calendar 2024. In addition, Chinese private consumption is expected to drive domestic demand and some tailwinds will come from announced stimulus measures.\n\nGlobally, the decline of inflation rates is expected to continue, although at a slower pace. Past interest rate hikes are having the desired effect, and headline inflation is expected to steadily approach the central bank targets. Hence, monetary policy is expected to become less restrictive in calendar 2024.\n\nGlobal fixed investments should benefit from government programs and from factory investments to improve supply chain resilience and other diversification measures. Global gross fixed investments are expected to grow by 3.2% in calendar 2024, unchanged from 3.2% in the year before.\n\nGiven the forecasted further slowdown of the global economy, growth of markets served by Siemens is also expected to slow in fiscal 2024  in  light  of  significant  headwinds,  few  tailwinds,  and  reduced  stabilizing  effects  from  high  industry's  order  backlogs  and  price adjustments in a number of our businesses.\n\nThe forecasts for calendars 2024 and 2023 presented here for GDP and fixed investments are based on a report from S&P Global dated October 15, 2023.\n\n## 8.1.2 Siemens Group\n\nWe are basing our outlook for fiscal 2024 on the above-mentioned expectations and assumptions regarding the overall economic situation and  also  on  the  specific  market  conditions  we  expect  for  our  respective  industrial  businesses,  as  described  in  chapter  3  Segment information. Furthermore, we assume that geopolitical tensions do not further increase. We expect improvements in productivity and adjusting prices for our own products, solutions and services to more than offset effects from wage increases and higher prices for raw materials and components.\n\nWe are exposed to currency translation effects, mainly involving the U.S. dollar, the British pound and currencies of emerging markets, particularly the Chinese yuan. Siemens is still a net exporter from the Eurozone to the rest of the world, so a weak euro is principally favorable for our business and a strong euro is principally unfavorable. While we expect volatility in global currency markets to continue in fiscal 2024, we have improved our natural hedge on a global basis through geographic distribution of our production facilities in the past. In addition to the natural hedging strategy, we also hedge currency risk in our export business using derivative financial instruments. We expect these steps to help us limit effects on income related to currency in fiscal 2024. In this outlook, we assume that currency translation effects in fiscal 2024 slightly reduce nominal volume growth rates for Siemens and profitability of our businesses.\n\nThis outlook excludes burdens from legal and regulatory matters.\n\n## Segments\n\nDigital Industries expects for fiscal 2024 comparable revenue development of 0% to 3%. This is based on the assumption that following destocking by customers, global demand in the automation businesses, especially in China, will pick up again in the second half of the fiscal year. The profit margin is expected to be 20% to 23%.\n\nSmart Infrastructure expects for fiscal 2024 comparable revenue growth of 7% to 10%. The profit margin is expected to be 15% to 17%.\n\nMobility expects for fiscal 2024 comparable revenue growth of 8% to 11%. The profit margin is expected to be 8% to 10%.",

        "page_content": "Siemens Healthineers expects to achieve comparable revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5% in fiscal 2024, and to contribute solidly to the profit and profit margin of our Industrial Business.\n\nSFS anticipates further gradually improved earnings before taxes in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. Return on equity (ROE) (after tax) is expected to be in the target range of 15% to 20%.\n\n## Revenue growth\n\nFor comparable revenue, we expect the Siemens Group to achieve comparable revenue growth in the range of 4% to 8%. Furthermore, we anticipate that orders in fiscal 2024 will exceed revenue for a book-to-bill ratio above 1.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, our order backlog totaled \u20ac111 billion, and we expect conversion from the backlog to strongly support revenue growth in fiscal 2024 with approximately \u20ac43 billion of past orders converted to current revenue. For expected conversion of order backlog to revenue for our respective segments, see chapter 3 Segment information.\n\n## Profitability\n\nOutside our reportable segments, we expect Portfolio Companies to achieve an operational margin of more than 5%.\n\nResults of Siemens Energy Investment depend on the performance of Siemens Energy and are excluded from our forecast for EPS pre PPA. We anticipate that Siemens Real Estate will continue with real estate disposals depending on market conditions. Results for Innovation are expected on the prior-year level, which was a negative \u20ac0.2 billion. The negative results related to Governance declined to \u20ac0.5 billion in fiscal 2023; we expect a further improvement in fiscal 2024. Centrally carried pension expense are expected to be on the prior-year level, which was a negative \u20ac0.1 billion. Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations is expected in a range of \u20ac0.7 billion to \u20ac0.8 billion in fiscal 2024 based on our current business portfolio. Financing, eliminations and other items, which were a negative \u20ac0.3 billion in fiscal 2023, are expected to be on the prior-year level depending on market developments.\n\nWe anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of 24% to 29%. This assumption does not take into consideration possible impacts from potential major tax reforms.\n\nOur forecast for net income takes into account a number of additional factors. We assume solid project execution continues in fiscal 2024. We plan to keep the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue, which was 8% in fiscal 2023 at approximately the level in fiscal 2024. We expect the ratio of selling and general administrative expenses to revenue, which was 18% in fiscal 2023 to remain approximately on this level in fiscal 2024. Severance charges, which were \u20ac0.4 billion in fiscal 2023, are expected at a lower level in fiscal 2024.\n\nGiven the above-mentioned assumptions, we expect profitable growth of our Industrial Business to drive an increase in EPS pre PPA excluding Siemens Energy Investment to a range of \u20ac10.40 to \u20ac11.00 in fiscal 2024, along with a corresponding increase in net income. For comparison, fiscal 2023 EPS pre PPA was \u20ac9.93 excluding \u20ac0.84 in EPS pre PPA from Siemens Energy Investment.\n\n## Capital efficiency\n\nFor fiscal 2024, we expect ROCE to be in our target range of 15% to 20%.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nWe aim in general for a capital structure of up to 1.5; we expect to achieve this in fiscal 2024.\n\n## Cash conversion rate\n\nFor fiscal 2024, we expect a cash conversion rate that contributes to reaching our target of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate of Siemens over a cycle of three to five years.\n\n## 8.1.3 Overall assessment\n\nOur outlook for the Siemens Group for fiscal 2024 is based on the assumption that geopolitical tensions do not further increase. Under this condition, we expect our Industrial Business to continue its profitable growth.\n\nFor the Siemens Group we expect comparable revenue growth in the range of 4% to 8% and a book-to-bill ratio above 1.\n\nWe expect profitable growth of our Industrial Business to drive an increase in EPS pre PPA excluding Siemens Energy Investment to a range of \u20ac10.40 to \u20ac11.00 in fiscal 2024, up from EPS pre PPA excluding Siemens Energy Investment of \u20ac9.93 in fiscal 2023.\n\nThis outlook excludes burdens from legal and regulatory matters.\n\nOverall, the actual development for Siemens and its segments may vary, positively or negatively, from our outlook due to the risks and opportunities described below or if our expectations and assumptions do not materialize.\n\n## 8.2 Risk management\n\n## 8.2.1 Basic principles of risk management\n\nOur risk  management policy stems from a philosophy of pursuing sustainable growth and creating economic value while managing appropriate risks and opportunities and avoiding inappropriate risks. As risk management is an integral part of how we plan and execute our business strategies, our risk management policy is set by the Managing Board. Our organizational and accountability structure requires each of the respective managements of our organizational units to implement risk management programs that are tailored to their specific industries and responsibilities, while being consistent with the overall policy.",

        "page_content": "## 8.2.2 Enterprise risk management process\n\nWe have implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems which support us in the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our business. The most important of these systems include our enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning is intended to support us in considering potential risks and opportunities well in advance of major business decisions, while management reporting is intended to enable us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our risk management and its contributing elements are regularly subject of audit activities by our internal  audit  function.  Accordingly,  if  deficits  are  detected,  it  is  possible  to  adopt  appropriate  measures  for  their  elimination.  This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nRisk  management  at  Siemens  builds  on  a  comprehensive,  interactive  and  management-oriented  Enterprise  Risk  Management  (ERM) approach that is integrated into the organization and that addresses both risks and opportunities. Our ERM approach is based on the globally accepted COSO Standard (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) Enterprise Risk Management Integrating with Strategy and Performance (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process, our internal control and our compliance management system. They consider a company's strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of its business operations, the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of, and response regarding, risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing and effective measures and controls. If  risks  have  already  been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the consolidated financial statements (e.g. as a provision or risk contingency), they are supposed to be incorporated with their financial impact in the entity's business objectives. As a consequence, only additional risks arising from the same cause (e.g. deviations from business objectives, different impact perspectives) should be considered. In order to provide a comprehensive view of our business activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way combining elements  of  both  top-down  and  bottom-up  approaches.  Reporting  generally  follows  a  quarterly  cycle;  we  complement  this  periodic reporting with an ad-hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner. Relevant risks and opportunities are evaluated in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation and regulatory  requirements.  The  bottom-up  identification  and  prioritization  process  is  supplemented  by  workshops  with  the  respective managements of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different  management  levels  and  are  included  in  the  subsequent  reporting  process,  if  found  to  be  relevant.  Reported  risks  and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above.\n\nResponsibilities  are  assigned  for  all  relevant  risks  and  opportunities,  with  the  hierarchical  level  of  responsibility  depending  on  the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one  of  our  general  response  strategies.  Our  general  response  strategies  with  respect  to  risks  are  avoidance,  transfer,  reduction  or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to 'pursue' the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management. Accordingly, we have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the  risk  of  fluctuations  in  currency  and  interest  rates  by  engaging  in  hedging  activities.  Regarding  our  projects,  systematic  and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks in order to  reduce  our  exposure  to  such  risks  and  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  losses.  Among  others,  we  address  the  risk  of  fluctuation  in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries, and by adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary. Due to regular screening of climate risks and environmental, social and governance (ESG) developments we can initiate related mitigation actions in a timely manner - also as part of our DEGREE implementation. Worldwide there are risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic or other infectious developments such as bioterrorism to cause high disease rates in countries, regions or continents. We constantly check information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. and Europe, the Robert Koch Institute in Germany and other institutions in order to be able to identify early epidemic or pandemic risks and determine and initiate related mitigation actions as early as possible.\n\n## 8.2.3 Risk management organization and responsibilities\n\nTo oversee the ERM process and to further drive the integration and harmonization of existing control activities to align with legal and operational requirements, the Managing Board established a Risk Management and Internal Control Organization, led by the Head of Assurance. In order to allow for a meaningful discussion at the Siemens Group level, this organization aggregates individual risks and opportunities of similar cause-and-effect nature into broader risk and opportunity themes. This aggregation naturally results in a mixture of risks, including those with a primarily qualitative assessment and those with a primarily quantitative assessment; the same applies to opportunities.  Accordingly,  we  do  not  adopt  a  purely  quantitative  assessment  of  risk  and  opportunity  themes.  Thematic  risk  and opportunity  assessments  as  well  as  our  risk-bearing  capacity  then  form  the  basis  for  the  evaluation  of  the  company-wide  risk  and opportunity  situation  during  the  quarterly  Managing  Board  meetings.  The  Head  of  Assurance  assists  the  Managing  Board  with  the operation and oversight of the risk and internal control system and reporting to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.",

        "page_content": "## 8.3 Risks\n\nBelow we describe the risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition (including effects on assets, liabilities and cash flows), results of operations and reputation. The order in which the risks are presented in each of the four categories reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens associated with these risks and thus provides an indication of the risks' current importance to us. Additional risks not known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business objectives and operations. Unless otherwise stated, the risks described below relate to all our organizational units.\n\n## 8.3.1 Strategic risks\n\nEconomic, political and geopolitical conditions: We see high uncertainties regarding the global economic and geopolitical outlook, which deteriorated significantly in the past year due to multiple headwinds, all of which may continue to intensify. First, the Israel-Gaza conflict continues to escalate and might cause a larger regional conflict involving further parties. Ongoing risks emanate from the war in Ukraine. Both the Israel-Gaza conflict and the war in Ukraine may have negative impacts on sales development, production processes and purchasing  and  logistics  processes,  for  example  through  interruptions  in  supply  chains  and  energy  supplies  or  bottlenecks  affecting components, raw materials and intermediate products. Each of the conflicts could also intensify further to the point of expanding to include other warring parties, including NATO countries, and the use of unconventional weapons. An expansion of the conflicts would have a significant impact on the Siemens market environment. Even the current states of conflicts could have a further negative impact on development of potential crude oil and natural gas supplies. This would fuel inflation, with further risk of a sustained wage-price-spiral. In any case one of the core risks for the Siemens outlook is that central banks may fail to get inflation below their targets and then react more restrictively or even overreact. More restrictive financial conditions would likely push advanced economies into recession and pose a significant risk to vulnerable emerging economies. Highly indebted (emerging and industrialized) countries could suffer from increasing financing costs, further U.S. dollar appreciation, and loss of investor confidence. Other risks could arise for the stability of public finances and the banking sector. Further risks are coming from other geopolitical tensions (particularly associated with the Baltics, Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans, China, Taiwan, and Iran). We continue to face economic risks from a further significant slow-down of the Chinese economy. Key risks are coming from potential financial imbalances, particularly due to the struggling real-estate sector, but also from the growing debt-level of local governments, with growing negative implications for Siemens business in China and the country's trading partners. Obstruction and redefinitions of international cooperation agreements could severely impact our business. First and foremost a more extensive U.S.-China decoupling would have adverse effects on confidence and investment activity and would severely hit Siemens' business. Increasing trade barriers, protectionism, sanctions and in particular technical regulations would negatively impact production costs and productivity along our global value chains, as well as significantly impede or even hinder access to sales markets. A significant risk to our sales potential and cost structures is coming from the possibility of renewed supply chain bottlenecks, due to growing lack of availability of intermediate goods, in particular electronic components. Furthermore, grid-lock in U.S. politics could weigh on U.S. growth with the risk of a global spillover. We are dependent on the economic development of certain industries; a continuation or even an intensification of the cyclical and structural headwinds in core customer industries, e.g. automotive or construction, would have adverse impact on our business prospects. A resurgence of COVID-19 or even the outbreak of a new pandemic, a terrorist attack, a significant cybercrime incident, or a series of such attacks or incidents in major economies, could depress economic activity globally and undermine consumer and business confidence. Additionally, the highly interconnected global economy remains vulnerable to natural disasters or hybrid warfare.\n\nIf we are not successful in adapting our production and cost structure to subsequent changes in conditions in the markets in which we operate, there can be no assurance that we will not experience adverse effects. For example, our customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products, solutions and services, or fail to follow through on purchases or contracts already executed. In addition, it may become more difficult for our customers to obtain financing. Contracted payment terms, especially regarding the level of advance payments by our customers relating  to  long-term  projects,  may  become  less  favorable,  which  could  negatively  impact  our  financial condition. Siemens' global setup with operations in almost all relevant economies, our wide range of offerings with varied exposures to business cycles, and our balanced mix of business models (e.g. equipment, components, systems, software, services and solutions) help us to absorb impacts from adverse developments in any single market.\n\nPortfolio measures, at-equity investments, other investments and strategic alliances : Our strategy includes divesting our activities in some  business  areas  and  strengthening  others  through  portfolio  measures,  including  mergers  and  acquisitions.  With  respect  to divestments, we may not be able to divest some of our activities as planned, and the divestitures we do carry out could have a negative impact on our business situation, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky because of difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products. There can be no assurance that any of the businesses we acquire can be integrated successfully and in a timely manner as originally planned, or that they will perform as anticipated once integrated. In addition, we may incur significant acquisition, administrative, tax and other expenditures in connection with these transactions, including costs related to integration of acquired businesses. Furthermore, portfolio measures may result in additional financing needs and adversely affect our capital structure. Acquisitions can lead to substantial additions to intangible assets, including goodwill, in our statements of financial position. If we were to encounter continuing adverse business developments or if we were otherwise to perform worse than expected at acquisition activities, then these intangible assets, including goodwill, might have to be impaired, which could adversely affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations. Our investment portfolio includes  investments  held  for  purposes  other  than  trading  and  other  investments.  Any  factors  negatively  influencing  the  financial condition and results of operations of our at-equity investments, such as Siemens Energy, and other investments could have an adverse effect on our equity pick-up related to these investments or may result in a related write-off. In addition, our business situation, financial condition and results of operations could also be adversely affected in connection with loans, guarantees or non-compliance with financial covenants related to these investments. Furthermore, such investments are inherently risky as we may not be able to sufficiently influence corporate governance processes or business decisions taken by our at-equity investments, by other investments and by strategic alliances, which may have a negative effect on our business and especially on our reputation. In addition, joint ventures bear the risk of difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products. Strategic alliances may also pose risks for us because we compete in some business areas with companies with which we have strategic alliances. Besides other measures, we handle these risks with standardized processes as well as dedicated roles and responsibilities in the areas of mergers, acquisitions, divestments and carveouts. This includes the systematic treatment of all contractual obligations and post-closing claims.",

        "page_content": "Increasing sustainability focus : Governments around the world continue to increase their focus on sustainability topics, resulting in the risk of increased costs to comply with new laws and related reporting requirements. In addition, increasing stakeholder and investor focus on sustainability topics brings reputational risk should our sustainability commitments, targets and activities be perceived as a deceptive use of green marketing or otherwise not credible. Climate change litigation has become a worldwide phenomenon with a corresponding risk to Siemens as a large corporation. We address these risks in a variety of ways including through our sustainability framework DEGREE, in which we have set ambitious sustainability targets. DEGREE includes measures to reduce our carbon footprint along with other initiatives addressing ESG topics more generally. We have implemented an ESG due diligence process that supports Siemens businesses with due diligence in the customer-oriented environment with a view to possible environmental and social risks as well as related human rights and reputational risks. Finally, we believe our overall portfolio is very well positioned to meet the current and future sustainability needs of our customers and the societies in which we operate.\n\nDisruptive technologies: The markets in which our businesses operate experience rapid and significant changes due to the introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies. In the field of digitalization (e.g. Digital Twin, artificial intelligence, cloud computing), there are risks associated with new competitors, substitutions for existing products/solutions/services, new business models (e.g. in terms of pricing, financing, extended scopes for project business or subscription models in the software business), and finally the risk that our competitors may have more advanced time-to-market strategies and introduce their disruptive products and solutions faster than Siemens. Siemens generally differentiates its software offerings from those of other software companies through deep domain know-how. There are risks associated with technologies such as artificial intelligence, including generative artificial intelligence, that domain expertise will not be a significant distinguishing feature in the future, and that additional competitors may therefore emerge more easily or rapidly. Our operating results depend to a significant extent on our technological leadership, our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in our markets, and our ability to optimize our cost base accordingly. Introducing new products and technologies requires a significant commitment to research and development, which in return requires expenditure of considerable financial resources that may not always result in success. Our results of operations may suffer if we invest in technologies that do not operate or may not be integrated as expected, or that are not accepted in the marketplace as anticipated, or if our products, solutions or systems are not introduced to the market in a timely manner, particularly  compared  to  our  competitors,  or  even  become  obsolete.  We  constantly  apply  for  new  patents  and  actively  manage  our intellectual property portfolio to secure our technological position. However, our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services that are similar to ours.\n\nCompetitive environment : The worldwide markets for our products, solutions and services are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing terms and shifts in market demands. We face strong, established competitors as well as rising competitors from emerging markets and new industries, which may have a better cost structure or offer a better customer solution. Some industries in which we operate are undergoing consolidation, which may result in stronger  competition,  a  change  in  our  relative  market  position,  an  increase  in  inventory  of  finished  or  work-in-progress  goods,  or unexpected price erosion. Furthermore, there is a risk that critical suppliers could be taken over by competitors and a risk that competitors are increasingly offering services to our installed base. We address these risks with various measures, for example benchmarking, strategic initiatives,  sales  push  initiatives,  executing  productivity  measures  and  target  cost  projects,  rightsizing  of  our  footprint,  outsourcings, mergers and joint ventures and optimizing our product and service portfolio. We continuously monitor and analyze competitive, market and industry information in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in the competitive environment rather than merely reacting to such changes.\n\n## 8.3.2 Operational risks\n\nCyber/Information security :  Digital technologies are deeply integrated into our business portfolio. Further integration of information technology  into  products  and  services  in  conjunction  with  changing  business  strategies  (such  as  outsourcing,  globally  distributed development, a lesser degree of sole production) are leading to an increasingly distributed supply chain, making efficient controls difficult. The fact of a large number of suppliers requires a significant effort for the initial and regular verification of the effective implementation of cybersecurity requirements by suppliers. Siemens business entities might lose market access if their products, solutions and services do not comply with increased regulations and legal requirements for cybersecurity in their respective countries. We observe a global increase of cybersecurity threats and higher levels of professionalism in computer crime, which pose a risk to the security of Siemens products, solutions and services; to Siemens IT systems and networks; and to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data. Like other large multinational companies, we face active cyber threats from sophisticated adversaries that are supported by organized crime and nationstates engaged in economic espionage or even sabotage. According to external sources of relevant data, this trend has been accelerated by geopolitical developments and tensions worldwide. Especially the numbers of phishing attacks and malicious websites have increased significantly. There is a risk that confidential information or data-privacy-relevant information may be stolen or that the integrity of our portfolio may be compromised, such as by attacks on our networks, social engineering, data manipulations in critical applications, or a loss of critical resources, resulting in financial damages and violation of data privacy laws. Moreover, the information technology market is concentrated among a small number of information technology and software vendors, which could lead to dependence on a single provider. There can be no assurance that the measures aimed at protecting our intellectual property and portfolio will address these threats under all circumstances. Cybersecurity covers the IT of our entire enterprise including office IT, systems and applications, special-purpose networks, and our operating environments such as manufacturing and R&D. We strive to mitigate these risks by employing a number of cyber defense measures, including employee training, considering new models of flexible working environments, and comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems with an artificial intelligence solution to identify attacks faster, and thereby prevent damage to society, critical infrastructures, our customers, our partners and Siemens overall. We initiated the industrial 'Charter of Trust,' signed by a growing group of global companies, which sets out principles for building trust in digital technologies and creating a more secure digital world. Nonetheless, our systems, products, solutions and services, as well as those of our service providers, remain potentially vulnerable to  attacks.  Such  attacks  could  potentially  lead  to  the  publication,  manipulation  or  leakage  of  information  such  as  through  industrial espionage. They could also result in deliberate improper use of our systems, vulnerable products, production downtimes and supply shortages, with potential adverse effects on our reputation, our competitiveness and results of operations. For increased protection of Siemens and reduction of a potential financial impact caused by cyber incidents, the currently insurable cybersecurity risks have been to a partial extent transferred to a consortium of insurance companies.",

        "page_content": "Supply chain management : The financial performance of our operating units depends on reliable and effective supply chain management for components, sub-assemblies, energy, critical parts (e.g. semiconductors) and materials. Capacity constraints and supply shortages resulting from ineffective supply chain management may lead to production bottlenecks, delivery delays, quality issues and additional costs. We also rely on third parties to supply us with parts, components and services. Using third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products may reduce our control over manufacturing yields, quality assurance, product delivery schedules and costs. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid supply-related problems, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter supply problems in  the  future,  especially  if  we  use  single-source  suppliers  for  critical  components.  Shortages  and  delays  could  materially  harm  our businesses. Unanticipated increases in the price of components or raw materials due to market shortages or other reasons could also adversely affect performance. Furthermore, we may be exposed to the risk of delays and interruptions in the supply chain as a consequence of catastrophic events (including pandemics), geopolitical uncertainties, energy shortages, sabotage, cyber incidents, suppliers' financial difficulties  or  suppliers  not  meeting our standards, particularly if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply or means of transportation in a timely manner or at all. Besides other measures, we mitigate price fluctuation in global raw material markets with various hedging instruments.\n\nInternal programs and initiatives : We are in a continuous process of operational optimization and constantly engage in cost-reduction initiatives,  including  ongoing  capacity  adjustment  measures  and  structural  initiatives.  Consolidation  of  business  activities  and manufacturing facilities, outsourcings, joint ventures and the streamlining of product portfolios are all part of these cost-reduction efforts. These measures may not be implemented as planned, may turn out to be less effective than anticipated, may become effective later than estimated or may not become effective at all. Any future contribution of these measures to our profitability will be influenced by the actual savings achieved and by our ability to sustain them. In case of restructuring and outsourcing activities, there could be delays in product deliveries or we might even experience delivery failures. Furthermore, delays in critical R&D projects could lead to negative impacts in running projects. We constantly control and monitor the progress of these projects and initiatives using standardized controlling and milestone tracking approaches.\n\nShortage of skilled personnel : Competition for diverse and highly qualified personnel, such as specialists and experts in technical fields, remains intense in the industries and regions in which our businesses operate. We have ongoing demand for highly skilled people and a need to enhance diversity, inclusion and sense of belonging in our workforce. Our future success depends in part on our continued ability to attract engineers, tech talent and other qualified personnel. We address these topics for example by strengthening the capabilities and skills of our talent acquisition teams and a strategy of proactive search for people with the required capabilities in our respective industries and markets. In fiscal 2023 we rolled out our new Employer Branding in all our recruiting marketing activities and started a media campaign with focus on tech talent in our key markets. Technology and digitalization help us to be more effective in attracting and selecting diverse talent. In addition, we have a focus on diversity and structured succession planning. As with our existing people, we must also provide new talent with opportunities to grow and bond, especially soon after they join us. This appears especially relevant at a time of new, increasingly virtual working environments.\n\nProject-related risks : A number of our segments conduct activities under long-term contracts that are awarded on a competitive bidding basis. Such contracts typically arise at Mobility and in various activities of Smart Infrastructure or Portfolio Companies. Some of these contracts are inherently risky because we may assume substantially all of the risks associated with completing a project and meeting postcompletion warranty obligations. For example, we may face the risk that we must satisfy technical requirements of a project even though we have not gained experience with those requirements before winning the project. The profit margins realized on fixed-priced contracts may vary from original estimates as a result of changes in costs and productivity over a contract's term. We sometimes bear the risk of unanticipated project modifications, shortage of key personnel, quality problems, financial difficulties of our customers and/or significant partners, cost overruns or contractual penalties caused by unexpected technological problems, unexpected developments at the project sites,  unforeseen  changes  or  difficulties  in  the  regulatory  or  political  environment,  performance  problems  with  our  suppliers, subcontractors  and  consortium  partners  or  other  logistical  difficulties.  Some  of  our  multi-year  contracts  also  contain  demanding installation and maintenance requirements in addition to other performance criteria relating to timing, unit cost and compliance with government regulations, which, if not satisfied, could subject us to substantial contractual penalties, damages, non-payment and contract termination. There can be no assurance that contracts and projects, in particular those with long-term duration and fixed-price calculation, can be completed profitably. To tackle those risks, we established a global project management organization to systematically improve the  technical  and  commercial  capabilities  of  our  project  management  personnel.  For  complex  projects  we  conduct  dedicated  risk assessments in very early stages of the sales phase before we decide to hand over a binding offer to our customers.\n\n## 8.3.3 Financial risks\n\nRisks from pension obligations : The provisions for pensions and similar obligations may be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate, as well as by movements in financial markets or a change in the mix of assets in our investment portfolio. Additionally, they are subject to legal risks with regard to plan design, among other factors. A significant increase in underfunding may have a negative effect on our capital structure and rating, and thus may tighten refinancing options and increase costs. In order to comply with local pension regulations in selected foreign countries, we may face an economic risk of increasing cash outflows due to changes in funding level according to local regulations of our pension plans in these countries or to changes in the regulations themselves.\n\nAudits by tax authorities and changes in tax regulations : We operate in nearly all countries of the world and therefore are subject to many different tax regulations. Changes in tax laws in any of these jurisdictions could result in higher tax expenses and increased tax payments. Furthermore, legislative changes could impact our tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the uncertain legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights. As a globally operating organization,  we  conduct  business  in  countries  subject  to  complex  tax  rules,  which  may  be  interpreted  in  different  ways.  Future interpretations or developments of tax regimes may affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations. We are regularly audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions and we continuously identify and assess relevant risks.\n\nMarket price risks : We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, especially between the U.S. dollar and the euro, because a high percentage of our business volume is conducted as exports from Europe to regions using the U.S. dollar. In addition, we are exposed to effects involving the currencies of emerging markets, in particular the Chinese yuan. Appreciable changes in euro exchange rates could materially change our competitive position. We are also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. Even hedging activities to mitigate such risks may result in a reverse effect. Fluctuations in exchange or interest rates, negative developments in the financial markets and changes",

        "page_content": "in central bank policies could therefore negatively impact our financial results. Market prices show higher volatility than in the past due to increased macroeconomic uncertainties resulting from inflation, geopolitical tensions and other factors noted above.\n\nLiquidity and financing risks : Our treasury and financing activities could face adverse deposit and/or financing conditions from negative developments related to financial markets, such as limited availability of funds and hedging instruments; an updated evaluation of our solvency, particularly from rating agencies; negative interest rates; and impacts arising from more restrictive regulation of the financial sector, central bank policy, or the usage of financial instruments. Widening credit spreads due to uncertainty and risk aversion in the financial  markets  might  lead  to  adverse  changes  in  the  market  values  of  our  financial  assets,  in  particular  our  derivative  financial instruments.\n\nCredit risks : We provide our customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing of orders and projects, including guarantees. Siemens Financial Services in particular bears credit risks due to such financing activities if, for example, customers do not meet obligations arising  from  these  financing  arrangements,  meet  them  only  partially,  or  meet  them  late.  The  credit  environment  has  become  more dynamic due to a more uncertain macroeconomic outlook (e.g. inflation) and geopolitical tensions.\n\nFor further information on post-employment benefits, derivative financial instruments, hedging activities, financial risk management and related measures, see Notes 17, 24 and 25 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2023.\n\n## 8.3.4 Compliance risks\n\nChanges of regulations, laws and policies: Regulatory requirements are being introduced or modified at an unprecedented rate, often with little or no advance implementation lead time. This creates a risk that new requirements become effective more quickly than they can be implemented in the associated systems and processes, potentially resulting in business disruptions and the need for manual mitigation  interventions.  As  a  diversified  company  with  global  businesses  we  are  exposed  to  various  product-  and  country-related regulations,  laws  and  policies  influencing  our  business  activities  and  processes.  According  to  observations  and  analysis,  there  is  an increasing risk that existing technical regulations in target markets will suddenly change, or new ones will be set in force, which result in market access criteria that our products do not meet. The affected products would lose marketability in this market. Reducing the risk of a sales-stop depends on the required correction for the non-conformity. In case the product can technically stay as is, while it has to undergo new and additional conformity assessment and certification, there will be considerable effort and cost to carry out the needed testing and certification procedures. In a worse case, the affected product will need re-engineering or re-design to meet the requirements of the changed or new technical regulation even before it can become re-assessed and certified for market approval. The latter case will cause significant extra effort and cost to make the needed product changes and to maintain the country-specific product variant as an additional derivative item in the portfolio. In the worst case, if the two aforementioned ways of maintaining the product's marketability prove to be not feasible, we must stop selling the affected product in the market. The uncertain geopolitical situation has triggered unpredictable and often conflicting  -  extraterritorial  regulations,  restrictions  and  sanctions,  thus  creating  a  potential  risk  that  it  will  be  difficult  to simultaneously comply with all relevant regulatory requirements of certain transactions. Complex cross-jurisdictional regulations can vary between countries, even within the same region, each with slightly different rules and requirements, creating a risk that a global standard cannot be effectively implemented and maintained, potentially leading to a need for more custom or regional standards. We monitor the political  and  regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas, with the aim of quickly adjusting our business activities and processes to changed conditions. However, any changes in regulations, laws and policies could adversely affect our business activities and processes as well as our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nCurrent  and  future  investigations  regarding  allegations  of  corruption,  of  antitrust  violations  and  of  other  violations  of  law : Proceedings against us or our business partners regarding allegations of corruption, of antitrust violations and of other violations of law may lead to fines as well as penalties, sanctions, injunctions against future conduct, profit disgorgements, disqualifications from directly and indirectly engaging in certain types of business, the loss of business licenses or permits, other restrictions and legal consequences as well as negative public media coverage. Accordingly, we may, among other things, be required to comply with potential obligations and liabilities arising in connection with such investigations and proceedings, including potential tax penalties. Moreover, any findings related to public corruption that are not covered by the 2008 and 2009 corruption charge settlements, which we concluded with U.S. and German authorities, may endanger our business with government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations. Monitors could again be appointed to review future business practices and we may otherwise be required to further modify our business practices and our compliance program.\n\nIn its global business, Siemens does part of its business with state-owned enterprises and governments. We also participate in projects funded  by  government  agencies  and  intergovernmental  and  supranational  organizations,  such  as  multilateral  development  banks. Ongoing or potential future investigations into allegations of corruption, antitrust violations or other violations of law could as well impair relationships with such parties or could result in our exclusion from public contracts. Such investigations may also adversely affect existing private business relationships and our ability to pursue potentially important strategic projects and transactions, such as strategic alliances, joint ventures or other business alliances, or could result in the cancellation of certain of our existing contracts. Moreover, third parties, including our competitors, could initiate significant litigation.\n\nIn addition, future developments in ongoing and potential future investigations, such as responding to the requests of governmental authorities  and  cooperating  with  them,  could  divert  management's  attention  and  resources  from  other  issues  facing  our  business. Furthermore, we might be exposed to compliance risks in connection with recently acquired operations that are in the ongoing process of integration.\n\nAlong with other measures, Siemens has established a global compliance organization that conducts compliance risk mitigation processes such as Compliance Risk Assessments, among others, or initiates audit activities performed by the internal assurance department.\n\nSanctions and export control : As a globally operating organization, we conduct business with customers in countries which are subject to export control regulations, embargoes, economic sanctions, debarment policies or other forms of trade restrictions (hereafter referred to as 'sanctions') imposed by the U.S., the EU, China or other countries or organizations. New or expanded sanctions in countries in which we do business may result in a curtailment of our existing business in such countries or indirectly in other countries. We are also aware of policies of national authorities and institutional investors, such as pension funds or insurance companies, requiring divestment of interests in and prohibiting investment in and transactions with entities doing business with countries identified by the U.S. Department of State as",

        "page_content": "state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, it is possible that such policies may result in our inability to gain or retain certain investors or customers. In addition, the termination of our activities in sanctioned countries may expose us to customer claims and other actions. Our reputation could also suffer due to our activities with counterparties in or affiliated with these countries or due to unauthorized diversion of our products to restricted parties or destinations. Siemens addresses these risks by maintaining a comprehensive and robust control program.\n\nProtectionism  (including  tariffs/trade  war) :  Protectionist  trade  policies,  de-coupling  and  changes  in  the  political  and  regulatory environment in the markets in which we operate, such as import and export controls, tariffs and other trade barriers including debarment from certain markets, inbound and outbound investment screenings, and price or exchange controls, could affect our business in national markets and could impact our business situation, financial position and results of operations; we may also be exposed to penalties, other sanctions and reputational damage. In addition, the uncertainty of the legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights and subject us to increasing costs related to adjusting our compliance programs.\n\nEnvironmental, health & safety and other governmental regulations : Some of the industries in which we operate are highly regulated. Current and future environmental, health, safety and other governmental regulations or changes thereto may require us to change the way we run our operations and could result in significant increases in our operating or production costs. Furthermore, we see the risk of potential environmental, health or safety incidents as well as potential non-compliance with environmental, health or safety regulations affecting Siemens and our contractors or sub-suppliers, resulting for example in serious injuries, business interruptions, penalties, loss of reputation and internal or external investigations.\n\nIn addition, while we have procedures in place to ensure compliance with applicable governmental regulations in the conduct of our business operations, it cannot be excluded that violations of applicable governmental regulations may be caused either by us or by third parties  that  we  contract  with,  including  suppliers  or  service  providers  whose  activities  may  be  attributed  to  us.  Any  such  violations particularly expose us to the risk of liability, penalties, fines, reputational damage or loss of licenses or permits that are important to our business operations. In particular, we could also face liability for damage or remediation for environmental contamination at the facilities we design or operate. With regard to certain environmental risks, we maintain liability insurance at levels that our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. We may incur environmental losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance, and such losses may have an adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nCurrent or future litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings : Siemens is and potentially will be involved in numerous legal disputes and proceedings in various jurisdictions. These legal disputes and proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. Asserted claims are generally subject  to  interest  rates.  Some  of  these  legal  disputes  and  proceedings  could  result  in  adverse  decisions  for  Siemens;  or  decisions, assessments or requirements of regulatory authorities could deviate from our expectations, which may have material effects on our business activities as well as our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Siemens maintains liability insurance for certain legal risks at levels our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. However, the insurance policy does not  protect  Siemens  against,  in  particular,  reputational  damage.  Moreover,  Siemens  may  incur  losses  relating  to  legal  disputes  and proceedings beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance or exceeding any provisions made for losses related to legal disputes and proceedings. Finally, there can be no assurance that Siemens will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the future.\n\nFor additional information with respect to specific proceedings, see Note 22 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2023.\n\n## 8.3.5 Assessment of the overall risk situation\n\nThe  most  significant  challenges  have  been  mentioned  first  in  each  of  the  four  risk  categories:  strategic,  operational,  financial  and compliance.\n\nWhile our assessments of individual risks have changed during fiscal 2023 due to developments in the external environment, changes in our business portfolio, effects of our own mitigation measures and the revision of our risk assessment, the overall risk situation for Siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year. We currently see the strategic risk economic, political and geopolitical conditions as the most significant challenge for us followed by the operational risk cyber/information security.\n\nAt present, no risks have been identified that either individually or in combination could endanger our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## 8.4 Opportunities\n\nWithin our ERM we regularly identify, evaluate and respond to opportunities that present themselves in our various fields of activity. Below we describe our most significant opportunities. Unless otherwise stated, the opportunities described relate to all organizational units. The order  in  which  the  opportunities  are  presented  reflects  the  currently  estimated  relative  exposure  for  Siemens  associated  with  these opportunities  and  thus  provides  an  indication  of  the  opportunities'  current  importance  to  us.  The  described  opportunities  are  not necessarily the only ones we encounter. In addition, our assessment of opportunities is subject to change because the Company, our markets and technologies are constantly advancing. It is also possible that opportunities we see today will never materialize.\n\nFavorable political and regulatory environment including sustainability : A favorable political and regulatory environment including the transition towards a low-carbon economy could restore a more positive industrial investment sentiment that supports the growth of our markets. In addition, government initiatives and subsidies (including tax reforms, green and digital recovery plans, R&D among others) lead to more government spending (e.g. infrastructure, healthcare, mobility or digitalization investments) and may ultimately result in an opportunity for us to participate in ways that increase our revenue and profit. Investments to strengthen countries' resilience, energy and food security, as well as to diversify value chains close to major markets (reshoring, nearshoring) can present opportunities to businesses. By enabling our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using our portfolio and by reducing CO2 emission in our own operations,  Siemens  strives  to  support  the  transition  towards  a  low-carbon  economy.  Siemens  also  welcomes  and  supports  recent",

        "page_content": "legislative and governmental measures to accelerate the mitigation of climate change, especially in Europe such as through the Green Deal or sustainable finance initiatives.\n\nValue creation through innovation : We drive innovation by investing significantly in R&D in order to develop sustainable solutions for our  customers  while  also  strengthening  our  own  competitiveness.  Being  an  innovative  company  and  constantly  inventing  new technologies that we expect will meet future demands arising from the megatrends of demographic change, urbanization, digitalization, environmental change, resource scarcity and glocalization is one of our core purposes. We are granted thousands of new patents every year and continuously develop new concepts and convincing new digital and data-driven business models. This helps us create the next generation of ground-breaking innovations in such fields as digital twin, artificial intelligence, automation and edge computing. Across our operating units, we are profiting from our strength in connecting the real and digital worlds. Our Xcelerator platform is an open, digital business platform featuring a curated portfolio of IoT-enabled hardware and software, an ecosystem and a marketplace to enhance the digital transformation of our customers. We see growth opportunities in opening up access to new markets and customers through new marketing and sales strategies, which we implement in our operating units. Our position along the value chains of automation and digitalization allows us to further increase market penetration. Along these value chains, we have identified several clear growth fields in which we see our greatest long-term potential. Hence, we are combining and developing our resources and capabilities for these growth fields.\n\nLeveraging  Market  Potential: Through  sales  and  services  initiatives  we  continuously  strive  to  grow  and  extend  our  businesses  in established markets, open up new markets for existing portfolio elements and strengthen our installed base in order to gain a higher market share and increased profits. Furthermore, we aim to increase our sales via improved account management and new distribution channels.\n\nOptimization of organization and processes : On the one hand, we leverage ideas to drive further improvements in our processes and cost  structure,  such  as  common  computing  architecture  for  image  processing.  Furthermore,  we  leverage  ideas  to  drive  further improvements in our processes and cost structure optimizing factory capacities for shorter lead times. On the other hand, we see an opportunity of further penetrating markets by quality initiative program and avoiding or reducing non conformance cost.\n\nMergers, acquisitions, equity investments, partnerships, divestments and streamlining our portfolio :  We constantly monitor our current and potential markets to identify opportunities for strategic mergers, acquisitions, equity investments and partnerships, which may complement our organic growth. Such activities may help us to strengthen our position in our existing markets, provide access to new or underserved markets, or complement our technological portfolio in strategic areas. Opportunities might also arise when portfolio optimization measures generate gains, which enable us to further pursue our other strategies for growth and profitability.\n\nAssessment of the overall opportunities situation : The most significant opportunity for Siemens is favorable political and regulatory environment (including sustainability) as described above.\n\nWhile our assessments of individual opportunities have changed during fiscal 2023 due to developments in the external environment, changes in our business portfolio, our endeavors to profit from them and revision of our strategic plans, the overall opportunity situation for Siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year.\n\n## 8.5 Significant characteristics of the internal control and risk management system\n\n## 8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM\n\nOur ICS and ERM are based on the principles, guidelines and measures introduced by the Managing Board, which are aimed at the organizational implementation of the Managing Board's decisions. Our ICS and ERM include the management of risks and opportunities relating to the achievement of business goals, the correctness and reliability of internal and external accounting, and compliance with the laws  and  regulations  relevant  to  Siemens.  Sustainability  aspects  are  covered  as  well  and  are  continuously  developed  based  on  the regulatory requirements.\n\nOur  ICS  and  ERM  are  based  on  the  globally  accepted  COSO  framework  (Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway Commission).  Our  ERM  approach  is  based  on  the  COSO  Standard  'Enterprise  Risk  Management  -  Integrating  with  Strategy  and Performance' (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. Our ICS is based on the internationally recognized 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework' (2013) also developed by COSO. The framework defines the elements of a control system and sets the standard for assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our ICS, both systems are complementary.\n\nAll Siemens entities are part of our ICS and ERM. The scope of activities to be performed by each entity is different, depending, among others, on the entity's impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens and the specific risks associated with the entity. The management of each entity is obliged to implement an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within their area of responsibility, based on the group-wide mandatory methodology.\n\nOverall responsibility for our ICS and ERM lies with the Managing Board. The Siemens Risk and Internal Control (RIC) organization bundles and integrates the internal control and ERM processes and supports the Managing Board in designing and maintaining adequate and effective  processes  for  implementing,  monitoring  and  reporting  on  internal  control  and  ERM  activities.  It  consists  of  the  central  RIC departments  of  Siemens  AG  and  the  RIC  departments  at  our  organizational  units.  The  central  RIC  departments  are  responsible  for monitoring and coordinating the entire processes in order to ensure an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within the Group.\n\nWe have an overarching, integrated ICS and ERM methodology (RIC methodology) with a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined, documented in accordance with uniform standards, and tested regularly for their adequacy and effectiveness. For more information on ERM, see chapter 8.2 Risk management.\n\nOur ICS and ERM and their contributing elements are regularly subject of audit activities by our internal audit function. These are carried out either as part of the risk-based annual audit plan or as part of audits scheduled during the year upon request. Siemens Healthineers has its own internal audit function and annual audit plan. Topics from the annual audit plan of Siemens Healthineers that are also relevant for our Managing Board and Audit Committee must be mandated first by Siemens Healthineers' Managing Board and Audit Committee",

        "page_content": "and subsequently by our Managing Board and Audit Committee. The audit procedures for these topics will be - where reasonable executed by joint teams including members of our and Siemens Healthineers' internal audit functions, thus respecting the interests of both Siemens AG and Siemens Healthineers.\n\nAt the end of each fiscal year, our Managing Board performs an evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS and ERM. This evaluation is based primarily on the Siemens 'In Control'-Statement and quarterly Managing Board meetings. The purpose of the \"In Control\"-Statement is to provide an overview of the key elements of the ICS and ERM of Siemens AG and its affiliated companies at the end of the fiscal year, to summarize the activities undertaken to review its adequacy and effectiveness and highlight any critical control weaknesses identified as part of these activities. The information contained in this statement is provided to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG to report on the effectiveness of the ICS and ERM. The Siemens 'In Control'-Statement is supported by certifications at various corporate levels and by all affiliated companies. In the quarterly Managing Board meetings, the company-wide risk and opportunity situation is evaluated, the results of the internal control process are explained and once a year an overall conclusion is made about the adequacy and effectiveness of our ICS or ERM. Based on this, the Managing Board has no indication that our ICS or ERM in their respective wholes have not been adequate or effective as of September 30, 2023.\n\nNevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any risk management and control system. For example, no system even if deemed to be adequate and effective - can guarantee that all risks that will actually occur will be identified in advance or that any process violations will be ruled out under all circumstances.\n\nThe Audit Committee is systematically integrated into our ICS and ERM. In particular, it oversees the accounting and the accounting process as well as the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS, ERM and the internal audit system.\n\nSiemens Healthineers is largely subject to the Group-wide principles for our ICS and ERM and is responsible for adhering to those principles.\n\nThe integration of Varian into our ICS, which began in fiscal 2021 after the acquisition by Siemens Healthineers, continued in fiscal 2023 and was completed to a very large extent with regard to all Varian entities. The integration measures are planned to be completely finalized in fiscal 2024.\n\n## 8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)\n\nOur ICS and ERM also comprise a CMS aligned to the Company's risk situation which is based on the three pillars - prevent, detect and react. It includes the legal risk areas of corruption, antitrust law, data protection, money laundering, export controls as well as human rights and is based on an extensive internal set of rules: The Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines (BCG) define the basic principles and standards of behavior that must be observed by all employees in the company units and in relation to customers, external partners and the  public.  In  addition,  there  are  extensive  internal  compliance  regulations,  including  associated  controls,  which  oblige  all  Siemens employees to ensure the implementation of the CMS. They contain topic-specific implementation regulations for the individual risk areas with regard to compliance processes and tools as well as additional guidelines and information. The compliance operating model contains binding specifications for the employees of the compliance organization and describes responsibilities and how the CMS works.\n\nCompliance risk management and compliance reviews as part of the CMS aim to identify compliance risks at an early stage and thus enable to take appropriate and effective measures to avoid or minimize risks. The risk assessment is also integrated into individual business processes and tools. The results of CMS that are relevant to the Group are taken into account as part of the Company-wide ERM.\n\nThe Compliance Control Program aims to ensure compliance with and implementation of the CMS and processes used worldwide. It is part of the ICS and is continuously further developed and adapted to the current Siemens guidelines. In addition, current compliance issues are discussed at the management level on a regular basis.\n\nThe entire CMS is continuously adapted to business-specific risks and various local legal requirements. The findings from compliance risk management as well as compliance controls and audits are used to derive measures for its further development.\n\n## 8.5.3 Significant characteristics of the accounting-related ICS and ERM\n\nThe overarching objective of our accounting-related ICS and ERM - as part of the overarching ICS and ERM - is to ensure that financial reporting is conducted in a proper manner, such that the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report of the Siemens Group and the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG as the parent company are prepared in accordance with all relevant regulations.\n\nOur ICS and ERM are based on the globally recognized COSO framework, for further information see 8.5.1.\n\nAt the end of each fiscal year, our management performs an evaluation of the effectiveness of the accounting-related ICS. We have a standardized  procedure  under  which  necessary  controls  are  defined,  documented  in  accordance  with  uniform  standards,  and  tested regularly for their effectiveness. Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any control system, and no system, including one determined to be effective, may prevent or detect all misstatements.\n\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements according to IFRS are prepared on the basis of a centrally issued conceptual framework which primarily consists of uniform Financial Reporting Guidelines and a chart of accounts. For Siemens AG and other companies within the Siemens Group required to prepare financial statements in accordance with German Commercial Code, this conceptual framework is complemented by mandatory regulations specific to the German Commercial Code. The need for adjustments in the conceptual framework due to regulatory changes is analyzed on an ongoing basis. Accounting departments are informed quarterly about current topics and deadlines from an accounting and closing process perspective.\n\nThe base data used in preparing our financial statements consists of the closing data reported by the operations of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries.  The  preparation  of  the  closing  data  of  most  of  our  entities  is  supported  by  an  internal  shared  services  organization. Furthermore,  other  accounting  activities,  such  as  governance  and  monitoring  activities,  are  usually  bundled  on  a  regional  level.  In particular cases, such as valuations relating to post-employment benefits, we use external experts. The reported closing data is used to prepare the financial statements in the consolidation system. The steps necessary to prepare the financial statements are subject to both manual and automated controls.",

As a fundamental principle, based on materiality considerations, the 'four eyes' principle applies, and specific procedures must be adhered to for data authorization. Additional control mechanisms include target-performance comparisons and analyses of the composition of and changes in individual line items, both in the closing data submitted by reporting units and in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In line  with  our  information  security  requirements,  accounting-related  IT  systems  contain  defined  access  rules  protecting  them  from unauthorized access. The manual and system-based control mechanisms referred to above generally also apply when reconciling the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) closing data to the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, we execute an internal certification process. Management at different levels of our organization, supported by confirmations by managements of entities under their responsibility, confirms the accuracy of the financial data that has been reported to Siemens' corporate headquarters and reports on the effectiveness of the related control systems.\n\nSiemens Healthineers is subject to our Group-wide principles for the accounting-related internal control and risk management system and is responsible for adhering to those principles.\n\nThe integration of Varian into our accounting-related ICS, which began in fiscal 2021 after the acquisition by Siemens Healthineers, continued in fiscal 2023 and was completed to a very large extent with regard to all Varian entities. The integration measures are planned to be completely finalized in fiscal 2024.\n\nOur  internal  audit  function  systematically  reviews  our  financial  reporting  integrity,  our  accounting-related  ICS  and  ERM.  Siemens Healthineers has its own internal audit department and annual audit plan (see also 8.5.1). The Audit Committee is integrated into our accounting-related  ICS.  In  particular,  it  oversees  the  accounting  and  accounting  process  and  the  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of  the associated ICS, the ERM and the internal audit system.

Siemens AG\n\nThe  Annual  Financial  Statements  of  Siemens  AG  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  regulations  set  forth  in  the  German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) and the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz).\n\nIn  fiscal  2023,  results  for  Siemens  AG  arise  mainly  from  the  business  activities  of  Digital  Industries  and  Smart  Infrastructure  and  are influenced  significantly  by  the  results  of  subsidiaries  and  investments  Siemens  AG  owns  either  directly  or  indirectly.  The  business development of Siemens AG is fundamentally subject to the same risks and opportunities as the Siemens Group. Therefore, the foregoing explanations for the Siemens Group apply also for Siemens AG.\n\nThe Supervisory Board and the Managing Board propose to distribute a dividend of \u20ac4.70 per share of no par value entitled to the dividend, from the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 amounting to \u20ac3.8 billion. The proposed dividend represents a total payout of \u20ac3.7 billion based on the estimated number of shares entitled to dividend at the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. We intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders. This includes striving for a dividend per share that exceeds the amount for the preceding year, or at least matches it. For fiscal 2024, we expect that net income of Siemens AG will be sufficient to fund the distribution of a commensurate dividend.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the number of employees was around 47.300.\n\n## 9.1 Results of operations\n\nStatement of Income of Siemens AG in accordance with German Commercial Code (condensed)\n\n|                                                     | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                  | 2023          | 2022          |            |\n| Revenue                                             | 19,660        | 17,390        | 13%        |\n| Cost of sales                                       | (13,671)      | (12,502)      | (9)%       |\n| Gross profit                                        | 5,989         | 4,888         | 23%        |\n| as percentage of revenue                            | 30%           | 28%           |            |\n| Research and development expenses                   | (2,084)       | (1,785)       | (17)%      |\n| Selling and general administrative expenses         | (3,701)       | (3,283)       | (13)%      |\n| Other operating income (expenses), net              | (53)          | (306)         | 83%        |\n| Income (loss) from investments, net                 | 4,734         | 4,204         | 13%        |\n| Interest and other financial income (expenses), net | (128)         | (605)         | 79%        |\n| Income from business activity                       | 4,758         | 3,115         | 53%        |\n| Income taxes                                        | (298)         | 498           | n/a        |\n| Net income                                          | 4,460         | 3,612         | 23%        |\n| Profit carried forward                              | 250           | 185           | 35%        |\n| Allocation to other retained earnings               | (950)         | (185)         | >-200%     |\n| Unappropriated net income                           | 3,760         | 3,613         | 4%         |\n\nOn a geographical basis, 75% of revenue was generated in the Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East region, 17% in the Asia, Australia region and 8% in the Americas region. Exports from Germany accounted for 57% of overall revenue. In fiscal 2023, orders for Siemens AG amounted to \u20ac16.1 billion.\n\nThe increases in revenue, cost of sales and research and development expenses were most evident at Digital Industries.\n\nThe R&D intensity (R&D costs as a percentage of revenue) was 10.6%, slightly above the level in fiscal 2022. The R&D activities of Siemens AG are fundamentally the same as for its corresponding business activities within the Siemens Group. R&D expenses in both periods related mainly to Digital Industries. On an average basis, Siemens AG employed 7,100 people in R&D in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe increase in selling and general administrative expenses was due mainly to higher selling expenses led by Digital Industries.\n\nOther operating income (expenses), net ,  included mainly a loss of \u20ac0.2 billion from a disposal in connection with the carve-out of business activities into the Innomotics GmbH, partly offset by \u20ac0.1 billion income from an intragroup service contract. Fiscal 2022 included mainly expenses of \u20ac0.2 billion from the intragroup service contract and expenses of \u20ac0.1 billion for the recognition of a provision related to guarantees and expected obligations from consortium contracts.\n\nIncome (loss) from investments, net included mainly income from investments of \u20ac2.9 billion (fiscal 2022: \u20ac4.8 billion) and income from profit transfer agreements with affiliated companies of \u20ac1.6 billion (fiscal 2022: \u20ac3.5 billion). Additionally, in fiscal 2023 Siemens AG recorded a gain of \u20ac0.2 billion from the sale of a part of its stake in Siemens Energy AG and a gain of \u20ac0.2 billion from the reversal of an impairment on the remaining stake in Siemens Energy AG. The remaining stake held directly by Siemens AG amounted to 21.0% as of September 30, 2023. These gains were partly offset by a loss of \u20ac0.2 billion from an impairment on a stake in Thoughtworks Holding Inc. For comparison, in fiscal 2022 Siemens AG recorded losses of \u20ac4.0 billion from impairment of investments, which included an impairment of \u20ac2.9 billion on Siemens AG's stake in Siemens Energy AG, Germany.\n\nInterest and other financial income (expenses), net included a negative interest result of \u20ac0.6 billion compared to a positive interest result of \u20ac0.4 billion a year earlier, which was driven by the effect of higher interest rates on intragroup-financing activities. Fiscal 2022 included impacts of \u20ac0.6 billion in connection with allowances on receivables from affiliated companies related to business activities in Russia, expenses from the recognition of provisions for risks relating to derivative financial instruments of \u20ac0.4 billion and a higher negative interest component of \u20ac0.3 billion from changes in pension and personnel-related provisions.",

The liquidity management is based on the financing policy of the Siemens Group, which is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion. Intragroup  financing  activities  drove  both  a  decrease  of  \u20ac4.5  billion  in  receivables  from  affiliated  companies,  which  resulted  in  lower inventories, receivables and other assets, and a decrease of \u20ac4.5 billion in liabilities to affiliated companies, which was the main reason for the decrease of trade payables, liabilities to affiliated companies and other liabilities.\n\nThe increase in equity was due to net income for the year of \u20ac4.5 billion and the transfer of \u20ac0.6 billion in treasury shares to employees in connection with our share-based payment programs. These factors were partly offset by dividends paid in fiscal 2023 (for fiscal 2022) of \u20ac3.4 billion and share buybacks during the year amounting to \u20ac0.9 billion. The equity ratio as of September 30, 2023 increased to 21%, from 19% a fiscal year earlier. For the disclosures in accordance with Section 160 para. 1 no. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act about treasury shares, refer to Note 15 of our Notes to Annual Financial Statements for fiscal 2023.\n\n## 9.3 Corporate Governance statement\n\nThe Corporate Governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code is publicly available on the company's website at siemens.com/corporate-governance.",

        "page_content": "## 10. Takeover-relevant information (pursuant to Sections 289a and 315a of the German Commercial Code) and explanatory report\n\n## 10.1 Composition of common stock\n\nFollowing  the  cancellation  of  50  million  registered  shares  of  no  par  value  of  the  Company  (Siemens  shares)  in  February  2023,  the Company's capital stock amounts to \u20ac2.400 billion (as of September 30, 2023), divided into 800 million Siemens shares. The shares are fully paid in. All shares confer the same rights and obligations. The shareholders' rights and obligations are governed in detail by the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, in particular by Sections 12, 53a et seq., 118 et seq. and 186 of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\n## 10.2 Restrictions on voting rights or transfer of shares\n\nAt the Shareholders' Meeting, each share of stock has one vote and accounts for the shareholder's proportionate share in the Company's net income. An exception to this rule applies with regard to treasury shares held by the Company, which do not entitle the Company to any rights. Under Section 136 of the German Stock Corporation Act the voting right of the affected shares is excluded by law.\n\nSiemens shares issued to employees worldwide under the Siemens share programs implemented since the beginning of fiscal 2009, in particular the Share Matching Plan, are freely transferable unless applicable local laws indicate otherwise. Under the rules of the Share Matching Plan, however, in order to receive one matching share free of charge for each three shares purchased, participants are required to hold the shares purchased by them for a vesting period of several years, during which the participants must be continuously employed by Siemens AG or any of its affiliated companies. The right to receive matching shares is forfeited if the purchased shares are sold, transferred, hedged on, pledged or hypothecated in any way during the relevant vesting period.\n\nThe von Siemens-Verm\u00f6gensverwaltung GmbH (vSV) has, on a sustained basis, powers of attorney allowing it to exercise the voting rights for 10,059,581 Siemens shares (as of September 30, 2023) on behalf of members of the Siemens family. These shares are part of the total number of shares held by the family's members. The powers of attorney are based on an agreement between the vSV and, among others, members of the Siemens family. The shares are voted together by vSV, taking into account the suggestions of a family partnership established by the family's members or of one of this partnership's governing bodies.\n\n## 10.3 Legislation and provisions of the Articles of Association applicable to the appointment and removal of members of the Managing Board and governing amendment to the Articles of Association\n\nThe appointment and removal of members of the Managing Board are subject to the provisions of Sections 84 and 85 of the German Stock Corporation Act and Section 31 of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz). According to Section 8 para. 1 of the Articles of Association, the Managing Board is comprised of several members, the number of which is determined by the Supervisory Board.\n\nAccording to Section 179 of the German Stock Corporation Act, any amendment to the Articles of Association requires a resolution of the Shareholders' Meeting. The authority to adopt purely formal amendments to the Articles of Association was transferred to the Supervisory Board under Section 13 para. 2 of the Articles of Association. In addition, by resolutions adopted during past Shareholders' Meetings, the Supervisory  Board  has  been  authorized  to  amend  Section  4  of  the  Articles  of  Association  in  accordance  with  the  utilization  of  the Authorized and Conditional Capitals, and after expiration of the then-applicable authorization and utilization period.\n\nResolutions of the Shareholders' Meeting require a simple majority vote, unless a greater majority is required by law (Section 23 para. 2 of the  Articles  of  Association).  Pursuant  to  Section  179  para.  2  of  the  German  Stock  Corporation  Act,  amendments  to  the  Articles  of Association require a majority of at least three-quarters of the capital stock represented at the time of the casting of the votes, unless another capital majority is prescribed by the Articles of Association.\n\n## 10.4 Powers of the Managing Board to issue and repurchase shares\n\nThe Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until February 2, 2026 by up to  \u20ac90  million  through  the  issuance  of  up  to  30  million  Siemens  shares  against  contributions  in  cash  (Authorized  Capital  2021). Subscription rights of existing shareholders are excluded. The new shares shall be offered exclusively to employees of the Company and any of its affiliated companies. To the extent permitted by law, such employee shares may also be issued in such a manner that the contribution to be paid on such shares is covered by that part of the annual net income which the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board may allocate to other retained earnings under Section 58 para. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\nFurthermore, the Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until January 29, 2024 by up to \u20ac510 million through the issuance of up to 170 million  Siemens  shares  against  contributions  in  cash  and/or  in  kind (Authorized Capital 2019).\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the total unissued authorized capital of Siemens AG therefore consisted of \u20ac600 million nominal that may be used, in installments with varying terms, by issuing up to 200 million Siemens shares.\n\nBy resolutions of the Shareholders' Meetings on January 30, 2019 and February 5, 2020, the Managing Board is authorized to issue bonds with conversion, exchange or option rights or conversion obligations, or a combination of these instruments, entitling the holders/creditors to subscribe to up to 80 million and up to 60 million Siemens shares, respectively. Based on these two authorizations, the Company or its affiliated companies may issue such convertible bonds and/or warrant bonds until January 29, 2024 and February 4, 2025, respectively, each in an aggregate principal amount of up to \u20ac15 billion. In order to grant shares of stock to holders/creditors of such convertible bonds",

They are, as a matter of principle, to be offered to shareholders for subscription. The Managing Board is authorized to exclude, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, subscription rights of shareholders in the event of capital increases against contributions in kind. In the event of capital increases against contributions in cash, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude shareholders' subscription rights with the approval of the Supervisory Board in the following cases:\n\n- \u00b7 The issue price of the new shares/bonds is not significantly lower than the stock market price of Siemens shares already listed or the theoretical market price of the bonds computed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial methods (exclusion of subscription rights, limited to 10% of the capital stock, in accordance with or by mutatis mutandis application of Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 German Stock Corporation Act).\n- \u00b7 The exclusion is necessary with regard to fractional amounts resulting from the subscription ratio.\n- \u00b7 The  exclusion  is  used  to  provide  subscription  rights  as  dilution  compensation  for  holders/creditors  of  conversion  or  option  rights/ obligations on Siemens shares.\n\nThe new shares issued or to be issued against contributions in cash or in kind, and with shareholders' subscription rights excluded, may in certain cases be subject to further restrictions. The details of those restrictions are described in the respective authorizations. In addition, the Managing Board has declared, by way of a voluntary commitment, not to increase the capital stock from the Authorized Capital 2019 and the Conditional Capitals 2019 and 2020 by a total of more than 10% of the capital stock existing at the time of the Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020, to the extent that capital increases with shareholders' subscription rights excluded are made from the Authorized Capital 2019 against contributions in cash or in kind or to service convertible bonds and/or warrant bonds issued under the authorizations  approved  on  January  30,  2019  or  February  5,  2020  with  shareholders'  subscription  rights  excluded.  This  voluntary commitment ends no later than February 4, 2025.\n\nThe Company may not repurchase Siemens shares unless so authorized by a resolution duly adopted by the shareholders at a general meeting or in other very limited circumstances set forth in the German Stock Corporation Act. On February 5, 2020, the Shareholders' Meeting authorized the Company to acquire until February 4, 2025 up to 10% of its capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution or - if the value is lower - as of the date on which the authorization is exercised. The aggregate of shares of stock of Siemens AG repurchased under this authorization and any other Siemens shares previously acquired and still held in treasury by the Company or attributable to the Company pursuant to Sections 71d and 71e of the German Stock Corporation Act may at no time exceed 10% of the then existing capital stock. Any repurchase of Siemens shares shall be accomplished at the discretion of the Managing Board either (1) by acquisition over the stock exchange, (2) through a public share repurchase offer or (3) through a public offer to swap Siemens shares for shares in a listed company within the meaning of Section 3 para. 2 German Stock Corporation Act. The Managing Board is additionally authorized to complete the repurchase of Siemens shares in accordance with the authorization described above by using certain derivatives (put and call options, forward purchases and any combination of these derivatives). In exercising this authorization, all stock repurchases based on the derivatives are limited to a maximum volume of 5% of Siemens' capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution at the Shareholders' Meeting. A derivative's term of maturity may not, in any case, exceed 18 months and must be chosen in such a way that the repurchase of Siemens shares upon exercise of the derivative will take place no later than February 4, 2025.\n\nIn addition to selling over the stock exchange or through a public sales offer to all shareholders, the Managing Board is authorized by resolution of the Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020 to also use Siemens shares repurchased on the basis of this or any previously given authorization for every permissible purpose. In particular such shares may be:\n\n- \u00b7 retired;\n- \u00b7 used in connection with share-based compensation programs and/or employee share programs of the Company or any of its affiliated companies and issued to individuals currently or formerly employed by the Company or any of its affiliated companies as well as to board members of any of the Company's affiliated companies;\n- \u00b7 offered and transferred, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to third parties against non-cash contributions;\n- \u00b7 sold by the Managing Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, against payment in cash if the price at which such Siemens shares are sold is not significantly lower than the market price of Siemens stock (exclusion of subscription rights, limited to 10% of the capital stock, by mutatis mutandis application of Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 German Stock Corporation Act); or\n- \u00b7 used to service or secure obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares arising particularly from or in connection with convertible bonds or warrant bonds of the Company or its affiliated companies. Moreover, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude subscription rights in  order  to  provide  subscription  rights  as  dilution  compensation  for  holders/creditors  of  conversion  or  option  rights/obligations  on Siemens shares, and to use Siemens shares to service such subscription rights.\n\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board is authorized to use shares acquired on the basis of this or any previously given authorization to meet obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares that were or will be agreed with members of the Managing Board within the framework of rules governing Managing Board compensation.\n\nOn June 24, 2021, the Company announced that it would launch a new five-year share buyback program, beginning in fiscal 2022. This buyback, which began on November 15, 2021 and extends at the latest until September 15, 2026, is limited to a maximum value of \u20ac3 billion (excluding incidental transaction charges) on purchases of no more than 50 million Siemens shares. Using the authorization given by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020, Siemens repurchased 21.0 million shares by September 30, 2023 under this share  buyback.  This  buyback  has  the  exclusive  purposes  of  retirement,  of  issuing  shares  to  employees,  board  members  of  affiliated companies and members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, and of servicing/securing the obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares arising particularly from or in connection with convertible bonds and warrant bonds.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company held 10,079,918 shares of stock in treasury.",

        "page_content": "For  details  on  the  authorizations  referred  to  above,  especially  the  terms  to  exclude  subscription  rights,  please  refer  to  the  relevant resolution and to Section 4 of the Articles of Association.\n\n## 10.5 Significant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, Siemens AG maintained lines of credit in the amount of \u20ac7.45 billion.\n\nIn January 2023, Siemens AG entered into a bilateral loan agreement in the amount of US$250 million and in December 2022, Siemens AG entered into a bilateral loan agreement in the amount of PLN500 million; both loan agreements have been fully drawn.\n\nIn December 2021, a consolidated subsidiary as borrower and Siemens AG as guarantor entered into a bilateral loan agreement in the amount of \u20ac500 million, which has been fully drawn. In addition, in March 2020 and in June 2019 respectively, a consolidated subsidiary as borrower and Siemens AG as guarantor entered into a bilateral loan agreement, each of which has been drawn in the full amount of US$500 million.\n\nThe lines of credit, and the relevant loan agreements mentioned above provide their respective lenders with a right of termination in the event that (1) Siemens AG becomes a subsidiary of another company or (2) a person or a group of persons acting in concert acquires effective control over Siemens AG by being able to exercise decisive influence over its activities (Art. 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) 139/2004).\n\nFramework  agreements  concluded  by  Siemens  AG  under  International  Swaps  and  Derivatives  Association  Inc.  documentation  (ISDA Agreements) grant each counterparty a right of termination, including in certain cases of (i) a transformation (for example mergers and changes of form), (ii) an asset transfer or (iii) acquisition of ownership interests that enables the acquirer to exercise control over Siemens AG or its controlling bodies. Partially this right of termination exists only, if (1) the resulting entity fails to simultaneously assume Siemens AG's  obligations  under  the  ISDA  Agreements  or  (2)  the  resulting  entity's  creditworthiness  is  materially  weaker  than  Siemens  AG's immediately prior to such event. Generally, ISDA Agreements are designed such that upon termination all outstanding payment claims documented under them are to be netted.\n\n## 10.6 Compensation agreements with members of the Managing Board or employees in the event of a takeover bid\n\nThe contracts with the members of the Managing Board previously contained the right of the member to terminate his or her contract with the Company for good cause in the event of a change of control that results in a substantial change in the position of a Managing Board  member  (for  example,  due  to  a  change  in  corporate  strategy  or  a  change  in  the  Managing  Board  member's  duties  and responsibilities). A change of control exists if one or several shareholders acting jointly or in concert acquire a majority of the voting rights in Siemens AG and exercise a controlling influence, or if Siemens AG becomes a dependent enterprise as a result of entering into an intercompany agreement within the meaning of Section 291 of the German Stock Corporation Act, or if Siemens AG is to be merged into an existing corporation or other entity. If this right of termination is exercised, the Managing Board member is entitled to a severance payment in the amount of no more than two years' compensation. The calculation of the annual compensation includes not only the base compensation and the target amount for the bonus, but also the target amount for the stock awards, in each case based on the most recent completed fiscal year prior to termination of the contract. The stock-based compensation components for which a firm commitment already exists will remain unaffected. Additionally, the severance payments cover non-monetary benefits by including an amount of 5% of the total severance amount. Severance payments will be reduced by 10% as a lump-sum allowance for discounted values and for income earned elsewhere. However, this reduction will apply only to the portion of the severance payment that was calculated without taking account of the first six months of the remaining term of the Managing Board member's contract. There is no entitlement to a severance payment if the Managing Board member receives benefits from third parties in connection with a change of control. A right to terminate the  contract  does  not  exist  if  the  change  of  control  occurs  within  a  period  of  twelve  months  prior  to  a  Managing  Board  member's retirement.\n\nOn September 18, 2019, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG resolved that the contracts with members of the Managing Board should not contain such right of termination in the future. This has already been taken into account in the case of contract extensions and in the case of new contracts with the newly appointed members of the Managing Board as of October 1, 2020.\n\n## 10.7 Other takeover-relevant information\n\nWe are not aware of, nor have we during the last fiscal year been notified of, any shareholder directly or indirectly holding 10% or more of the voting rights. There are no Siemens shares with special rights conferring powers of control. Shares of stock issued by Siemens AG to employees under its share programs and/or as share-based compensation are transferred to the employees. The beneficiary employees who hold shares of employee stock may exercise their control rights in the same way as any other shareholder in accordance with applicable laws and the Articles of Association.",

        "page_content": "## 11. EU Taxonomy disclosure\n\nThe key performance indicators (KPI) in this section were determined based on Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 in conjunction with the International Financial Reporting Standards applicable for the Consolidated Financial Statements. For calculating the eligibility  and  alignment  KPIs,  Siemens'  business  activities  and  associated  revenue,  capital  expenditures  (CapEx),  and  operating expenditures (OpEx) were predominantly directly mapped to an applicable economic activity listed in the Commission Delegated Acts in connection with EU regulation 2020/852. For the calculation of CapEx and OpEx, allocations were also made based on the revenue of the Taxonomy-eligible and aligned activities. To avoid double counting, a mapping was always made to one economic activity only. Following the  eligibility  assessment,  the  alignment  with  Substantial  Contribution  criteria  for  all  eligible  business  activities  was  assessed  and documented based on appropriate reporting hierarchy levels, such as business-segment, product-family or project level. Once a business activity demonstrated Substantial Contribution, the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria were assessed together with technical experts on  the  product,  site,  project  and/or  supplier  level.  For  fiscal  2023,  EU  Taxonomy  reporting  is  limited  to  the  first  two  environmental objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change adaption). Based on its implemented group-wide structures on risk analysis, corporate  guidelines  and  due  diligence  processes  and  mechanisms,  Siemens  fulfills  the  Minimum  Safeguards  requirements,  which comprise the areas of human rights, anti-corruption and bribery, taxation, and fair competition.\n\n## Revenue KPI\n\nThe  revenue  KPI  shows  the  ratio  of  revenue  from  Taxonomy-eligible  and/or  aligned  economic  activities  to  the  total  revenue  in  the Consolidated Statements of Income for the reporting year. Based on an assessment of the Siemens business portfolio, Taxonomy-eligible revenue accounted for 20.3% and Taxonomy-aligned revenue for 16.5% of total revenue. This translates into \u20ac15.7 billion in Taxonomyeligible revenue and \u20ac12.8 billion in aligned revenue.\n\nTaxonomy-eligible and aligned economic activities were primarily driven by the (i) Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport (Climate  Change Mitigation, CCM 3.3), (ii)  rail  transportation  infrastructure  (CCM  6.14),  (iii)  Infrastructure  enabling  low-carbon  road transport and public transport (CCM 6.15), all associated with Mobility businesses, as well as (iv) energy-efficient building technologies (CCM 3.5) and (v) services for energy-efficient building technologies (CCM 7.5), both related to Smart Infrastructure businesses.\n\nThe difference between Taxonomy-eligible revenue and Taxonomy-aligned revenue is mainly due to DNSH criteria related to pollution prevention  as  part  of  Appendix  C,  which  go  beyond  existing  national  regulation.  This  is  mainly  because  additionally  required documentation is not completely available yet.\n\n## Capital expenditures KPI\n\nThe CapEx KPI shows the ratio of CapEx from Taxonomy-eligible and/or aligned economic activities to the total CapEx, reflecting additions (including additions from business combinations) to other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in accordance with Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the reporting year, 34.5% (\u20ac1.3 billion) of Siemens' CapEx were eligible, and 12.2% (\u20ac0.5 billion) were aligned. The aligned CapEx is composed as follows: a majority of \u20ac0.4 billion is related to additions to property, plant and equipment, the remainder pertains to internally generated intangible assets and capitalized right-of-use assets.\n\nThis aligned CapEx includes \u20ac116 million related to a CapEx plan, associated with building projects to be finalized by fiscal 2028, summing up to a planned total volume of \u20ac1.4 billion (capitalizable and non-capitalizable costs). The buildings are designed to minimize energy use and carbon emissions (CCM 7.7).\n\nAcquisition and ownership of buildings (CCM 7.7) related to Siemens' real estate portfolio represents the largest portion in overall CapEx eligibility. The difference between Taxonomy-eligible CapEx and Taxonomy-aligned CapEx is impacted by (i) only partial availability of information on energy performance certificates for our global portfolio and (ii) energy certificates below the required threshold defined in the Substantial Contribution criteria for the energy efficiency of buildings.\n\n## Operating expenditures KPI\n\nThe OpEx KPI shows the ratio of OpEx from Taxonomy-eligible and/or aligned economic activities to total OpEx. The total OpEx comprises direct non-capitalized costs related to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repairs, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant, and equipment per Annex I of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178. Accordingly, 12.4% (\u20ac0.9 billion) of Siemens' OpEx were eligible and 8.2% (\u20ac0.6 billion) were aligned.\n\nThe majority of eligible and/or aligned expenditures relate to processes and assets associated with the economic activities described for the revenue KPI: (i) Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport (CCM 3.3) and (ii) rail transportation infrastructure (CCM 6.14). These two activities account for half of eligible OpEx and the majority of aligned OpEx.\n\nThis aligned OpEx includes \u20ac3 million related to a CapEx plan, associated with building projects to be finalized by fiscal 2028, summing up to a planned total volume of \u20ac1.4 billion (capitalizable and non-capitalizable costs). The buildings are designed to minimize energy use and carbon emissions (CCM 7.7).\n\nCorresponding  to  revenue,  the  difference  between  Taxonomy-eligible  OpEx  and  Taxonomy-aligned  OpEx  relates  mainly  to  the documentation of DNSH criteria for pollution prevention (Appendix C).",

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1 Basis of presentation\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements present the operations of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft with registered offices in Berlin (registry number HRB 12300) and Munich (registry number HRB 6684), Germany, and its subsidiaries (the Company or Siemens). They have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union as well as with the additional requirements set forth in Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The Consolidated Financial Statements are in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Consolidated Financial Statements were authorized for issue by the Managing Board on December 4, 2023. Siemens prepares and reports its Consolidated Financial Statements in euros (\u20ac). Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided. Siemens is a German based multinational focused technology company.\n\n## NOTE 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates\n\nCertain of the following accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where Siemens reasonably could have used a different estimate in the  current  accounting  period.  Siemens  cautions  that  future  events  often  vary  from  forecasts  and  that  estimates  routinely  require adjustment.\n\nSiemens operates in an increasingly complex and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, particularly due to the war in Ukraine  and  the  conflict  in  Israel-Gaza/Middle  East.  Notably,  we  face  continuing  inflation,  increased  interest  rates,  volatile  foreign currencies and share prices along with a rising apprehension of a slow-down of economic growth in significant markets compared to prior years. Uncertainties increase in prognosis and forecasts, in applying critical accounting estimates and in using management judgements. Those trends could impact fair values and carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, amount and timing of results of operations and cash flows of Siemens. Severity and duration of those trends are decisive on the magnitude of its impact on Siemens' Consolidated Financial Statements. Siemens based its estimates and assumptions on existing knowledge and best information available.\n\nBasis of consolidation - The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries over which the Company has control. Siemens controls an investee if it has power over the investee. In addition, Siemens is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from the involvement with the investee and Siemens is able to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of Siemens' return.\n\nBusiness combinations - Cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date  of  exchange.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a  business  combination  (including  contingent  liabilities)  are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests are measured at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method). If there is no loss of control, transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions not affecting net income. At the date control is lost, any retained equity interests are remeasured to fair value. In case of a written put option on non-controlling interests the Company assesses whether the prerequisites for the transfer of present ownership interest are fulfilled at the balance sheet date. If the Company is not the beneficial owner of the shares underlying the put option, the exercise of the put option will be assumed at each balance sheet date and treated as equity transaction between shareholders with the recognition of a purchase liability at the respective exercise price. The non-controlling interests participate in profits and losses during the reporting period.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures -  Associates  are  companies  over  which Siemens has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally through direct or indirect ownership of 20% to 50% of the voting rights). Joint ventures are entities over which Siemens and one or more parties have joint control. Joint control requires unanimous consent of the parties sharing control in decision making on relevant activities.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. If the investment was retained in a transaction in which Siemens lost control of a subsidiary, the fair value of the investment represents the cost on initial recognition. Siemens' share of its associate's or joint venture's post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in  the  Consolidated  Statements of Income, and its share of post-acquisition changes in equity that have not been recognized in the associate's or joint venture's profit or loss is recognized directly in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition changes also include effects from fair value adjustments and are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When Siemens' share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the investment, Siemens does not recognize further losses, unless it incurs obligations or makes payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. The interest in an associate or joint venture is the carrying amount of the investment together with any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of Siemens' net investment in the associate or joint venture.\n\nSiemens reviews associates and joint ventures for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that its investment is impaired, for example a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost. In  addition,  Siemens similarly assesses whether there are indications that an impairment loss recorded in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased. If this is the case, any reversal of an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount subsequently increases, not exceeding the carrying amount, had no impairment loss been recognized in previous periods. Impairments and reversal of impairments include the use of judgements.\n\nForeign currency translation - Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the functional currency is other than the euro, are translated using the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, while the Consolidated Statements of Income are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Differences arising from such translations are recognized within equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign subsidiary is recognized. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, whereas cash and cash equivalents are translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.",

        "page_content": "Foreign currency transaction - Transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at that functional currency applying the spot exchange rate at the date when the underlying transactions are initially recognized. At the end of the reporting period, foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are revalued to functional currency applying the spot exchange rate prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized in net income. Those foreign currency-denominated transactions which are classified as non-monetary are remeasured using the historical spot exchange rate.\n\nRevenue recognition - Siemens recognizes revenue when, or as control over distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer; i.e. when the customer is able to direct the use of the transferred goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits, provided a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others collectability of consideration is probable taking our customer's creditworthiness into account. Revenue is the transaction price Siemens expects to be entitled to. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur once associated uncertainties are resolved. The amount of variable consideration is calculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending on which is expected to better predict the amount of variable consideration. Consideration is adjusted for the time value of money if the period between the transfer of goods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve months and there is a significant financing benefit either to the customer or Siemens. If a contract contains more than one distinct good or service, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling prices. If stand-alone selling prices are not observable, the Company reasonably estimates those. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation either at a point in time or over time.\n\nRevenues from construction-type contracts : Revenues are recognized over time under the percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs. An expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expense immediately. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.\n\nThe  percentage-of-completion  method  places  considerable  importance  on  accurate  estimates  of  the  extent  of  progress  towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. These significant estimates include total estimated costs, total estimated revenues, contract risks, including technical, political and regulatory risks, risks from supply chain constraints and other judgments. Under the percentage-of-completion method, changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue. In addition, Siemens needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether it is terminated. In determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected to be the most likely scenario, all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract are considered on an individual basis.\n\nRevenues from maintenance and service contracts : Revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than straight-line, as services are provided, i.e. under the percentage-of-completion method as described above. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.\n\nRevenues from product sales : Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually upon delivery of the goods. Invoices are issued at that point in time and are usually payable within 30 days.\n\nRevenues from software contracts: Software contracts usually comprise the sale of subscription licenses and perpetual licenses, which are both on-premise, as well as technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades and the sale of software-as-aservice. Subscription contracts generally contain two separate performance obligations: time-based software license and technical support service. Revenues for perpetual and time-based licenses granting the customer a right to use Siemens' intellectual property are recognized at a point in time, i.e. when control of the license passes to the customer. Revenues for technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades are recognized over time on a straight-line basis as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by Siemens' services. Software-as-a-service contracts including related cloud services represent one performance obligation for which revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis. Payment terms for all transactions are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.\n\nIncome from interest - Interest is recognized using the effective interest method.\n\nFunctional  costs -  In  general,  operating  expenses  by  types  are  assigned  to  the  functions  following  the  functional  area  of  the corresponding profit and cost centers. Amortization, depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are included in functional costs depending on the use of the assets.\n\nProduct-related expenses - Provisions for estimated costs related to product warranties are recorded in line item Cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized.\n\nResearch and development costs - Costs of research activities are expensed as incurred. Costs of development activities are capitalized when the recognition criteria in IAS 38 are met. Capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses with an amortization period of generally three to 25 years.\n\nEarnings per share - Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income from continuing operations, income from discontinued operations and net income, all attributable to ordinary shareholders of Siemens AG by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by assuming conversion or exercise of all potentially dilutive securities and sharebased payment plans.\n\nGoodwill - Goodwill is not amortized, instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as well as whenever there are events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generating unit or a group of cashgenerating units, generally represented by a segment. Siemens Healthineers is tested one level below the segment. This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the (group of) cash-generating unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. If the carrying amount of the (group of) cash-generating unit(s), to which the goodwill is allocated, exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss on goodwill allocated to that (group of) cash-generating unit(s) is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the (group of) cash-generating unit(s)' fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If either of these values exceeds the carrying amount, it is not always necessary to determine both values. These",

        "page_content": "values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future periods.\n\nThe determination of the recoverable amount of a (group of) cash-generating unit(s) to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by management. The outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced e.g. by the successful integration of acquired entities, volatility  of  capital  markets,  interest  rate  developments,  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuations  and  the  outlook  on  economic  trends.  In determining recoverable amounts, discounted cash flow calculations generally use five-year projections (in exceptional cases up to ten years) that are based on financial forecasts. Cash flow projections consider past experience and represent management's best estimate about future developments. Cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates. Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use include estimated growth rates and weighted average cost of capital.  These  estimates,  including  the  methodology  used,  can  have  a  material  impact  on  the  respective  values  and ultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment.\n\nOther intangible assets - The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives for patents, licenses and other similar rights generally range from three to five years, except for  intangible  assets  with  finite  useful  lives  acquired  in  business  combinations.  Intangible  assets  acquired  in  business  combinations primarily consist of customer relationships and trademarks as well as technology. Useful lives in specific acquisitions ranged from two to 30 years for customer relationships and trademarks and for technology from five to 22 years.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment, is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method. The following useful lives are assumed:\n\nFactory and office buildings\n\n20 to 50 years\n\nOther buildings\n\n5 to 10 years\n\nTechnical machinery & equipment\n\ngenerally 10 years\n\nOffice & other equipment\n\ngenerally 5 years\n\nEquipment leased to others\n\ngenerally 3 to 7 years\n\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets - The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual impairment test. Impairment testing of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets involves the use of estimates in determining the assets' recoverable amount, which can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment.\n\nLeases - A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Further information on leases can be found in Notes 8, 13 and 16.\n\nLessor : Leases are classified as either finance or operating leases, determined based on whether substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset are transferred. If this is the case, the lease is classified as a finance lease; if not, it is an operating  lease.  Receivables  from  finance  leases  are  recognized  at  an  amount  equal  to  the  net  investment  in  the  lease.  The  assets underlying the operating leases are presented in Property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives or to their estimated residual value. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nLessee : Siemens recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months if the underlying asset is not of low value. Payments for short-term and low-value leases are expensed over the lease term. Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation expense and impairment losses adjusted for any remeasurements. Right-of-use assets are depreciated under the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying assets. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments due over the lease term, generally discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. They are remeasured in case of modifications or reassessments of the lease.\n\nDiscontinued operations and non-current assets held for disposal - Discontinued operations are reported when a component of an entity  is  classified  as  held  for  disposal  or  has  been  disposed  of,  if  the  component  represents  a  separate  major  line  of  business  or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to disposal. A non-current asset or a disposal group is held for disposal, if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction or through a distribution to owners rather than through continuing use. Depreciation and amortization cease for assets classified as held for disposal. In the Consolidated Statements of Income and of Cash Flows, discontinued operations are reported separately from continuing operations; prior periods are presented on a comparable basis. The disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements outside of Note 3 relate to continuing operations or assets and liabilities not held for disposal. The non-current asset held for disposal or the disposal group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The determination of the fair value less costs to sell includes the use of estimates and assumptions that tend to be uncertain.\n\nIncome taxes - Tax positions are calculated taking into consideration the respective local tax laws, relevant court decisions and applicable tax  authorities'  views.  Tax  regulations  can  be  complex  and  possibly  subject  to  different  interpretations  of  tax  payers  and  local  tax authorities. Different interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other tax legislative procedures may result in additional tax payments for prior years and are taken into account based on management's considerations. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected tax consequences of future periods attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future  taxable  profit  is  available,  including  income  from  forecasted  operating  earnings,  the  reversal  of  existing  taxable  temporary differences  and  available  tax  planning  opportunities  that  Siemens  would  execute.  As  of  each  period-end,  Siemens  evaluates  the recoverability of deferred tax assets, based on taxable income of past periods and projected future taxable profits. As future developments are uncertain and partly beyond Siemens's control, assumptions are necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in which deferred tax assets will recover. Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption.",

        "page_content": "Expected tax effects, arising from prospectively applying the global minimum taxation rules (Pillar Two), are not considered in calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities. Currently, it is expected to apply Pillar Two to the entire Siemens Group commencing with fiscal 2025.\n\nContract assets, contract liabilities, receivables - When either party to a contract with customers has performed, Siemens presents a contract  asset,  a  contract  liability  or  a  receivable  depending  on  the  relationship  between  Siemens'  performance  and  the  customer's payment. Contract assets and liabilities are presented as current since incurred in the normal operating cycle. Receivables are recognized when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Valuation allowances for credit risks are made for contract assets and receivables in accordance with the accounting policy for financial assets measured at amortized cost.\n\nInventories -  Inventories  are  valued  at  the  lower  of  acquisition  or  production  costs  and  net  realizable  value,  costs  being  generally determined based on an average or first-in, first-out method. Determining net realizable value of inventories involves accounting estimates for quantity, technical and price risks.\n\nDefined benefit plans -  Siemens measures the entitlements by applying the projected unit credit method. The approach reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered. In determining the net present value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered (Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)), the expected rates of salary and pension increases are considered. The assumptions used for the calculation of the DBO as of the period-end of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost and interest income and expense of the following year. Significant plans apply individual spot rates from full discount rate curves to determine service cost and interest expense. The net interest income or expense for the fiscal  year  will  be  based  on  the  discount  rate  for  the  respective  year  multiplied  by  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  (asset)  at  the preceding fiscal year's period-end date.\n\nService cost, past service cost and settlement gains (losses) for pensions and similar obligations as well as administration costs unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated among functional costs. Past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are recognized immediately in profit or loss. For unfunded plans, the amount in line item Provisions for pensions and similar obligations equals the DBO. For funded plans, Siemens offsets the fair value of the plan assets from the DBO. Siemens recognizes the net amount, after adjustments for effects relating to any asset ceiling.\n\nRemeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset). They are recognized in Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.\n\nActuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation increases, rate of pension progression and mortality rates. Discount rates used are determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting period. In case such yields are not available, discount rates are based on government bonds yields. Due to changing market, economic and social conditions, the underlying key assumptions may differ from actual developments.\n\nEntitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at period-end. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the DBO is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back to a present value.\n\nProvisions - A provision is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position when (1) it is probable that the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and (2) it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and (3) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. When a contract becomes onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision.\n\nSignificant  estimates  are  involved  in  the  determination  of  provisions  related  to  onerous  contracts,  warranty  costs,  asset  retirement obligations, legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations (Legal Proceedings). Siemens records a provision for onerous contracts with customers when current estimates of total estimated costs exceed estimated revenue. Onerous contracts with customers are identified by monitoring the progress of the project and updating the estimates which requires significant judgment relating to achieving certain performance standards as well as estimates involving warranty costs and estimates regarding project delays including the assessment of responsibility splits between the contract partners for these delays.\n\nLegal Proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly, considerable judgment is part of determining whether it is probable that there is a present obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the reporting period, whether it is probable that such a Legal Proceeding will result in an outflow of resources and whether the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Internal and external counsels are generally part of the determination process. Due to new developments, it may be necessary, to record a provision for an ongoing Legal Proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously recognized provision. Upon resolution of a Legal Proceeding, Siemens may incur charges in excess of the recorded provisions for such matters. The outcome of Legal Proceedings may have a material effect on Siemens' financial position, its results of operations and/or its cash flows.\n\nTermination benefits - Termination benefits are provided as a result of an entity's offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancy before the regular retirement date or from an entity's decision to terminate the employment. Termination benefits in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits, are recognized as a liability and an expense when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.\n\nFinancial instruments - A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Based on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model they are held in, financial instruments are classified as financial assets and financial liabilities measured at cost or amortized cost, measured at fair value, loan commitments, contract assets and receivables from finance leases. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are accounted for at the  trade  date.  Initially,  financial  instruments  are  recognized  at  fair  value  and  net  of  transaction  costs,  if  not  categorized  at  FVTPL. Subsequently, financial assets and liabilities are measured according to the category to which they are assigned to:\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) : a) mandatorily measured at FVTPL: Debt financial assets are measured at FVTPL if the business model they are held in is not a hold-to-collect or a hold-and-sell business model, or if their contractual cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest. Equity instruments are measured at FVTPL unless the FVOCI-option is  elected.  b)  Financial  assets  designated  as  measured  at  FVTPL  are  irrevocably  designated  at  initial  recognition  if  the  designation significantly reduces accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise if assets and liabilities as well as recognizing gains (losses) were measured on different bases.",

        "page_content": "Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) :  are equity instruments for which Siemens irrevocably elects to present subsequent fair value changes in OCI at initial recognition of the instrument. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income tax expenses, as well as gains and losses on the subsequent sale of the instruments are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost : Loans, receivables and other debt instruments held in a hold-to-collect business model with contractual cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less valuation allowances for expected credit losses.\n\nValuation  allowances  are  set  up  for  expected  credit  losses,  representing  a  forward-looking  estimate  of  future  credit  losses  involving significant judgment. Expected credit loss is the gross carrying amount less collateral, multiplied by the probability of default and a factor reflecting the loss in the event of default. Valuation allowances are not recognized as far as the gross carrying amount is sufficiently collateralized. Probabilities of default are mainly derived from internal rating grades. A simplified approach is used to assess expected credit losses from trade receivables, lease receivables and contract assets by applying their lifetime expected credit losses. The valuation allowance for loans and other long-term debt instruments primarily held at Financial Services (SFS) is measured according to a three-stage impairment approach:\n\nStage 1 : At inception, twelve-month expected credit losses are recognized based on a twelve months probability of default.\n\nStage 2 :  If  the  credit  risk  of  a  financial  asset  increases  significantly  without being credit-impaired, lifetime expected credit losses are recognized  based  on  a  lifetime  probability  of  default.  A  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  is  determined  for  each  individual  financial instrument using internal credit ratings. A rating deterioration does not trigger a transfer into Stage 2, if the credit rating remains within the investment grade range. More than 30 days past due payments will not be transferred into Stage 2, if the delay is not credit-riskrelated.\n\nStage 3 : If the financial asset is credit-impaired, valuation allowances equal lifetime expected credit losses. A financial asset is considered credit-impaired when there is observable information about significant financial difficulties and a high vulnerability to default, however, the definition of default is not yet met. Impairment triggers include liquidity problems, a request for debt restructuring or a breach of contract. A credit-risk driven contractual modification always results in a credit-impaired financial asset.\n\nFinancial assets are written off as uncollectible if recovery appears unlikely. Generally, if the limitation period expired, when a debtor's sworn statement of affairs is received, or when the receivable is not pursued due to its minor value. Receivables are written off when bankruptcy proceedings close.\n\nA financial asset is derecognized when the rights to cash flows expire or the financial asset is transferred to another party. Significant modifications of contractual terms of a financial asset measured at amortized cost result in derecognition and recognition of a new financial asset; for insignificant modifications, the carrying amount of the financial asset is adjusted without derecognition.\n\nCash and cash equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid investments with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost.\n\nLoan  Commitments -  Expected  credit  losses  for  irrevocable  loan  commitments  are  determined  using  the  three-stage  impairment approach for financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized as a liability.\n\nFinancial  liabilities -  except  for  derivative  financial  instruments,  Siemens  measures  financial  liabilities  at  amortized  cost  using  the effective interest method.\n\nDerivative financial instruments - Derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts are measured at fair value unless they are designated as hedging instruments, for which hedge accounting is applied. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized either in net income or, in the case of a cash flow hedge, in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes (applicable deferred income tax). Certain derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are also accounted for separately as derivatives.\n\nFair value hedges :  The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk. Where an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in its fair value is recognized as a separate financial asset or liability with corresponding gain or loss recognized in net income. For hedged items carried at amortized cost, the adjustment is amortized until maturity of the hedged item. For hedged firm commitments the initial carrying amount of the assets or liabilities  that  result  from  meeting the firm commitments are adjusted to include the cumulative changes in the fair value that were previously recognized as separate financial assets or liabilities.\n\nCash flow hedges :  The  effective  portion  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  derivative  instruments  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income.\n\nShare-based payment - Share-based payment awards at Siemens are predominately designed as equity-settled. Fair value is measured at grant date and is expensed over the vesting period. Fair value is determined as the price of the underlying shares, considering dividends during the vesting period the grantees are not entitled to as well as market conditions and non-vesting conditions, if applicable. Plans granting the rights to receive subsidiary shares constitute own shares and, accordingly, are accounted as equity-settled.\n\nInsurance contracts - In June 2020, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance contracts (IFRS 17), effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Siemens will adopt the standard commencing with fiscal 2024. IFRS 17 introduces and applies uniform accounting policies for insurance contracts and supersedes IFRS 4 Insurance contracts. The adoption of IFRS 17 is not expected to have a significant impact on Siemens' Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nPrior-year  information -  The  presentation  of  certain  prior-year  information  has  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current  year presentation.",

In fiscal  2022  acquisitions  totaled  \u20ac2.0  billion.  In  fiscal  2023  and  2022,  the  (preliminary)  purchase  price  allocations  resulted  in  Other intangible assets of \u20ac180 million and \u20ac1.1 billion, respectively, and in Goodwill of \u20ac203 million and \u20ac1.5 billion, respectively. Goodwill comprises  intangible  assets  that  are  not  separable  such  as  employee  know-how  and  expected  synergy  effects.  The  purchase  price allocation for some of the acquired businesses is preliminary, as a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities has not been finalized.\n\n## Disposals\n\nIn November 2022, Siemens sold its Commercial Vehicles business for a consideration of \u20ac184 million in cash and recognized a pre-tax gain on  the  disposal  of  \u20ac148  million,  which  is  presented  in  Other  operating  income.  The  business  was  previously  reported  at  Portfolio Companies.\n\n## NOTE 4 Interests in other entities\n\n## Investments accounted for using the equity method\n\n|                                                                           | Sep 30,   | Sep 30,   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                        | 2023      | 2022      |\n| Share of profit (loss), net                                               | (1,298)   | (97)      |\n| Gains (losses) on disposals, net                                          | 618       | 609       |\n| Impairments and reversals of impairment                                   | 1,586     | (2,597)   |\n| Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net | 906       | (2,085)   |\n\nSiemens Energy AG, an associate accounted for using the equity method, is globally active in the transmission and generation of electrical power and is publicly listed. The fair value of our investment in Siemens Energy AG is \u20ac2.5 billion and \u20ac2.9 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, determined based on Siemens Energy's market capitalization (level 1 of the fair value hierarchy). In fiscal 2023 and 2022, Siemens Energy AG added a loss to Share of profit (loss), net of \u20ac(1,478) million and \u20ac(207) million, respectively. The loss includes  Siemens'  share  of  Siemens  Energy  AG's  net  losses  of  \u20ac(1,405)  million  and  \u20ac(142)  million  as  well  as  effects  from  fair  value adjustments  at  initial  recognition  of  \u20ac(73)  million  and  \u20ac(65)  million,  respectively.  In  fiscal  2023,  Siemens  Energy  AG  acquired  and redeemed shares of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. from the minority shareholders. The acquisition and redemption of shares of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. reduced equity within Siemens Energy AG's consolidated financial statements. Recognizing Siemens' share in this equity transaction decreased the carrying amount of our investment in Siemens Energy AG by \u20ac1,553 million, which is recognized in Equity directly. In March 2023, Siemens Energy AG completed a capital increase, in which Siemens did not participate. The transaction decreased Siemens' stake in Siemens Energy AG from 35.1% to 31.9%, which resulted in a gain of \u20ac235 million, disclosed in Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method and in Reconciling items of Segment information. As of March 31, 2023, the recoverable amount of our investment in Siemens Energy AG of \u20ac5.2 billion, determined based on its market capitalization (level 1 of the fair value hierarchy), increased significantly compared to the level when the impairment was recorded in fiscal 2022. This triggered a partial reversal of the previous impairment of \u20ac1,594 million, which is included in Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method and in Reconciling items of Segment information. In June 2023, Siemens contributed a 6.8% stake in Siemens Energy AG (54 million shares) to the Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. at fair value (share price of \u20ac15.67; Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy). Siemens' stake in Siemens Energy AG declined from 31.9% to 25.1%. The contribution resulted in a gain of \u20ac318 million disclosed at Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method and at Reconciling items of Segment information.\n\nBelow summarized consolidated financial information of Siemens Energy AG are disclosed at a 100 per cent basis. They are adjusted to align with Siemens' accounting policies and to incorporate effects from fair value adjustments at initial recognition.\n\n|                                                                                  | Siemens Energy AG  registered in Munich, Germany   | Siemens Energy AG  registered in Munich, Germany   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                               | Sep 30, 2023                                       | Sep 30, 2022                                       |\n| Ownership interest                                                               | 25.1%                                              | 35.1%                                              |\n| Current assets                                                                   | 26,567                                             | 28,665                                             |\n| Non-current assets excluding goodwill                                            | 16,321                                             | 17,279                                             |\n| Current liabilities                                                              | 31,599                                             | 27,941                                             |\n| Non-current liabilities                                                          | 8,487                                              | 7,134                                              |\n| Net Assets                                                                       | 2,802                                              | 10,870                                             |\n| attributable to shareholders of Siemens Energy AG                                | 2,207                                              | 10,528                                             |\n| Siemens interest in the net assets of Siemens Energy AG at fiscal year-end       | 554                                                | 3,695                                              |\n| Consolidation adjustments including goodwill                                     | 2,098                                              | 2,670                                              |\n| Accumulated (impairment) and reversal of impairment (balance at fiscal year-end) | (873)                                              | (2,703)                                            |\n| Carrying amount of Siemens Energy AG at fiscal year-end                          | 1,779                                              | 3,662                                              |",

In fiscal 2023 and 2022, deferred taxes include tax effects from the origination and reversal of temporary differences of \u20ac(670) million and \u20ac(430) million, respectively. Deferred taxes include tax expenses of \u20ac125 million from the write-down of previously recognized deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences (in fiscal 2022, \u20ac(202) million tax from the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred taxes on tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences).\n\nIn Germany, the calculation of current taxes is based on a combined tax rate of 31%, consisting of a corporate tax rate of 15%, a solidarity surcharge thereon of 5.5% and an average trade tax rate of 15%. For foreign subsidiaries, current taxes are calculated based on the local tax law and applicable tax rates in the individual foreign countries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities in Germany and abroad are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled.\n\nGlobal minimum taxation rules (Pillar Two) were enacted in some jurisdictions, in which Siemens currently operates. We expect to apply Pillar Two worldwide commencing with fiscal 2025 and anticipate an increase in current taxes in a low double-digit million euro range.\n\nCurrent and deferred income tax expenses differ from the amounts computed by applying a combined statutory German income tax rate of 31% as follows:\n\n|                                                                 | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                              | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Expected income tax expenses                                    | 3,472         | 2,218         |\n| Increase (decrease) in income taxes resulting from:             |               |               |\n| Non-deductible expenses                                         | 831           | 1,947         |\n| Tax-free income                                                 | (1,142)       | (769)         |\n| Taxes for prior years                                           | (8)           | 215           |\n| Change in realizability of deferred tax assets and tax credits  | 36            | (198)         |\n| Change in tax rates                                             | (6)           | 12            |\n| Foreign tax rate differential                                   | (752)         | (591)         |\n| Tax effect of investments accounted for using the equity method | 410           | 14            |\n| Other, net (primarily German trade tax differentials)           | (154)         | (106)         |\n| Actual income tax expenses                                      | 2,687         | 2,741         |\n\nDeferred income tax assets and (liabilities) on a net basis are summarized as follows:\n\n|                                             | Sep 30,   | Sep 30,   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                          | 2023      | 2022      |\n| Deferred taxes due to temporary differences |           |           |\n| Intangible assets                           | (2,208)   | (2,957)   |\n| Pensions and similar obligations            | 1,709     | 1,943     |\n| Current assets and liabilities              | 640       | 459       |\n| Non-current assets and liabilities          | (318)     | (355)     |\n| Tax loss carryforwards and tax credits      | 753       | 989       |\n| Total deferred taxes, net                   | 576       | 78        |\n\nMinus amounts represent deferred tax liabilities.",

Key assumptions on which Siemens based its determinations of the fair value less costs to sell for the (group of) cash-generating unit(s) being part of the segments include terminal value growth rates up to 1.9% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, and after-tax discount rates of 7.5% to 9.5% in fiscal 2023 and 6.5% to 9.0% in fiscal 2022.\n\nTo estimate the fair value less costs to sell of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units, cash flows were projected for the next five years (in exceptional cases up to ten years) based on past experience, actual operating results and management's best estimate about future developments as well as market assumptions. The determined fair value of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units is assigned to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe fair value less costs to sell is mainly driven by the terminal value, which is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions on the terminal value growth rate and discount rate. Both assumptions are determined individually for each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units. Discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Siemens Financial Services' discount rate represents its specific cost of equity. The discount rates are calculated based on a risk-free rate of interest and a market risk premium. In addition, the discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit or group of cashgenerating units by taking into account specific peer group information on beta factors, leverage and cost of debt as well as country specific premiums. The parameters for calculating the discount rates are based on external sources of information. The peer group is subject to an annual review and adjusted, if necessary. Terminal value growth rates take into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data and industry specific trends.\n\nThe following table presents key assumptions used to determine fair value less costs to sell for impairment test purposes for the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated:\n\n|                                 | Sep 30, 2023   | Sep 30, 2023                 | Sep 30, 2023             |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)              | Goodwill       | Terminal  value growth  rate | After-tax  discount rate |\n| Varian of Siemens Healthineers  | 7,874          | 1,9%                         | 8,5%                     |\n| Digital Industries              | 7,828          | 1,9%                         | 9,5%                     |\n| Imaging of Siemens Healthineers | 6,782          | 1,9%                         | 8,0%                     |\n\nRevenue figures in the detailed forecast planning period of the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated are based on average revenue growth rates (excluding portfolio effects) of between 7.3% and 8.4% (8.3% and 10.3% in fiscal 2022).\n\n|                                 | Sep 30, 2022   | Sep 30, 2022                 | Sep 30, 2022             |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)              | Goodwill       | Terminal  value growth  rate | After-tax  discount rate |\n| Digital Industries              | 8,226          | 1.9%                         | 9.0%                     |\n| Varian of Siemens Healthineers  | 8,134          | 1.9%                         | 8.0%                     |\n| Imaging of Siemens Healthineers | 7,260          | 1.9%                         | 7.5%                     |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis for the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated was based on a reduction in after-tax future cash flows by 10% or an increase in after-tax discount rates by one percentage point or a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by one percentage point. Siemens concluded that no impairment loss would need to be recognized on goodwill in any of these groups of cash-generating units.",

As  of  September  30,  2023,  and  2022,  contractual commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment are \u20ac694 million and \u20ac627 million, respectively.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Siemens Healthineers incurred impairment losses in the endovascular robotics solution business of \u20ac262 million, mainly on other intangible assets, due to a decision to refocus certain activities within this business. The impairment loss is primarily reported at Cost of sales. The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit of \u20ac(69) million is fair value less costs to sell, determined by applying a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy) using a 10% after tax discount rate and a term corresponding to the expected useful life of the respective asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are presented in Property, plant and equipment in accordance with their nature; right-of-use assets have a carrying amount of \u20ac2,546 million and \u20ac2,608 million as of September 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively; additions are \u20ac924 million and \u20ac918 million and depreciation expense is \u20ac770 million and \u20ac760 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022. Right-of-use assets mainly relate to leases of land and buildings with a carrying amount of \u20ac2,176 million and \u20ac2,309 million as of September 30, 2023, and 2022, additions of \u20ac604 million and \u20ac650 million and depreciation expense of \u20ac554 million and \u20ac558 million in fiscal 2023, and 2022. Equipment leased to others mainly relate to Technical machinery and equipment as well as to Office and other equipment owned by Siemens with a carrying amount of \u20ac1,248 million and \u20ac298 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2023 and \u20ac1,323 million and \u20ac337 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2022.\n\nIn fiscal 2023 and 2022, expenses recognized for short-term leases are \u20ac64 million and \u20ac56 million, respectively; expenses for low-value leases not accounted for under the right-of-use model are \u20ac27 million and \u20ac22 million, respectively.

As of September 30, 2023, \u20ac22.7 billion in notional amounts were issued and are outstanding (\u20ac23.0 billion as of September 30, 2022).\n\nIn February 2023, the 0.0% \u20ac1.25 billion fixed-rate instruments, in June 2023, the 0.875% \u00a3450 million fixed-rate instruments and in September 2023, the 0.375% \u20ac1.0 billion fixed-rate instruments were redeemed at face value. In February 2023, Siemens issued fixedrate instruments totaling \u20ac2.5 billion in three tranches: 3.375% \u20ac1.25 billion due August 2031; 3.5% \u20ac500 million due February 2036 and 3.625% \u20ac750 million due February 2043.\n\nStand Alone Bonds - In March 2023, the 0.4% US$1.25 billion fixed-rate instruments and in September 2023, the 2.0% US$750 million fixed-rate instruments were redeemed at face value.\n\n## Assignable and term loans\n\nAs  of  September  30,  2023,  and  2022,  five  bilateral  term  loan  facilities  are  outstanding  (in  aggregate  \u20ac1.8  billion  and  \u20ac2.1  billion, respectively).\n\nIn fiscal 2023, two bilateral term loan facilities were newly signed: one bilateral PLN 500 million (\u20ac108 million) term loan facility maturing in fiscal 2026 with one one-year extension option and one bilateral US$250 million (\u20ac236 million) term loan facility maturing in fiscal 2025 with one one-year extension option, which was extended in October 2023 to mature in fiscal 2026 with no remaining extension option.\n\nThe previous bilateral \u20ac250 million term loan facility and the bilateral \u20ac350 million term loan facility, both maturing in fiscal 2023, were redeemed as due.\n\nOf the two persisting bilateral term loan facilities of US$500 million (\u20ac472 million) each, one matures in fiscal 2024, and the second in fiscal 2025. The existing bilateral \u20ac500 million term loan facility matures in fiscal 2025.\n\n## Commercial paper program\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, and 2022, Siemens has a US$9.0 billion (\u20ac8.5 billion and \u20ac9.2 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022) commercial paper program in place including US$ extendible notes capabilities. As of September 30, 2023, US$49 million (\u20ac46 million) were outstanding; as of September 30, 2022, none were outstanding. Siemens' commercial papers have a maturity of generally less than 90 days. Interest rates ranged from 3.06% to 5.29% in fiscal 2023 and from 0.08% to 3.06% in fiscal 2022.\n\n## NOTE 17 Post-employment benefits\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe defined benefit plans open to new entrants are based predominantly on contributions made by the Company. Only to a certain extent, those  plans  are  affected  by  longevity,  inflation  and  compensation  increases  and  take  country  specific  differences  into  account.  The Company's major plans are funded with assets in segregated entities. In accordance with local laws these plans are managed in the interest of the beneficiaries by way of contractual trust agreements with each separate legal entity. The defined benefit plans cover 442,000 participants, including 183,000 actives, 82,000 deferreds with vested benefits and 177,000 retirees and surviving dependents.\n\n## Germany\n\nIn  Germany, pension benefits are provided through the following plans: BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans as well as deferred compensation plans. The majority of active employees participate in the BSAV. Those benefits are based predominantly on notional contributions and the return on the corresponding assets of this plan, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the employer. At inception of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of compensation increases. However, the frozen plans still expose Siemens to investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and longevity risk. The pension plans are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA). In Germany no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements apply.\n\n## U.S.\n\nIn the U.S., the Pension Plans are sponsored by Siemens, which for the most part have been frozen to new entrants and to future benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts. Siemens has appointed the Investment Committee as the named fiduciary for the management of the assets of the Plans. The Plans' assets are held in Trusts and the trustees of the Trusts are responsible for the administration  of  the  assets  of  the  Trusts,  taking  directions  from  the  Investment  Committee.  The  Plans  are  subject  to  the  funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA). There is a regulatory requirement to maintain a minimum funding level of 80% in the defined benefit plans in order to avoid benefit restrictions. At their discretion, sponsoring employers may contribute in excess of this regulatory requirement. Annual contributions are calculated by independent actuaries.\n\n## U.K.\n\nPension benefits are mainly offered through the Siemens Benefit Scheme for which, until the start of retirement, an inflation increase of the majority of accrued benefits is mandatory. The required funding is determined by a funding valuation carried out every third year based on legal requirements. Due to deviating guidelines for the determination of the discount rates, the technical funding deficit is usually larger than the IFRS funding deficit. To reduce the deficit Siemens entered into an agreement with the trustees to provide annual payments of \u00a331 (\u20ac35) million until fiscal 2033. The agreement also provides for a cumulative advance payment by Siemens AG compensating the remaining annual payments at the date of early termination of the agreement due to cancellation or insolvency.",

        "page_content": "## Switzerland\n\nFollowing the Swiss law of occupational benefits (BVG) each employer has to grant post-employment benefits for qualifying employees. Accordingly, Siemens in Switzerland sponsors several cash balance plans. These plans are administered by external foundations. The board of the main foundation is composed of equally many employer and employee representatives. The board of the foundation is responsible for investment policy and asset management, as well as for any changes in the plan rules and the determination of contributions to finance the benefits. The Company is required to make total contributions at least as high as the sum of the employee contributions set out in the plan rules. In case of an underfunded plan the Company together with the employees may be asked to pay supplementary contributions according to a well-defined framework of recovery measures.\n\n## Development of the defined benefit plans\n\n|                                                                                                     | Defined benefit  obligation   (DBO) 1 (I)   | Defined benefit  obligation   (DBO) 1 (I)   | Fair value of   plan assets  (II)   | Fair value of   plan assets  (II)   | Effects of asset  ceiling   | Effects of asset  ceiling   | Net defined benefit  balance  (I -

Sensitivities reflect changes in the DBO solely for the assumption changed.\n\n## Asset Liability Matching Strategies\n\nAs a significant risk, the Company considers a decline in the plans' funded status due to adverse developments of plan assets and/or defined benefit obligations resulting from changing parameters. Accordingly, Siemens implemented a risk management concept aligned with the defined benefit obligations (Asset Liability Matching). Risk management is based on a worldwide defined risk threshold (Value at Risk). The concept, the Value at Risk and the asset development including the investment strategy are monitored and adjusted on an ongoing basis  under  consultation  of  senior  external  experts.

Order related losses and risks are provided for anticipated losses and risks on uncompleted construction, sales and leasing contracts.\n\nThe Company is subject to asset retirement obligations related to certain items of property, plant and equipment. Such asset retirement obligations are primarily attributable to environmental clean-up costs and to costs primarily associated with the removal of leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term.\n\nEnvironmental  clean-up  costs  relate  to  remediation  and  environmental  protection  liabilities  which  have  been  accrued  based  on  the estimated costs of decommissioning the site for the production of uranium and mixed-oxide fuel elements in Hanau, Germany (Hanau facilities), as well as for a nuclear research and service center in Karlstein, Germany (Karlstein facilities). In May 2021, Siemens AG and the Federal Republic of Germany entered into a contract under public-law, based on which the obligation of final disposal of nuclear waste is transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of \u20ac360 million. The contract and therefore the payment is subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules. Estimation uncertainties still relate to assumptions made to measure the obligations that remain with Siemens AG, regarding conditioning and packaging of nuclear waste, as well as intermediate storage and transport to the final storage facility 'Schacht Konrad' or a logistics depot until year-end 2032. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the provisions total \u20ac480 million and \u20ac487 million, respectively.",

The provisions are for incurred and reported insurance losses as well as for incurred, hence, not yet reported insurance losses as of fiscal year-end. The provision is determined using actuarial standard valuation methodologies, which are parameterized based on historical loss data. Life reinsurance contracts have an average term of 19 years, whereas the cash outflows for the industrial business reinsurance contracts are expected within the next five years. Other also includes provisions for Legal Proceedings, as far as the risks that are subject to such Legal Proceedings are  not  already  covered  by  project  accounting.  Provisions  for  Legal  Proceedings  amounted  to  \u20ac227  million  and  \u20ac236  million  as  of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, \u20ac260 million and \u20ac181 million are included for claims and charges resulting from the construction business. Furthermore, Other includes provision for indemnifications in connection with dispositions of businesses of \u20ac82 million and \u20ac92 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. Such indemnifications may protect the buyer from potential tax, legal and other risks in conjunction with the purchased business.\n\n## NOTE 19 Equity\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, and 2022, Siemens' issued capital is divided into 800 million and 850 million registered shares, respectively, with no par value and a notional value of \u20ac3.00 per share. The shares are paid in full. At the Shareholders' Meeting, each share has one vote  and  accounts  for  the  shareholders'  proportionate  share  in  the  Company's  net  income.  All  shares  confer  the  same  rights  and obligations. In fiscal 2023, Siemens cancelled 50 million treasury shares, thereby reducing issued capital by \u20ac150 million to \u20ac2.4 billion.\n\nIn fiscal 2023 and 2022, Siemens repurchased 6,853,091 shares and 14,185,791 shares, respectively. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, Siemens transferred 4,227,344 and 4,376,201 treasury shares, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company has treasury shares of 10,079,918 and 57,454,171 respectively.\n\nShare  based  payment  expenses  increased  Capital  reserve  by  \u20ac444  million  and  \u20ac376  million  (including  non-controlling  interests), respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022. In connection with the settlement of share based payment awards, Siemens treasury shares (at cost) were transferred to employees amounting to \u20ac265 million and \u20ac257 million, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022, which decreased Capital reserve and Retained earnings by \u20ac221 million and \u20ac44 million, respectively in 2023 and by \u20ac191 million and \u20ac66 million in fiscal 2022.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, and 2022, total authorized capital of Siemens AG is \u20ac600 million nominal issuable in installments based on various time-limited authorizations, by issuance of up to 200 million registered shares of no par value. Siemens AG's conditional capital is \u20ac420.6 million or 140.2 million shares as of September 30, 2023 and 2022; which, primarily, can be used to serve convertible bonds or warrants  under  warrant  bonds  that  could  or  can  be  issued  based  on  various  time-limited  authorizations  approved  by  the  respective Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nDividends paid per share were \u20ac4.25 and \u20ac4.00, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022. The Managing Board and the Supervisory Board propose to distribute a dividend of \u20ac4.70 per share to holders entitled to dividends, in total representing approximately \u20ac3.7 billion in expected payments. Payment of the proposed dividend is contingent upon approval at the Shareholders' Meeting on February 8, 2024.\n\n## NOTE 20 Additional capital disclosures\n\nA key consideration of our capital structure management is to maintain ready access to capital markets through various debt instruments and to sustain our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. In order to achieve our target, Siemens intends to maintain an Industrial net debt divided by EBITDA (continuing operations) ratio of up to 1.5 in accordance with our Financial Framework. The ratio indicates  the  approximate  number  of  years  that  would  be  needed  to  cover  the  Industrial  net  debt  through  Income  from  continuing operations, excluding interest, other financial income (expenses), taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairments.\n\n|                                                                                                  | Sep 30,   | Sep 30,   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                                               | 2023      | 2022      |\n| Short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt                                         | 7,483     | 6,658     |\n| Plus: Long-term debt                                                                             | 39,113    | 43,978    |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents                                                                  | (10,084)  | (10,465)  |\n| Less: Current interest-bearing debt securities                                                   | (1,047)   | (1,239)   |\n| Less: Fair value of foreign currency and interest hedges relating to short- and long-term debt 1 | (621)     | (1,720)   |\n| Net debt                                                                                         | 34,843    | 37,212    |\n| Less: Siemens Financial Services debt 2                                                          | (28,756)  | (29,107)  |\n| Plus: Provisions for pensions and similar obligations                                            | 1,426     | 2,275     |\n| Plus: Credit guarantees                                                                          | 411       | 515       |\n| Industrial net debt                                                                              | 7,924     | 10,896    |\n| Income from continuing operations before income taxes                                            | 11,201    | 7,154     |\n| Plus/Less: Interest income, interest expenses and other financial income (expenses), net         | (646)     | 45        |\n| Plus: Amortization, depreciation and impairments                                                 | 3,608     | 3,561     |\n| EBITDA                                                                                           | 14,163    | 10,759    |\n| Industrial net debt/EBITDA                                                                       | 0.6       | 1.0       |",

Additionally, credit guarantees are issued in the course of the SFS business. Credit guarantees generally provide that in the event of default or non-payment by the primary debtor, Siemens will be required to settle such financial obligations. The maximum amount of these guarantees is equal to the outstanding balance of the credit or, in case a credit line is subject to variable utilization, the nominal amount of the credit line. These guarantees have typically residual terms of up to three years (in fiscal 2022 four years). The Company held collateral mainly through inventories and trade receivables. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, Credit guarantees include \u20ac95 million and \u20ac123 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy. Siemens accrued \u20ac18 million and \u20ac2 million relating to credit guarantees as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nFurthermore,  Siemens  issues  performance  guarantees,  which  mainly  include  performance  bonds.  In  the  event  of  non-fulfillment  of contractual obligations by the primary obligor, Siemens will be required to pay up to an agreed-upon maximum amount. These agreements typically have terms of up to ten years. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, Performance guarantees include \u20ac5,341 million and \u20ac8,562 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy; the related contract liability amount for parent company guarantees is generally reduced using the straight-line method over the planned term of the underlying delivery or service agreement. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company accrued \u20ac58 million and \u20ac54 million, respectively, relating to performance guarantees.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, and 2022, in addition to guarantees disclosed in the table above, there are contingent liabilities of \u20ac402 million and \u20ac421 million which mainly result from other guarantees and legal proceedings. Other guarantees include \u20ac71 million and \u20ac99 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy.\n\n## NOTE 22 Legal proceedings\n\nSiemens is involved in numerous Legal Proceedings in various jurisdictions. These Legal Proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. In addition, further Legal Proceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending Legal Proceedings may be extended. Asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates.\n\nSome of these Legal Proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens, which may have material effects on its business activities as well as its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nFor Legal Proceedings information required under IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets is not disclosed if the Company concludes that disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of the matter.\n\n## Proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations\n\nAs previously reported, in July 2008, Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A. (OTE) filed a lawsuit against Siemens AG with the district court of Munich, Germany, seeking to compel Siemens AG to disclose the outcome of its internal investigations with respect to OTE. OTE seeks to obtain information with respect to allegations of undue influence and/or acts of bribery in connection with contracts concluded between Siemens AG and OTE from calendar 1992 to 2006. At the end of July 2010, OTE expanded its claim and requested",

        "page_content": "payment of damages by Siemens AG of at least \u20ac57 million to OTE for alleged bribery payments to OTE employees. In October 2014, OTE increased its damage claim to the amount of at least \u20ac68 million. Siemens AG continues to defend itself against the expanded claim.\n\nAs previously reported, in May 2014, the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo initiated a lawsuit against Siemens Ltda. as well as other companies and several individuals claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL2.5 billion (approximately \u20ac471 million as of September 2023) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train refurbishment contracts entered into between 2008 and 2011. In January 2015, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted a lawsuit of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo and two customers against Siemens Ltda., Siemens AG and other companies and individuals claiming damages in an unspecified amount. In March 2015, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted a lawsuit of the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo against Siemens Ltda. and other companies claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL487 million (approximately \u20ac92 million as of September 2023) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train maintenance contracts entered into in 2000 and 2002. In September 2015, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted another lawsuit of the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo against Siemens Ltda. and other companies  claiming,  inter  alia,  damages  in  an  amount  of  BRL918  million  (approximately  \u20ac173  million  as  of  September  2023)  plus adjustments  for  inflation  and  related  interest  in  relation  to  train  maintenance  contracts  entered  into  in  2006  and  2007.  Siemens  is defending itself against these actions. It cannot be excluded that further significant damage claims will be brought by customers or the state against Siemens.\n\nAs previously reported, in June 2015, Siemens Ltda. appealed to the Supreme Court against a decision of a previous court to suspend Siemens Ltda. from participating in public tenders and signing contracts with public administrations in Brazil for a five year term based on alleged irregularities in calendar 1999 and 2004 in public tenders with the Brazilian Postal authority. In June 2018, the court accepted Siemens' appeal and declared the earlier instance decision as void. In June 2021, the court referred the case back to the court of first instance. In February 2018, the Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico in Brasilia filed a lawsuit based on the same set of facts, mainly claiming the exclusion of Siemens Ltda. from public tenders for a ten year term. Siemens Ltda. is defending itself against the lawsuit. Siemens Ltda. is currently not excluded from participating in public tenders.\n\n## NOTE 23 Additional disclosures on financial instruments\n\nThe following table discloses the carrying amounts of each category of financial assets and financial liabilities:\n\n|                                                                            | Sep 30,   | Sep 30,   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                         | 2023      | 2022      |\n| Loans, receivables and other debt instruments measured at amortized cost 1 | 47,021    | 46,386    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                  | 10,084    | 10,465    |\n| Derivatives designated in a hedge accounting relationship                  | 1,466     | 2,701     |\n| Financial assets mandatorily measured at FVTPL 2                           | 1,578     | 2,368     |\n| Financial assets designated as measured at FVTPL 3                         | 136       | 154       |\n| Equity instruments measured at FVOCI 1                                     | 665       | 692       |\n| Financial assets                                                           | 60,950    | 62,766    |\n| Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost 4                         | 58,202    | 62,536    |\n| Derivatives not designated in a hedge accounting relationship 5            | 296       | 651       |\n| Derivatives designated in a hedge accounting relationship  5               | 1,282     | 1,249     |\n| Financial liabilities                                                      | 59,779    | 64,436    |\n\nCash and cash equivalents include \u20ac89 million and \u20ac164 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are not available for use by Siemens mainly due to minimum reserve requirements with banks.

No compensating effects from underlying transactions (e.g. firm commitments and forecast transactions) are considered.\n\nThe Company limits default risks resulting from derivative financial instruments by generally transacting with financial institutions with a minimum credit rating of investment grade.

Under this approach the Company-wide risks are aggregated centrally, and various derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency",

        "page_content": "swaps and options, are utilized to minimize such risks. Such a strategy does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The Company also accounts for foreign currency derivatives, which are embedded in sale and purchase contracts.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Company's operating units apply hedge accounting to certain significant forecast transactions and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Particularly, the Company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of variability of future cash flows resulting from forecast sales and purchases as well as firm commitments. The risk mainly results from contracts denominated in US$ both from Siemens' operating units entering into long-term contracts e.g. from the project business and from the standard product business. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the risk is hedged against the euro at an average rate of 1.2780 \u20ac/US$ and 1.2293 \u20ac/US$ (forward purchases of US$), respectively, and 1.1027 \u20ac/US$ and 1.0258 \u20ac/US$ (forward sales of US$), respectively. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the hedging transactions have an average remaining maturity until 2028 and 2027 (forward purchases of US$) as well as 2024 and 2023 (forward sales of US$), respectively.\n\nIncluded are Siemens' foreign currency forward contracts, entered into in fiscal 2021, to hedge foreign currency risks relating to US$10 billion (\u20ac10 billion) bonds granted to Siemens Healthineers, through which a synthetic Euro financing structure is achieved. It factually, also turns interest into \u20ac with volume weighted average interest rates of currently about 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Interest rate risk management\n\n## Derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship\n\nInterest rate risk management uses derivative financial instruments under a portfolio-based approach to manage interest risk actively. The approach does not qualify for hedge accounting. Gains and losses in connection with interest rate swap agreements are recorded in Other financial income (expenses), net. The interest rate risk management includes SFS business, for which the interest rate risk was formerly managed separately.\n\n## Cash flow hedges of floating-rate commercial papers\n\nIn September 2023, Siemens ended cash flow hedge accounting. Previously, Siemens applied cash flow hedge accounting to a revolving portfolio of floating-rate commercial papers of nominal US$200 million.\n\n## Fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt obligations\n\nUnder interest rate swap agreements outstanding in fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company agreed to pay a variable rate of interest multiplied by a notional principal amount, and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest multiplied by the same notional principal amount. These interest rate swap agreements offset future changes in interest rates designated as hedged risk on the fair value of the underlying fixed-rate debt obligations. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the carrying amounts of \u20ac13,164 million and \u20ac10,718 million,  respectively,  of  fixed-rate  debt  obligations  are  designated  in  fair  value  hedges,  including  \u20ac(876)  million  and  \u20ac(973)  million cumulative fair value hedge adjustments. Unamortized fair value hedge adjustments of \u20ac112 million and \u20ac169 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, relate to no longer applied hedge accounting. The amounts are amortized over the remaining term of the underlying debt, maturing until 2042. Carrying amount adjustments to debt of \u20ac(95) million and \u20ac1,273 million, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022 are included in Other financial income (expenses), net; the related swap agreements resulted in gains (losses) of \u20ac74 million and \u20ac(1,236) million, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022. Net cash receipts and payments relating to such interest rate swap agreements are recorded as interest expenses.\n\nThe Company had interest rate swap contracts to pay variable rates of interest of an average of 3.00% and (0.86% as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively and received fixed rates of interest (average rate of 1.81% and 1.07%, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively). The notional amount of indebtedness hedged as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 was \u20ac13,687 million and \u20ac11,719 million, respectively. This changed 33% and 26% of the Company's underlying notes and bonds from fixed interest rates into variable interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The notional amounts of these contracts mature at varying dates based on the maturity of the underlying hedged items. The net fair value of interest rate swap contracts (excluding accrued interest) used to hedge indebtedness as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 was \u20ac(844) million and \u20ac(959) million, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 25 Financial risk management\n\nIncreasing  market  fluctuations  may  result  in  significant  earnings  and  cash  flow  volatility  risk  for  Siemens.  The  Company's  operating business as well as its investment and financing activities are affected particularly by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. In order to optimize the allocation of financial resources across Siemens' segments and entities, as well as to achieve its aims, Siemens identifies, analyzes and manages the associated market risks. The Company seeks to manage and control these risks primarily through its regular operating and financing activities and uses derivative financial instruments when deemed appropriate.\n\nForeign currency exchange rate risk is quantified based on a sensitivity analysis. In order to quantify remaining market risks Siemens has implemented a system based on Value at Risk (VaR), which is also used for internal management of Corporate Treasury activities. The VaR figures  are  calculated  based  on  historical  volatilities  and  correlations  of  various  risk  factors,  a  ten  day  holding  period,  and  a  99.5% confidence level.\n\nActual results that are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income may differ  substantially  from  VaR  figures  due  to  fundamental  conceptual  differences.  While  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are prepared in accordance with IFRS, the VaR figures are the output of a model with a purely financial perspective and represent the potential financial loss, which will not be exceeded within ten days with a probability of 99.5%. Although VaR is an important tool for measuring market risk, the assumptions on which the model is based give rise to some limitations including the following. A ten day holding period assumes that it is possible to dispose of the underlying positions within this period. This may not be valid during continuing periods of illiquid markets. A 99.5% confidence level means that there is a 0.5% statistical",

The use of historical data as a basis for estimating the statistic behavior of the relevant markets and finally determining the possible range of the future outcomes on the basis of this statistic behavior may not always cover all possible scenarios, especially those of an exceptional nature.\n\nAny market sensitive instruments, including equity and interest-bearing investments that our Company's pension plans hold are not included in the following quantitative and qualitative disclosures.\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rate risk\n\n## Transaction risk\n\nEach Siemens unit conducting businesses with international counterparties leading to future cash flows denominated in a currency other than its functional currency is exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the ordinary course of business, Siemens units are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Foreign currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respective currencies as well as production activities and other contributions along the value chain in the local markets.\n\nOperating  units  are  prohibited  from  borrowing  or  investing  in  foreign  currencies  on  a  speculative  basis.  Intercompany  financing  or investments of operating units are preferably carried out in their functional currency or on a hedged basis.\n\nAccording to the Company policy, Siemens units are responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. Foreign currency transaction exposure of Siemens units from contracted business and cash balances in foreign currency is generally hedged approximately by 100% with Corporate Treasury. Foreign currency transaction exposure of Siemens units from planned business above defined thresholds has to be hedged with Corporate Treasury within a band of 75% to 100% for a hedging period of at least three months.\n\nGenerally, the operating units conclude their hedging activities internally with Corporate Treasury. By applying a cost-optimizing portfolio approach, Corporate Treasury itself hedges foreign currency exchange rate risks with external counterparties and limits them.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of net income and equity to a reasonably possible change in the euro versus the most important currency exchange rates compared to the respective year-end exchange rates. The analysis does not include effects of foreign currency  translation.  The  effect  on  net  income  is  due  to  changes  in  the  fair  values  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  including  nondesignated foreign currency derivatives and embedded derivatives. The effect on equity is due to changes in the fair values of forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. In fiscal 2023, the sensitivity of net income with regard to the U.S. dollar decreased compared to the prior year mainly due to a decrease of monetary assets and liabilities and a higher hedge ratio. The sensitivity of equity with regard to the U.S. dollar decreased due to a decline in the nominal amount of U.S. dollar forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.\n\n|             |                     | Sep 30, 2023   | Sep 30, 2023   | Sep 30, 2023   | Sep 30, 2022   | Sep 30, 2022   | Sep 30, 2022   |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| (in Mio. \u20ac) | Change in \u20ac  versus | USD            | GBP            | CNY            | USD            | GBP            | CNY            |\n| Net income  | +5%                 | 27             | 15             | (3)            | 122            | 22             | (3)            |\n|             | (5)%                | (27)           | (15)           | 3              | (122)          | (22)           | 3              |\n| Equity      | +5%                 | (3)            | 62             | 19             | 71             | 72             | 12             |\n|             | (5)%                | 3              | (62)           | (19)           | (71)           | (72)           | (12)           |\n\n## Translation risk\n\nMany Siemens units are located outside the Eurozone. Because the financial reporting currency of Siemens is the euro, the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into euro for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. To consider the effects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the general assumption is that investments in foreign-based operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous. Effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset amounts into euro are reflected in the Company's consolidated equity position.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different. In order to manage the Company's position with regard to interest rate risk, interest income and interest expenses, Corporate Treasury performs a comprehensive corporate interest rate risk management by using fixed or variable interest rates from bond issuances and derivative financial instruments when appropriate. The interest rate risk is mitigated by managing interest rate risk within an integrated Asset Liability Management approach and results primarily from funding in the U.S. dollar, British pound and euro. This includes SFS business, for which the interest rate risk was formerly managed separately.\n\nIf  there  are  no  conflicting  country-specific  regulations,  all  Siemens  operating  units  generally  obtain  any  required  financing  through Corporate Treasury in the form of loans or intercompany clearing accounts. The same concept is adopted for deposits of cash generated by the units.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the VaR relating to the interest rate was \u20ac683 million and \u20ac864 million. The decrease was driven mainly by a decrease in interest rate sensitivity for the U.S. dollar and a lower interest rate volatility for the euro.",

Siemens follows a deliberated financing policy that is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion. Siemens mitigates liquidity risk  by  the  implementation  of  effective  working  capital  and  cash  management,  arranged  credit  facilities  with  highly  rated  financial institutions, via a debt issuance program and via a global multi-currency commercial paper program. Liquidity risk may also be mitigated by the Siemens Bank GmbH, which increases the flexibility of depositing cash or refinancing.\n\nIn addition, Siemens constantly monitors funding options available in the capital markets, as well as trends in the availability and costs of such funding, with a view to maintaining financial flexibility and limiting repayment risks.\n\nThe following table reflects our contractually fixed pay-offs for settlement, repayments and interest. The disclosed expected undiscounted net cash outflows from derivative financial liabilities are determined based on each particular settlement date of an instrument and based on the earliest date on which Siemens could be required to pay. Cash outflows for financial liabilities (including interest) without fixed amount or timing are based on the conditions existing at September 30, 2023.\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                   | 2024   | 2025   | 2026 to  2028   | Fiscal year  2029 and  thereafter   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities |        |        |                 |                                     |\n| Notes and bonds                      | 6,598  | 4,642  | 14,599          | 24,763                              |\n| Loans from banks                     | 820    | 1,308  | 159             | 21                                  |\n| Other financial indebtedness         | 519    | 2      | 36              | -                                   |\n| Lease liabilities                    | 753    | 609    | 982             | 918                                 |\n| Trade payables                       | 10,107 | 21     | 3               | -                                   |\n| Other financial liabilities          | 1,134  | 186    | 170             | 8                                   |\n| Derivative financial liabilities     | 760    | 307    | 355             | 262                                 |\n| Credit guarantees 1                  | 411    | -      | -               | -                                   |\n| Irrevocable loan commitments 2       | 3,370  | 325    | 156             | 6                                   |\n\n- \u00b2 A considerable portion result from asset-based lending transactions meaning that the respective loans can only be drawn after sufficient collateral has been provided by the borrower.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is defined as an unexpected loss in financial instruments if the contractual partner is failing to discharge its obligations in full and on time or if the value of collateral declines.\n\nSiemens provides its customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing particularly in connection with large projects. Hence, credit risks are determined by the solvency of the debtors, the recoverability of the collaterals, the success of projects we invested in and the global economic development.\n\nThe effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a core competency of our risk management system. In this context, Siemens has implemented a binding credit policy.\n\nSiemens maintains a Credit Risk Intelligence Unit to which numerous operating units from the Siemens Group regularly transfer business partner data as a basis for a centralized internal rating and credit limit recommendation process. Due to the identification, quantification and active management of credit risks, this increases credit risk transparency.\n\nRatings and individually defined credit limits are based on generally accepted rating methodologies, with information obtained from customers, external rating agencies, data service providers and Siemens' credit default experiences. Internal ratings consider appropriate forward-looking  information  relevant  to  the  specific  financial  instrument  like  expected  changes  in  the  debtor's  financial  position, ownership, management or operational risks, as well as broader forward-looking information, such as expected macroeconomic, industryrelated and competitive developments. The ratings also consider a country-specific risk component derived from external country credit ratings. Ratings and credit limits for financial institutions as well as Siemens' public and private customers, which are determined by internal  risk  assessment  specialists,  are  continuously  updated  and  considered  for  investments  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  in determining the conditions under which direct or indirect financing will be offered to customers.\n\nAn exposure is considered defaulted if the debtor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit obligations. A range of internally defined events trigger a default rating, including the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, receivables being more than 90 days past due, or a default rating by an external rating agency.\n\nTo analyze and monitor credit risks, the Company applies various systems and processes. A main element is a central IT application that processes data from operating units together with rating and default information and calculates an estimate, which may be used as a basis for individual bad debt provisions. Additionally, qualitative information is considered to particularly incorporate the latest developments.\n\nThe carrying amount is the maximum exposure to a financial asset's credit risk, without taking account of any collateral. Collateral reduces the valuation allowance to the extent it mitigates credit risk. Collateral needs to be specific, identifiable and legally enforceable to be taken into account. Those collaterals are mostly held in the portfolio of SFS.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, collateral of \u20ac863 million and \u20ac1,444 million, respectively, relate to financial assets measured at fair value.  Those  collaterals  are  provided  in  connection  with  netting  agreements  for  derivatives  providing  protection  from  the  risk  of  a counterparty's  insolvency.  As  of  September  30,  2023  and  2022,  collateral  held  for  credit-impaired  receivables  from  finance  leases amounted to \u20ac66 million and \u20ac53 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, collateral held for financial assets measured at amortized cost amounted to \u20ac3,918 million and \u20ac3,817 million, respectively, including \u20ac135 million and \u20ac108 million, respectively, for",

These investments are monitored based on their current market value, affected primarily by fluctuations on the volatile technology-related markets worldwide. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the market value of Siemens' portfolio was \u20ac182 million and \u20ac339 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the VaR relating to the equity price was \u20ac26 million and \u20ac74 million.\n\n## NOTE 26 Share-based payment\n\nShare-based payment awards may be settled in newly issued shares of capital stock of Siemens AG, in treasury shares or in cash. Sharebased payment awards may forfeit if the employment of the beneficiary terminates prior to the expiration of the vesting period. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, expense from equity-settled awards on a continuing basis are \u20ac444 million and \u20ac377 million; cash-settled awards on a continuing basis resulted in expenses of \u20ac18 million and gains of \u20ac12 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022. Included is expense of \u20ac113 million and \u20ac110 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, relating to Siemens Healthineers plans. Siemens Healthineers plans are largely similar to Siemens' plans, except for granting Siemens Healthineers AG shares.\n\n## Stock awards\n\nStock awards granted by Siemens are distinguished between a) subject to performance conditions and b) no performance conditions. Stock awards entitle the beneficiaries to Siemens shares without payment of consideration at the end of the respective vesting period.\n\n## Stock awards subject to performance conditions\n\nThe  Company  grants  stock  awards  subject  to  performance  conditions  to  members  of  the  Managing  Board,  members  of  the  senior management and other eligible employees. The vesting period for awards granted to members of the senior management and other eligible  employees is  three  years  respectively  four  years  for  awards  granted  prior  to  fiscal  2022.  Awards  granted  to  members  of  the Managing Board are subject to a four year vesting period.\n\nFor stock awards subject to performance conditions, 80% of the target amount is linked to the relative total shareholder return of Siemens compared to the total shareholder return of the MSCI World Industrials sector index (TSR-Target); the remaining 20% are linked to a Siemens internal sustainability target considering environmental, social and governance targets (ESG-Target). The annual target amount for  stock  awards  up  to  and  including  tranche  2019  is  linked  to  the  share  price  performance  of  Siemens  relative  to  the  share  price performance of five important competitors. The target attainment for each individual performance criteria ranges between 0% and 200%. Settlement of the awards is in shares corresponding to the actual target attainment.\n\n## Commitments to members of the Managing Board\n\nFair values of TSR-related stock awards granted are \u20ac7 million and \u20ac6 million, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022, calculated by applying a valuation model. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, inputs to that model include an expected weighted volatility of Siemens shares of 26.71% and 24.41%, respectively, and a Siemens share price of \u20ac130.68 and \u20ac153.34. Expected volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities. The model applies a risk-free interest rate of up to 2.76% and (0.15)% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, and an expected dividend yield of 3.25% in fiscal 2023 and 2.61% in fiscal 2022. Assumptions relating to correlations between the Siemens share price and the development of the MSCI index were derived from historic observations of share price and index changes. The fair value of the ESG component of \u20ac112.39 and \u20ac135.25 per share in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, was determined as Siemens' share price, less the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period.\n\n## Commitments to members of the senior management and other eligible employees\n\nIn fiscal 2023 and 2022, 1,784,892 and 1,459,182 equity-settled stock awards were granted relating to the TSR-Target with a fair value of \u20ac114 million and \u20ac106 million, respectively. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, 446,237 and 365,610 equity-settled stock awards were granted relating to the ESG-Target with a fair value of \u20ac54 million and \u20ac51 million, respectively.\n\nThe fair value of stock awards granted in fiscal 2023 and 2022 (TSR-related) was calculated by applying a valuation model.

The shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter. Plan participants receive the right to one Siemens share without payment of consideration (matching share) for every three investment shares continuously held over a period of about three years (vesting period) provided the plan participant has been continuously employed by Siemens until the end of the vesting period.\n\n## Monthly Investment Plan\n\nUnder the Monthly Investment Plan employees other than senior managers may invest a specified part of their compensation in Siemens shares on a monthly basis over a period of twelve months. Shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date once a month. If the Managing Board decides that shares acquired under the Monthly Investment Plan are transferred to the Share Matching Plan, plan participants will receive the right to matching shares under the same conditions applying to the Share Matching Plan described above with a vesting period of about two years. The Managing Board decided that shares acquired under the tranches issued in fiscal 2022 and 2021 are transferred to the Share Matching Plan as of February 2023 and February 2022, respectively.\n\n## Base Share Program\n\nUnder the Base Share Program employees of Siemens AG and participating domestic Siemens companies may invest a fixed amount of their compensation in Siemens shares, sponsored by Siemens. The shares are bought at market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter and grant the right to receive matching shares under the same conditions applying to the Share Matching Plan described above. Siemens' contributions to the Base Share Program recognized as expense were \u20ac23 and \u20ac24 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively\n\n## Resulting Matching Shares:\n\n|                                  | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                  | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Outstanding, beginning of period | 1,255,825     | 1,389,016     |\n| Granted                          | 655,177       | 557,839       |\n| Vested and fulfilled             | (573,468)     | (573,440)     |\n| Forfeited                        | (68,404)      | (64,030)      |\n| Settled                          | (23,663)      | (53,561)      |\n| Outstanding, end of period       | 1,245,467     | 1,255,825     |\n\nThe weighted average fair value of matching shares granted in fiscal 2023 and 2022 of \u20ac107.60 and \u20ac121.35 per share, respectively, was determined as Siemens' share price, less the present value of expected dividends; non-vesting conditions were taken into account.",

        "page_content": "## Description of reportable segments\n\nDigital Industries offers a comprehensive product portfolio and system solutions for automation used in discrete and process industries, complemented by product lifecycle and data-driven services,\n\nSmart Infrastructure offers products, systems, solutions, services and software to support a sustainable transition from fossil to renewable energy sources, as well as a transition to smarter, more sustainable buildings and communities,\n\nMobility combines  all  Siemens  businesses  in  the  area  of  rail  passenger  and  rail  freight  transportation,  including  rail  vehicles,  rail automation systems, rail electrification systems, digital and cloud-based solutions and related services,\n\nSiemens Healthineers provides healthcare solutions and services. It develops, manufactures, and sells a diverse range of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic products and services to healthcare providers.\n\nSiemens Financial Services provides financing solutions to Siemens' customers and other companies via debt and equity investments, offering  leasing,  lending,  working  capital  and  structured  financing  solutions,  equipment  and  project  financing  and  financial  advisory services.\n\n## Portfolio Companies (POC)\n\nPortfolio  Companies comprise  businesses  which  deliver  a  broad  range  of  customized  and  application-specific  products,  software, solutions, systems and services for different industries including oil and gas, chemical, mining, cement, logistics, energy, marine, water and fiber.\n\n## Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nSiemens Energy Investment -  includes our investment in Siemens Energy accounted for using the equity method, and previously, a smaller investment in connection with Siemens Energy sold in fiscal 2022.\n\nSiemens Real Estate (SRE) - Siemens Real Estate is responsible for uniform and comprehensive management of Company real estate worldwide (except for Siemens Healthineers) and supports the industrial businesses and corporate activities with customer-specific real estate solutions.\n\nInnovation - mainly includes results from our units Technology and Next47.\n\nGovernance - primarily includes Siemens brand fees and governance costs, group managing costs, IT and corporate services.\n\nCentrally carried pension expense - includes the Company's pension related income (expense) not allocated to the segments, POC or Siemens Real Estate.\n\nFinancing, eliminations and other items - comprise activities of Advanta and Global Business Services, results from corporate projects, equity interests and activities generally intended for closure as well as activities remaining from divestments, consolidation of transactions within the segments, certain reconciliation and reclassification items as well as central financing activities. It also includes interest income and expense, such as, for example, interest not allocated to segments or POC (referred to as financing interest), interest related to central financing activities or resulting consolidation and reconciliation effects on interest.\n\n## Measurement - Segments\n\nAccounting policies for Segment information are generally the same as those used for the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment information  is  disclosed  for  continuing  operations.  For  internal  and  segment  reporting  purposes,  intercompany  lease  transactions, however, are classified as operating leases by the lessor and are accounted for off-balance sheet by the lessee (except for intercompany leases with Siemens Healthineers as lessees). Intersegment transactions are based on market prices.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue includes revenue from contracts with customers and revenue from leasing activities. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, lease revenue is \u20ac1,004 million and \u20ac1,104 million, respectively. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, Digital industries recognized \u20ac5,067 million and \u20ac4,691 million revenue, respectively, from its software business, Smart Infrastructure recognized \u20ac4,243 million and \u20ac3,856 million in its service business. Revenues of Mobility are mainly derived from construction-type business.\n\n## Profit\n\nSiemens' Managing Board is responsible for assessing the performance of the segments (chief operating decision maker). The Company's profitability measure of the segments except for SFS is earnings before interest, certain pension costs, income taxes and amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations as determined by the chief operating decision maker (Profit). The major categories of items excluded from Profit are described below.\n\nInterest income (expenses) are excluded from Profit. Decision-making regarding financing is typically made at the corporate level.\n\nDecisions on essential pension items are made centrally. Accordingly, Profit primarily includes amounts related to service cost of pension plans only, while all other regularly recurring pension related costs are included in reconciliations in line item Centrally carried pension expense.\n\nAmortization  expenses  of  intangible  assets  acquired  in  business  combinations  are  not  part  of  Profit.  Furthermore,  income  taxes  are excluded from Profit since income tax is subject to legal structures, which typically do not correspond to the structure of the segments. The effect of certain litigation and compliance issues is excluded from Profit, if such items are not indicative of performance. This may also be the case for items that refer to more than one reportable segment, SRE and (or) POC or have a corporate or central character. Costs for support functions are primarily allocated to the segments.",

        "page_content": "## Profit of the segment SFS\n\nIn contrast to performance measurement principles applied to other segments, interest income and expenses are included, since interest is an important source of revenue and expense of SFS.\n\n## Asset measurement principles\n\nManagement determined Assets (Net capital employed) as a measure to assess capital intensity of the segments except for SFS. Its definition corresponds to the Profit measure except for amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations which are not part of Profit, however, the related intangible assets are included in the segments' Assets. Segment Assets is based on Total assets of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, primarily excluding intragroup financing receivables, tax related assets and assets of discontinued operations, since the corresponding positions are excluded from Profit. The remaining assets are reduced by noninterest-bearing liabilities other than tax related liabilities, e.g. trade payables, to derive Assets. In contrast, Assets of SFS is Total assets. In individual cases assets of Mobility include project-specific intercompany financing of long-term projects. Assets of Siemens Healthineers include real estate, while real estate of all other segments is carried at SRE.\n\n## Orders\n\nOrders are determined principally as estimated revenue of accepted purchase orders for which enforceable rights and obligations exist as well as subsequent order value changes and adjustments, excluding letters of intent. To determine orders, Siemens considers termination rights and customer's creditworthiness.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, and 2022, order backlog totaled \u20ac111 billion and \u20ac102 billion (continuing operations); thereof Digital Industries \u20ac11 billion and \u20ac14 billion, Smart Infrastructure \u20ac16 billion and \u20ac15 billion, Mobility \u20ac45 billion and \u20ac36 billion and Siemens Healthineers \u20ac34 billion and \u20ac34 billion. In fiscal 2024, Siemens expects to convert approximately \u20ac43 billion of the September 30, 2023 order backlog into revenue; thereof at Digital Industries approximately \u20ac8 billion, Smart Infrastructure approximately \u20ac10 billion, Mobility approximately \u20ac11 billion and Siemens Healthineers approximately \u20ac11 billion.\n\n## Free cash flow definition\n\nFree cash flow of the segments constitutes cash flows from operating activities less additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Except for SFS, it excludes financing interest, except for cases where interest on qualifying assets is capitalized or classified as contract costs; it also excludes income tax as well as certain other payments and proceeds. Free cash flow of SFS includes related financing interest payments and proceeds; income tax payments and proceeds of SFS are excluded. In individual cases, free cash flow of Mobility includes project-specific intercompany financing of long-term projects.\n\n## Amortization, depreciation and impairments\n\nAmortization,  depreciation  and  impairments  includes  depreciation  and  impairments  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  as  well  as amortization and impairments of intangible assets each net of reversals of impairment.\n\n## Measurement - POC and Siemens Real Estate\n\nPOC follows the measurement principles of the segments except for SFS. Siemens Real Estate applies the measurement principles of SFS.\n\n## Additional segment information\n\nThe orderly wind down of business activities in Russia resulted in losses in Profit of Mobility of \u20ac0.6 billion in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, subsequent to the wind down, Profit of Mobility carried related gains of \u20ac153 million, which mainly stem from the reversal of provisions and obligations as well as from the reversal of write downs and the sale of inventories.\n\n## Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Profit\n\n|                                                                     | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                  | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Siemens Energy Investment                                           | 668           | (2,911)       |\n| Siemens Real Estate                                                 | 67            | 118           |\n| Innovation                                                          | (195)         | (190)         |\n| Governance                                                          | (451)         | (582)         |\n| Centrally carried pension expense                                   | (104)         | (113)         |\n| Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations | (865)         | (990)         |\n| Financing, eliminations and other items                             | (256)         | (474)         |\n| Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements                 | (1,135)       | (5,141)       |\n\nIn fiscal 2023 and 2022, Financing, eliminations and other items includes a loss of \u20ac167 million and \u20ac308 million, respectively, mainly due to measuring our investment in Thoughtworks Holding, Inc. at fair value through profit and loss at fiscal year-end.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, and 2022, Profit of SFS includes interest income of \u20ac1,942 million and \u20ac1,399 million, respectively and interest expenses of \u20ac985 million and \u20ac428 million, respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditor's report\n\nTo Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich\n\n## Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report\n\n## Opinions\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, the consolidated statements of financial position as of September 30, 2023, the consolidated statements of cash flows and changes in equity for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including  a  summary  of  significant  accounting  policies.  In  addition,  we  have  audited  the  group  management  report  of  Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022  to  September  30,  2023.  In  accordance  with  the  German  legal  requirements,  we  have  not  audited  chapter  11  'EU  Taxonomy disclosure'  of  the  group  management  report,  the  sections  '8.5.1  Internal  Control  System  (ICS)  and  ERM'  and  '8.5.2  Compliance Management System (CMS)' in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report as well as the content of the Corporate Governance Statement which is published on the website stated in the combined management report. In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- \u00b7 the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  comply,  in  all  material  respects,  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB ['Handelsgesetzbuch': German Commercial Code] as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as of September 30, 2023 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, and\n- \u00b7 the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the group management report does not cover chapter 11 'EU Taxonomy disclosure' of the group management report, the sections '8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM' and '8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)' in chapter 8.5 of the group management report and the content of the Corporate Governance Statement.\n\nPursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n## Basis for the opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as 'EU Audit Regulation') and in compliance with German Generally Accepted  Standards  for  Financial  Statement  Audits  promulgated  by  the  Institut  der  Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer  [Institute  of  Public  Auditors  in Germany] (IDW). We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report' section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Art. 10 (2) f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art. 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n## Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nBelow, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:\n\n## Revenue recognition on construction-type contracts\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The Group conducts a significant portion of its business under construction-type contracts, particularly in the Mobility business. Revenue from long-term construction-type contracts is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, generally over time under the percentage-of-completion method. We consider the accounting for construction-type contracts to be an area posing a significant risk of material misstatement (including the potential  risk  of  management  override  of  internal  controls)  and  accordingly  a  key  audit  matter,  because  management's  assessments significantly impact the determination of the extent of progress towards completion. These assessments include, in particular, the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill contractually defined obligations, total estimated contract costs, remaining costs to completion and total estimated contract revenues, as well as contract risks including technical, political, regulatory, legal and supply chain risks.",

    {
        "page_content": "Revenues, total estimated contract costs and profit recognition may deviate significantly from original estimates based on new knowledge about cost overruns and changes in project scope over the term of a construction-type contract.\n\nThe effects of current geopolitical and macroeconomic developments on the project business, such as delays in project execution, price increases or disruptions in supply chains and their accounting treatment were taken into account during our audit.\n\nAuditor's response: As part of our audit, we obtained an understanding of the Group's internally established methods, processes and control mechanisms for project management in the bid and execution phase of construction-type contracts. In this regard, we assessed the design and operating effectiveness of the accounting-related internal controls in the project business by obtaining an understanding of  business  transactions  specific  to  construction-type  contracts,  from  the  initiation  of  the  transaction  through  presentation  in  the consolidated financial statements. We also tested controls addressing the timely assessment of changes in cost estimates, the timely and complete recognition of such changes in the project calculation as well as their accounting treatment.\n\nAs  part  of  our  substantive  audit  procedures,  which  particularly  involved  project  reviews,  we  evaluated  management's  estimates  and assumptions based on a risk-based selection of a sample of contracts. Our sample primarily included projects that are subject to significant future uncertainties and risks, such as projects with complex safety/technical and regulatory requirements or projects with a large portion of materials and services to be provided by suppliers or consortium partners, fixed-price or turnkey projects, cross-border projects and projects with changes in cost estimates, delays and/or low or negative margins.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, review of the contracts and their terms and conditions including contractually agreed partial deliveries and services, termination rights, penalties for delay and breach of contract, liquidated damages as well as joint and several liability.  In  order  to  evaluate  whether  revenues  were recognized on an accrual basis for the selected projects, we analyzed revenues attributable to the fiscal year and corresponding cost of sales to be recognized in the statement of income considering the extent of progress towards completion and examined the accounting for the associated items in the statement of financial position.\n\nFor  this  we  also  assessed  the  accounting  for  contractually  agreed  options,  contract  amendments  or  contract  terminations  (including related pending legal proceedings) also in relation to previous construction-type contracts with Russian customers. We also assessed the recognition requirements of reimbursement claims.\n\nWe  further  performed  inquiries  of  project  management  (both  commercial  and  technical  project  managers)  with  respect  to  the development of the projects, the reasons for deviations between planned and actual costs, the current estimated costs to complete the projects, and management's assessments on probabilities that contract risks and claims from joint and several liability will materialize.\n\nTo identify anomalies in the development of margins and other project KPIs, we also applied data analysis procedures. In designing our audit procedures, we also considered results from project audits conducted by the internal audit function. Furthermore, we obtained evidence from third parties for selected projects (e.g., project acceptance documentation, contractual terms and conditions, and lawyers' confirmations regarding alleged breaches of contract and asserted claims) and inspected the status of projects at plant sites. Due to the large contract volume and risk profile, our audit procedures focused on large contracts for delivery of high-speed and commuter trains.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to revenue recognition on construction-type contracts.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for construction-type contracts,  refer  to  Note  2  Material  accounting  policies  and  critical  accounting  estimates  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements. With respect to contract assets and liabilities as well as provisions for order related losses and risks, refer to Note 10 Contract assets  and  liabilities,  Note  18  Provisions  and  Note  21  Commitments  and  contingencies  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## Valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AG\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Since the spin-off of Siemens Energy AG in September 2020, Siemens AG has held a 35.1% stake in the listed Siemens Energy AG which was reduced to 25.1% due to capital measures at Siemens Energy AG and the contribution of shares in Siemens Energy AG to the Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. in fiscal year 2023. The investment is accounted for as an associate, applying the equity method in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. As of June 30, 2022, an impairment was recognized on the investment. During the first six months of the financial year 2023, the market capitalization of the investment was mostly higher than the value at the time of the impairment. As of March 31, 2023, the latter was significantly exceeded. As a result, an impairment reversal was made in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, in the amount of the increase in the stock market price since the date of the impairment until March 31, 2023. In addition, Siemens Energy AG acquired additional shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. in fiscal year 2023. This led to a reduction in equity in the consolidated financial statements of Siemens Energy AG. The recognition of Siemens' share in this equity transaction resulted in a reduction of the carrying amount of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, which was recognized directly in Siemens' equity. As of September 30, 2023, the pro rata market value of the investment was above the book value.\n\nDue to the judgments and estimates by management in the analyses and assessments with regards to possible impairments or reversals of impairments as well as the overall material implications for the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group and the related significant risk of material misstatement, the assessment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG is one of the key audit matters.\n\nAuditor's response: As part of our audit procedures in relation to management's assessment regarding the valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, we examined the methods and processes defined internally for the identification of indicators for a reversal of an impairment and thus the timing of a possible reversal of an impairment as well as the measurement of a reversal of an impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG.\n\nWith regards to the assessment of whether there are indications for a reversal of an impairment, in particular regarding the interpretation of a possible significant increase of the fair value, we evaluated management's assessment made on a quarterly and year-end basis as well as management's judgements and estimates contained therein and also considered external evidence on credit ratings, stock market prices, analysts' assessments and observable valuation indicatorsin this regard. In addition, we evaluated the calculation of the reversal of the impairment as of March 31, 2023.",

        "page_content": "In order to assess the valuation of the investment in fiscal year 2023, we also considered the effects for Siemens AG from the acquisition of the shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A. by Siemens Energy AG, the capital increase of Siemens Energy AG and the contribution of shares in Siemens Energy AG to the Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. by Siemens AG.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding the investment in Siemens Energy AG, and the reversal of the impairment, the effects of the other transactions described above as well as the events affecting Siemens Energy AG after the balance sheet date.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations regarding the valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AG as of September 30, 2023.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for investments in associates,  refer  to  Note  2  Material  accounting  policies  and  critical  accounting  estimates  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements. Details on the reversal of the impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG and the other described transactions are presented in Note 4 Interests in other entities. Regarding the subsequent events relating to the investment in Siemens Energy AG refer to Note 34 Subsequent events.\n\n## Provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: We consider the accounting for provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, including allegations of corruption and antitrust violations to be a key audit matter. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the recognition and measurement of the respective provision and, accordingly, on assets, liabilities and financial performance. The proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they involve complex legal issues and accordingly, considerable management judgment, in particular when determining whether and in what amount a provision is required to account for the risks.\n\nAuditor's response: During our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, we examined the processes implemented by Siemens for identifying, assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings. To determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted are known and to assess management's estimates of the expected cash outflows, our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the Group entrusted with these matters, obtaining written statements from in-house legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their  probability,  obtaining  confirmations  from  external  legal  advisors  and  evaluating  internal  statements  concerning  the  accounting treatment in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered.\n\nWe further considered alleged or substantiated non-compliance with legal provisions, official regulations (including sanctions) and internal company policies by inspecting internal and external statements on specific matters, obtaining written statements from external legal advisors, and by inquiring of the compliance organization. In this regard, among other procedures, we evaluated the conduct and results of internal investigations by inspecting internal reports and the measures taken to remediate identified weaknesses, and assessed on this basis whether management's evaluation of any risks to be accounted for in the consolidated financial statements is plausible.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the disclosures on proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for provisions, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. With respect to proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, refer to Note 22 Legal proceedings.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Siemens operates in numerous countries with different local tax legislation. The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions and was therefore a key audit matter. In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the measurement and completeness of deferred tax liabilities.\n\nAuditor's  response: With  the  assistance  of  internal  tax  specialists  who  have  knowledge  of  relevant  local  tax  law,  we  examined  the processes installed by management for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax positions.\n\nIn the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions, we evaluated whether management's assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year 2023, which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions, was in compliance with tax law. In particular, this includes the tax implications arising from cross border matters, such as the determination of transfer prices, the results of tax field audits, the acquisition or disposal of company shares  and  corporate  (intragroup)  restructuring  activities.  In  order  to  assess  measurement  and  completeness,  we  also  obtained confirmations from external tax advisors. Further, we evaluated management's assessments with respect to the prospects of success of appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the Siemens tax department and by considering current tax case law.\n\nIn assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we above all analyzed management's assumptions with respect to tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income and compared them to internal business plans. In the course of our audit procedures regarding deferred tax liabilities, we examined in particular the assumptions regarding reinvestment of subsidiaries' retained profits for an indefinite period and assessed these taking into account dividend planning.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes.",

In addition, the other information comprises parts to be included in the Annual Report, of which we received a version prior to issuing this auditor's report, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 the Responsibility Statement (to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report),\n- \u00b7 the Responsibility Statement (to the Annual Financial Statements and the Management Report),\n- \u00b7 the Five-Year Summary,\n- \u00b7 the Compensation Report,\n- \u00b7 the Report of the Supervisory Board,\n- \u00b7 Notes and forward-looking statements,\n\nbut not the consolidated financial statements and the annual financial statements, not the disclosures of the combined management report whose content is audited and not our auditor's reports as well as not our auditor's report on a limited assurance engagement on the EU Taxonomy disclosure.\n\nOur opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- \u00b7 is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- \u00b7 otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the consolidated financial statements and the group management report\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the IASB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as management has determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.  It  also  has  the  responsibility  for  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern.  In  addition,  management  is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for  such  arrangements  and  measures  (systems)  as  management  has  considered  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  a  group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation as well as in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated",

We also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the  consolidated  financial  statements  present  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that  the  consolidated  financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the IASB;\n- \u00b7 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- \u00b7 perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n## Other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## Report on the assurance on the electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report prepared for publication purposes in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the rendering of  the  consolidated financial statements and the group management report (hereinafter the 'ESEF documents') contained in the file SIEMENS\\_2023.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format ('ESEF format'). In accordance with German legal requirements, this assurance work extends only to the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report into the ESEF format and therefore relates neither to the information contained within these renderings nor to any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\nIn our opinion, the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the file identified above and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format. Beyond this assurance opinion and our audit opinions on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the accompanying group management report for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 contained in the 'Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report' above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these renderings or on the other information contained in the file identified above.",

Our responsibility in accordance therewith is further described in the 'Group auditor's responsibilities for the assurance work on the ESEF documents' section. Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality Management 1: Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QS 1).\n\n## Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF documents\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents including the electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements  and  the  group  management  report  in  accordance  with  Sec.  328  (1)  Sentence  4  No.  1  HGB  and  for  the  tagging  of  the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Sec. 328 (1) Sentence 4 No. 2 HGB.\n\nIn  addition,  management  is  responsible  for  such  internal  control  as  it  has  determined  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  ESEF documents that are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\n## Group auditor's responsibilities for the assurance work on the ESEF documents\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion;\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the financial statements, on the technical specification for this file;\n- \u00b7 evaluate  whether  the  ESEF  documents  enable  an  XHTML  rendering  with  content  equivalent  to  the  audited  consolidated  financial statements and to the audited group management report;\n- \u00b7 evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Arts. 4 and 6 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the financial statements, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.\n\n## Further information pursuant to Art. 10 of the EU Audit Regulation\n\nWe were elected as group auditor by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 9, 2023. We were engaged by the Supervisory Board on February 9, 2023.

The consolidated financial statements and the group management report converted to the ESEF format - including the versions to be published in the Unternehmensregister [German Company Register] - are merely electronic renderings of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report and do not take their place.

Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management considers necessary to enable the preparation of the EU Taxonomy disclosure that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (manipulation of the EU Taxonomy disclosure) or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, management has disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in the EU Taxonomy disclosure. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n\n## Independence and quality assurance of the audit firm\n\nWe have complied with the German professional requirements on independence as well as other professional conduct requirements.\n\nOur audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional pronouncements, in particular the BS WP/vBP ['Berufssatzung f\u00fcr Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer/vereidigte Buchpr\u00fcfer': Professional Charter for German Public Accountants/German Sworn Auditors]) in the exercise of their Profession and the IDW Standard on Quality Management issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW): Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QS 1), and accordingly maintains a comprehensive quality management system that includes documented policies and procedures with regard to compliance with professional ethical requirements, professional standards as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.\n\n## Responsibilities of the auditor\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the EU Taxonomy disclosure based on our assurance engagement.\n\nWe  conducted  our  assurance  engagement  in  accordance  with  the  International  Standard  on  Assurance  Engagements  (ISAE)  3000 (Revised): 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information' issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). This standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Company's EU Taxonomy disclosure is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as well as  the  interpretation  by  management  disclosed  in  the  EU  Taxonomy  disclosure.  In  a  limited  assurance  engagement,  the  procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the auditor.\n\nIn  the  course of our assurance engagement we have, among other things, performed the following assurance procedures and other activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Inquiries of relevant employees for the assessment of the process to identify the Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities,\n- \u00b7 Inquiries of the employees responsible for data capture and consolidation as well as the preparation of the EU Taxonomy disclosure about the reporting processes, the data capture and compilation methods as well as internal controls to the extent relevant for the limited assurance of the EU Taxonomy disclosure,\n- \u00b7 Identification of likely risks of material misstatement in the EU Taxonomy disclosure,\n- \u00b7 Analytical evaluation of data at the level of the Group and businesses as well as service and governance units,\n- \u00b7 Inquiries and inspection of documents relating to the collection and reporting of data,\n- \u00b7 Reconciliation of selected disclosures with the corresponding data in the consolidated financial statements and group management report,\n- \u00b7 Evaluation of the presentation of the EU Taxonomy disclosure.\n\nIn determining the disclosures in accordance with Art. 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, management is required to interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Notes to Annual Financial Statements\n\n## 3.1 General Disclosures\n\nSiemens AG has registered offices in Berlin and Munich, Germany. The Company is registered in the commercial register maintained by the local courts in Berlin Charlottenburg, Germany, under the entry number HRB 12300, and in Munich, Germany, under the entry number HRB 6684.\n\nThe  Annual  Financial  Statements  of  Siemens  AG  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  regulations  set  forth  in  the  German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG). Amounts are presented in millions of euros (\u20ac million). Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided.\n\n## 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles\n\nRevenue are proceeds from selling and leasing products, providing services and granting licenses, including licensing contracts for the use of the Siemens trademark.\n\nNegative interest from financial investments is presented as a deduction in interest income , and positive interest from borrowings as a deduction in interest expenses .\n\nIntangible assets acquired for consideration are capitalized at acquisition costs and amortized on a straight-line basis over a maximum of five years or, if longer, the contractually agreed useful life. Items are amortized on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition. The capitalization option for internally generated intangible assets is not used.\n\nAcquired goodwill is generally amortized systematically over the expected useful life of five to 15 years. The expected useful life is based on the expected use of the acquired businesses and is determined in particular by economic factors such as future growth and profit expectations, synergy effects and employee base.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment : The components of production costs are described in the context of the explanations for inventories. In general, property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method. In certain cases, the declining balance method is applied, whereby a switch is made from the declining balance to the straight-line method as soon as the latter results in higher depreciation expense. Items are depreciated on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition. Low-value non-current assets that are subject to wear and tear, movable, and capable of being used independently, are expensed immediately or capitalized and fully depreciated in the year of acquisition.\n\nUseful lives of property, plant and equipment\n\n| Factory and office buildings                | 20 to 50 years      |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Other buildings                             | 5 to 10 years       |\n| Technical equipment and machines            | mostly 10 years     |\n| Other equipment, plant and office equipment | 3 to 8 years        |\n| Equipment leased to others                  | mostly 3 to 5 years |\n\nSpecial  reserve  with  an  equity  portion includes  reserves  pursuant  to  Section  6b  of  the  German  Income  Tax  Act (Einkommensteuergesetz), recognized and transferred in fiscal years prior to the transition to regulations of the German Accounting Law Modernisation Act (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz).\n\nFinancial assets : Impairment losses are recognized if the decline in value is presumed to be other than temporary. This applies, if objective evidence, particularly events or changes in circumstances, indicate a significant or other than temporary decline in value. In case of an impairment in prior periods, a lower recognized value may not be maintained if the reasons for the impairment do no longer exist.\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of average acquisition or production costs and daily values. Production costs comprise, in addition to direct costs, an appropriate portion of production and material overheads and depreciation of property, plant and equipment. General administration expenses, expenses for social facilities, voluntary social costs and company pension scheme costs are not capitalized. Writedowns are recorded to cover inventory risks for reduced usability and technological obsolescence as well as in the context of loss-free valuation of unbilled contracts in construction-type and service businesses.\n\nAllowances on receivables are determined on the basis of the probability of default and country risks.\n\nDeferred tax assets for differences between valuations of balance sheet line items in accordance to commercial and tax law and tax loss carryforwards are recognized if a future tax benefit is expected. Deferred tax assets are netted with deferred tax liabilities. Recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities comprise temporary differences of assets, liabilities, and deferred items of entities forming part of the Siemens AG tax group and partnerships to the extent that the recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of assets, liabilities, or deferred items result in a deductible or taxable amount in the taxable profit (loss) of Siemens AG.\n\nOffsetting of assets and of income and expenses : Siemens AG measures assets at fair value that are designated as being held exclusively to settle specified pension obligations and obligations for early retirement ('Altersteilzeit') arrangements and which cannot be accessed by other creditors.\n\nPensions and similar commitments :  Siemens AG measures its pension obligations using the settlement amount calculated with the actuarial projected unit credit method on the basis of biometric probabilities. The discount rate used corresponds to the average market interest rate for instruments with an assumed remaining maturity of 15 years as published by German Federal Reserve Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank).",

        "page_content": "Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at the balance sheet date. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the pension provision is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting to a present value.\n\nAccording to the Act on the Improvement of Company Pensions (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der betrieblichen Altersversorgung), Siemens AG is secondarily liable for pension benefits provided under an indirect pension funding vehicle (mittelbarer Durchf\u00fchrungsweg). Siemens AG recognizes the underfunding in the item Provisions for pensions and similar commitments as far as the respective assets of the pension fund or of the pension and support fund (Pensions- und Unterst\u00fctzungskasse) do not cover the settlement amount of the respective pension obligations.\n\nOther provisions are recognized in an appropriate and sufficient amount to cover individual obligations for all identifiable risks relating to liabilities of uncertain timing and amount and for anticipated losses on onerous contracts, taking account of price and cost increases expected  to  arise  in  the  future.  Provisions  for  agreed  personnel  restructuring  measures  were  recognized  for  legal  and  constructive obligations. Significant provisions with a remaining term of more than one year are discounted using a discount rate which corresponds to  the  average  market  interest  rate  appropriate  for  the  remaining  term  of  the  obligations,  as  calculated  and  published  by  Deutsche Bundesbank.\n\nForeign currency translation : Receivables, other current assets, securities, cash and cash equivalents, provisions and liabilities (excluding advance  payments  received  on  orders)  as  well  as  commitments  and  contingencies  denominated  in  foreign  currency  are  generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Balance Sheet line items denominated in foreign currency which are part of a valuation unit used to hedge foreign currency risk are measured using the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date. Non-current assets and inventories acquired in foreign currency are generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date.\n\nGuarantees and other commitments : Siemens AG issues parent company guarantees, i.e. guarantees to ensure performance obligations incurred from the delivery of goods or provision of services by affiliated and long-term investee companies or their parent companies. For measurement purposes, the contract amount of the secured delivery or service agreement is reduced using the straight-line method over the planned term of the delivery or service agreement, unless there are reasons for a different risk assessment and an increased liability amount  ('risk-adequate  liability  amount').  Credit  lines  included  in  the  guarantee  obligations  in  the  context  of  financing  affiliated companies are recognized at their nominal amount.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used by Siemens AG almost exclusively for hedging purposes and - if the relevant conditions are met - are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. When a valuation unit is created, changes in values or cash flows from the hedged item and hedging contract are compared. A provision is recognized only for a negative surplus from the ineffective part  of  the  market  value  changes.  The  unrealized  gains  and  losses  from  the  effective  part  offset  each  other  completely  and  are  not recognized in the Balance Sheet or the Income Statement.\n\nClassification of items in the annual financial statements : Siemens AG aggregates individual line items of the Income Statement and Balance Sheet if the individual line item is not material for providing a true and fair view of the Company's financial position and if such an aggregation improves the clarity of the presentation. Siemens AG discloses these items separately in the notes.\n\n## 3.3 Notes to the Income Statement\n\n## NOTE 1 Revenue\n\nRevenue by lines of business\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)   | Fiscal year  2023   |\n|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Digital Industries   | 11,220              |\n| Smart Infrastructure | 6,127               |\n| Other revenue        | 2,313               |\n| Revenue              | 19,660              |\n\nRevenue by region\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                  | Fiscal year  2023   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East | 14,708              |\n| Americas                            | 1,606               |\n| Asia, Australia                     | 3,346               |\n| Revenue                             | 19,660              |\n\n## NOTE 2 Other operating income and expenses\n\nOther operating income included income from an intragroup service contract in the amount of \u20ac148 million.

Interest income included interest income from affiliated companies of \u20ac890 million (2022: \u20ac347 million). Interest expenses included interest expenses from affiliated companies of \u20ac1,548 million (2022: \u20ac67 million interest income).

Subscription rights of existing shareholders are excluded. The new shares may exclusively be offered to employees of Siemens AG and its affiliated companies (employee shares). To the extent permitted by law, employee shares may also be issued in such a manner that the contribution to be paid on such shares is covered by that part of the annual net income which the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board may allocate to other retained earnings under Section 58 para. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n- \u00b7 Further, by resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of January 30, 2019, the Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until January 29, 2024 by up to \u20ac510 million through the issuance of up to 170 million registered no-par value shares against cash contributions and/or contributions in kind (Authorized Capital 2019). Under certain conditions, the Managing Board is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights in the event of issue against contributions in kind. In the case of issue against cash payment, the shares are generally to be offered to shareholders for  subscription.  However,  the  Managing  Board  is  authorized,  with  the  consent  of  the  Supervisory  Board,  to  exclude subscription rights, firstly for any fractional amounts, secondly, to grant dilution compensation in connection with convertible bonds or bonds with warrants already issued, and thirdly, under certain further conditions, if the issue price of the new shares does not fall significantly below the stock exchange price of the Company's already listed shares.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nThe following table presents the development of treasury shares:\n\n| (in number of shares)                                           | Fiscal year  2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Treasury shares, beginning of fiscal year                       | 57,454,171          |\n| Retirement of treasury shares                                   | (50,000,000)        |\n| Share buyback                                                   | 6,853,091           |\n| Issuance under share-based payments and employee share programs | (4,227,344)         |\n| Treasury shares, end of fiscal year                             | 10,079,918          |\n\nSiemens AG held 10,079,918 treasury shares, equaling a nominal amount of \u20ac30 million, representing 1.3% of the capital stock.\n\nOn June 24, 2021, Siemens announced a share buyback with a volume of up to \u20ac3 billion in the period from the beginning of fiscal 2022 to 2026. The share buyback, which began on November 15, 2021 and will run no longer than until September 15, 2026, is executed based on the authorizations granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020. In addition to the dividend policy, the share buyback  is  intended  to  allow  shareholders  to  continuously  participate  in  the  success  of  the  Company.  In  fiscal  2023,  Siemens  AG repurchased a total of 6,853,091 treasury shares under this buyback program. This represented a nominal amount of \u20ac21 million or 0.9% of capital stock. In the current reporting period, \u20ac884 million (excluding incidental transaction charges) were spent for this purpose; this represents a weighted average stock price of \u20ac129.04 per share. The purchases were made in the reporting period on 248 Xetra trading days and were carried out by a bank that had been commissioned by Siemens AG; the shares were purchased exclusively on the electronic trading platform of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra). The average volume on these trading days was about 27,633 shares.",

        "page_content": "The treasury shares purchased under the share buybacks may be used for purposes of retirement, distribution to employees, members of the executive bodies of companies affiliated with Siemens and members of the Managing Board, as well as the servicing of convertible bonds with attached warrants.\n\nFollowing the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Management Board resolved to redeem 50,000,000 treasury shares.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Siemens AG re-issued in total 4,227,344 treasury shares under the exclusion of subscription rights in connection with sharebased payments and employee share programs in the Group, equaling a nominal amount of \u20ac13 million and 0.5% of capital stock. The Company received in total \u20ac236 million for 1,843,831 shares, re-issued against payment of a purchase price. Siemens AG received this amount for unrestricted use. All shares were sold as investment shares in connection with the share matching program to plan participants. In each case, the purchase price was determined on the basis of the closing rate in Xetra trading, determined on a monthly effective date. Therefore, in the reporting period, in total 1,297,391 shares related to the monthly investment plan at a weighted average share price of \u20ac138.69 per share, 227,427 shares related to the share matching plan at a weighted average share price of \u20ac145.02 per share, and 319,013 shares related to the base share program at a weighted average share price of \u20ac72.51 per share (after consideration of a 50% subsidy by the Company). The other shares re-issued during the reporting period can be primarily attributed to the servicing of stock awards granted in fiscal 2019 totaling 1,693,126 shares, to 573,467 matching shares under the share matching program for fiscal 2020, and to 116,920 jubilee shares.\n\n## Information on amounts subject to dividend payout restrictions\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                                                                                                                      | Fiscal Year  2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Amount representing the difference of the recognition of provisions and similar commitments based on average interest rates covering ten and  seven years, respectively | 257                 |\n| Amounts from the capitalization of deferred taxes                                                                                                                       | 2,294               |\n| Amounts from the capitalization of assets at fair value                                                                                                                 | 18                  |\n\nThese amounts subject to dividend payout restrictions face other retained earnings in a sufficiently high amount. The unappropriated net income of \u20ac3,760 million is available for distribution.\n\n## Disclosures on shareholdings of Siemens AG\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the following information on shareholdings subject to reporting requirements was available to the Company pursuant to Section 160 para 1 No. 8 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz):\n\nBlackRock, Inc., Wilmington, USA, informed us on August 7, 2023, that as of August 2, 2023, its percentage of voting rights (held either directly  or  indirectly)  in  Siemens  AG  amounted  to  6.68%  of  which  6.56%  were  voting  rights  from  52,480,190  shares  due  to  their participation and 0.12% were attributable to instruments.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Wilmington, USA, informed us on December 22, 2022, that as of December 16, 2022, its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG amounted to 4.15% of which 0.28% were voting rights from 2,377,304 shares due to their participation and 3.87% were attributable to instruments.\n\nThe Werner Siemens-Stiftung, Zug, Switzerland, notified us on January 21, 2008, that its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG exceeded the threshold of 3% of the voting rights in our Company on January 2, 2008 and amounted to 3.03% (27,739,285 voting rights) as per this date.\n\n## NOTE 16 Provisions for pensions and similar commitments\n\nIn Germany, Siemens AG provides pension benefits through the BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans and deferred compensation plans. The majority of Siemens' active employees participate in the BSAV. The benefits are predominantly based on nominal contributions by the Company and investment returns on assets designated to that plan, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the Company. At inception of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of compensation increases. However, the frozen plans still expose Siemens to investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and longevity risk. The pension benefits are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA). A portion of these trust assets also covers the pension obligations of other domestic subsidiaries. Therefore, the assets do not meet the criteria for offsetting against the pension obligation and are presented as financial assets of Siemens AG.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions for valuation of the settlement amount as of September 30, 2023 were based, among others, on a discount rate of 1.81% and an average weighted pension increase of 2.40% p.a. The mortality tables used (Siemens Bio 2017/2023) are primarily based on data of the German Siemens population, using a set of formulas that corresponds to generally accepted actuarial standards.\n\n## NOTE 17 Other provisions\n\nThe major amounts in other provisions were contributed by provisions related to personnel costs amounting to \u20ac1,136 million, provisions for contingent losses from derivative financial instruments amounting to \u20ac723 million, provisions for warranties, delay compensations, penalties for delay and breach of contract amounting to \u20ac639 million, provisions for decontamination obligations amounting to \u20ac489 million, and provisions related to guarantees and expected obligations from consortium agreements amounting to \u20ac267 million.\n\nIn May 2021, Siemens AG and the Federal Republic of Germany entered into a public-law contract based on which the obligation of final disposal of nuclear waste is transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of \u20ac360 million. The contract and therefore the payment is subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules. Estimation uncertainties still relate to assumptions made to  measure  the  obligations  that  remain  with  Siemens  AG,  with  regard  to  conditioning  and  packaging  of  nuclear  waste,  as  well  as intermediate storage and transport to the final storage facility 'Schacht Konrad' or a logistics depot until year-end 2032.",

        "page_content": "Warranty obligations relating to financing of affiliated companies included guarantees towards banks for credit lines granted to affiliated companies.\n\nThe items Obligations from guarantees and Warranty Obligations - Others included guarantees and other commitments for the benefit of companies of the Siemens Energy Group totaling \u20ac0.1 billion and \u20ac4.7 billion, respectively, with corresponding full reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co. KG. In addition, the items included indemnifications issued in connection with dispositions of businesses. Such indemnifications, if customary to the relevant transactions, may protect the buyer from potential tax, legal and other risks in conjunction with the purchased business.\n\nWarranty obligations included obligations of Siemens AG towards affiliated companies totaling \u20ac1.0 billion.\n\nSiemens AG only enters into guarantees and other commitments after careful consideration of the risks concerned and in general only in relation to its own business activities or those of affiliated companies as well as to business activities of companies, if it holds an investment in them or their parent companies. Based on an ongoing risk evaluation of the arrangements entered into and taking into account all information available up to the date on which the Annual Financial Statements were issued for approval, Siemens AG concluded that the relevant primary debtors are able to fulfill the underlying obligations. For this reason, Siemens AG considered it not probable that it will be called upon in conjunction with any of the guarantees and commitments described above.\n\n## NOTE 24 Financial payment obligations under lease and rental arrangements\n\nExpenses for lease and rental arrangements in which the economic ownership of the leased/rented asset was not attributable to Siemens AG and the relevant items were not recognized as assets by Siemens AG amounted to \u20ac293 million. Object of these contracts were mainly real estate and other non-current assets.\n\nPayment obligations under lease and rental arrangements amounted to \u20ac1,334 million, of which \u20ac201 million resulted from transactions with affiliated companies. Payment obligations under lease and rental arrangements due within the next fiscal year amounted to \u20ac247 million.\n\n## NOTE 25 Other financial obligations\n\nApproximately \u20ac1.5 billion were outstanding as of September 30, 2023, from an outsourcing agreement with a maturity of several years. Obligations for equity contributions to affiliated companies amounted to \u20ac491 million.\n\nSiemens AG has entered into a contract to pay its affiliated company Siemens Trademark GmbH & Co. KG, Germany, a running royalty for the use of the Siemens trademark rights. The fee is calculated by applying business-specific royalty rates to brand-related revenue. The contract has an indefinite duration. For fiscal 2023, the corresponding expenses amounted to \u20ac988 million. For fiscal 2024, the royalty is expected to be in the same magnitude.\n\nIn  the  course  of  its  normal  business  operations,  Siemens  AG  is  involved  in  numerous  legal  and  regulatory  proceedings  as  well  as governmental investigations (legal proceedings) in various jurisdictions. These legal proceedings could result in particular in the Company being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or criminal or civil sanctions, fines or disgorgements of profit. In individual cases, this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. In addition, further Legal Proceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending Legal Proceedings may be expanded. Some of these legal proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens AG that may have material effects on its financial position, the results of its operations and/or its cash flows in the respective reporting period. In addition, Siemens is jointly and severally liable within consortia. As far as not recognized in the financial statements, Siemens AG did not expect any material negative effects on its financial position, the results of its operations and/or its cash flows at balance sheet date.\n\n## NOTE 26 Derivative financial instruments and valuation units\n\nAs a consequence of its global operating, investing and financing activities, Siemens AG is in particular exposed to risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, managed in line with a proven risk management system in consideration of defined risk limits. As the parent company of the Siemens Group, Siemens AG has the central role within the group-wide management of financial market risks. To manage the risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, Siemens AG uses primarily foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps as well as combined interest and foreign currency swaps. Thereby the operating units of Siemens AG are not allowed to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The contract partners of the Company for derivative  financial  instruments  are  banks,  brokers  and  affiliated  companies.  The  credit  rating  for  banks  and  brokers  is  constantly monitored.\n\nThe following table shows the notional volume and net fair values of existing derivative financial instruments that were not included in a valuation unit as of the balance sheet date:\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                               | Notional  amount   | Sep 30, 2023  Fair values  (722)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Interest rate hedging contracts                  | 8,038              |                                    |\n| Combined interest and currency hedging contracts | 369                | 26                                 |\n| Existing derivative financial instruments        | 8,407              | (696)                              |\n\nThe notional amounts equal the contractual amounts of the individual derivative financial instrument which - irrespective of the nature of the concluded position (sale or purchase) - are presented on a gross basis (gross notional amounts).\n\nFair values of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting expected future cash flows over the remaining term of the instrument using current market interest rates and yield curves.",

Using the freezing method, the hedging transactions are not recognized in the balance sheet. The effectiveness of the valuation unit is either ensured through risk management, or is demonstrated both prospectively and retrospectively based on appropriate methods used to demonstrate effectiveness (e.g. dollar offset method, regression method, sensitivity analysis). Valuation gains and losses from derivative  financial  instruments  and  hedged  items  are  netted  for  each  valuation  unit.  A  provision  for  anticipated  losses  on  onerous contracts is recognized for the respective valuation unit in the amount of an existing loss surplus. Profit surpluses are not recognized.\n\n## Valuation unit used to hedge the foreign currency risk\n\nAccording to the Company policy, Siemens units are responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. Foreign currency transaction exposure of the Siemens units from contracted business and cash balances in foreign currency is generally hedged approximately by 100% with Corporate Treasury. Foreign currency transaction exposure of the Siemens units from planned business above defined thresholds has to be hedged with Corporate Treasury within a band of 75% to 100% for a hedging period of at least three months.\n\nThe remaining foreign currency risk after offsetting cash flows in the same currency is hedged by the Corporate Treasury with external contract partners. The net foreign currency position (before hedging) is combined with the offsetting foreign currency exchange contracts to  a  macro  valuation  unit.  For  this  purpose,  hedged  items  and  hedging  instruments  are  measured  with  the  respective  underlying discounted cash flows. For foreign currency derivative financial instruments, the determination is based on the changes in relevant forward exchange rates. The existing derivative currency hedging contracts are included in the valuation unit in their entirety and had maturity terms until the year 2041. The cash in- and outflows from the foreign currency exchange contracts, firm commitments and forecast transactions are disclosed on a net basis in the following table.\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                             | Sep 30,  2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Foreign currency risk from balance sheet items                                 | 3,115           |\n| thereof assets                                                                 | 14,073          |\n| thereof liabilities                                                            | (10,958)        |\n| Foreign currency risk from firm commitments and forecast transactions          | 687             |\n| thereof expected cash inflows from firm commitments and forecast transactions  | 1,245           |\n| thereof expected cash outflows from firm commitments and forecast transactions | (558)           |\n| Net foreign currency position (before hedging)                                 | 3,802           |\n| Foreign currency exchange contracts (net notional value)                       | (3,968)         |\n| thereof with external contract partners                                        | 2,671           |\n| thereof with affiliated companies                                              | (6,639)         |\n| Net foreign currency position (after hedging)                                  | (166)           |\n\nFirm  commitments  and  forecast  transactions  relate  to  transactions  for  which  a  legally  binding  contract  was  concluded  but  not  yet performed on by either contracting party, as well as contingent payment claims for already partially completed performance obligations in the project and product businesses.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the fair value of derivative financial instruments from foreign currency hedging transactions was \u20ac(4) million, net. Positive fair values of \u20ac1,897 million were offset by negative fair values of \u20ac1,901 million. For derivative financial instruments with negative fair values, no provision for anticipated losses was recognized as part of the valuation unit.\n\n## Valuation unit used to hedge the interest rate risk\n\nThe interest rate hedging contracts used by Siemens AG serve to reduce interest rate risks within the framework of an integrated assetliability management approach and to optimize the interest results.\n\nSiemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties to hedge interest rate swaps with its affiliated companies against interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2023, the interest rate swaps with affiliated companies with a maximum maturity term until the year 2028 included in this macro-valuation unit had a notional amount of \u20ac2,121 million and fair values of \u20ac122 million. At balance sheet date, these underlying transactions were matched by external interest rate derivatives with negative fair values of \u20ac59 million, net, and a maximum maturity term until the year 2030.\n\nTo hedge interest rate risks arising from payables to affiliated companies, Siemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties. As of September 30, 2023, the liabilities hedged in this micro-valuation unit had a nominal volume of \u20ac2,347 million and a maximum maturity term until the year 2025. As of September 30, 2023, the positive cumulative changes in the market value of these payables of \u20ac86 million were offset by external interest rate derivatives with identical maturities whose negative market value was \u20ac78 million.",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditor's report\n\nTo Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich\n\n## Report on the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report\n\n## Opinions\n\nWe have audited the annual financial statements of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich, (the Company) which comprise the income statement for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, the balance sheet as of September 30, 2023 and notes to the financial statements, including the recognition and measurement policies presented therein. In addition, we have audited the management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft,  which  is  combined  with  the  group  management  report,  for  the  fiscal  year  from October 1,  2022  to  September  30,  2023.  In  accordance  with  the  German  legal  requirements,  we  have  not  audited  chapter  11  'EU Taxonomy  disclosure'  of  the  combined  management  report,  the  sections  '8.5.1  Internal  Control  System  (ICS)  and  ERM'  and  '8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)' in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report as well as the content of the Corporate Governance Statement which is published on the website stated in the combined management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- \u00b7 the  accompanying annual financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law applicable to business corporations and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 in compliance with German legally required accounting principles, and\n- \u00b7 the accompanying management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position. In all material respects, this management report is consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the management report does not cover chapter 11 'EU Taxonomy disclosure' of the combined management report, the sections '8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM' and '8.5.2 Compliance  Management  System  (CMS)'  in  chapter  8.5  of  the  combined  management  report  and  the  content  of  the  Corporate Governance Statement.\n\nPursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the annual financial statements and of the management report.\n\n## Basis for the opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as 'EU Audit Regulation') and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). In  conducting  the  audit  of  the  annual  financial  statements  we  also  complied  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  (ISA).  Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report' section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional  responsibilities  in  accordance  with  these  requirements.  In  addition,  in  accordance  with  Art.  10  (2)  f)  of  the  EU  Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art. 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report.\n\n## Key audit matters in the audit of the annual financial statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual financial statements for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the annual financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nBelow, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:\n\n## Valuation of non-current financial assets\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The impairment test and the assessment regarding the need for a reversal  of  impairment  of  non-current  financial  assets  was  a  key  audit  matter,  as  in  particular  shares  in  affiliated  companies  and investments entail a higher risk of material misstatement due to the materiality of these assets as well as the estimation uncertainties and judgments involved in assessing whether there is objective evidence to indicate a lower net realizable value and permanent impairment or a reversal of impairment, and the determination of the fair values.\n\nThe determination of the fair values of non-current financial assets also depends to a large extent on the assessment of future cash inflows and the discount rate applied.\n\nIn case of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, in which 21,0% are held directly, the market capitalization during fiscal 2023 was on average above the book value sometimes significantly. As of September 30, 2023, a reversal of impairment to the stock market price has been recorded, following an impairment as of September 30, 2022.\n\nAuditor's response: With regards to the net realizable values calculated by management and its assessment as to whether an impairment or reversal of impairment is expected to be permanent, we examined the underlying processes related to the planning of future cash flows",

    {
        "page_content": "as well as to the calculation of net realizable value, obtained an understanding of management's evaluation and also considered external evidence in this regard, amongst others, on the development of stock market prices.\n\nWe assessed the underlying valuation models for the determination of the net realizable value in terms of methodology and reperformed the  calculations  with  the  assistance  of  internal  valuation  specialists.  We  further  obtained  explanations  from  management  regarding material  value  drivers  of  the  planning  and  examined  whether  the  budget  planning  reflects  general  and  industry-specific  market expectations. Forecast accuracy was assessed on a sample basis using budget-to-actual comparisons of historically forecast data with the actual results. The parameters used to estimate net realizable value such as the estimated growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital rates were assessed by comparing them to publicly available market data. We also performed our own sensitivity analyses to assess the impairment risk in the case of a reasonably possible change in one of the significant assumptions.\n\nWith regard to the reversal of impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, we have traced the development of the stock market price  and  assessed  the  calculation  of  the  reversal  of  impairment  as  of  September  30,  2023,  considering  the  acquisition  costs  of  the investment.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the disclosures in the notes to the annual financial statements regarding the subsequent events relating to the investment in Siemens Energy AG.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the valuation of non-current financial assets as of September 30, 2023.\n\nReference to related disclosures : With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied for the impairment of non-current financial assets, refer to chapter 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles in the notes to the financial statements and with respect to write-downs and write-ups of non-current financial assets, refer to chapter 3.3 Notes to the Income Statement, Note 3 Income (loss) from investments, net as well as chapter 3.4 Notes to the Balance Sheet, Note 10 Non-current assets and with respect to the subsequent events relating to the investment in Siemens Energy AG, refer to chapter 3.5 Other disclosures, Note 30 Subsequent events in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Other Provisions for legal disputes, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: We considered the accounting for other provisions for legal disputes, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations (legal proceedings) out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations to be a key audit matter. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the  recognition  and  measurement  of  the  respective  provision  and,  accordingly,  on  assets,  liabilities  and  financial  performance.  The proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they involve complex legal issues and accordingly, considerable management judgment, in particular when determining whether and in what amount a provision is required to account for the risks.\n\nAuditor's response: During our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, we examined the processes implemented by Siemens for identifying, assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings. To determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted also in connection with joint and several liability are known and to assess management's estimates of the expected cash outflows, our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the Company entrusted with these matters, obtaining written statements from in-house legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their probability, obtaining confirmations from external legal advisors and evaluating internal statements concerning the accounting treatment in the annual financial statements. Furthermore, we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered.\n\nWe further considered alleged or substantiated non-compliance with legal provisions, official regulations (including sanctions) and internal company policies by inspecting internal and external statements on specific matters, obtaining written statements from external legal advisors, and by inquiring of the compliance organization. In this regard, among other procedures, we evaluated the conduct and results of internal investigations by inspecting internal reports and the measures taken to remediate identified weaknesses, and assessed on this basis whether management's evaluation of any risks to be accounted for in the annual financial statements is plausible.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for other provisions, refer to chapter 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles in the notes to the financial statements. With respect to the legal proceedings, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations, refer to chapter 3.5 Other Disclosures, Note 25 Other financial obligations.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions and recoverability of deferred tax assets\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions, and was therefore a key audit matter. In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions as well as the recoverability of deferred tax assets.\n\nAuditor's response: With the assistance of internal tax specialists who have knowledge of tax law, we examined the processes installed by management for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax positions.\n\nIn the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions, we evaluated whether management's assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year 2023, which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions, was in compliance with tax law. In particular, this includes the tax implications arising from cross border matters, such as the determination of transfer prices, the results of tax field audits, the acquisition or disposal of company shares and corporate (intragroup) restructuring activities. In order to assess measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, we also obtained confirmations from external tax advisors. Further, we evaluated management's assessments with respect to the prospects of success of appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the Siemens tax department and by considering current tax case law.",

Management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for the declaration pursuant to Sec. 161 AktG ['Aktiengesetz': German Stock Corporation Act] on the Corporate Governance Code, which is part of the Corporate Governance Statement, and for the Compensation Report.  In  all  other  respects,  management  is  responsible  for  the  other  information.  The  other  information  comprises chapter 11 'EU Taxonomy disclosure' of the combined management report, the sections '8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM' and '8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)' in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report as well as the content of the Corporate Governance Statement.

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the annual financial statements and the management report\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  the  annual  financial  statements  that  comply,  in  all  material  respects,  with  the requirements of German commercial law applicable to business corporations, and that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Company in compliance with German legally required accounting principles. In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as it, in accordance with German legally required accounting principles, has determined necessary to enable the preparation of annual financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  annual  financial  statements,  management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  It  also  has  the  responsibility  for  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern.  In  addition,  management  is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.\n\nFurthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Company's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as management has considered necessary to enable the preparation of a management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the management report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process for the preparation of the annual financial statements and of the management report.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the annual financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error  and  are  considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual financial statements and this management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual financial statements and of the management report, whether due to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for the  risk  of  detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the annual financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems of the Company;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures;\n- \u00b7 conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the annual financial statements and in the management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to be able to continue as a going concern;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the annual financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Company in compliance with German legally required accounting principles;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the consistency of the management report with the annual financial statements, its conformity with German law and the view of the Company's position it provides;\n- \u00b7 perform  audit  procedures  on  the  prospective  information  presented  by  management  in  the  management  report.  On  the  basis  of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the annual financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n## Other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## Report on the assurance on the electronic rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report prepared for publication purposes in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report (hereinafter the 'ESEF documents') contained in the file SIEMENS\\_2023.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format ('ESEF format'). In accordance with German legal requirements, this assurance work extends only to the conversion of the information contained in the annual financial statements and the management report into the ESEF format and therefore relates neither to the information contained within these renderings nor to any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\nIn our opinion, the rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report contained in the file identified above and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format. Beyond this assurance opinion and our audit opinions on the accompanying annual financial statements and the accompanying management report for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 contained in the 'Report on the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report' above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these renderings or on the other information contained in the file identified above.",

Our responsibility in accordance therewith is further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the assurance work on the ESEF documents' section. Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality Management 1: Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QS 1).\n\n## Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF documents\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  the  ESEF  documents  including  the  electronic  rendering  of  the  annual  financial statements and the management report in accordance with Sec. 328 (1) Sentence 4 No. 1 HGB.\n\nIn  addition,  management  is  responsible  for  such  internal  control  as  it  has  determined  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  ESEF documents that are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the assurance work on the ESEF documents\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion;\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the financial statements, on the technical specification for this file;\n- \u00b7 evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the audited annual financial statements and to the audited management report.\n\n## Further information pursuant to Art. 10 of the EU Audit Regulation\n\nWe were elected as auditor by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 9, 2023. We were engaged by the Supervisory Board on February 9, 2023. We have been the auditor of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft without interruption since the fiscal year from October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009.\n\nWe declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee pursuant to Art. 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\nIn addition to the financial statement audit, we have provided to the Company or entities controlled by it the following services that are not disclosed in the annual financial statements or in the management report:\n\nIn  addition  to  auditing  the  statutory  financial  statements  of  Siemens  AG, we performed the statutory audit of Siemens' consolidated financial statements, audits of financial statements of subsidiaries of Siemens AG, reviews of interim financial statements integrated in the audit, project-based IT audits as well as service organization control engagements.\n\nAudit-related  services  include  primarily  audits  of  financial  statements  as  well  as  other  attestation  services  in  connection  with  M&A activities, attestation services related to the sustainability reporting, the compensation reporting and the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy, comfort letters and other attestation services required under regulatory requirements, contractually agreed or requested on a voluntary basis.\n\n## Other matter - use of the auditor's report\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited annual financial statements and the audited management report as well  as  the  assured  ESEF  documents.  The  annual  financial  statements  and  the  management  report  converted  to  the  ESEF  format  including the versions to be published in the Unternehmensregister [German Company Register] - are merely electronic renderings of the audited annual financial statements and the audited management report and do not take their place. In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.",

        "page_content": "## A. Fiscal 2023 in retrospect\n\n## What did the economic and political environment look like at the start of fiscal 2023?\n\nSiemens AG began fiscal 2023 spurred by a strong performance in fiscal 2022. However, the economic and political environment still contained a large number of uncertainties. Although new variants of the coronavirus did not produce the negative impacts feared and a crisis in gas and electricity supplies failed to materialize, the economic situation began to weaken - particularly in Germany, the Company's home market. The war in Ukraine continued as did tensions between the western democracies and China. On the other hand, supply chain pressures eased. Due to a sharp increase in inflation, all major central banks raised their interest rates to levels not seen since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008. In Europe, high energy prices burdened economic development, while, in the U.S., consumption and the labor market in particular proved to be very resilient despite the interest rate increases. Growth in China - which had been strong following the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in Q1 of fiscal 2023 - slowed due to the normalization of inventories, which had built up during the pandemic, and as a result of the burdens imposed by the crisis in China's real estate market. Siemens AG's markets benefited from high order backlogs, positive price developments and customers' efforts to become more resilient, more competitive and more sustainable.\n\n## How is the strategy reflected in Managing Board compensation?\n\nAs a leading technology company, Siemens partners closely with other companies, industries and innovators in order to combine the real and the digital worlds. In this context, the Company focuses on accelerated, high-value growth. The Managing Board compensation determined by the Supervisory Board fosters the implementation of the Company's strategic targets by providing incentives for increasing profit, capital efficiency and cash generation. Incentives are also provided for driving the Company's digital transformation and developing its sustainability-related business.\n\nIn addition, sustainability - as a strategic goal and an expression of Siemens' social responsibility - is a high priority at Siemens. Sustainability is managed using the DEGREE framework. Introduced in fiscal 2021, this framework addresses sustainability from every angle and determines Siemens' ambitions in the sustainability area with systematized, measurable and specific long-term targets for environment, social and governance (ESG) dimensions. DEGREE is an acronym that stands for  decarbonization,  ethics,  governance,  resource  efficiency,  equity  and  employability.  The  DEGREE  framework  is continuously developed and adapted to the commitments that Siemens has made, such as the Science Based Targets initiative. The key performance indicators applied in long-term variable compensation are part of this DEGREE framework (CO2 emissions and digital learning hours per employee) and/or reflect the Company's priorities (Net Promoter Score as an expression of customer satisfaction).\n\n## How did Siemens perform in fiscal 2023?\n\nFiscal 2023 was another very successful year for Siemens. We achieved excellent financial results in a volatile market environment, which on the one hand included destocking by customers and distributors following previously proactive purchasing, particularly in our short-cycle businesses, and on the other hand included improved supply chain conditions, which accelerated revenue conversion from our high order backlog. We raised our outlook during the fiscal year after the first and the second quarters. We then reached or exceeded all the targets set for our primary measures for fiscal 2023.\n\nRevenue  was  higher  in  nearly  all  our  industrial  businesses  and  rose  to  \u20ac77.8  billion,  up  8%  year-over-year.  Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries contributed double-digit growth with all businesses posting increases.  Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects, revenue for Siemens rose 11%. Profit Industrial Business exceeded the record high of a year earlier and rose 11% to \u20ac11.4 billion. The profit margin of our Industrial Business rose to 15.4%, up from 15.1% a year earlier, reaching its highest level ever.\n\nNet income nearly doubled year-over year to a historic high of \u20ac8.5 billion and corresponding basic earnings per share (EPS) more than doubled to \u20ac10.04. Earnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA) increased to \u20ac10.77.\n\nReturn on capital employed (ROCE) for fiscal 2023 rose to 18.6%, up from 10.0% in fiscal 2022. This increase was due to sharply higher income before interest after tax year-over-year. We thus exceeded the forecast for ROCE, which was to come close to or reach the lower end of our target range of 15% to 20%.\n\nFree cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal 2023 was \u20ac10.0 billion, reaching a record high. The cash conversion rate for Siemens, defined as the ratio of free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations to net",

        "page_content": "income, was 1.17. We thus achieved a cash conversion rate that contributed strongly to the average required to reach our target of 1 minus annual comparable revenue growth rate over a cycle of three to five years.\n\nSiemens' strong operating performance in fiscal 2023 is reflected in the Managing Board's variable compensation, which takes into account not only financial success but also environmental and social aspects. As a result, the compensation of the Managing Board members is also oriented toward the interests of the shareholders as well as the other stakeholders of Siemens AG.\n\n## Composition of the Managing Board and the Compensation Committee\n\nThere were no changes in the composition of the Managing Board of Siemens AG in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2023, the Managing Board comprised Dr. Roland Busch (President and CEO), Cedrik Neike, Matthias Rebellius, Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas and Judith Wiese.\n\nFollowing the scheduled departure of Michael Diekmann, the previous Chairman of the Compensation Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG, from the Supervisory Board and thus also from the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee elected Matthias Zachert to serve as its new Chairman, effective February 10, 2023. Grazia Vittadini has been a new member of the Compensation Committee since February 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the Compensation Committee comprised Matthias Zachert  (Chairman), Harald Kern, J\u00fcrgen Kerner, Jim Hagemann Snabe, Birgit Steinborn and Grazia Vittadini.\n\n## Vote on the Compensation Report for fiscal 2022 at the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting\n\nThe Compensation Report for fiscal 2022 was prepared in accordance with Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), and its content was also audited by the independent auditors, beyond the requirement of Section 162 para. 3 sent. 1 and 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The Compensation Report on the compensation individually awarded and due to the members of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG in fiscal 2022 was approved by a majority of 92.09% of the valid votes cast at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 9, 2023.\n\nIn view of the high level of approval, the Compensation Report for 2023 is basically unchanged in structure and scope. In addition, no changes to the compensation system were deemed necessary for fiscal 2023. Pursuant to Section 120a para.1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the compensation system for Managing Board members must be submitted for regular approval by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in February 2024. In this connection, the compensation system has been subjected to a comprehensive review and adjusted. The compensation system as of fiscal 2024 is available on the Company website as part of the Notice of Annual Shareholders' Meeting.",

Compensation of Managing Board members\n\n## B.1 The compensation system at a glance\n\nThe compensation system for the members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG that is applicable for fiscal 2023 has been in place since fiscal 2020 and was approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020, by a majority of 94.51% of the valid votes cast.\n\nThe compensation of the Managing Board members consists of fixed and variable components. Fixed compensation, which is not performance-based, comprises base salary, fringe benefits and a pension benefit commitment. Short-term variable compensation (Bonus) and long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards) are performance-based compensation and thus variable.\n\nThe Share Ownership Guidelines are a further key component of the compensation system. They obligate Managing Board members to permanently hold Siemens shares worth a defined multiple of their base salary and to purchase additional shares in the event that the value of their shares falls below the defined amount.\n\nThe  Managing  Board  compensation  system  is  also  supplemented  by  commitments  granted  in  connection  with  the commencement and termination of appointments to the Managing Board as well as any change in the regular place of work.\n\nOverview of the compensation system for Managing Board members\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Compensation components                        | Design of compensation components                                             | Design of compensation components                                  | Maximum payout  (in % of target amount)  regulations   | Malus and clawback  Maximum compensation   |                                                                      | Other design characteristics                                            | Other design characteristics                                          |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed compensation                             | Base salary                                                                   | Fringe benefits                                                    | 100% 1                                                 | Not applicable                             |                                                                      | Equals the sum of maximum amounts that can possibly be paid out to each | Share Ownership Guidelines                                            |\n| Short-term variable compensation (Bonus)       | 33.34% Siemens Group                                                          | 33.33% Managing Board portfolio 33.33% Individual targets          | 200%                                                   |                                            | member from all compensation components for the relevant fiscal year | Equals the sum of maximum amounts that can possibly be paid out to each | Commitments in connection with the commence- ment of appoint- ments   |\n| Long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards) | 80% Total shareholder return (TSR) com- pared to MSCI World Industrials Index | 20% Environment, Social and Governance (ESG/ Sustainability index) | 300%                                                   |                                            |                                                                      | Equals the sum of maximum amounts that can possibly be paid out to each | Commitments in the event of termination of appointments Severance cap |\n\n- 1 Fringe benefits are reimbursed up to a maximum amount set by the Supervisory Board.",

In making this determination, the Supervisory Board has ensured that the proportion of long-term variable compensation always exceeds that of short-term variable compensation and that the proportions of total target compensation represented by each of the individual compensation components are within the ranges defined in the compensation system.\n\nComposition of total target compensation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  regular  review  of  Managing  Board  compensation  at  the  beginning  of  fiscal  2023  in  order  to  determine  the compensation's appropriateness and conformity with customary market practices indicated that - when compared to the companies in the DAX 40, the German blue-chip stock index, that have been defined in the compensation system as the relevant market - the total target compensation of the members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG was positioned toward the lower end of the customary market ranges. Compared to the companies in the STOXX Europe 50, which is also used for a market comparison due to Siemens' international footprint, direct target compensation was actually below the customary  market  range.  Against  this  backdrop,  the  Supervisory  Board  approved  an  increase  in  the  total  target compensation of all Managing Board members as of October 1, 2022. This increase was implemented by raising the individual members' Stock Awards target amounts. The Stock Awards target amount for Dr. Roland Busch was raised to \u20ac3,340,000 from \u20ac2,954,000, the target amount for Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas was raised to \u20ac2,145,000 from \u20ac2,000,000, the target amount for Cedrik Neike was raised to \u20ac1,470,000 from \u20ac1,259,000, and the target amounts for the remaining Managing Board members were raised to \u20ac1,380,000 from \u20ac1,259,000.\n\nDue to the increase in the Stock Awards target amounts, variable compensation is structured on a more long-term basis, while compensation as a whole is oriented even more toward sustainable Company development.\n\nRegarding compensation, all components of the compensation of the position of President and CEO are differentiated. The target amount of Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas's Stock Awards is differentiated due to his particular responsibilities as CFO. The target amount of Cedrik Neike's Stock Awards is also differentiated due to the outstanding business results of Digital Industries, the strategic importance of this Business for the further development of Siemens AG and Cedrik Neike's fiveyears of membership on the Managing Board.\n\nThe following table shows the individualized target compensation of each Managing Board member and the relative proportions of total target compensation represented by each of the individual compensation components.",

Maximum compensation is equal to the total of the maximum amounts of all compensation components that can possibly be paid out to each Managing Board member for the relevant fiscal year. It is calculated by adding base salary, maximum fringe benefits and the BSAV contribution (or the amount for free disposal) as well as two times the Bonus target amount and three times the Stock Awards target amount. Twice the Bonus target amount and triple the Stock Awards target amount also correspond to the respective limits (individual caps) on the amount of variable compensation.\n\nThe following table shows the maximum compensation of each Managing Board member as approved by the Supervisory Board for fiscal 2023 in accordance with Section 87a para. 1 sent. 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nMaximum compensation fiscal 2023\n\n|                        |    |                                                                     |                   |               |                     | Managing Board members   in office on September 30, 2023   | Managing Board members   in office on September 30, 2023   |\n|------------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (\u20ac thousand)           |    |                                                                     | Dr. Roland  Busch | Cedrik  Neike | Matthias  Rebellius | Prof. Dr. Ralf P.

For  this  purpose,  the  Supervisory  Board  assessed  the compensation's level and structure relative to the companies included in the DAX 40, the German blue-chip stock index, and relative to the companies included in the STOXX Europe 50 (horizontal comparison). In the course of its review, the Supervisory Board also assessed the development of Managing Board compensation relative to the compensation of Senior Management and Siemens' total workforce in Germany (vertical comparison). Senior Management comprises executive employees. The total workforce comprises Senior Management as well as the Siemens employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements and those who are not. In addition to a status quo analysis, the vertical comparison took into account the development of compensation ratios over time. Since Siemens Healthineers is a separately managed, publicly listed company, its workforce was not included in the vertical comparison.\n\nThe  appropriateness  review  of  Managing  Board  compensation  for  fiscal  2023  has  shown  that  Managing  Board compensation is appropriate.",

It consists of a short-term variable component (Bonus) and a long-term variable component (Stock Awards).\n\nThe performance criteria and the key performance indicators used to measure performance for variable compensation in fiscal 2023 are derived from the Company's strategic goals and operational steering and are in line with the compensation system applicable for fiscal 2023. As a rule, all the performance criteria measure successful value creation in all its different forms,  as  strategically  envisioned.

If they are not reached, variable compensation can be reduced to zero. If the targets are significantly exceeded, target achievement is capped at 200%.\n\n## B.3.1 Short-term variable compensation (Bonus)\n\n## B.3.1.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES AND FUNCTIONING\n\nThe Bonus system is based on three equally weighted target dimensions, which take account of the overall responsibility of the Managing Board as well as each Managing Board members' specific business responsibilities and individual challenges:\n\n- \u2192 'Siemens Group'\n- \u2192 'Managing Board portfolio'\n- \u2192 'Individual targets.'\n\nPerformance  criteria  are  assigned  to  each  of  the  three  target  dimensions  based  on  Company  priorities  and  the responsibilities of each Managing Board member. One financial performance criterion is assigned to the 'Siemens Group' dimension and another to the 'Managing Board portfolio' dimension. The fulfillment of these criteria is measured on the basis of key performance indicators. Within the 'Individual targets' dimension, the financial performance criteria 'growth' and  'liquidity'  can  be  employed  as  can  additional,  non-financial  performance  criteria.  In  the  case  of  non-financial performance criteria, the Supervisory Board considers the degree to which a Managing Board member has fulfilled so-called focus topics, which comprise operations-related aspects of the execution of the Company's strategy as well as sustainabilityrelated aspects.\n\nAt the end of the fiscal year, target achievement for the individual key performance indicators and the achievement of the Managing Board members' individual targets are determined and aggregated to form a weighted average. The percentage of weighted target achievement multiplied by the individual target amount yields the Bonus payout amount for the past fiscal year. The payable Bonus is capped at two times the target amount and is paid in cash, at the latest, together with the compensation paid at the end of February of the following fiscal year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## B.3.1.2. BONUS FOR FISCAL 2023\n\n## 'Siemens Group' target dimension\n\nFor the 'Siemens Group' target dimension in fiscal 2023, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG defined the performance criterion 'profit.'  In accordance with external communications and the Siemens Financial Framework for the financial steering of the Company, the focus is on the transparent presentation of Siemens' operating performance. For this reason, 'profit' is measured in terms of basic earnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA). EPS pre PPA is defined as basic earnings per share from net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and related income taxes. It includes the amounts attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG.\n\nTo take account of the Company's long-term performance and provide incentives for a sustainable increase in profit, the average EPS pre PPA of three consecutive fiscal years was used for target setting. The portfolio of Siemens AG changed significantly due to the spin-off of Siemens Energy at the end of fiscal 2020. Against this backdrop, target setting for fiscal 2023 was defined on the basis of comparable EPS pre PPA values. The following EPS pre PPA values were used for this purpose: the EPS pre PPA value of continuing operations was used for fiscal 2020, and the EPS pre PPA values of continuing and discontinued operations were used for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.",

ROCE is defined as profit before interest and after tax divided by average capital employed. For the purposes of target setting and determining target achievement, ROCE - as defined in the Siemens Financial Framework, which  excludes  certain  Varian-related  acquisition  effects  -  is  adjusted  for  main  effects  relating  to  the  stake  in Siemens Energy (profit 'Siemens Energy Investment' in the numerator and asset 'Siemens Energy Investment'  in the denominator).

The CCR reflects a company's ability to convert profit into available cash.

CCR Siemens Group is defined as the ratio of free cash flow  from  continuing and discontinued operations to  net income. For the Managing Board members with business responsibility for Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure, the CCR targets are business-specific and defined as the ratio of free cash flow to profit at each business. The target amounts for CCR were based on the budget plans.\n\nIndividual targets: Cash conversion rate (CCR) -  Target setting and target achievement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to CCR, 'comparable revenue growth' was defined as the second individual target for fiscal 2023 for all members of the Managing Board. It indicates the development in Siemens' business net of currency translation effects arising from the external environment outside of Siemens' control and the portfolio effects that involve business activities that are either new to or no longer a part of the relevant business. For the President and CEO and the members of the Managing Board with  primarily  functional responsibility, the growth target was determined  on the basis of continuing operations (c/o) related to the Siemens Group (Siemens c/o). For the Managing Board members with business responsibility for Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure, growth targets are based on their respective businesses. The respective target values were derived from the external outlook for fiscal 2023.\n\nIndividual targets: Comparable revenue growth -  Target setting and target achievement\n\n<!-- image -->",

BASIC PRINCIPLES AND FUNCTIONING\n\nSiemens grants long-term variable compensation in the form of Stock Awards. A Stock Award is the claim to one share conditional on target achievement - after the expiration of a defined vesting period. The vesting period is, accordingly, the term of each Stock Awards tranche.\n\nAt the beginning of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board defines a target amount in euros based on 100% target achievement for each Managing Board member. This target amount is extrapolated to target achievement of 200% ('maximum allocation amount'). Stock Awards for this maximum allocation amount are then allocated to the Managing Board members. The number of Stock Awards is calculated by dividing the maximum allocation amount by the price of the Siemens share on the allocation date, less the estimated discounted dividends ('allocation price').\n\nAn approximately four-year vesting period begins with the allocation of Stock Awards, after the expiration of which Siemens shares are transferred. The beneficiary Managing Board members are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period.\n\n## Performance criteria\n\nSince fiscal 2020, the number of Siemens shares that is actually transferred depends 80% on the financial performance criterion 'long-term value creation,' measured on the basis of the key performance indicator 'total shareholder return' (TSR), and 20% on the non-financial performance criterion 'sustainability.' For measuring the 'sustainability' performance criterion, Siemens AG's performance in the environment, social and governance (ESG) area is assessed on the basis of a Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index, the composition of which is determined annually by the Supervisory Board.\n\nTotal shareholder return - TSR is indicative of the performance of one share over a specified period of time - in the case of Siemens, over the approximately four-year vesting period. It takes into account changes in the share price and the dividends paid during this period. To reflect the Company's international footprint, the TSR of Siemens AG is compared at the end of the vesting period with the TSR of an international sector index, the MSCI World Industrials or a comparable successor index.\n\nTarget achievement for TSR is concretely determined by first calculating a TSR reference value for Siemens AG and a TSR reference value for the sector index. The TSR reference value is equal to the average of the end-of-month values over the first 12 months of the vesting period (reference period).\n\nIn order to determine at the end of the vesting period how well the TSR of Siemens AG has performed relative to the TSR of the sector index, the TSR performance value is calculated over the subsequent 36 months (performance period). The TSR performance value is the average of the end-of-month values during the performance period.",

At the beginning of each tranche, the Supervisory Board defines the target values for each of the ESG key performance indicators. Target measurement is based on defined interim targets for each fiscal year. Target achievement for the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is finally determined at the end of the approximately four-year vesting period on the basis of the weighted average of the target achievement values calculated for each of the key performance indicators.\n\n## Determination of total target achievement\n\nAt  the  end  of  the  approximately  four-year  vesting  period,  the  Supervisory  Board  determines  the  degree  of  target achievement. The target achievement range for TSR and for the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is between 0% and 200%. If target achievement is less than 200%, a number of Siemens Stock Awards equivalent to the shortfall are forfeited without refund or replacement and a correspondingly smaller number of shares is transferred.\n\nThe value of the Siemens shares transferred after the expiration of the vesting period is also capped at 300% of the target amount. If this cap is exceeded, a corresponding number of Stock Awards is forfeited without refund or replacement.",

For the 2023 tranche, the allocation date in accordance with IFRS 2 was November 23, 2022 (the date of communication to the Managing Board members).\n- 2 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, Matthias Rebellius is CEO of Smart Infrastructure and CEO of Siemens Schweiz AG. The corresponding legal relationship is defined in a separate contract between Matthias Rebellius and Siemens Schweiz AG. The entire compensation he receives under the terms of his contract with Siemens Schweiz AG is deducted from his Managing Board compensation. Of the target amount reported here (based on 100% target achievement), \u20ac600,000 is attributable to Siemens Schweiz AG.\n\nConcrete target setting and the degree of target achievement for the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index of the 2023 Stock Awards tranche will be published together with the degree of target achievement for the TSR in the Compensation Report for fiscal 2027, after the expiration of the vesting period.\n\n## B.3.2.3 TRANSFER OF STOCK AWARDS IN FISCAL 2023 (2019 TRANCHE)\n\nThe 2019 Stock Awards tranche became due and was settled in fiscal 2023. The 2019 Stock Awards tranche depended on the performance of the Siemens share compared to the share performance of five relevant competitors during the approximately four-year vesting period from November 9, 2018, to November 17, 2022.\n\nOverview of target achievement for the 2019 Stock Awards tranche\n\n## Performance of the Siemens share compared to the share performance of five relevant competitors\n\n|                             | Reference price       | Performance price   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| ABB                         | CHF18.74              | CHF25.73            |\n| Eaton                       | $79.66                | $127.46             |\n| General Electric            | $74.91                | $82.64              |\n| Mitsubishi Heavy Industries | \u00a54,401.17             | \u00a53,422.67           |\n| Schneider                   | \u20ac72.37                | \u20ac121.12             |\n| Competitors (average)       | Competitors (average) |                     |\n| Siemens AG                  | \u20ac89.91                | \u20ac115.81             |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTarget achievement: 91%\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the key parameters of the 2019 Stock Awards tranche. In connection with the due date and settlement of the Stock Awards for fiscal 2019, the table also includes an additional cash payment to the Managing Board members as a result of the Siemens Energy spin-off. The spin-off of Siemens Energy in fiscal 2020 led to adjustments in the stock-based compensation commitments agreed upon until the spin-off date. At the time when the 2019 Stock Awards became due, the Managing Board members - like all other eligible employees - were, accordingly, entitled to receive an additional cash payment based on the spin-off ratio of 2:1 and on the Siemens Energy share price of \u20ac14.68 on the date when their stock-based compensation commitments became due.",

For this reason, the number of Stock Awards, as set out in the table, is based on a target achievement of 200%. At the end of the vesting period, a final number of Siemens shares to be transferred will be determined on the basis of actual target achievement and taking into account the Stock Awards cap.\n- 2 The target achievement of the Stock Awards from the 2019 tranche, which were due and settled in fiscal 2023, was 91%. Since the Stock Awards were initially allocated on the basis of 200% target achievement, a number equivalent to this shortfall was forfeited without refund or replacement, in accordance with plan requirements.\n- 3 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board, Cedrik Neike served as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Siemens Ltd. China from May 1, 2017, to March 31, 2019. The reported figures include the Stock Awards allocated to Cedrik Neike by Siemens Ltd. China due to this position.\n- 4 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, Matthias Rebellius is CEO of Smart Infrastructure and CEO of Siemens Schweiz AG. The corresponding legal relationship is defined in a separate contract between Matthias Rebellius and Siemens Schweiz AG. The entire compensation he receives under the terms of his contract with Siemens Schweiz AG is deducted from his Managing Board compensation. The Stock Awards reported here also include the Stock Awards allocated by Siemens Schweiz AG since the appointment of Matthias Rebellius to the Managing Board of Siemens AG.\n- 5 The reported figures also include the Stock Awards allocated to Judith Wiese in November 2020 as compensation for the loss of benefits granted by her former employer in addition to the regular allocation of Stock Awards from the 2021 tranche.",

Since fiscal 2020, newly appointed members of the Managing Board can be awarded, instead of BSAV contributions, a fixed cash amount for free disposal.\n\nContributions under the BSAV are credited to the individual members' pension accounts in the January following each fiscal year. Until pension payments begin, members' pension accounts are credited with an annual interest payment (guaranteed interest) on January 1 of each year. The interest rate is currently 0.25%.\n\nInformation regarding the Siemens Defined Contribution Pension Plan (BSAV)\n\n|                                                          | Contributions   | Contributions   |           |           | Defined benefit obligation   for all pension commitments   excluding deferred compensation 2   | Defined benefit obligation   for all pension commitments   excluding deferred compensation 2   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (Amounts in \u20ac)                                           | 2023            | 2022            | 2023      | 2022      | 2023                                                                                           | 2022                                                                                           |\n| Managing Board members   in office on September 30, 2023 |                 |                 |           |           |                                                                                                |                                                                                                |\n| Dr. Roland Busch                                         | 991,200         | 991,200         | 792,442   | 913,079   | 8,569,123                                                                                      | 7,814,364                                                                                      |\n| Cedrik Neike                                             | 616,896         | 616,896         | 502,591   | 581,069   | 4,350,198                                                                                      | 4,026,008                                                                                      |\n| Prof. Dr. Ralf P.

As a result, they include all the amounts actually paid to individual Managing Board members in the reporting period ('awarded compensation') and all the compensation that is legally due but not yet received ('due compensation').\n\nThe Bonus is reported under 'Short-term variable compensation' as 'due compensation' since the underlying services were fully rendered by the end of each period (September 30). Therefore, the Bonus payout amounts for the reporting year are reported, although payout only occurs after the end of each reporting year, in order to make reporting transparent and comprehensible and in order to guarantee a connection between performance and compensation in the reporting period.\n\nFurthermore, in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the Stock Awards from the 2019 and 2018 tranches allocated in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively, became due and were settled by transfer of Siemens shares. The value of Siemens shares at the time of transfer is reported under 'Long-term variable compensation.'\n\nIn connection with the due date and settlement of the Stock Awards for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, the tables also include the additional cash payments to eligible Managing Board members as a result of the Siemens Energy spin-off. The spin-off of Siemens Energy in fiscal 2020 led to adjustments in the stock-based compensation allocations agreed upon until the spin-off date. At the time when the 2019 and 2018 Stock Awards became due, the Managing Board members - like all other eligible employees - were, accordingly, entitled to receive an additional cash payment based on the spin-off ratio of 2:1 and on the Siemens Energy share price of \u20ac14.68 and \u20ac24.32, respectively, on the date when their respective stockbased compensation allocations became due.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to the amounts of compensation, Section 162 para. 1 sent. 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) requires disclosure of the relative proportion of total compensation represented by all fixed and variable compensation components. The relative proportions reported here refer to the compensation components 'awarded' and 'due' in the respective fiscal years in accordance with Section 162 para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nAlthough the service costs for Company pension plans are not to be classified as awarded and due compensation, they are also reported in the following table for purposes of transparency.",

The amounts reported under '2019 Stock Awards (vesting: 2018 - 2022)' and '2018 Stock Awards (vesting: 2017 - 2021)' include the value of the Stock Awards allocated by Siemens Ltd. China. Likewise, a portion of the additional cash payment attributable to the Stock Awards allocated by Siemens Ltd. China is included under 'Cash payment Siemens Energy spin-off.' For details, see chapter \"B.3.2.3 Transfer of Stock Awards in fiscal 2023 (2019 tranche).'\n- 3 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, Matthias Rebellius is CEO of Smart Infrastructure and CEO of Siemens Schweiz AG. The corresponding legal relationship is defined in a separate contract between Matthias Rebellius and Siemens Schweiz AG. The entire compensation he receives under the terms of his contract with Siemens Schweiz AG is deducted from his Managing Board compensation. Of the base salary and fringe benefits reported here, \u20ac710,428 and \u20ac34,312, respectively, were awarded and paid by Siemens Schweiz AG. Of the Bonus for fiscal 2023 reported here, \u20ac1,192,486 (corresponding to CHF 1,153,015 and converted into euros as of September 30, 2023) will be paid by Siemens Schweiz AG. Furthermore, employer contributions to pension plans paid by Siemens Schweiz AG are deducted from the amount for free disposal. Matthias Rebellius is subject to Swiss legislation on social insurance. Unlike in Germany, this subjection to social insurance also applies to compensation as a member of the Managing Board of Siemens AG. Since the clarification of this matter in May 2023, employer contributions of CHF5,785 (\u20ac6,048) have accrued. For the reverse transaction relating to the period from October 2020, when Matthias Rebellius joined the Managing Board, until May 2023, Siemens AG has incurred, in addition, one-time social insurance costs of CHF133,548 (\u20ac139,855). Neither the employer contributions nor the one-time social insurance costs are included in the compensation awarded and due to Matthias Rebellius in fiscal 2023.",

Compensation of Supervisory Board members\n\nThe currently applicable rules for Supervisory Board compensation are set out in Section 17 of the Articles of Association of Siemens AG. They have been in effect since October 1, 2021, and stem from a decision of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 3, 2021, in accordance with Section 113 para. 3 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The compensation system for Supervisory Board members submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and the proposed new version of Section 17 of the Articles of Association were approved by a majority of 97.49% of the valid votes cast. The compensation system approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting as well as the Articles of Association are publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE .\n\nSupervisory Board compensation consists entirely of fixed compensation; it reflects the responsibilities and scope of the work of the Supervisory Board members. Under the applicable rules, the members of the Supervisory Board receive base compensation  for  each  full  fiscal  year,  and  the  members  of  the  Audit  Committee,  the  Chairman's  Committee,  the Compensation Committee and the Innovation and Finance Committee receive additional compensation for their committee work. The Chairman and Deputy Chairs of the Supervisory Board as well as the chairs of the Audit Committee, the Chairman's Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Innovation and Finance Committee receive additional compensation.\n\nCompensation of members of the Supervisory Board and its committees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  the  event  of  changes  in  the  composition  of  the  Supervisory  Board  and/or  its  committees  within  a  fiscal  year, compensation is paid on a pro-rated basis, rounding up to the next full month.\n\nIn addition, the members of the Supervisory Board receive a fee of \u20ac2,000 for each of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees that they attend. Attendance at a meeting also includes participation via telephone, video conference or other similar customary means of communication. For attendance at several meetings on the same day, only a single fee is paid.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their duties and for any value-added tax to be paid on their compensation. For the performance of his duties, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is also entitled to an office with secretarial support and the use of a car service. No loans or advances from the Company are provided to members of the Supervisory Board.",

Comparative information on profit development and annual change in compensation\n\nThe following table shows, in accordance with Section 162 para. 1 sent. 2 No. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), Siemens' profit development, the annual change in the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members' compensation and the annual change in average employee compensation on a full-time equivalent basis over the last five fiscal years.\n\nProfit development is presented on the basis of the Siemens Group's key performance indicators revenue, comparable revenue growth and basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations. Through fiscal 2021, the latter was also one of the financial targets for the short-term variable compensation (Bonus) of the Managing Board and thus had a significant influence on the amount of the compensation of the Managing Board members. Since  fiscal 2022,  the comparative information has also included basic earnings per share before purchase price allocation. This key performance indicator supersedes basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations in the Bonus in accordance with the Siemens Financial Framework, which has been in effect since fiscal 2022. In accordance with Section 275 para. 3 No. 16 of the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch , HGB), the development of the net income of Siemens AG is also shown.\n\nThe compensation awarded and due to the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members in each fiscal year is presented in accordance with Section 162 para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Pension payments to former members of the Managing Board are not listed here since they do not depend on Siemens' profit development.\n\nThe presentation of average employee compensation is based on the size of the workforce, including trainees, employed by Siemens in Germany. In fiscal 2023, this workforce comprised on average 70,984 employees (full-time equivalent). By way of comparison, the Siemens Group had about 254,000 employees and trainees worldwide as of September 30, 2023. The figures exclude the workforce of Siemens Healthineers, which is not included in the presentation since it is a separately managed, publicly listed company.\n\nAverage  employee  compensation  comprises  the  personnel  costs  for  wages  and  salaries,  fringe  benefits,  employer contributions to social insurance and any short-term variable compensation components attributable to the fiscal year. For compensation in connection with share plans, the amounts received in the fiscal year are taken into account. Therefore, employee compensation is also equivalent, in principle, to awarded and due compensation within the meaning of Section 162 para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act  (AktG)  and  is  thus in line with Managing Board and Supervisory Board compensation.",

We have not audited the content of disclosures regarding appropriateness and marketability of the compensation in chapter B.2.3 APPROPRIATENESS OF THE COMPENSATION that is beyond the scope of Sec. 162 AktG.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board\n\nManagement  and  the  Supervisory  Board  of  Siemens  Aktiengesellschaft  are  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  the Compensation  Report and the related disclosures in compliance with the requirements of Sec. 162 AktG. In addition, management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a Compensation Report and the related disclosures that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this Compensation Report and the related disclosures based on our audit. We conducted our audit in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Compensation Report and the related disclosures are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts in the Compensation Report and the related disclosures. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures in order to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the Supervisory Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the Compensation Report for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 and the related disclosures comply, in all material respects, with the financial reporting provisions of Sec. 162 AktG. Our opinion on the Compensation  Report does not cover the content of the abovementioned disclosures of the Compensation Report that go beyond the scope of Sec. 162 AktG.\n\n## Other matter - formal audit of the Compensation Report\n\nThe audit of the content of the Compensation Report described in this auditor's report comprises the formal audit of the Compensation Report required by Sec. 162 (3) AktG and the issue of a report on this audit. As we are issuing an unqualified opinion on the audit of the content of the Compensation Report, this also includes the opinion that the disclosures pursuant to Sec. 162 (1) and (2) AktG are made in the Compensation Report in all material respects.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nBerlin and Munich, December 6, 2023\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Siemens AG once again demonstrated its operational excellence as a leading technology company by delivering an impressively high level of profitable growth. The Company's long-range strategy of  combining the real and the digital worlds and its rigorous orientation toward long-term growth fields paid off: Siemens benefited from strong, stable developments in the global markets - above all, from worldwide efforts to make value chains across the board more efficient, resilient and sustainable. The Company also made major investments to drive its innovative power and enhance its manufacturing capacities - while further strengthening its regional diversification.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Supervisory Board focused intensively in fiscal 2023 on the execution of Siemens' growth strategy. Siemens Xcelerator, our open digital business platform, gained more and more momentum and is the key element of Siemens' strategy to combine the real and the digital worlds. The business opportunities created by  digitalization and sustainability as well as the DEGREE sustainability framework were likewise priorities. In  addition, the elections at the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting enabled the Supervisory Board to successfully further develop its own profile of skills and expertise, particularly in the areas of technology and sustainability. Today, our Supervisory Board is more global and more diverse than ever before - and, as a result, excellently positioned to optimally support the Company also in the next phases of its development.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Supervisory Board performed in full the duties assigned to it by law, the Siemens Articles of Association and the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board. On the basis of detailed written and oral reports provided by the Managing Board, we monitored the Managing Board and advised it on the management of the Company. In my capacity as Chairman of the Super visory Board, I regularly exchanged information with the  President and Chief Executive Officer and other Managing Board members. As a result, the Supervisory Board was always\n\nkept up to date on projected business policies, Company planning - including financial, investment and personnel planning - and the Company's profitability and business operations as well as on the state of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group. We were directly involved at an early stage in all decisions of fundamental importance to the Company and discussed these decisions with the Managing Board intensively and in detail. To the extent that Supervisory Board approval of the decisions and measures of Company management was required by law, the Siemens Articles of Association or our Bylaws, the members of the Supervisory Board - prepared in some cases by the Supervisory Board's committees - issued such approval after intensive review and discussion.\n\nA special focus of our activities in fiscal 2023 was the further implementation of the Company's growth strategy. At our meetings and in additional informational sessions, we concerned ourselves intensively with the goals and priorities of Siemens' businesses and with the Managing Board's technology and personnel strategy. In this connection, we focused our attention on the accelerated transformation toward digitalization and sustainability and on business and technological innovation and the related opportunities for growth. Together with the Managing Board, we discussed markets, trends and growth fields. A further focus of our activities in fiscal 2023 - in addition to Siemens Xcelerator, our platform for driving the digital transformation - was Siemens AG's sustainability  strategy. We focused on s ustainability-related topics in the environment, social and governance (ESG) area. At the center was not only DEGREE, our Companywide sustainability framework - with the aspects of decarbonization, ethics, governance, resource efficiency, equity and employability - but also the positive impact the Company creates for customers with its port folio. The Supervisory Board discussed the risks and opportunities for the Company connected with social and environmental factors as well as the environmental and social impact of the Company's activities. The discussion made clear that sustainability is a strategic business opportunity for Siemens due to our strong portfolio focused",

The Supervisory Board discussed the risks and opportunities for the Company connected with social and environmental factors as well as the environmental and social impact of the Company's activities. The Supervisory Board also concerned itself with the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n## Topics at the plenary meetings of the Supervisory Board\n\nWe held a total of six regular plenary meetings in fiscal 2023. We also held an extraordinary constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board immediately after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 9, 2023. Six meetings were held in person and one in a so-called hybrid format that is, as an in-person meeting with the possibility of virtual participation. No meetings were held via telephone conference or in an exclusively virtual format. We also made one decision using other customary forms of communication. Topics of discussion at our regular plenary meetings were strategic progress, revenue, profit and employment development at Siemens AG and the Siemens Group, the Company's financial position and the results of its operations, personnel-related matters, the status of the implementation of Siemens Xcelerator, and sustainability. In addition, we concerned ourselves, as occasion required, with acquisition and divestment projects and with risks to the Company. The Supervisory Board and/or the Innovation and Finance Committee were regularly informed - within the stipulated legal framework - by the relevant Managing Board member about measures and decisions of fundamental importance at the Equity Investments, companies in which Siemens holds a majority stake. In addition, we regularly met in sessions without the Managing Board in attendance. In these closed sessions, we dealt with agenda items that concerned either the Managing Board itself or internal Supervisory Board matters.\n\nAt our meeting on November 16, 2022, the Managing Board reported to us on the Company's current business position,  including  personnel-related  matters  and sustainability, as of the fourth quarter. We discussed the key financial figures for fiscal 2022 and approved the budget for fiscal 2023. We also discussed the Managing Board's considerations regarding business activities at Large Drive Applications. On a recommendation by the Compensation  Committee,  we  also  determined  the Managing Board members' compensation for fiscal 2022 on the basis of calculated target achievement. A review conducted by an independent compensation expert con-\n\nfirmed the appropriateness of this compensation. We had already defined the performance criteria for the Managing Board's variable compensation for fiscal 2023 at our meeting on September 23, 2022. On this basis and on a recommendation by the Compensation Committee, we made a decision regarding target setting for Managing Board compensation for fiscal 2023 at our meeting on November 16, 2022. At this meeting, we also  approved the Corporate Governance Statement for  fiscal 2022 and endorsed a decision by the Managing Board regarding financing measures.

At this meeting, the Supervisory Board confirmed Birgit  Steinborn as the Supervisory Board's First Deputy Chairwoman and Dr. Werner Brandt as the Supervisory Board's Second Deputy Chairman, effective the beginning of their respective new electoral periods.

As part of a strategic focus, we concerned ourselves at this meeting - on the basis of the strategy discussions held in the previous weeks in smaller groups with the Managing Board - extensively and in detail with the growth targets and the further implementation of Siemens' strategy as a focused technology company. For Siemens Xcelerator, our open digital business platform, growth targets for the portfolio at the Siemens and business level were presented in detail and the status of the two pillars 'ecosystem' and 'marketplace' were discussed. We were also informed about the current business position of Siemens Healthineers and about progress in the integration of Varian. We approved amendments to the Bylaws for the Managing Board, for the Supervisory Board and for the Chairman's Committee, the Audit Committee, the Innovation and Finance Committee, and the Compensation Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAt our meeting on August 9, 2023, the Managing Board reported on the Company's current business and financial position and on personnel-related matters as of the third  quarter.  One  focus  of  the  meeting  was  the\n\nCompany's sustainability strategy. We concerned ourselves with the Company's strategic orientation and with progress in its sustainability-related transformation. We discussed the Company's business opportunities connected with sustainability-related factors and concerned ourselves with business potential particularly in the areas of decarbonization, energy efficiency and resource efficiency. Regulatory requirements - in particular, the EU taxonomy and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) - and their impact on Siemens were also topics of our discussions. In addition, we discussed the Siemens Energy investment and the format of the 2024 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Finally, we dealt with Managing Board compensation and approved a proposal regarding the engagement of the auditors of the Compensation Report for fiscal 2023.\n\nThe Supervisory Board meeting on September 22, 2023, was held in Berlin, where we gained an insight into the future-oriented project Siemensstadt Square and, on a tour of the R\u00f6hrenwerk tube plant, familiarized ourselves with the advanced production and manufacturing methods at the long-standing location. At the meeting, the Managing Board reported on the state of the Company. The personnel strategy of Siemens AG was again a focus of the meeting. Following up on its reporting on December 7, 2022, the Managing Board informed us about the strategic approach to systematic workforce training, which aimed to drive the organization's transformation and empower its employees to continuously learn and grow. We discussed the Managing Board's considerations regarding the 2024 budget. A further focus of the meeting was Managing Board compensation, whose appropriateness had been confirmed by an internal review. After preparation by and on a recommendation of the Compensation Committee, we approved an adjustment of the compensation system for the Managing Board as of fiscal 2024.

Finally, we discussed the results of the Supervisory Board's self-assessment in August and the recommendations and measures to be derived from it.\n\n## Corporate Governance Code\n\nAt our meeting on September 23, 2022, we approved a Declaration of Conformity in accordance with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz , AktG). Information on corporate governance is provided in the Corporate Governance Statement, which is publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW. SIEMENS.COM/CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE.

The  current Declaration of Conformity is also available in the Corporate Governance Statement.\n\n## Work in the Supervisory Board committees\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Supervisory Board had six standing committees. These committees prepare decisions and topics to be dealt with at the Supervisory Board's plenary meetings. Some of the Supervisory Board's decision-making powers have been delegated to these committees within the permissible legal framework. The committee chairpersons report to the Supervisory Board on their committees' work at the subsequent Board meeting. A list of the members and a detailed explanation of the tasks of the individual Supervisory Board committees are set out in the Corporate Governance Statement.\n\nThe  Chairman's Committee met eight times. Three meetings were held in person, two in a virtual format via video conference and three in a so-called hybrid format. The Chairman's Committee also made one decision using other customary means of communication. In my capacity as Chairman of the Chairman's Committee, I discussed topics of major importance with other Committee members also between meetings. The Committee concerned itself, in particular, with personnel-related matters, longterm succession planning for the composition of the Managing Board, corporate governance issues and the acceptance by Managing Board members of positions at other companies and institutions.\n\nThe Nominating Committee met three times. Two meetings were held in a virtual format via video conference and one in a so-called hybrid format. The Nominating Committee gave in-depth consideration to succession planning for the composition of the Supervisory Board. One focus of the Nominating Committee's activities in fiscal  2023  was  the  preparation  of  the  Supervisory Board's nominations of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board for election by the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Nominating Committee was supported in this connection by an external consulting firm. In selecting the potential candidates and in preparing a recommendation for the Supervisory Board's decision, the Nominating Committee gave particular consideration to the objectives that the Supervisory Board had previously approved for its composition - including the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept for the Supervisory Board - and to the Supervisory Board's qualification matrix. With a view to the regular elections of three shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board scheduled for 2025, the Nominating Committee also defined the topics for its work over the next few years and concerned itself with the regulatory framework, with the objectives that the Supervisory Board had approved for its composition, including the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept for the Supervisory Board, and with the qualification matrix.\n\nThe Mediation Committee had no need to meet.\n\nThe Compensation Committee met four times. All four meetings were held in person. The Compensation Committee also made one decision using other customary means of communication. The Committee prepared, in particular, Supervisory Board decisions regarding the definition of performance criteria and the targets for variable compensation, regarding the determination and regarding the review of the appropriateness of Managing Board compensation and regarding the Compensation Report. In addition, the Compensation Committee prepared the Supervisory Board's decision regarding the engagement of an auditor for the Compensation Report for fiscal 2023. One focus of the Compensation Committee's work was the preparation of the Supervisory Board's decision regarding the adjustment of the compensation system for the members of the Managing Board as of fiscal 2024. Independent external consultants were also involved in the preparation of this decision.",

The focus of the Committee's work was on innovationand technology-related topics. The Committee discussed the Company's progress, strategic priorities, technologies and growth opportunities relating to the industrial metaverse. In the strategic context, it concerned it self with progress regarding Siemens Xcelerator, the Company's open digital business platform. Detailed growth plans for the  portfolio  and  new  Siemens  Xcelerator  portfolio elements were presented. Expanding the ecosystem and increasing the relevance of the marketplace were also focus topics. Under the heading 'UX Transformation,' the Managing Board reported on progress in user-centered product  design.  The  Committee's  meetings  and/or decisions also focused on the discussion of the pension system and the preparation and approval of investment and divestment projects and/or financial measures. For example, the Innovation and Finance Committee endorsed the Managing Board's decision regarding the Siemens Industrial Campus  Erlangen Project.\n\nThe Audit Committee held six regular meetings. All the meetings were held in person. In the presence of the independent auditors, the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the head of accounting, the head of corporate audit and the head of the sustainability function, the Audit Committee dealt with the financial statements and the Combined  Management  Report  for  Siemens AG  and  the Siemens Group, including the non-financial information integrated into the Combined Management Report.

The Committee discussed the Half-year Financial Report and the quarterly statements with the Managing Board and the independent auditors. In the presence of the independent auditors, it also discussed the report on the auditors' review of the Company's Half-year Consolidated Financial Statements and of its Interim Group Management Report. As part of the preparation and implementation of the audit, the Audit Committee regularly exchanged views with the independent auditors without the Managing Board in attendance. In addition, it met\n\nregularly without the Managing Board and/or the independent auditors in attendance. Outside its meetings, the Chairman of the Audit Committee regularly exchanged views with the independent auditors regarding the progress of the audit and reported to the Audit Committee thereon. The Audit Committee recommended that the Supervisory Board propose to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting that Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, be elected independent auditors for fiscal 2023. It awarded the audit contract for fiscal 2023 to the independent auditors, who had been elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, defined the audit's focus areas and determined the auditors' fee. The Audit Committee approved the audit plan and defined the Audit Committee's focus areas. It monitored the selection, independence, qualification, rotation and efficiency of the independent auditors as well as the services they provided and concerned itself with the review of the quality of the audit of the financial statements. In fiscal 2023, against the backdrop of the Wirecard situation, the Audit Committee regularly discussed the role of Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, as the independent auditors of Wirecard AG. The Audit Committee questioned the independent auditors regarding this matter and assessed the impact on Siemens AG. The Audit Committee also dealt with the Company's accounting and accounting process, the appropriateness and effectiveness of its internal control system and its risk management system (including sustainability-related aspects), and the effectiveness, resources and findings of its internal audit as well as with reports concerning potential and pending legal disputes.

The Company supports them in this regard. Internal informational events are regularly offered to support targeted training measures. In March and July of fiscal 2023, three internal training events concerning strategically relevant technology and sustainability-related topics were held for all Supervisory Board members. The Supervisory Board informed  itself,  in  particular,  about  industrial  and generative artificial intelligence and discussed the technological  background,  application  and  impact  on Siemens' markets as well as the technology-related and regulatory challenges.\n\nNew Supervisory Board members can meet with Managing Board members and other managers with specialist responsibility to exchange views on current topics and topics of fundamental importance and thus gain an overview of Company-relevant matters (onboarding). In fiscal 2023, a separate informational event for the new members of the Supervisory Board was held on March 13, 2023, to familiarize those members, in particular, with the Company's business model and strategy and with the structures of the Siemens Group. As part of this onboarding program, Supervisory Board members also have the opportunity to visit the various locations of different Siemens business areas and gain an insight into the portfolio as well as production and manufacturing methods. Longer-serving Supervisory Board members may also attend onboarding events and regularly do so.\n\n## Disclosure of participation by individual Supervisory Board members in meetings\n\nThe average rate of participation by members in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees was 97 %. In fiscal 2023, meetings were held not only in person but, in some cases, also in a virtual format via video conference or in a so-called hybrid format.

Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, has served as the independent auditors of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group since fiscal 2009. Siegfried Keller has signed as auditor since fiscal 2023 and as auditor responsible for the audit also since fiscal 2023. Dr. Philipp Gaenslen has signed as auditor since fiscal 2021. The Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG and the Combined Management Report for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group were prepared in accordance with the requirements of German law.  The  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of  the Siemens Group were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the European Union (EU) and with the additional requirements of German law set out in Section 315  e  (1)  of  the  German  Commercial  Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch , HGB). The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group also comply with all IFRS requirements as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The independent auditors conducted their audit in accordance with Section 317 of the German Commercial Code and the EU Audit Regulation and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements as promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) as well as in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). The abovementioned documents as well as the Managing Board's proposal for the appropriation of net income were submitted to the Supervisory Board by the Managing Board in advance. The Audit Committee discussed the dividend proposal in detail at its meeting on November 14, 2023. It discussed the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group and the Combined Management Report in detail at its meeting on December 5, 2023. In this context, the Audit Committee concerned itself, in particular, with the key audit matters described in the independent auditors' respective opinions, including the audit procedures implemented. The\n\nAudit Committee's review also covered the non-financial information for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group that is included in the Combined Management Report. The audit reports prepared by the independent auditors were distributed to all members of the Supervisory Board and comprehensively reviewed at the Supervisory Board meeting on December 6, 2023, in the presence of the independent auditors, who reported on the scope, focal points and main findings of their audit, addressing, in particular, key audit matters, the Audit Committee's focus areas and the audit procedures implemented. No major weaknesses in the Company's internal control or risk management systems were reported. At this meeting, the Managing Board explained the financial statements of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group as well as the Company's risk management system.\n\nThe Supervisory Board concurs with the results of the audit. Following the definitive findings of the Audit Committee's examination and our own examination, we have no objections. The Managing Board prepared the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group. We approved the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG and  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of  the Siemens Group. In view of our approval, these financial statements are accepted as submitted. We endorsed the Managing Board's proposal that the net income available for distribution be used to pay out a dividend of \u20ac 4.70 per share entitled to a dividend and that the amount of net income attributable to shares of stock not entitled to receive a dividend for fiscal 2023 be carried forward.\n\nThe Sustainability Report for fiscal 2023 and the information regarding the EU taxonomy in the Combined Management Report for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group for fiscal 2023 and the independent auditors' related reports were dealt with at the Audit Committee meeting on December 5, 2023, and at the Supervisory Board meeting on December 6, 2023.",

The Companywide DEGREE program, which was approved by the Managing Board in fiscal 2021, intensified the focus of all Siemens businesses on ambitious sustainability targets - targets for environmental and social sustainability and good governance - even further. The Managing Board ensures that  the  risks  and  opportunities  for  the  Company connected with social and environmental factors and the environmental and social impact of the Company's activities are systematically identified and assessed.

Together with the Supervisory Board, the Managing Board prepares the Compensation Report. The Managing Board has established an appropriate and effective internal control system and risk management system that also covers sustainability\u00adrelated aspects. In addition, it ensures that the Company adheres to statutory requirements, official regulations and internal Company policies and works to achieve compliance with these provisions and policies within the Siemens Group. The Managing Board has established a comprehensive compliance  management  system  oriented  toward the Company's risk situation. Protection is offered to employees and third parties who provide information on unlawful behavior within the Company. Details on the compliance management system are available on the  Siemens  Global  Website  at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ SUSTAINABILITYINFORMATION .\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  has  issued  Bylaws  for  the Managing Board that contain the assignment of different portfolios and the rules for cooperation both within the Managing Board and between the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board as well as rules for the so\u00adcalled Equity Investments. In accordance with these Bylaws, the Managing Board is divided into the portfolio of the President and CEO and a variety of Managing Board port\u00ad folios. The Managing Board members responsible for the individual Managing Board portfolios are defined in a business  assignment plan that is determined by the Supervisory Board. As the Managing Board member with responsibility for the People & Organization port\u00ad folio, the Labor Director ( Arbeitsdirektor ) is appointed in accordance with the requirements of Section 33 of the German Codetermination Act ( Mitbestimmungsgesetz , MitbestG). When making recommendations for the first\u00ad time appointments of Managing Board members, it is to be taken into account that the terms of these appoint\u00ad ments shall not, as a rule, exceed three years.\n\nAs a rule, the portfolio assigned to an individual member is  that  member's  own  responsibility.  Activities  and\n\ntransactions in a particular Managing Board portfolio that  are  considered  to  be  extraordinarily  important for the  Company or associated with an extraordinary economic  risk  require  the  prior  consent  of  the  full Managing Board. The same applies to activities and transactions for which the President and CEO or another member of the  Managing Board demands a prior  decision by the  Managing Board. The President and CEO is respon\u00ad sible for the coordination of all Managing Board port\u00ad folios. The Managing Board had no standing committee in  fiscal 2023.

The Managing Board informs the Supervisory Board regularly, compre\u00ad hensively and without delay on all issues of importance to the entire Company with regard to strategy (including the Company's sustainability strategy), planning,  business development, financial position, results of operations, compliance and entrepreneurial risks. At regular inter\u00ad vals, the Managing Board also discusses the status of strategy implementation with the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe members of the Managing Board are subject to a comprehensive prohibition on competitive activity for the period of their employment at Siemens AG. They are com\u00ad mitted to serving the interest of the Company. When mak\u00ad ing their decisions, they may not be guided by personal interests, nor may they exploit for their own advantage business opportunities offered to the Company. Manag\u00ad ing Board members may engage in secondary activities in particular, hold supervisory board positions outside the Siemens Group - only with the approval of the Chairman's Committee of the Supervisory Board.

As stipulated by the German Codetermination Act, half of its members represent Company shareholders, and half represent Company employees. The shareholder repre\u00ad sentatives on the Supervisory Board are elected at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting by a simple majority vote. Elections to the Supervisory Board are conducted, as a rule, on an individual basis. The employee representa\u00ad tives on the Supervisory Board are elected in accordance with the provisions of the German Codetermination Act. Further information regarding the Supervisory Board members  and  their  memberships,  which  are  to  be disclosed pursuant to Section 285 No. 10 of the German Commercial  Code,  are  set  out  in  Section 11  of  this Cor porate Governance Statement. The curricula vitae of the Supervisory Board members are publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ SUPERVISORY-BOARD and updated annually.\n\nThe Supervisory Board oversees and advises the Manag\u00ad ing Board in its management of the Company's business. At regular intervals, the Supervisory Board discusses business development, planning, strategy (including sustainability strategy) and strategy implementation. It reviews  the  Annual  Financial  Statements  of Siemens AG, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group, the Combined Management Report of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group (including non\u00ad financial matters), and the proposal for the appropriation of net income. It approves the Annual Financial State\u00ad ments of Siemens AG as well as the Consolidated Finan\u00ad cial Statements of the Siemens Group, based on the results of the preliminary review conducted by the Audit Committee and taking into account the reports of the independent auditors. The Supervisory Board approves the Managing Board's proposal for the appropriation of net income and the Report of the Supervisory Board to the  Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting.  The  Supervisory Board is jointly responsible with the Managing Board for the preparation of the Compensation Report. In addition, the Company's adherence to statutory provisions, official regulations and internal Company policies (compliance) are monitored by the Supervisory Board and / or the Audit Committee.  The  Supervisory  Board's  oversight  and advisory activities also encompass, in particular, sustain\u00ad ability\u00adrelated topics in the environment, social and governance (ESG) area. The Managing Board reports regularly to the Supervisory Board on Siemens' Company\u00ad\n\nwide sustainability strategy and on the status of this strategy's implementation. The Supervisory Board deals with both the risks and the opportunities for Siemens relating to social and environmental factors and the environmental and social impact of the Company's activ\u00ad ities. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee also concern themselves with sustainability reporting, which includes the Sustainability Report in addition to re\u00ad porting on non\u00adfinancial matters in the Combined Man\u00ad agement  Report,  and  are  kept  up  to  date  on  new developments and the status of their implementation at Siemens. In addition, the Supervisory Board appoints and dismisses  the  members  of  the  Managing  Board  and determines each member's portfolios. The Supervisory Board approves - on the basis of a proposal by the Compensation Committee - the compensation system for Managing Board members and defines their concrete com\u00ad pensation in accordance with this system. It sets the indi\u00ad vidual targets for the variable compensation and the total compensation of each individual Managing Board mem\u00ad ber, reviews the appropriateness of total compen sation and regularly reviews the Managing Board  compensation system. Important Managing Board  decisions - such as those regarding major acquisitions, divestments, fixed as\u00ad set investments or financial  measures - require Supervi\u00ad sory Board approval unless the Bylaws for the  Supervisory Board specify that such authority be delegated to the Inno\u00ad vation and Finance Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\nSeparate preparatory meetings of the shareholder repre\u00ad sentatives and of the employee representatives are held regularly in order to prepare the Supervisory Board meet\u00ad ings. The Supervisory Board also meets regularly without the Managing Board in attendance. Every Supervisory Board member must disclose conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board. Information regarding conflicts of interest that may have arisen and their handling is provided in the Report of the Supervisory Board. Special informational (onboarding) events are held in order to familiarize new Supervisory Board members with the Company's business model and the structures of the Siemens Group. The Supervisory Board members take part, on their own responsibility, in the educational and training measures necessary for the performance of their duties - measures relating, for example, to changes in the legal framework and new, groundbreaking tech\u00ad nologies. The Company supports them in this regard. Internal informational events are offered when necessary to  support targeted training measures.",

As  a  cross\u00adcutting  issue, sustainability touches on the areas of responsibility of several committees. To the extent that sustainability affects  reporting,  the  Audit  Committee  considers sustainability\u00adrelated questions in detail and reports on these matters at the Supervisory Board's plenary meet\u00ad ings. To prepare for discussions and decisions at these meetings, the sustainability\u00adrelated aspects of Managing Board compensation are dealt with in the Compensation Committee.\n\nFurther details regarding the operation and composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees are pro\u00ad vided in the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board and the bylaws for its committees, which are publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE .\n\n## SUPERVISORY BOARD SELF-ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Supervisory Board and its committees regularly con\u00ad duct reviews - either internally or with the involvement of external consultants - in order to determine how efficiently they perform their duties.

Targets, within the meaning of Section 76 para. 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act, for the quota of women at the two management levels below the Managing Board; Information on Managing Board compliance with the participation require\u00ad ment and Supervisory Board compliance with minimum gender quota requirements\n\nPursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act, the Man\u00ad aging Board of Siemens AG must include at least one woman and at least one man (minimum participation requirement). In fiscal 2023, Siemens AG complied with this  requirement. Beyond the minimum participation re\u00ad quirement, the consideration of women is an essential aspect of the Supervisory Board's long\u00adterm succession planning for the Managing Board.\n\nWhen filling managerial positions at the Company, the Managing Board takes diversity into account and, in partic\u00ad ular, aims for an appropriate consideration of women and internationality. In May 2022, in compliance with the German legal requirements set out in Section 76 para. 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Managing Board set the targets for the percentage of women in  management positions at Siemens AG that will apply until September 30, 2025, as follows: 30 % for the first management level below the Managing Board and 25 % for the second management level below the Managing Board. On the basis of projected employee figures, women will, accordingly, hold a total of four of the 13 positions at Siemens AG at the first management level below the Managing Board and a t otal of 32 of the 126 positions at Siemens AG at the second management level below the Managing Board. For the Siemens Group worldwide, the targets set out in the  Companywide  DEGREE  sustainability  framework continue to apply without change.\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board fulfilled the legal requirements regarding the minimum gender quota in the reporting period.\n\nStatutory provisions on the equal participation of men and women in management positions that may be applicable to Group companies other than Siemens AG remain unaffected.\n\n## 6.  Diversity concept for the Managing Board and long\u00adterm succession planning\n\nFor the composition of the Managing Board, the follow\u00ad ing diversity concept applies:\n\n'The goal of this diversity concept is to achieve a com\u00ad position that is as diverse as possible and comprises individuals who complement one another in a Manag\u00ad ing Board that provides strong leadership and brings different perspectives to the management of the Company as well as to ensure that, as a group, the members of the Managing Board have all the know\u00ad how and skills that are considered essential in view of Siemens' activities.\n\nWhen selecting members of the Managing Board, the Supervisory Board pays close attention to candidates' personal suitability, integrity, convincing leadership qualities, international experience, expertise in their prospective areas of responsibility, achievements to date and knowledge of the Company as well as their ability to adjust business models and processes in a changing world. Diversity with respect to such charac\u00ad teristics as age and gender as well as professional and educational background is an important selection cri\u00ad terion for appointments to Managing Board positions. When selecting members of the Managing Board, the Supervisory Board also gives special consideration to the following factors:\n\n- In addition to the expertise and management and leadership experience required for their specific tasks, the Managing Board members shall have the broadest possible range of knowledge and experi\u00ad ence and the widest possible educational and pro\u00ad fessional backgrounds.\n- Taking the Company's international orientation into account, the composition of the Managing Board shall reflect internationality with respect to different cultural backgrounds and international experience (such as extensive professional experi\u00ad ence in foreign countries and responsibility for business activities in foreign countries in areas that are relevant for Siemens).\n- As a group, the Managing Board shall have experi\u00ad ence in the business areas that are important for Siemens - in particular, in the industry, infrastruc\u00ad ture, energy, mobility and healthcare sectors.",

According to the legal requirement applicable to Siemens AG (Section 76 para. 3a of the German Stock Corpora\u00ad tion Act), the Managing Board must include at least one woman and at least one man (minimum partic\u00ad ipation requirement). Beyond the minimum partici\u00ad pation requirement, the consideration of women is an essential aspect of the Supervisory Board's long\u00ad term succession planning for the Managing Board.\n- It is considered helpful if different age groups are represented on the Managing Board. In accordance with the recommendation of the Code, the Super\u00ad visory Board has defined an age limit for the mem\u00ad bers of the Managing Board. In keeping with this limit, the members of the Managing Board are, as a rule, to be not older than 67 years of age.\n\nWhen making an appointment to a specific Managing Board position, the decisive factor is always the Com\u00ad pany's best interest, taking into consideration all cir\u00ad cumstances in the individual case.'\n\n## Implementation of the diversity concept for the Managing Board in fiscal 2023\n\nThe diversity concept for the Managing Board is imple\u00ad mented as part of the process for making appointments to  the  Managing  Board.  When  selecting  candidates and / or making proposals for the appointment of Manag\u00ad ing Board members, the Supervisory Board and / or the Chairman's Committee of the Supervisory Board take into account the requirements defined in the diversity con\u00ad cept for the Managing Board.\n\nIn its current composition, the Managing Board fulfills all the requirements of the diversity concept. The Managing Board members have a broad range of knowledge, expe\u00ad rience and educational and professional backgrounds as well as international experience. The Managing Board has all the knowledge and experience that is considered essential in view of Siemens' activities. As a group, the Managing Board has experience in the business areas that are important for Siemens - in particular, in the\n\nindustry, infrastructure, energy, mobility and healthcare sectors - as well as many years of experience in tech\u00ad nology (including information technology, digitalization and cybersecurity), sustainability, transformation, pro\u00ad curement, manufacturing, research and development, sales, finance, risk management, law (including compli\u00ad ance) and human resources.\n\nSiemens AG complies with the minimum participation requirement set out in Section 76 para. 3 a of the German Stock Corporation Act. The Managing Board has one female member, Judith Wiese. Beyond the minimum participation requirement, the consideration of women is a key component of the Supervisory Board's long\u00adterm succession planning for the Managing Board. Different age groups are represented on the Managing Board. No Managing Board member has reached the stipulated regular age limit.\n\n## Long-term succession planning for the Managing Board\n\nJointly with the Managing Board and with the support of the Chairman's Committee, the Supervisory Board con\u00ad ducts long\u00adterm succession planning for the Managing Board. Long\u00adterm succession planning is systematic and based on the strategic target setting of the Company. Taking into account the concrete qualification require\u00ad ments and the diversity concept that the Supervisory Board has approved for the Managing Board's compo\u00ad sition, the Chairman's Committee prepares ideal profiles. When a concrete decision regarding succession is to be made, the Chairman's Committee compiles a shortlist of the available candidates on the basis of these profiles. Structured interviews are then conducted with these candidates. After the interviews, a recommendation is submitted to the Supervisory Board for approval. When developing the profile of requirements and selecting candidates, the Supervisory Board and / or the Chairman's Committee  are  supported,  if  necessary,  by  external consultants.",

Objectives regarding the Supervisory Board's composition as well as the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept for the Super\u00ad visory Board\n\nIn September 2022, the Supervisory Board approved the objectives for its composition including the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept:\n\n'The  composition  of  the  Supervisory  Board  of Siemens AG shall be such that the Supervisory Board's ability to effectively monitor and advise the Managing Board is ensured. In this connection, mutually comple\u00ad mentary collaboration among members with a wide range  of  personal  and  professional  backgrounds and diversity with regard to internationality, age and gender are considered helpful.\n\n## Profile of required skills and expertise\n\nThe candidates proposed for election to the Super\u00ad visory Board shall have the knowledge, skills and experience necessary to carry out the functions of a Supervisory Board member in a multinational com\u00ad pany oriented toward the capital markets and to safe\u00ad guard the reputation of Siemens in public. In particu\u00ad lar, care shall be taken with regard to the personality, integrity, commitment and professionalism of the individuals proposed for election.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that, in the Supervisory Board, as a group, all the knowhow and experience is available that is considered essential in view of Siemens' acti\u00ad vities. This includes, for instance, knowledge and experience in the areas of technology (including infor\u00ad mation technology, digitalization and cybersecurity), sustainability, transformation, procurement, manu\u00ad facturing, research and development, sales, finance, risk management, law (including compliance) and human resources. In addition, the members of the Supervisory Board shall collectively have knowledge and experience in the business areas that are impor\u00ad tant for Siemens, in particular, in the areas of industry, infrastructure, energy, mobility and healthcare. As a group, the members of the Supervisory Board are to be familiar with the sector in which the Company operates. In accordance with the German Stock Cor\u00ad poration Act, at least one member of the Supervisory\n\nBoard must have knowledge and expertise in the area of accounting, and at least one additional member of the Supervisory Board must have knowledge and expertise in the auditing of financial statements. The expertise in the field of accounting shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems and the expertise in the field of auditing  shall  consist  of  special  knowledge  and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit and assurance. The chairman of the audit committee shall have appropriate exper\u00ad tise in at least one of the two areas and shall be inde\u00ad pendent. In particular, the Supervisory Board shall also include members who have leadership experi\u00ad ence as senior executives or members of a supervisory board (or comparable body) at a major company with international operations.\n\nWhen a new member is to be appointed, a review shall be performed to determine which of the areas of expertise deemed desirable for the Supervisory Board are to be strengthened.\n\n## Internationality\n\nTaking the Company's international orientation into account, care shall be taken to ensure that the Super\u00ad visory Board has an adequate number of members with extensive international experience. The goal is to make sure that the present considerable share of Supervisory Board members with extensive inter\u00ad national experience is maintained.\n\n## Diversity\n\nWith regard to the composition of the Supervisory Board, attention shall be paid to achieving sufficient diversity. Not only is appropriate consideration to be given to women. Diversity of cultural heritage and a wide range of educational and professional back\u00ad grounds, experiences and ways of thinking are also to be promoted. When considering possible candidates for new elections or for filling Supervisory Board positions that have become vacant, the Supervisory Board shall give appropriate consideration to diversity at an early stage in the selection process.\n\nIn accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board is composed of at least 30 % women and at least 30 % men.

        "page_content": "Committee shall continue to include at least one female  member.\n\n## Independence\n\nThe Supervisory Board shall include what the share\u00ad holder representatives on the Supervisory Board con\u00ad sider to be an appropriate number of independent shareholder representatives. More than half of the shareholder representatives shall be independent of the Company and its Managing Board. Substantial and not merely temporary - conflicts of interest are to be avoided.\n\nNo more than two former members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG shall belong to the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board members shall have sufficient time to exercise their mandates with the necessary regularity and diligence.\n\n## Limits on age and on length of membership\n\nIn compliance with the age limit stipulated by the Super\u00ad visory Board in its Bylaws, only individuals who are no older than 70 years of age shall, as a rule, be nominated for election to the Supervisory Board. Nominations shall take into account the regular limit established by the Supervisory Board, which restricts membership on the Supervisory Board to a maximum of three full terms of office. It is considered helpful if different age groups are represented on the Supervisory Board.'\n\n## Implementation of the objectives regarding the Supervisory Board's composition as well as the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept for the Supervisory Board in fiscal 2023; Independent members of the Supervisory Board\n\nWithin  the  framework  of  the  selection  process  and the nomination of candidates for the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board as well as the Nominating Com\u00ad mittee of the Supervisory Board take into account the objectives  regarding the Supervisory Board's composition and the  requirements defined in its diversity concept. In pre paring the nominations of the seven shareholder representatives elected by the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the  Supervisory Board and the Nominating Committee took these objectives - including the profile\n\nof required skills and expertise and the diversity con\u00ad cept - into consideration.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is of the opinion that, with its current composition, it meets the objectives for its compo\u00ad sition and fulfills the profile of required skills and expertise as well as the diversity concept. The Supervisory Board members have the specialist and personal qualifications considered necessary. As a group, they are familiar with the sector in which the Company operates and have the knowl\u00ad edge, skills and experience essential for Siemens in the areas of technology (including information technology, digitalization and cybersecurity), transformation, procure\u00ad ment, manufacturing, research and development, sales, finance, risk management, law (including compliance) and human resources. Due to the presence in the Supervisory Board of expertise in the sustainability\u00adrelated matters important for Siemens, the Supervisory Board is in a position to monitor the way in which environmental and social sustainability is taken into consideration in the Company's strategic orientation and in Company planning. Knowledge and experience in the business areas important for Siemens - in particular, in the industry, infrastructure, energy, mobility and healthcare sectors - are also present in the Supervisory Board. A considerable number of Super\u00ad visory Board members are engaged in international activi\u00ad ties and / or have many years of international experience. Appropriate consideration has been given to diversity in the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board currently has nine female members, of whom five are shareholder repre\u00ad sentatives and four are employee representatives. As a result, 45 % of the Supervisory Board members are women. Dr. Nathalie von Siemens is a member of the Nominating Committee.\n\nIn the estimation of the shareholder representatives, the Supervisory Board now includes ten independent share\u00ad holder  representatives  -  namely,  Dr. Werner  Brandt, Dr.  Regina E. Dugan, Keryn Lee James, Martina Merz, Beno\u00eet Potier, Kasper R\u00f8rsted, Dr. Nathalie von Siemens, Jim Hagemann  Snabe, Grazia Vittadini and Matthias Zachert - and thus an appropriate number of members who are independent within the meaning of the Code. The regulations establishing limits on age and restricting  membership in the Supervisory Board to three full terms of office are complied with.\n\nThe implementation status of the profile of required skills and expertise is disclosed below in the form of a qualifi\u00ad cation matrix.",

Share transactions by members of the Managing and Supervisory Boards\n\nPursuant to Article 19 of EU Regulation No. 596 / 2014 of the European Parliament and Council of April 16, 2014, on market abuse (Market Abuse Regulation), members of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are legally required to disclose all transactions conducted on their own account relating to the shares or debt instru\u00ad ments of Siemens AG or to the derivatives or financial instruments linked thereto if the total value of such trans\u00ad actions entered into by a board member or any closely associated person in any calendar year reaches or ex\u00ad ceeds \u20ac 20,000. All transactions reported to Siemens AG in fiscal 2023 have been duly published and are available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ DIRECTORS-DEALINGS .\n\n## 9.  Annual Shareholders' Meeting and investor relations\n\nShareholders exercise their rights at the Annual Share\u00ad holders' Meeting. An ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meet\u00ad ing normally takes place within the first five months of each fiscal year. The Annual Shareholders' Meeting de\u00ad cides, among other things, on the appropriation of net income, the ratification of the acts of the members of the Managing and Supervisory Boards, and the appointment of the independent auditors. Amendments to the Articles of Association and measures that change the Company's capital stock are approved at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and implemented by the Managing Board. The Managing Board facilitates shareholder participation in this meeting through electronic communications - in par\u00ad ticular, via the Internet - and enables shareholders who are unable to attend the meeting to vote by proxy. Proxies can also be reached during the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Furthermore, shareholders may exercise their right to vote in writing or by means of electronic commu\u00ad nications (absentee voting). The Managing Board may enable shareholders to participate in the Annual Share\u00ad holders' Meeting without the need to be present at the venue and without a proxy and to exercise some or all of their rights fully or partially by means of electronic com\u00ad munications. The Company enables shareholders to follow the entire Annual Shareholders' Meeting via the Internet. Shareholders may submit motions regarding the proposals\n\nof the Managing and Supervisory Boards and may contest decisions of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Sharehold\u00ad ers owning Siemens stock with an aggregate notional value of \u20ac 100,000 or more may also demand the judicial appointment of special auditors to examine specific is\u00ad sues. The reports, documents and information required by law for the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, including the Annual Financial Report, can be downloaded from the Siemens Global Website. The same applies to the agenda for the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and to any counter\u00ad proposals or shareholders' nominations that may require disclosure. For the election of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board, a detailed curriculum vitae of every candidate is published.\n\nPursuant to a decision by the Annual Shareholders' Meet\u00ad ing on February 9, 2023, the Articles of Association have been amended and the Managing Board has been autho\u00ad rized to allow for the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held without shareholders or their representatives being physically present at the place of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting (virtual shareholders' meeting). This authoriza\u00ad tion applies to holding virtual shareholders' meetings in a period of two years after the registration of this amend\u00ad ment in the Company's commercial registers. This regis\u00ad tration took place in May 2023.\n\nAs part of our investor relations activities, we inform our investors comprehensively about developments within the Company. For communication purposes, Siemens makes extensive use of the Internet. We publish quarterly statements, Half\u00adyear and Annual Financial Reports, earnings  releases,  ad  hoc  announcements,  analyst presentations, letters to shareholders and press releases as well as the financial calendar for the current year, which  contains  the  publication  dates  of  significant financial communications and the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/INVESTORS . The  Chairman of the  Supervisory Board regularly dis\u00ad cusses Supervisory\u00adBoard\u00adspecific topics with investors.\n\nThe Articles of Association of Siemens AG, the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board, the bylaws for the most important Supervisory Board committees, the Bylaws for the Managing Board, our Declarations of Conformity with  the  Code  and  a  variety  of  other  corporate\u00ad governance\u00ad related  documents  are  posted  on  the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ CORPORATE-  GOVERNANCE .",

        "page_content": "This document contains statements related to our future business and financial performance and future events or developments involving Siemens that may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified by words such as 'expect,' 'look forward to,' 'anticipate,' 'intend,' 'plan,' 'believe,' 'seek,' 'estimate,' 'will,' 'project' or words of similar meaning. We may also make forwardlooking statements in other reports, in prospectuses, in presentations, in material delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In addition, our representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on the current expectations and certain assumptions of Siemens' management, of which many are beyond Siemens' control. These are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and factors, including, but not limited to, those described in disclosures, in particular in the chapter Report on expected developments and associated material opportunities and risks in the Combined Management Report of the Siemens Report (siemens.com/siemensreport).  Should  one  or  more  of  these  risks  or  uncertainties  materialize,  should  decisions,  assessments  or requirements of regulatory authorities deviate from our expectations, should events of force majeure, such as pandemics, unrest or acts of war, occur or should underlying expectations including future events occur at a later date or not at all or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results, performance or achievements of Siemens may (negatively or positively) vary materially from those described explicitly or implicitly  in  the  relevant  forward-looking  statement.  Siemens  neither  intends,  nor  assumes  any  obligation,  to  update  or  revise  these forward-looking statements in light of developments which differ from those anticipated.\n\nThis document includes - in the applicable financial reporting framework not clearly defined - supplemental financial measures that are or may be alternative performance measures (non-GAAP-measures). These supplemental financial measures should not be viewed in isolation or as alternatives to measures of Siemens' net assets and financial positions or results of operations as presented in accordance with  the  applicable  financial  reporting  framework  in  its  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Other  companies  that  report  or  describe similarly titled alternative performance measures may calculate them differently.\n\nDue  to  rounding,  numbers  presented  throughout  this  and  other  documents  may  not  add  up  precisely  to  the  totals  provided  and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.\n\nThis document is an English language translation of the German document. In case of discrepancies, the German language document is the sole authoritative and universally valid version.\n\nFor technical reasons, there may be differences between the accounting records appearing in this document and those published pursuant to legal requirements.",
