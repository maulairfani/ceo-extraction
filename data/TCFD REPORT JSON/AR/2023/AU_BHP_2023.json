        "page_content": "## Chair's review\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nI am pleased to provide BHP's Annual Report for FY2023.\n\nIn FY2023, we achieved strong performance and made progress towards our social value and sustainability commitments, targets and goals. However, these achievements were overshadowed by the tragic deaths of our colleagues Jody Byrne at our Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) operations and Nathan Scholz at Olympic Dam during the second half of the year. Our investigation into Jody Byrne's death at WAIO has been completed and the findings shared with industry peers. Our investigation into Nathan Scholz's death at Olympic Dam is ongoing. We are determined to learn from these events and prevent them from happening again.\n\n## Our priorities\n\nDuring FY2023, our key priority areas were safety, culture and capability, capital discipline, portfolio and social value. I met with many of our shareholders and visited sites in Australia, Singapore, Chile and Brazil where I had the opportunity to engage with our workforce, suppliers, customers, local communities and Indigenous partners. These discussions reinforced the work we have been doing across these priority areas. I am confident our ongoing delivery against these key areas will position BHP to continue to grow long-term value for our shareholders and create social value with our partners and stakeholders.\n\n## Safety and culture\n\nThe safety of our people is our highest priority. I am deeply saddened by the deaths of Jody Byrne and Nathan Scholz, and I offer my condolences to their family, friends and colleagues.\n\nOur commitment to the goal of zero fatalities and serious injuries at BHP remains unwavering and, following these tragic events, we have enhanced the organisation's focus on the execution of our safety systems and processes in the field and strengthened our control environment. We continue to drive the safety culture needed to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries at BHP.\n\nOur commitment to safety includes addressing sexual harassment, racism and bullying in our workplaces. We are determined to eliminate these harmful behaviours at BHP. There is more to do and we are committed to providing a safe, inclusive and diverse workplace culture where our people can perform at their best.\n\nWe know that inclusive and diverse teams are safer and more productive. We are on track to achieve our aspirational goal for a gender-balanced workforce by the end of FY2025 and have doubled the representation of women since CY2016 when we set our gender-balance goal.\n\n## Portfolio\n\nOur objective is to position BHP's portfolio of commodities to create value for today and the future. We have reshaped our portfolio to align with the global megatrends of decarbonisation, electrification, urbanisation and a rising population. Mining is essential for decarbonisation and the energy transition. The world needs copper for renewable energy, nickel for electric vehicles, and iron ore and higher-quality metallurgical coal for steel to build new infrastructure. And we're moving into potash, which will be vital to food security and more sustainable farming to support a growing population.\n\nBHP has a world-class portfolio of assets that stands to benefit from the increased demand generated from the global megatrends unfolding around us, and we have made changes to our portfolio this year to further align to these megatrends.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring FY2023, our key priority areas were safety, culture and capability, capital discipline, portfolio and social value.\n\nI am confident our ongoing delivery against these key areas will position BHP to continue to grow long-term value for our shareholders and create social value with our partners and stakeholders.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe acquired OZ Minerals in May 2023, adding complementary copper and nickel assets in Australia to Olympic Dam and Nickel West. We are consolidating our metallurgical coal portfolio to focus on higher-quality coals preferred by our steelmaking customers and the Jansen Potash Project in Canada is progressing, with first production now expected in late CY2026.\n\n## Delivering value\n\nOur Capital Allocation Framework is used to assess the most effective and efficient way to deploy capital and is embedded in our decision making at BHP. In FY2023, through our Capital Allocation Framework, we were able to deliver substantial shareholder returns and create financial and social value for our partners and stakeholders.\n\nThe Board determined dividends totaling US$8.6 billion to shareholders for the year, taking the total amount in cash dividends for the past three years to over US$40 billion.\n\nIn addition to the value delivered to our shareholders, we created significant financial value in the communities where we operate through payments to suppliers, wages to our employees, community contributions and taxes and royalties paid to governments. In FY2023, our total economic contribution was US$54.2 billion, including US$2.6 billion to local suppliers who support our operations by providing goods and services.\n\nWe also delivered tangible social value outcomes in each of the six pillars of our social value framework. Our social value pillars are focused on: decarbonisation, the environment, Indigenous partnerships, workforce, communities and supply chains. Key highlights in FY2023 included:\n\n- -  We are working with our steel manufacturing customers to develop solutions to help them reduce their greenhouse gas emission intensity, and have collaborative partnerships with seven major steelmakers, which together represent a total of approximately 19 per cent of reported global steel production according to recent World Steel Association data. Through these partnerships, we are supporting the industry to develop technologies and pathways that have the potential to reduce the GHG emission intensity of steelmaking.\n- -  We released our updated Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in Australia, which was recognised with 'Elevate' status from Reconciliation Australia, which is provided to organisations with a proven track record in respectful engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The RAP was developed in partnership with many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses, communities and peak bodies across Australia.\n- -  We are making progress against our social value metrics for Indigenous workforce participation. BHP is the largest Indigenous employer in the Australian resources sector and we have increased Indigenous employment in our operations in Chile and at our Jansen Potash Project in Canada.\n\n## Board evaluation and governance review\n\nOur structured and continuous Board succession and renewal process allows the Board to continue to be fit for purpose and have a balance of experience and fresh perspectives.\n\nAs part of the renewal process, John Mogford and Malcolm Broomhead retired from the Board in October 2022 and November 2022, respectively. I would like to thank John and Malcolm for their outstanding contribution to the Board and commitment to value creation for BHP shareholders.\n\nIn FY2023, an external evaluation of the Board was carried out to assess the performance and effectiveness of the Board and its Committees. Separately, we reviewed the Board and Committee responsibilities and refreshed the Board and Committee governance documents to streamline our governance approach, including on key matters such as climate, technology and people.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBHP will face challenges and uncertainty in FY2024. Cost inflation is expected to remain in the short to medium term and the changing geopolitical landscape is impacting global markets. I believe BHP is well positioned to successfully navigate these challenges and continue to create value for shareholders and broader communities, customers, suppliers and partners.\n\nWe have built a global business that can make the most of the many opportunities before us. It's an exciting time to be at BHP.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKen MacKenzie\n\nChair",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive Officer's review\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nBHP performed solidly in FY2023. Our commitment to operational excellence saw us achieve another year of strong production results and cost performance. We continued to create and advance further growth options across our portfolio. This consistent execution of our strategy gives me great confidence in our ability to continue to generate long-term value for our shareholders, partners, customers and stakeholders.\n\nHowever, in reviewing our performance each year we always look first to safety. Tragically, this year saw two BHP colleagues, Jody Byrne and Nathan Scholz, lose their lives in the workplace. These events underscore the absolute importance of safety and we are resolute in our commitment to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries at BHP.\n\nOur operational performance was strong in FY2023, with record annual production achieved at Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO), where we remain the lowest-cost major producer, and at Spence and Olympic Dam. At Escondida, we navigated operational challenges to deliver solid production, and our Queensland coal operations achieved strong underlying performance, offsetting the impact of significant wet weather.\n\nWe saw lower revenue in FY2023 due to weaker prices in key commodities. On the cost side, we managed the impact of inflation better than our competitors through disciplined cost control. We remain focused on productivity to stay competitive, which will remain important in FY2024 as we operate amid continued global economic volatility.\n\nWe delivered earnings of more than US$13 billion and announced dividends totalling 170 US cents per share for the year. That's US$8.6 billion flowing back to our investors, including the many millions of Australians who hold BHP shares directly or via their superannuation funds. Our total economic contribution paid to governments, suppliers, contractors, communities and employees for the year was US$54.2 billion, including US$13.8 billion paid in taxes and royalties.\n\n## Positioned for growth\n\nPopulation growth, rising global living standards and decarbonisation of the global energy system all mean the demand for many metals and minerals we produce is anticipated to grow. With our purpose of bringing people and resources together to build a better world, no company is better positioned to responsibly supply these resources than BHP.\n\nWe believe increasing productivity of our existing assets remains the greatest single value lever for BHP. This requires an ongoing focus on cost efficiency and throughput maximisation, ensuring we make the most of what we have - maximising the value our assets can create.\n\nOur substantial resource base continues to provide organic development opportunities. We have the world's largest copper mineral resources 1 and the world's second-largest nickel sulphide resources. 2 The Jansen Stage 1 Potash Project in Canada, which is creating a new growth front for the company in potash, remains ahead of plan, and studies for Stage 2 are progressing. FY2023 also saw us continue to progress our strategy to increase our copper and nickel prospects globally. These interests include Kabanga Nickel in Tanzania, Oak Dam in Australia, and Ocelot in the United States. It also encompassed projects in Serbia and Peru, the Filo del Sol project in Argentina and Chile and, of course, the acquisition of OZ Minerals. Bringing together the copper assets from OZ Minerals with OIympic Dam will create a Tier 1 copper province in South Australia. The acquisition of OZ Minerals also brings potential for further copper and nickel growth in both the near and long term.\n\n## Social value in action\n\nThe world needs the growing demand for metals and minerals to be met responsibly and more sustainably. We continue to make good progress against the goals within our social value framework announced in FY2022. As of today, we have among the lowest absolute operational GHG emissions of the major diversified mining companies.\u00b3 In FY2023, our operational GHG emissions reduced by 11 per cent from adjusted FY2022 levels, and we remain on track to achieve our FY2030 target to reduce operational GHG emissions by at least 30 per cent from FY2020 levels.\n\nBHP's relationship with the Indigenous peoples on whose traditional lands we operate is vitally important. In FY2023 we launched our updated Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement, which outlines our global approach to engaging and partnering with Indigenous peoples based on deep respect for the cultures, rights and perspectives of Indigenous peoples. BHP spent around US$333 million with Indigenous suppliers globally in FY2023, more than double last year's figure.\n\nAt BHP, we are already providing the materials and jobs critical to the future and we see clear opportunities to use our strengths to continue to grow value for shareholders.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs well as increasing the value of our procurement, we are focused on building our relationships with Indigenous suppliers to create higher-value, long-term contracting partnerships that support economic empowerment and drive innovation and growth for Indigenous enterprises.\n\n## Differentiated culture\n\nOur strong performance in FY2023 is thanks to the more than 80,000 great people working at BHP. We continue to build an inclusive, performance-orientated culture. We are empowering our people through the BHP Operating System, our way of working that seeks to make improvement part of what we do every day.\n\nI am proud to say female employee representation grew to more than 35 per cent in FY2023, and representation of Indigenous peoples grew to 8.6 per cent of our operational employees in Australia, 9.7 per cent in Chile and 7.7 per cent in our Jansen Potash Project in Canada.\n\nWe have made progress, but there is still work to do. Our priority is to ensure our workplaces are safe and inclusive for everyone who works for, or with, BHP. We continue to focus on eliminating incidents of sexual harassment, racism and bullying through ongoing leader communication, company-wide workforce training that sets clear expectations about appropriate conduct, and ongoing work to support impacted people and review policies and processes to eliminate this unacceptable behaviour.\n\n## Innovating for the future\n\nData and technology, including automation and artificial intelligence, are further unlocking growth opportunities and enhancing our operating performance, enabling us to be safer, more efficient and more sustainable. We're using autonomous trucks at some of our sites across Western Australia and Queensland and extending this to Spence and Escondida. At Jimblebar and Newman, truck automation has resulted in a 90 per cent reduction in heavy vehicle safety risks.\n\nThrough BHP Ventures and the Xplor program, we have increased our investment in innovation, building partnerships with companies to help us discover innovative ways to unlock more of the critical minerals needed for the energy transition.\n\nMining is an industry for today and tomorrow. At BHP, we are already providing materials and jobs critical to the future and we see clear opportunities to use our strengths to continue to grow value for shareholders. I am incredibly optimistic about the future of our company.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mike Henry\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\n- 1 Largest copper mineral resources on a contained metal basis, equity share.

Among our by-products, we are a major producer of uranium and, following the acquisition of OZ Minerals in May 2023, we expect to become a major producer of gold.\n\nWe hold the world's largest copper mineral resources. 1 We are using technical innovation such as new flotation technology to help lower energy costs and unlock value and are looking to secure more copper resources through exploration, acquisition and early-stage entry. Escondida in Chile is the world's largest copper mine and increased production by 5 per cent in FY2023. Improved reliability and productivity helped Olympic Dam in South Australia achieve record annual copper production. Spence in Chile also achieved record annual copper production, largely due to higher concentrator throughput. The copper assets acquired with OZ Minerals are in the process of being integrated with Olympic Dam and our Oak Dam deposit to create Copper South Australia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 5.2 and 5.3\n\nWestern Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) is the lowest-cost major iron ore producer globally 2 and has one of the lowest GHG emission production intensities of benchmarked seaborne iron ore operations. 3 WAIO achieved record production in FY2023 of 253 million tonnes (Mt) through productivity gains in its supply chain, rail network and car dumpers. We are focused on increasing annual production at WAIO to greater than 305 Mt over the medium term. We are also studying growing the WAIO business to 330 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa). Within WAIO, South Flank remains on track to ramp up to full production capacity of 80 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) by the end of FY2024. South Flank completed the deployment of autonomous trucks in May 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 5.1\n\nWe are continuing to focus our metallurgical coal operations in Queensland on higher-quality product and have one of the lowest GHG emission production intensities of benchmarked export metallurgical coal mines. 3 We believe a wholesale shift away from blast furnace steelmaking, which uses metallurgical coal, is still decades in the future and as a result metallurgical coal will remain an essential input into the steelmaking process and a critical input to support decarbonisation infrastructure over the coming decades. We believe higher-quality coals for steelmaking have greater potential upside for quality premiums as steelmakers seek to improve blast furnace utilisation and reduce GHG emission intensity of production. Our metallurgical coal operations achieved a strong underlying performance in FY2023, with Goonyella Riverside and Daunia transitioning to autonomous fleets.\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 5.1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe hold the second-largest nickel sulphide resources globally 4 and our nickel operations in Western Australia have one of the lowest GHG emission production intensities of benchmarked nickel mines and processing plants.\u00b3 We are assessing options to expand Mt Keith operations and have completed approximately 100 kilometres of development and exploration drilling in FY2023. We are continuing to seek more nickel resources through exploration, acquisition and early-stage entry. The West Musgrave nickel mine acquired as part of OZ Minerals, when complete, has potential to be a feed source to the Nickel West smelting and refining assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 5.1\n\nWe are developing one of the world's largest potash mines in Canada. The proposed mine has been designed based on a more sustainable approach with a relatively low GHG emission footprint and water intensity compared to existing potash mines. The Jansen Potash Project is expected to increase BHP's product diversification, customer base and operating footprint, and open a new future growth front. The US$5.7 billion Jansen Stage 1 is tracking to plan and in FY2023 we brought forward the expected date for first production to late CY2026.

        "page_content": "## 2  Why BHP\n\n## Exceptional performance\n\n## Operating and financial strength\n\nThe strength of our portfolio, our operating excellence and financial rigour from the disciplined application of the Capital Allocation Framework (CAF) have helped us deliver strong and consistent returns. We achieved net operating cash flow of US$18.7 billion in FY2023. Our net operating cash flow has been above US$15 billion for 13 of the last 14 years.\n\nIn FY2023, through our CAF we kept our balance sheet strong, delivered growth and returns for our shareholders, made progress towards our social value and GHG emissions reduction objectives and prioritised capital to maintain reliable operations.\n\n## Technology and innovation\n\nThe use of technology and our focus on innovation, together with the BOS, have helped accelerate continuous improvement in our value chain - from the introduction of advanced technologies designed to improve safety and increase productivity of our operated assets, to reducing water and energy consumption.\n\nTechnology is a key lever for BHP and has been used to:\n\n- -  support the maintenance of safe, predictable and productive operations\n- -  drive productivity improvements, with an emphasis on automation and real-time, data-driven insights and decision-making\n- -  unlock the next stage of value growth potential, from realising greater margins at our existing operations to finding new assets\n- -  improve sustainability outcomes through innovation\n- -  help drive inclusion and diversity through technologies, such as remote operations and decision support tools that make roles more accessible to a wider range of people\n\nThe advanced use of next generation technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud and data analytics, is enabling quicker and more economic recovery of our existing resources, more safely and more sustainably. It is also helping achieve a performance uplift by delivering operational improvements in iron ore, copper and nickel.\n\nExamples of our application of technology and innovation in FY2023 include:\n\n- -  Around US$13 million per year for the past two years in additional revenue was unlocked through cloud-based technology, which uses the Grade Adjustment Model and StacksOn applications to reduce shipping grade variability and increase operational planning accuracy from mine to port. This technology has been introduced at WAIO's Jimblebar, Newman Hub, Mining Area C, South Flank and Yandi operations, and is in the process of being rolled out to Port Hedland.\n- -  Increased copper recovery has been achieved at Escondida by using AI recommendations, new machine learning and data processing platforms to help optimise flotation operational parameters.\n\n## Operational excellence\n\nThe importance and value of operational excellence and cost control in dealing with challenging circumstances was evident in FY2023. We achieved production guidance across copper, iron ore, metallurgical coal and energy coal, including record annual production at WAIO, Olympic Dam and Spence. Our focus on cost discipline meant we continued to manage inflationary pressures effectively.\n\nThe BOS is our way of working that seeks to make improvement part of what we do every day through the application of the BOS tools and practices to our operations. We continued to deploy the BOS throughout our business in FY2023 and expect full deployment by the end of FY2024.\n\n- -  An additional 40 kilotonnes (kt) of coal was delivered at BMA through the Process Area Set Point Optimisation (PASPO) digital tool in FY2023. Built in-house, the PASPO technology uses machine-learning models to optimise coal handling and processing plant operating settings, and accurately forecast product blend. We believe the PASPO was one of the first successful applications of machine learning in the resources industry and it won the 2022 AustIndustry Innovation of the Year Award at the Queensland Mining Awards. Since its inception in CY2020, the PASPO tool has delivered more than 450 kt of additional coal.\n- -  Reduction of 59 gigawatt hours of energy and 2 million cubic metres of water compared to FY2022 by optimising energy and water consumption in concentrators and desalination plants at Escondida. Solutions provided real-time options to enable operators to implement water optimisation plans and real-time data analytics on large volumes of energy usage data to identify anomalies and automate corrective actions.\n\n## Financial excellence\n\nWe use our CAF to assess the most effective and efficient way to deploy capital. Since the CAF's introduction in FY2016, we have balanced reinvestment in our business with cash returns to shareholders.\n\nOur CAF promotes discipline in all capital decisions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe this commitment can help us become a partner of choice with communities, governments, suppliers and our customers.\n\nWe seek to be a valued partner with the communities where we operate and the Indigenous peoples we interact with.\n\nWe released a revised Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement in November 2022 and launched a re-designed and co-created Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in Australia in June 2023, which outlines our commitment to early engagement, to listening and learning, and ensuring we capture and integrate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' voices, values, knowledge and perspectives in our decision-making.\n\nThe RAP has been recognised with 'Elevate' status from Reconciliation Australia, which is provided to organisations with a proven track record in respectful engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and taking a leadership role to advance national reconciliation and create a more equitable Australia. Commitments made in the plan include targets by the end of FY2027 to increase Indigenous representation across our Australian workforce to 9.7 per cent and to achieve a A$1.5 billion spend (from 1 July 2023) in aggregate across our Australian assets with Traditional Owner and Indigenous businesses. We are also working to develop regional Indigenous peoples plans to advance our existing and new relationships with Indigenous peoples in Canada and South America.\n\nThrough our commitment to sustainability, we seek to reduce the impact we have on the planet through our operational activities.

At 30 June 2023, we were the steward of just under 6.5 million hectares of land and water. 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 6.5\n\n## How WAIO intends to manage an expected increase in surplus water\n\nBy FY2040, around 40 per cent of the ore at Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) is expected to be accessed from below the water table. This could mean around a four-fold increase in dewatering volumes to that in FY2022 and an increase in surplus water (dewatering volumes that are excess to operational requirements).\n\nBHP's intent is to use surplus water for beneficial use as much as practicable and manage it to prevent or minimise our adverse impacts on water resources. In June 2023, WAIO released a context-based water target that by FY2030 at least 50 per cent of surplus water will be prioritised for beneficial use to improve the sustainability of regional groundwater resources or generate social value.\n\nAt WAIO's Mining Area C, for example, additional aquifer reinjection bores and infiltration ponds are planned to be expanded so that more than 70 per cent of surplus water is returned to the ground.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to bhp.com/News/case-\n\nstudies/2023/08/pilbara-water-scheme-success\n\nFor more information on BHP's approach to water management, refer to OFR 6.13\n\n- 1 Nature positive is defined by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)/TNFD as 'A high-level goal and concept describing a future state of nature (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural capital) which is greater than the current state.'

        "page_content": "## 3  Positioning for growth\n\nWe have continued to create a simpler, more efficient BHP, that we believe is better able to capitalise on the megatrends shaping our world. As the population grows, urbanisation increases and as the world increasingly pursues a lower GHG emissions energy transition, we continue to position our portfolio for success.\n\n## Unlocking growth potential at our assets\n\nOur biggest near-term growth lever is from improving productivity at our existing assets and unlocking more of their untapped potential.\n\nWAIO was designed with an initial capacity of 240 Mt annually, and in FY2023 it produced a record 285 Mt (100 per cent basis), due to optimisations we have made over the years.\n\nWe are undertaking initiatives to responsibly grow our production to more than 305 Mt per year over the medium term, through the ramp up of our newest mine, South Flank, debottlenecking our port and rail systems, the rollout of autonomous haulage trucks and ongoing productivity enhancements. We are also studying options to further grow annual production to 330 Mt with the study expected to be completed in CY2025.\n\nEscondida has significant untapped resource potential and we are progressing studies into potentially replacing the Los Colorados concentrator. We are also looking at different leaching technologies that could help us extract more copper and have potential to lower water and energy consumption, reduce or eliminate the need for tailings dams, and enable production of cathode-finished product that does not require smelting.\n\n## Developing a position in potash\n\nPotash is used in fertilisers to enable more efficient and sustainable farming. With the world's population continuing to grow and rising concerns around food security and land use, we believe potash is a potential new growth front for BHP.\n\nAt the end of FY2023, Jansen Stage 1 (JS1) was 26 per cent complete. Production is expected to commence in late CY2026. When JS1 reaches full production capacity, it is expected to produce approximately 4.35 Mt of potash per year, increasing Canada's total potash output by nearly 22 per cent. We intend to progressively ramp up to full production by CY2028.\n\nAt its construction peak, around 3,500 roles are expected to be involved in JS1, with around 600 permanent positions once production commences, including at a new Integrated Operations Centre in Saskatoon.\n\nStudies for Jansen Stage 2 (JS2) are progressing. If approved by the BHP Board, JS2 may increase optionality and strengthen capital efficiency and operational productivity. Existing JS1 infrastructure could be leveraged to allow for an accelerated JS2 production timeline. Should it proceed, JS2 is expected to add an additional 4 Mtpa of potash at full production capacity, with possible first production estimated to occur in FY2029.\n\n## OZ Minerals: Creating a new copper province in South Australia\n\nWe will pursue growth through acquisition when we believe we can create value for our shareholders.\n\nBHP completed the acquisition of OZ Minerals on 2 May 2023 increasing our exposure to future-facing commodities by adding copper and nickel resources that complement our existing resources in Australia.\n\nWe are integrating OZ Minerals' two South Australian mines and options, which include Prominent Hill as well as Carrapateena, with Olympic Dam and the Oak Dam deposit to create a significant mining province called Copper South Australia. This province is expected to produce copper, gold and uranium oxide for decades to come.\n\nWe expect to be innovative in the creation of the province and intend to incorporate the OZ Minerals' 'Think & Act Differently' approach to innovation. The approach seeks to build capability across the mining value chain to help us better understand future opportunities and find new ways to understand ore bodies and responsibly extract and process commodities.\n\nOur focus is on building scale and optionality. While OZ Minerals is expected to add about 120,000 tonnes of copper production annually (based on its CY2022 performance and including production in Brazil), we believe it also brings potential for further copper and nickel growth in the medium term.\n\nIn Western Australia, the West Musgrave nickel mine, when complete, has potential to be a feed source to the Nickel West smelting and refining assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 5.2 Copper South Australia and OFR 5.1 West Musgrave\n\n## Creating and accelerating longer-term options\n\n## BHP Ventures\n\nBHP Ventures is our dedicated venture capital unit. It looks for gamechanging technologies and emerging companies to help drive ongoing and more sustainable growth within BHP and provide us with a portfolio of new growth options for the decades ahead.\n\nBHP Ventures complements the innovation already underway within BHP by forging new partnerships and creating fresh opportunities to strengthen our portfolio and support the decarbonisation of our operated assets and decarbonisation opportunities in our value chain. For our partners, BHP Ventures provides an opportunity to collaborate with us.\n\nBHP Ventures' focus areas include:\n\n- -  supporting innovation in our core operations, primarily around decarbonisation\n- -  opportunities that enable us to grow our resource base by extracting more from what we have today\n- -  opportunities that provide new options for BHP beyond our core business, including in our portfolio and value chain\n\n## BHP Xplor\n\nBHP Xplor is our global accelerator program targeting innovative, early-stage mineral exploration companies to find critical resources necessary to drive the energy transition. We are searching globally for the next generation of explorers to unlock copper, nickel and other critical mineral deposits.\n\nIn January 2023, BHP Xplor announced its first cohort of seven companies. Each of these companies received a cash payment of up to US$500,000 from BHP and gained access to a network of internal and external experts, to support the development of their opportunity and to provide potential investment options for BHP to accelerate the exploration for minerals needed for the energy transition.\n\nSubject to the finalisation of definitive agreements, further investment is expected in three of the seven participating companies in the first cohort, due to their region of interest, potential technical opportunity, team capability and strategic alignment.",

        "page_content": "## Growth through exploration, focused on copper and nickel\n\nDuring FY2023, we advanced our exploration programs globally, including undertaking further drilling at the Ocelot project in Arizona. This confirmed the presence of a body of mineralisation at depth, albeit at a lower grade than anticipated. We pursued earlier stage exploration opportunities for copper in Australia, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Serbia and the United States. This involved reconnaissance work through target definition and drill testing.\n\nWe have also increased the number of highquality nickel projects within the exploration pipeline. In Australia, we are actively exploring nickel targets, while in Canada, we continued our partnership with Midland Exploration Inc, through our 5 per cent interest and collaboration on a target generation program. BHP made a US$40 million investment in Kabanga Nickel in Tanzania in FY2022 and the exploration team has completed a series of studies to assess the additional upside potential to the known resource. As confirmatory drilling advances, we will continue to evaluate further work required to test this potential.\n\nThe acquisition of OZ Minerals brings the opportunity to unlock synergies and further grow our portfolio of copper and nickel projects. In South Australia, this acquisition has significantly increased our land position and is enabling us to develop an important province with additional upside copper discovery opportunities. We expect to fully integrate the OZ Minerals exploration activities into our programs during FY2024.\n\nIn June 2023, BHP acquired a 100 per cent interest in Ragnar Metals Sweden AB for US$6.4 million. This includes the early-stage Granmuren project, a drill-ready nickel-copper target in southern Sweden. The exploration team expects to commence activities focused on completed initial drill tests during FY2024.\n\nOur exploration partnerships continued to deliver encouraging results. In Australia, we continued our partnership with Encounter Resources to explore for sediment-hosted copper deposits in the Northern Territory. We finalised our exploration agreement with Mundoro Capital covering Serbia and Bulgaria, with initial drilling completed during FY2023 in Serbia.

Our underlying attributable profit was US$13.4 billion, or 265 US cents per share. Underlying EBITDA remained healthy at US$28 billion while our margin, at 54 per cent, and return on capital employed, at 29 per cent, remained strong - reflecting the quality and resilience of our assets, and consistent operating performance.\n\nWe continue to deliver strong margins and a consistently high baseline of cash flow. Over the past decade, we have delivered margins of over 50 per cent - significantly ahead of our nearest competitors - and generated average net operating cash flows of more than US$20 billion per year. This stability is a hallmark of our business and demonstrates the quality of our portfolio and the consistency of our returns.\n\nEnsuring shareholders continue to benefit from our consistent and reliable performance, we've announced a final dividend of 80 US cents per share. Together with the shareholder dividend for the first half of 90 US cents per share, the total return to shareholders for FY2023 was US$8.6 billion, which represented a 64 per cent payout ratio.\n\nThe biggest driver of the year-on-year decline in earnings was lower commodity prices. Iron ore and copper, our two largest segments, saw prices down 18 per cent and 12 per cent respectively, compared to last year. We also continued to see the lagged effect of inflation, which had a negative US$1.7 billion impact.\n\nIn areas within our control we performed well. Production was up three per cent in copper equivalent terms, supported by record annual production at Western Australia Iron Ore, Spence and Olympic Dam. On the cost front we met unit cost guidance for the majority of our assets.\n\nDuring the year, we spent US$7.1 billion on capital and exploration expenditure, an increase of 16 per cent year on year.\n\nLooking forward, we expect to increase our capital spend as we unlock productivity, decarbonise our operations and deliver growth in futurefacing commodities. After incorporating the OZ Minerals assets, we now expect to spend around US$10 billion on capital and exploration in both the 2024 and 2025 financial years. The majority of this will be directed to improvement and growth, as we progress Jansen, Copper South Australia projects and growth in the Pilbara.\n\nWe have continued to deliver value. BHP's total direct economic contribution in FY2023 was US$54.2 billion. This includes payments to suppliers, wages and benefits for more than 80,000 employees and contractors, dividends, taxes, royalties and voluntary investment in social projects across the communities where we operate.\n\nIn FY2023, our tax, royalty and other payments to governments totalled US$13.8 billion. During the last decade, we paid US$94.2 billion globally in taxes, royalties and other payments, including US$74.9 billion (approximately A$101 billion) in Australia. Our global adjusted effective tax rate in FY2023 was 30.9 per cent. Once royalties are included, our FY2023 rate increases to 41.3 per cent.\n\nWe are proud of our financial and operational performance and the value we have continued to generate for our shareholders, partners and stakeholders.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDavid Lamont Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur total FY2023 economic contribution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022: US$ 82.5 bn\n\nTax, royalty and other payments to governments in FY2023\n\nUS$ 13.8 bn 2022: US$17.3 bn\n\nShareholder dividends per share\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n170 US cents\n\n2022: 325 US cents\n\nUnderlying return on capital employed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022: 48.7 per cent",

We publish our Consolidated Financial Statements in US dollars. All Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Cash Flow Statement information below has been derived from audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information refer to Financial Statements.\n\nWe use various non-IFRS financial information to reflect our underlying performance. Non-IFRS financial information is not defined or specified under the requirements of IFRS, however is derived from the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial information is consistent with how management reviews financial performance of the Group with the Board and the investment community. OFR 10 'Non-IFRS financial information' includes our non-IFRS financial information and OFR 10.1 'Definition and calculation of non-IFRS financial information' outlines why we believe non-IFRS financial information is useful and the relevant calculation methodology. We believe non-IFRS financial information provides useful information, however it should not be considered as an indication of, or as a substitute for, statutory measures as an indicator of actual operating performance (such as profit or net operating cash flow) or any other measure of financial performance or position presented in accordance with IFRS, or as a measure of a company's profitability, liquidity or financial position.\n\n## 4.2  Key performance indicators\n\nOur key performance indicators (KPIs) enable us to measure our development and financial performance. These KPIs are used to assess performance of our people throughout the Group.\n\n- For information on our approach to performance and reward refer to Remuneration Report.\n- For information on our overall approach to executive remuneration, including remuneration policies and remuneration outcomes refer to Remuneration Report.\n\nFollowing BHP's sale of the Onshore US assets in FY2019 and subsequently the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside in FY2022, the contribution of these assets to the Group's results is presented as Discontinued operations. Footnotes to tables and infographics indicate whether data presented in OFR 4.2 is inclusive or exclusive of Petroleum assets. Details of the contribution of the Petroleum assets to the Group's results are disclosed in Financial Statements note 28 'Discontinued operations'.\n\n## Summary of financial measures\n\n| Year ended 30 June  US$M                                                                                   | 2023    | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Consolidated Income Statement (Financial Statements 1.1)                                                   |         |        |\n| Revenue                                                                                                    | 53,817  | 65,098 |\n| Profit/(loss) after taxation from Continuing operations                                                    | 14,324  | 22,400 |\n| Profit/(loss) after taxation from Continuing and Discontinued operations attributable to  BHP shareholders | 12,921  | 30,900 |\n| Dividends per ordinary share - paid during the period (US cents)                                           | 265.0   | 350.0  |\n| Dividends per ordinary share - determined in respect of the period (US cents)                              | 170.0   | 325.0  |\n| In specie dividend on merger of Petroleum with Woodside (US cents)                                         | -       | 386.4  |\n| Basic earnings/(loss) per ordinary share (US cents)                                                        | 255.2   | 610.6  |\n| Consolidated Balance Sheet (Financial Statements 1.3)                                                      |         |        |\n| Total assets                                                                                               | 101,296 | 95,166 |\n| Net assets                                                                                                 | 48,530  | 48,766 |\n| Consolidated Cash Flow Statement (Financial Statements 1.4)                                                |         |        |\n| Net operating cash flows                                                                                   | 18,701  | 32,174 |\n| Capital and exploration expenditure                                                                        | 7,083   | 7,545  |\n| Other financial information (OFR 10)                                                                       |         |        |\n| Net debt                                                                                                   | 11,166  | 333    |\n| Underlying attributable profit                                                                             | 13,420  | 23,815 |\n| Underlying attributable profit - Continuing operations                                                     | 13,420  | 21,319 |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                                                                          | 27,956  | 40,634 |\n| Underlying basic earnings per share (US cents)                                                             | 265.0   | 470.6  |\n| Underlying basic earnings per share - Continuing operations (US cents)                                     | 265.0   | 421.2  |\n| Underlying return on capital employed (per cent)                                                           | 28.8    | 48.7   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Includes data for Continuing and Discontinued operations for the financial years being reported.\n- 2 Excludes data from Discontinued operations for the financial years being reported.\n- 3 For more information on non-IFRS financial information refer to OFR 10.",

This decrease was mainly due to lower average realised prices for iron ore, metallurgical coal and copper combined with the divestment of BHP Mitsui Coal (BMC) in FY2022, partially offset by higher average realised prices for thermal coal and nickel.\n\nHigher sales volumes were achieved across Copper, Iron Ore and Nickel supported by record production at Olympic Dam, Spence and WAIO. Olympic Dam sales volumes increased following the completion of the planned major smelter maintenance campaign in the prior period. Escondida sales volumes increased mainly due to favourable feed grade and higher throughput was achieved at the Spence Growth Option (SGO). Minimal disruptions from COVID-19 also supported higher volumes across the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For information on our average realised prices and production of our commodities refer to OFR 9.\n\nTotal expenses excluding net finance costs of US$31.9 billion decreased by US$0.5 billion, or 2 per cent from FY2022. This reflected lower thirdparty commodity purchases of US$1.1 billion mainly at Antamina due to lower copper prices, lower depreciation, amortisation and impairment expense of US$1.1 billion reflecting the increase in mine life at Yandi in FY2022, lower depreciation of index-linked freight contracts and the nonrecurrence of impairment at Cerro Colorado in FY2022. Expenses were also lower due to the non-recurrence of corporate structure unification costs in FY2022 of US$0.4 billion. Partially offsetting these impacts was an increase in raw materials and consumables expenditure of US$0.7 billion\n\nbeing the net impact of higher prices and the divestment of BMC in FY2022, combined with higher drawdown of inventories driven by higher production at Olympic Dam and Spence due to the completion of the planned major smelter maintenance campaign in the prior period and SGO, respectively.\n\nProfit from equity accounted investments, related impairments and expenses of US$594 million increased by US$613 million from FY2022 reflecting the Samarco dam failure cost estimate update in FY2022 partially offset by lower Antamina profits driven by lower copper prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the total impact of the Samarco dam failure provision and impairment charges connected with equity accounted investments refer to Financial Statements note 3 'Exceptional items' and Financial Statements note 13 'Impairment of non-current assets' respectively.\n\nNet finance costs of US$1.5 billion increased by US$0.6 billion, or 58 per cent from FY2022 primarily due to higher effective interest rates and the impact of US$5.0 billion additional borrowings used to fund the acquisition of OZ Minerals Limited (OZL).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on net finance costs and the OZL acquisition refer to Financial Statements note 23 'Net finance costs' and note 29 'Business combinations' respectively.\n\nTotal taxation expense of US$7.1 billion decreased by US$3.7 billion from FY2022 in line with lower profits primarily

Acquisition related costs of US$0.1 billion have been expensed and included in other operating expenses in the income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to Financial Statements note 29 'Business combinations'.\n\n## Cash flow\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement contained in Financial Statements 1.4, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents.\n\n| Year ended 30 June                                                                | 2023  US$M   | 2022  US$M   | 2021  US$M   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Net operating cash flows from Continuing operations                               | 18,701       | 29,285       | 25,883       |\n| Net operating cash flows from Discontinued operations                             | -            | 2,889        | 1,351        |\n| Net operating cash flows                                                          | 18,701       | 32,174       | 27,234       |\n| Net investing cash flows from Continuing operations                               | (13,065)     | (4,973)      | (6,325)      |\n| Net investing cash flows from Discontinued operations                             | -            | (904)        | (1,520)      |\n| Net cash completion payment on merger of Petroleum with Woodside                  | -            | (683)        | -            |\n| Cash and cash equivalents disposed on merger of Petroleum with Woodside           | -            | (399)        | -            |\n| Net investing cash flows                                                          | (13,065)     | (6,959)      | (7,845)      |\n| Net financing cash flows from Continuing operations                               | (10,315)     | (22,734)     | (17,884)     |\n| Net financing cash flows from Discontinued operations                             | -            | (33)         | (38)         |\n| Net financing cash flows                                                          | (10,315)     | (22,767)     | (17,922)     |\n| Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents                              | (4,679)      | 2,448        | 1,467        |\n| Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents from Continuing operations   | (4,679)      | 1,578        | 1,674        |\n| Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents from Discontinued operations | -            | 1,952        | (207)        |\n| Net cash completion payment on merger of Petroleum with Woodside                  | -            | (683)        | -            |\n| Cash and cash equivalents disposed on merger of Petroleum with Woodside           | -            | (399)        | -            |\n\nNet operating cash inflows from Continuing operations of US$18.7 billion decreased by US$10.6 billion. This is primarily due to significantly lower average realised prices and the inflationary impacts on the cost base partially offset by favourable foreign exchange movements.\n\nNet investing cash outflows from Continuing operations of US$13.1 billion increased by US$8.1 billion. This increase primarily reflects the US$5.9 billion acquisition of OZL completed on 2 May 2023, higher capital expenditure of US$0.9 billion which includes major projects such as Jansen Stage 1 and also the non-recurrence of net proceeds received in the prior period related to the sale of BHP's 80 per cent interest in BMC to Stanmore Resources Limited of US$1.3 billion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the acquisition of OZL and a breakdown of capital and exploration expenditure on a commodity basis refer to Financial Statements note 29 'Business combinations' and OFR 9 respectively.\n\nNet financing cash outflows from Continuing operations of US$10.3 billion decreased by US$12.4 billion. This decrease mainly reflects lower dividends paid to BHP shareholders of US$4.6 billion and higher proceeds from interest bearing liabilities of US$7.0 billion primarily reflecting funding for the OZL acquisition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information refer to Financial Statements note 21 'Net debt'.\n\nUnderlying return on capital employed (ROCE) of 28.8 per cent decreased by 19.9 percentage points (FY2022: 16.2 percentage point increase) reflecting the significant decrease in profit after taxation excluding net finance costs and exceptional items of US$10.9 billion primarily due to lower average realised prices and inflationary impacts on the cost base.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on ROCE refer to OFR 10.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.4  Debt and sources of liquidity\n\nOur policies on debt and liquidity management have the following objectives:\n\n- -  a strong balance sheet through the cycle\n- -  diversification of funding sources\n- -  maintain borrowings and excess cash predominantly in US dollars\n\n## Interest bearing liabilities, net debt and gearing\n\nAt the end of FY2023, Interest bearing liabilities were US$22.3 billion (FY2022: US$16.4 billion) and Cash and cash equivalents were US$12.4 billion (FY2022: US$17.2 billion). This resulted in Net debt of US$11.2 billion, which represented an increase of US$10.8 billion compared with the net debt position at 30 June 2022. This was primarily due to net investing cash flows (including the acquisition of OZ Minerals), and dividend payments, which more than offset the operating cash flows generated. Gearing, which is the ratio of Net debt to Net debt plus Net assets, was 18.7 per cent at 30 June 2023, compared with 0.7 per cent at 30 June 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on Net debt and gearing refer to Financial Statements note 21 'Net debt' and OFR 10.\n\nDuring FY2023, gross debt increased by US$5.9 billion to US$22.3 billion as at 30 June 2023. This increase includes the drawdown of the US$5.0 billion OZ Minerals acquisition facility in April 2023 and US$2.75 billion US bond issuance in February 2023. The Group also redeemed \u00a30.6 billion of 6.5 per cent GBP hybrid notes in October 2022, repaid \u20ac0.4 billion of 0.75 per cent EUR senior notes that matured on 28 October 2022 (the balance following an early repurchase program) and repaid CAD$0.8 billion of 3.23 per cent CAD senior notes that matured on 15 May 2023.\n\nAt the subsidiary level, Escondida repaid US$0.4 billion of debt and received proceeds from debt of US$0.5 billion including the refinancing of a US$0.3 billion loan facility due to mature in the period.",

The commodities produced by our Minerals Australia assets are transported by rail and road to port and exported to our global customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Iron ore\n\n## Western Australia Iron Ore\n\n## Overview\n\nWestern Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) is an integrated system of four processing hubs and five open-cut operational mines in the Pilbara region of northern Western Australia, connected by more than 1,000 kilometres of rail infrastructure and port facilities.\n\nWAIO's Pilbara reserve base is relatively concentrated, allowing development through integrated mining hubs connected to the mines and satellite orebodies by conveyors or spur lines. This approach seeks to maximise the value of installed infrastructure by using the same processing plant and rail infrastructure for several orebodies.\n\nOre is crushed, beneficiated (where necessary) and blended at the processing hubs - Mt Newman operations (which has our beneficiation plant), Yandi, Mining Area C and Jimblebar - to create lump and fines products that are transported along the Port Hedland-Mt Newman rail line to the Finucane Island and Nelson Point port facilities at Port Hedland.\n\nThere are four main WAIO joint ventures (JVs): Mt Newman, Yandi, Mt Goldsworthy (which includes the South Flank mining area) and Jimblebar. BHP's interest in each is 85 per cent, with Mitsui and ITOCHU owning the remaining 15 per cent. The joint ventures are unincorporated, except Jimblebar.\n\nBHP, Mitsui, ITOCHU and POSCO are also participants in the POSMAC JV. BHP's interest in POSMAC is 65 per cent. The ore from the POSMAC JV is sold to the Mt Goldsworthy JV.\n\nAll ore is transported on the Mt Newman JV and Mt Goldsworthy JV rail lines. The Nelson Point port facility is owned by the Mt Newman JV and the Finucane Island facility is owned by the Mt Goldsworthy JV. On 7 September 2021, BHP received regulatory approval to increase our export capacity at WAIO's Port Hedland operations up to 330 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) (100 per cent basis). We are currently studying expansion alternatives for growth to 330 Mtpa with the feasibility study expected to be completed in CY2025.\n\nOur near-term focus remains on stable production of 290 Mtpa of iron ore. Successful tie-in of capital projects, including the port debottlenecking project, is expected to enable growth in excess of 305 Mtpa in the medium term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nWAIO achieved record production of 253 million tonnes (Mt) or 285 Mt on a 100 per cent basis, reflecting continued strong supply chain performance, including rail performance and increased car dumper utilisation.\n\nSouth Flank remains on track to ramp up to full production capacity of 80 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) by the end of FY2024.\n\nSouth Flank mining has transitioned to full autonomous haulage. The mine's 41 Komatsu 903E trucks and 185 pieces of ancillary equipment have been fitted with automation kits and are fully operational across the mine's autonomous operating zones. Since March 2022, we have delivered more than 3,000 training modules to help our people upskill into new roles, both on-site and in our remote operations centre in Perth. This training helps ensure everyone understands and can work safely in and around our autonomous fleet.\n\nYandi continues its end-of-life ramp down and is expected to provide supply chain flexibility with a lower level of production to continue for a few years.\n\nThe Shiploader Automation Project has continued to see success with the automation largely complete on two shiploaders and work is advancing with automation equipment installed on seven of BHP's eight shiploaders. Together with autonomous haulage rollouts at South Flank and Newman West, these initiatives are expected to deliver significant safety, production and cost improvements as well as new job and development opportunities.\n\nThe Port Debottlenecking Project 1 is on track for completion in CY2024 with major milestones achieved to date, including the safe and successful completion of the stacker 6 upgrade and erection of the bucket wheel reclaimer 11 in the south yard.\n\nBHP signed an agreement with BP Australia for a trial to assess hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) performance, suitability and GHG emission reduction capability in mining equipment at our Yandi operations. The trial has provided valuable insight and knowledge in renewable diesel and will be used to evaluate how renewable diesel may be a practical complementary transition pathway to support BHP's operational decarbonisation plan.",

BMA's mines are open cut, except for the Broadmeadow underground longwall operation. A small proportion of BMA's production is sold as energy coal. BMA has access to infrastructure, including a modern, multi-user rail network, and owns and operates its own coal-loading terminal at Hay Point, near Mackay. BMA has contracted capacity at two other multiuser port facilities - the Port of Gladstone (RG Tanna Coal Terminal) and Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal (DBCT). In February 2023, we announced together with Mitsubishi Development Pty Ltd our intention to pursue options to divest the Daunia and Blackwater mines. The process for this potential divestment is progressing in line with our plans.\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nBMA production of 29 Mt (58 Mt on a 100 per cent basis) was in line with the prior period. The slowdown in production resulting from the significant wet weather experienced in the first three quarters was offset by strong underlying operational performance, in particular, continued improvement in truck productivity at Goonyella and Daunia following the completion of their transitions to autonomous fleet. Production for the period was further supported by a drawdown of raw coal inventory and improved labour availability compared to the prior period.\n\nWith the full automation of BMA's Daunia and Goonyella truck fleets complete, (the latter being the largest autonomous truck fleet used at an operating coal mine in the world) the safety and productivity benefits associated with these transformations are being realised by BMA. On safety, our high-potential vehicle interaction events are down 48 per cent at Daunia and Goonyella highlighting the compelling case for automation. With our teams trained and continuing to build further capability in the new roles required by automation, significant productivity improvement is being delivered across both operations (with Goonyella achieving its highest ever truck hours in May 2023) translating to more productive material movement with further upside potential.\n\nDuring the year, BMA continued with the fabrication and installation of a replacement berth structure and shiploader at Hay Point Coal Terminal. The project is well advanced and the resilience of the shiploader to significant weather and major cyclone events has improved. The project is on track to commission the replacement berth structure and shiploader in Q1 FY2024.\n\nWhile we intend to continue to invest in the productivity of our existing assets, BMA is not making significant new investments in Queensland given the changes to the royalty regime imposed by the State Government in FY2023, which have increased risk and reduced competitiveness of investments in the state.\n\n## New South Wales Energy Coal\n\n## Overview\n\nNew South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) (BHP ownership: 100 per cent) comprises the Mt Arthur Coal open-cut energy coal mine in the Hunter Valley. It has access to infrastructure in the Hunter Region, including a multi-user rail network and coal loading terminal access at the Port of Newcastle through Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group (BHP ownership: 28 per cent) and Port Waratah Coal Services.\n\nOn 16 June 2022, we announced we would retain NSWEC in our portfolio, seek the relevant approvals to continue mining beyond the current consent that expires at the end of 2026 and proceed with a managed process to cease mining at the asset by the end of FY2030. Continuation of mining to the end of FY2030 is intended to provide the time to work with our people and the local community on an equitable change and transition approach as well as the time to plan and execute the necessary works for a positive legacy of BHP mining in the Hunter Valley.\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nNSWEC production increased by 3 per cent to 14.2 Mt driven by an improvement in weather conditions in the second half and an uplift in truck productivity compared to the prior period. Additional deployed capacity into a new mining area also resulted in an uplift in prime stripping volumes. Production for FY2024 is expected to be between 13 and 15 Mt.\n\nHigher-quality products made up 77 per cent of sales, compared to 89 per cent in the prior period, reflecting the impacts of the change in export market conditions and the commencement of domestic sales under the New South Wales Government Coal Market Price Emergency Directions (Directions for Coal Mines) in the June 2023 quarter. The reservation allocation for FY2024 is expected to be at least 0.7 Mt in line with the Directions for Coal Mines.\n\nThe New South Wales Parliament passed legislation in late December 2022 amending the Energy and Utilities Administration Act 1987 to give the New South Wales Government powers to declare a 'coal market price emergency' and impose a price cap on coal used in New South Wales power generators. These powers were enacted immediately (for a period from 22 December 2022 until 30 June 2024) for existing coal producers who sold domestically and were then extended on 30 January 2023 to include export-only coal producers (including NSWEC).\n\nNSWEC commenced delivering its allocation of 0.175 Mt per quarter as prescribed in the Directions for Coal Mines in April 2023. As NSWEC's cost of production exceeds the price cap prescribed under the Directions, NSWEC applied for a higher cap price utilising the process and guidance provided by the New South Wales Government and the Australian Energy Regulator (AER), which was granted in June 2023.",

It comprises open-cut and underground mines, concentrators, a smelter and refinery. Nickel West owns the majority of tenements of known resource in the Agnew-Wiluna basin in Western Australia.\n\nDisseminated sulphide ore is mined at the Mt Keith open-pit operation and Mt Keith Satellite mine (Yakabindie) and crushed and processed on-site to produce nickel concentrate. Nickel sulphide ore is mined at the Cliffs and Leinster underground mines and processed through a concentrator and dryer at Leinster. A concentrator plant in Kambalda processes ore and concentrate purchased from third parties.\n\nThe three streams feed the Kalgoorlie nickel smelter, which uses a flash furnace to produce nickel matte. The Kwinana nickel refinery then turns this into nickel powder, briquettes and nickel sulphate.\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nNickel West production increased by 4 per cent to 80 kilotonnes (kt) due to an increased proportion of concentrate and matte products and inventory drawdowns. This was partially offset by the slower than planned ramp up of the refinery following planned maintenance in the December 2022 quarter and a heavy rain event at the Mt Keith operations in early April 2023 impacting mine progression.\n\nDuring the year, Nickel West experienced ongoing issues with the quality and volume of ore deliveries from Mincor Resources containing high levels of arsenic, and in March advised it would no longer accept off-specification product. In the second half, Nickel West purchased more third-party products compared to the first half, including higher cost third-party concentrate to offset the impact of the ore supply issues.\n\nIn conjunction with Nickel West, TransAlta has completed the construction of the Northern Goldfields Solar Project, a large-scale, off-grid mining solar and battery energy storage system, to help power Nickel West's Mt Keith and Leinster operations. The project includes a solar farm at Mount Keith and a solar farm and battery energy storage system at Leinster. Early-stage project commissioning began in the June 2023 quarter with energisation due for completion in August 2023. The project will reduce Scope 2 emissions and is a key deliverable in Nickel West's Path to Net Zero strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## West Musgrave\n\n## Overview\n\nThe West Musgrave Project (BHP ownership: 100 per cent; acquired as part of OZ Minerals) is a greenfield nickel and copper project located on Ngaanyatjarra Country in the West Musgrave Ranges of Western Australia, approximately 1,300 kilometres northeast of Perth and 1,400 kilometres northwest of Adelaide, near the intersection of the borders of Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory.\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nA final investment decision was taken in September 2022 with construction commencing in the December 2022 quarter (prior to the acquisition of OZ Minerals by BHP). Initial project activities focused on the continued recruitment of project execution and operations readiness personnel, procurement of certain long-lead items, execution of key contracts and critical path on-site activities. Site activities have progressed safely, including the commencement of bulk earthworks to establish key infrastructure such as the minerals processing plant and living hub. Other key activities include quarry operations, mobilisation and commissioning of concrete batch plant facilities as well as installation of the construction village and facilities.",

Copper South Australia was formed upon our acquisition of OZ Minerals in May 2023 and combines our Olympic Dam operated asset with the acquired operated assets of Carrapateena and Prominent Hill. The underground mining and conventional crushing operations of Carrapeteena and Prominent Hill produce copper concentrate and are located in close proximity to the mining and integrated crushing, grinding, concentrating, smelting and refining operations of Olympic Dam, which produces copper cathode. The commodities produced by Copper South Australia are transported by road and rail to our domestic customers and via the Adelaide and Whyalla ports to be exported to our global customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Copper\n\n## Olympic Dam\n\n## Overview\n\nLocated on Kokatha Country in the Gawler Craton, South Australia, Olympic Dam (BHP ownership: 100 per cent) is one of the world's most significant deposits of copper, gold, silver and uranium. It comprises underground and surface operations and is a fully integrated processing facility from ore to metal.\n\nOre mined underground is hauled by an automated train system to crushing, storage and ore hoisting facilities or trucked directly to the surface.\n\nOlympic Dam has a fully integrated metallurgical complex with a grinding and concentrating circuit, a hydrometallurgical plant incorporating solvent extraction circuits for copper and uranium, a copper smelter, a copper refinery, including an electro-refinery and an electrowinning-refinery, and a recovery circuit for precious metals.\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nOlympic Dam achieved a record cathode production outcome under BHP operatorship of 212 kt, primarily driven by record concentrator and smelter performance. Record total material milled was achieved at 10.8 Mt (10.5Mt FY2011) and record concentrate smelted was achieved at 508 kt (471 kt FY2016). The strong plant performance was delivered following the successful major smelter maintenance campaign in FY2022 and through debottlenecking programs of existing facilities. Record gold production was also delivered in FY2023 at 186 thousand troy ounces (koz) (146 koz FY2021).\n\nThe underground mine continues to develop further into the Southern Mine Area, with ~65 per cent of total ore production currently from this part of the mine. Average copper grade remains strong at 2.04 per cent and investment over the past few years has enabled mine performance to lift to 9.3 Mt (8.8 Mt FY2022). The short-term focus is on optimising operational performance and debottlenecking existing facilities to further improve production performance.\n\nOlympic Dam signed a renewable Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Neoen, which is expected to meet half of Olympic Dam's electricity needs from FY2026 based on current forecast demand.\n\nOn 29 March 2023, BHP received environmental approval from the South Australian State Government for Oak Dam's next phase exploration program. Resource definition drilling has since increased to nine deep directional diamond drill rigs on the exploration licence (EL) at the end of FY2023 with 11 rigs planned by November 2023. BHP is also installing a 150-room accommodation village and support facilities adjacent to the drilling target area.\n\n## Carrapateena\n\n## Overview\n\nCarrapateena (BHP ownership: 100 per cent; acquired as part of OZ Minerals) is an underground copper, gold and silver mine located on Kokatha Country in the Gawler Craton, South Australia, approximately 180 kilometres by road southeast of Olympic Dam and 160 kilometres north of Port Augusta.\n\nUnderground mining at Carrapateena is by sub-level caving. Conventional crushing, grinding and flotation produces copper concentrate.\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nIn the two months since acquisition, Carrapateena produced 11.7 kt of copper concentrate.\n\nThe Carrapateena cave safely propagated to surface at the end of CY2022 (prior to the acquisition of OZ Minerals by BHP), which was an important de-risking event for the mine.\n\nProgress was also made on converting the bottom half of the Carrapateena mine from a sub-level cave to a block cave, with the aim of unlocking the mine's potential to be a multigenerational, low quartile cash cost producing province. Significant progress was made during the year on enabling underground infrastructure, such as crushers and ventilation. The tailings storage facility main embankment Stage 2 lift was completed and a new regrind mill was commissioned.\n\n## Prominent Hill\n\n## Overview\n\nProminent Hill (BHP ownership: 100 per cent; acquired as part of OZ Minerals) is an underground copper, gold and silver mine located on Antakirinja Country in the Gawler Craton, South Australia, 200 kilometres northwest of Olympic Dam.\n\nProminent Hill was first developed as an open-pit mine, however, mining activities are currently principally underground via sub-level open stoping. Conventional crushing, grinding and flotation produce copper concentrate.\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nIn the two months since acquisition, Prominent Hill produced 8.2 kt of copper concentrate.\n\nTuuka, the main access decline that enables shaft sinking, continued to progress. Shaft works advanced, including shaft pre-sinking with the pilot hole complete and back reaming underway. Headframe lift is anticipated in early FY2024. The installation of underground primary ventilation fans was completed. Work on the permanent refrigeration works advanced with the supply and installation of the condenser units and supporting structure.",

The non-operated assets in the Minerals Americas portfolio are open-cut mines that produce copper (Antamina) and iron ore (Samarco). We have a 100 per cent interest in the Jansen Potash Project in Canada and a 45 per cent interest in the Resolution Copper Project in the United States. The commodities produced by our Minerals Americas assets are transported to port by pipeline, rail or road and exported to customers around the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Copper\n\n## Escondida\n\n## Overview\n\nEscondida (BHP ownership: 57.5 per cent) is a leading producer of copper concentrate and cathodes, with by-products including gold and silver and cathodes. It is located in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.\n\nEscondida's two pits feed three concentrator plants, as well as two leaching operations (oxide and sulphide).\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nEscondida copper production increased by 5 per cent to 1,055 kt primarily due to higher concentrator feed grade of 0.82 per cent, compared to 0.78 per cent in FY2022. The positive impact of the higher grade was partially offset by the impact of road blockades across Chile as part of civil unrest in the December 2022 quarter, which reduced availability of some key mine supplies. Full-year production came in at the low end of revised guidance largely as a result of measures implemented to manage geotechnical events in a high-grade section of the Escondida pit. These included a resequencing of the mine plan, resulting in lower-than-anticipated volumes of mined ore and increased processing of lower grade stockpiles through the concentrators. Escondida Cathodes was awarded the Shingo prize for operational excellence by the Shingo Institute - an organisation that helps companies achieve operational excellence through the principles in the Shingo Model - Cultural Enablers, Continuous Improvement, and Enterprise Alignment.\n\n## Pampa Norte\n\n## Overview\n\nPampa Norte (BHP ownership: 100 per cent) consists of two assets in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile - Spence and Cerro Colorado.\n\nSpence produces copper cathodes and copper concentrate, with byproducts including gold, silver and molybdenum.\n\nCerro Colorado produces copper cathodes. Its current environmental licence expires at the end of CY2023.\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nPampa Norte copper production increased by 3 per cent to 289 kt, including a record 240 kt at Spence and 49 kt at Cerro Colorado. This was largely\n\na result of higher concentrator throughput at the Spence Growth Option (SGO), partially offset by lower production at Cerro Colorado as it transitions towards closure.\n\nWe continue to closely monitor the previously identified anomalies in the Spence tailings storage facility (TSF) and are aiming to ensure safe operational conditions. In order to remediate the anomalies, changes to the original TSF design will be required and further study is being undertaken. In collaboration with the Engineer of Record, Independent Tailings Review Board and expert consultants, work is ongoing to finalise the schedule, scope and cost of the TSF design, including through studies, site characterisation and modelling. Production guidance at Spence remains subject to the remediation of the TSF anomalies.\n\nCerro Colorado is transitioning to closure by December 2023. Operating costs at Cerro Colorado are expected to be approximately US$70 million and US$45 million for the December 2023 and June 2024 half years, respectively. We are exploring options to extend the life of Cerro Colorado, including through the use of leaching technologies and desalinated water, which could see the operation restart in approximately 2030, subject to environmental approvals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Potash\n\n## Jansen Potash Project\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Jansen Potash Project (BHP ownership: 100 per cent) is located about 140 kilometres east of Saskatoon, Canada.\n\nJansen's large resource provides the opportunity to develop the project in stages, with Jansen Stage 1 (Jansen S1) expected to produce approximately 4.35 Mt of potash per annum on completion, which is expected in late CY2026, and sequenced brownfield expansions of up to 12 Mtpa (approximately 4 Mtpa per stage).\n\nBHP holds mineral leases covering around 9,600 square kilometres in the Saskatchewan potash basin.\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nJansen S1 is tracking in line with our plan and was 26 per cent complete as at 30 June 2023. During FY2023, we completed all piling activities for the mill and storage facilities. The feasibility study for Jansen Stage 2 continues to progress and is on track to be completed during FY2024.",

Antamina is operated independently by Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera Antamina S.A.\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nAntamina copper production decreased by 8 per cent to 138 kt (BHP share) reflecting lower copper feed grades, partially offset by higher throughput. Zinc production was 1 per cent higher at 125 kt (BHP share) reflecting higher throughput.\n\nIn FY2022, Antamina submitted to Peruvian authorities a Modification of the Environmental Impact Assessment to sustain mine life from 2028 to 2036 entirely within Antamina's current operational area. During FY2023, Antamina continued to monitor the progress of the permitting process and provided supplementary information to the Peruvian authorities as required.\n\n## Resolution Copper\n\n## Overview\n\nResolution Copper (BHP ownership: 45 per cent), located in the US state of Arizona, is operated by Rio Tinto (55 per cent ownership interest). Resolution Copper is one of the largest undeveloped copper projects in the world and has the potential to become one of the largest copper producers in North America. The Resolution Copper deposit lies more than 1,600 metres beneath the surface.\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nDuring FY2023, Resolution continued the engineering and permitting phase of the project. The project is subject to a federal permitting process led by the US Forest Service. The US Forest Service published a Final Environmental Impact Statement in January 2021, which was rescinded in March 2022 to allow additional environmental analysis and consultation with Native American Tribes. The US Forest Service has indicated there is no timeline for republication of the Final Environmental Impact Statement and the process is subject to three lawsuits, which have been filed against the US Forest Service on behalf of Native American Tribe members and nongovernment organisations. Resolution has publicly stated its commitment to deepening ongoing engagement with Native American Tribes and other stakeholders while also collaborating to create shared value opportunities. The US Government has continued to consult with Native American Tribes. Through the process of consultation, the US Government has identified areas of cultural heritage and mitigation strategies. The consultation process has led to changes in the project design to mitigate potential impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Iron ore\n\n## Samarco\n\n## Overview\n\nSamarco (BHP ownership: 50 per cent) comprises a mine and three concentrators located in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, and four pellet plants and a port located in Anchieta in the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo. Three 400-kilometre pipelines connect the mine site to the pelletising facilities. Samarco is operated independently by Samarco Minera\u00e7\u00e3o S.A. Samarco's main product is iron ore pellets. Pellets are independently marketed by Samarco and sold to customers around the world.\n\nSamarco's operations were suspended in November 2015 after the Fund\u00e3o dam failure. Since its restart in December 2020, 80 per cent of the tailings generated are filtrated and dry stacked, and 20 per cent are deposited in a confined pit enabling Samarco to operate without a conventional tailings dam structure.\n\n## Key developments in FY2023\n\nSamarco produced 4.5 Mt of iron ore pellets and ore fines in FY2023 (BHP share). Samarco is currently operating at 26 per cent of its total 26 Mtpa production capacity and has shipped more than 20 Mt of pellets and fines since the resumption of operations in December 2020. In June 2023, Samarco received investment approval to increase its production capacity to approximately 60 per cent of its full production capacity by early CY2025. This will involve restarting the second concentrator and third pelletising plant, expanding the existing filtration plant and increasing the mine fleet.\n\nSamarco has been progressively decommissioning its upstream tailings dam structures in accordance with Brazilian legislation. During FY2023, decommissioning works for the smaller of the two tailings dams, the Germano Pit dam, were completed. The progressive decommissioning of the remaining upstream tailings dam structure, the Germano Main dam, is planned for completion by FY2029. These structures have been certified by independent third parties as stable and are following local stability and monitoring requirements.\n\nSamarco is continuing broader studies to review solutions for Samarco to operate without tailings dams beyond FY2030. For more information on the Fund\u00e3o dam failure and the response refer to OFR 7.",

We seek to achieve our purpose through collective effort, including partnering with suppliers and customers to make our business more sustainable and contribute to global sustainable development goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on BHP's approach to and definition of sustainability refer to this OFR 6 and Additional information 10.4\n\n## 6.1  Safety\n\nA culture that embraces care and trust as core values is fundamental to achieving improved outcomes.\n\nOur highest priority is to protect the safety and wellbeing of our workforce and the communities where we operate. Tragically, we lost two of our colleagues in FY2023. We recognise the severity and impact of these events and place importance on continuing to provide support to families, friends and colleagues of Jody Byrne at Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) and Nathan Scholz at Olympic Dam.\n\nWe continue to focus on building resilience within our safety systems and processes, by identifying areas of organisational improvement and strengthening our control environment.\n\nOur leaders are also reinforcing that it is safe to speak up in their engagements with our workforce in order for us to learn and improve. We recently held a senior leadership conference dedicated to safety and senior leaders cascaded key themes from the conference to their teams to help re-emphasise the importance of working together to build and sustain a strong safety culture.\n\nThe investigation into Jody Byrne's death has been completed and findings shared with industry peers. The Olympic Dam investigation into Nathan Scholz's death is ongoing. Through the investigations into these events, we will seek to identify lessons that can be shared and applied across our whole organisation to prevent or significantly reduce the likelihood and severity of recurrence, including potential ongoing improvements to our risk framework and underpinning culture.\n\nWe also recognise it is vital to learn from everyday successful work and from others across the mining and other high-risk industries in our effort to learn faster and improve our approach to workplace safety.\n\nIn FY2023, as part of our safe, inclusive and future-ready workforce social value pillar, our criteria for reporting life-altering injuries and illnesses was further developed.\n\nLife-altering injuries and illnesses include cases that are serious at the point of diagnosis as well as those cases that may initially be considered less severe but may result in the prolonged inability to return to full duties. By measuring this metric, we believe we can better focus our organisational efforts on reducing these injuries and illnesses from occurring and improve our return-towork management strategies and workforce health and wellbeing.\n\n## Our safety performance\n\nIn FY2023 we recorded: 1\n\n- -  two fatal incidents in which two colleagues lost their lives\n- -  an increase of 13 per cent in the high-potential injury frequency rate from FY2022. The highest number of events with potential for one or more fatalities was related to vehicle and mobile equipment accidents. High-potential injury trends remain a primary focus to assess progress against our most important safety objective, eliminating fatalities\n- -  an increase in total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) of 9 per cent from FY2022. The highest number of recordable injuries was related to slips, trips and falls for employees, followed by caught between objects. For contractors, the highest number of recordable injuries was for caught between objects\n- -  a consistent application of field leadership activities, which occurred at a 'sustainable frequency rate' of 9,383 activities per million hours worked with over 1.6 million activities completed. Scheduled activities compared to non-scheduled activities increased by 3 per cent from FY2022 and coaching increased by nearly 3 per cent from FY2022\n- -  four safety fines at our operated assets\n\nWe have a sustained focus on improving our management of risk, via our existing programs and systems, such as:\n\n- -  Fatality Elimination Program\n- -  Integrated Contractor Management Program\n- -  Field Leadership Program\n- 1 Data excludes OZ Minerals.\n\n## Performance data - workforce health and safety for FY2023 1,2\n\n## High-potential injury events 3\n\n| Year ended 30 June                | 2023   | 2022      | 2021   | 2020        |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|-----------|--------|-------------|\n| High-potential injuries 4,7       | 30     | 24        | 33     | 42          |\n|                                   |        | Employees |        | Contractors |\n| High-potential injury frequency 5 |        | 0.03      |        | 0.04        |\n\n## Total recordable injury frequency (per million hours worked)\n\nYear ended 30 June\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\nTotal recordable injury frequency\n\nTotal recordable injury frequency\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4.5\n\n4.1\n\n3.8\n\n4.3\n\nEmployees\n\nContractors\n\n1.01\n\n0.81\n\n- 1 Data excludes OZ Minerals.\n- 2 Data excludes OZ Minerals exposure hours and Discontinued operations, as follows: BHP Mitsui Coal (sale completed 3 May 2022) and operated assets in our Petroleum business up to the date of the merger with Woodside (1 June 2022).\n- 3 High-potential injury includes injuries with fatality potential. The basis of calculation was revised in FY2020 from event count to injury count as part of a safety reporting methodology improvement.\n- 4 One additional event from FY2022 was reclassified to be a high-potential injury post FY2022, updating the total from 23 to 24.\n- 5 Employee and contractor frequency per 200,000 hours worked.\n- 6 Combined employee and contractor frequency per 1 million hours worked.\n- 7 OZ Minerals exposure hours and high-potential injuries are excluded from this calculation. Since the acquisition of OZ Minerals on 2 May 2023, there have been three high-potential injuries recorded at former OZ Minerals assets.\n\nWe aim to continue to enhance the application of these programs and systems in FY2024 and to continue to learn and improve. We greatly value the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with others across our industry and within similar high-risk work environments. An example of this is our key role in supporting the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) in its work to encourage the development and adoption of capable solutions across diesel particulate matter emission reduction and the elimination of fatalities related to vehicle interaction.\n\n## Fatality Elimination Program\n\nThe tragic loss of two colleagues has amplified the importance of our Fatality Elimination Program (FEL) even further. It is paramount that we learn and improve from these tragic events and remain committed to our goal to have no fatalities.\n\nWe are seeking to enhance the effectiveness of the Fatality Elimination Program by operationalising our recent fatality investigation learnings. While BHP's top 10 material risks are predominately associated with actual high-potential and near miss events, which has driven the development of Fatality Elimination Program control management plans at our assets, we recognise there are ongoing improvement opportunities relating to the development, verification and validation of critical controls for other material risks.\n\n## In FY2023 we:\n\n- -  continued implementation of the five-year fatality elimination roadmap, including the recommended sequencing of strengthened controls based on effort, cost and near miss reduction impact\n- -  continued our ongoing quarterly review routine of high-potential near miss and actual events to ensure we remain focused on the relevant risks and conditions that may increase the likelihood of accidents\n- -  undertook an internal audit across Minerals Australia operated assets (December 2022) to assess the adequacy of controls identified under the respective Fatality Elimination Program plans. Key audit findings and recommendations identified the opportunity to improve the approach to the overall FEL program progress reporting and provision of supporting evidence. A Minerals Americas operated assets audit is planned for FY2024\n\nThe fatality risk management framework will be reviewed to determine if there are any opportunities for improvement in FY2024 following a review of the fatality investigation findings.\n\n## Integrated Contractor Management Program\n\nOur commitment to safety includes for the many thousands of contractors who represent a large part of our total workforce.\n\nOur Integrated Contractor Management Program is designed to make it safer and easier for contractors to work with us. Introduced in FY2020, the program is focused on building long-term mutually beneficial relationships, integrating and simplifying processes and systems, and creating an inclusive, respectful and",

Since its introduction, the program has standardised roles and responsibilities of contract owners and promoted improved partnerships with BHP service providers.\n\nWe undertook assurance and audit activities in FY2023, assessing controls against the global Our Requirements for Contractor Management standard and continued to use the contractor perception survey in parallel with our employee perception survey.\n\n## Field Leadership Program\n\nLeaders spending time in the field helps maintain safe operations. Our global Field Leadership Program encourages the workforce to provide feedback to their leaders about safety to reinforce an interdependent culture of safety. It involves leaders engaging with workers in the field to drive a common approach to improving health, safety and environment (HSE) performance. The program helps verify that critical safety controls are in place, being applied and are effective in managing risks that have the potential to result in fatalities.\n\n## In FY2023 we:\n\n- -  continued to improve the quality of field leadership activities by increasing coaching and delivery of field leadership engagements\n- -  conducted field leadership activities to support the verification of risks that have the potential to result in fatalities across our operated assets\n- -  continued to embed the global, standardised field leadership procedure designed to increase the effectiveness of field leadership activities across the business\n- -  leveraged predictive data analytics to initiate a 'critical control observation uplift program' during the end of the calendar year holiday season, to focus each respective operation on potential hot spots and blind spots\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on safety is available at\n\n- bhp.com/safety\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6.2  Our sustainability approach\n\nOur approach to sustainability includes identifying opportunities to create a positive contribution to society through social value. Our approach to social value, including the targets and goals we have set for ourselves, is outlined in OFR 6.5. We recognise our business interacts with a range of material sustainability issue areas and governance of our approach to managing our potential and actual impacts is key to operating more sustainably.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on governance of sustainability refer to OFR 6.3\n\n## Reporting standards and frameworks\n\nWe commit to a number of sustainability frameworks, standards and initiatives and we disclose data both as required by law and according to the requirements of those frameworks, standards and initiatives.

We will seek opportunities to learn from and leverage effective practices from OZ Minerals as we integrate.\n\nOZ Minerals Limited released its most recent Annual Report and Sustainability Review in February 2023, which outlined its sustainability performance during CY2022. Consistent with BHP, OZ Minerals adopted the GRI Standards and the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as the basis to prepare and report its sustainability disclosures. OZ Minerals received reasonable assurance over the energy and GHG emission data for its Australian assets and limited assurance over selected sustainability information within its Annual Report and Sustainability Review and 2022 Sustainability Review Databook.\n\nIn the identification of our material sustainability topics, we have included consideration of the sustainability issues that OZ Minerals identified as material for disclosure through its materiality assessment in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information refer to OFR 6.4\n\nThis Report includes the OZ Minerals sustainability-related data and information that is required to be disclosed under legal and regulatory requirements or necessary to meet applicable voluntary standards and benchmarks. Specific OZ Minerals data and information are noted in certain sections, such as workforce gender metrics and material climate-related transition and physical risks, where expressly stated, but not otherwise.\n\nDuring FY2024, we will focus on integrating and aligning OZ Minerals' preacquisition approach and relevant performance-related data into our sustainability reporting and assurance processes to allow for more detailed disclosure across the full suite of material sustainability topics in the BHP Annual Report 2024 and supplementary materials (e.g. our ESG Standards and Databook).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on OZ Minerals' sustainability performance for CY2022 refer to OZ Minerals' 2022 Annual Report and Sustainability Review and 2022 Sustainability Review Databook, published in February 2023, as well as OZ Minerals' 2022 Modern Slavery Statement, which was approved by the Board of OZ Minerals Limited on 5 April 2023 and published on 1 May 2023\n\n## 6.3  Sustainability governance\n\nWe define our approach to sustainability through Our Charter , which is governed through the Our Requirements standards. These standards describe our mandatory minimum performance requirements and provide the foundation to develop and implement management systems at our operated assets.\n\nThe BHP Board has oversight of our approach to and delivery on sustainability and is supported by each of its Committees. For more information on BHP's governance structure, including the work of the Board and each Committee, refer to the Corporate Governance Statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the governance of climate change refer to OFR 6.12\n\nIn March 2023, we expanded management's Climate Change Steering Committee to a Sustainability and ESG Steering Committee (SteerCo) with the purpose of facilitating review of a broader range of cross-functional and strategic issues relating to key sustainability and ESG topics. The key responsibilities of the SteerCo relating to climate change have not changed from FY2022.\n\nThe membership of the SteerCo includes the Chief Legal, Governance and External Affairs Officer, the Chief Operations Officer, the Chief Commercial Officer and the Presidents of Minerals Americas and Minerals Australia from the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) as well as sustainability and ESG leaders within BHP. Matters considered by the SteerCo may also be subject to review or approval by the ELT, and the Board or its Committees in accordance with their remits.\n\nPrior to its expansion, the Climate Change SteerCo met twice in FY2023 and the expanded Sustainability and ESG SteerCo met once during FY2023. They discussed topics including our social value scorecard and preparation for emerging mandatory climate-related reporting requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6.4  Material sustainability topics\n\n## Annual sustainability materiality assessment\n\nEach year we identify the sustainability topics most material to our business partners and stakeholders. These considerations inform our approach to sustainability.\n\nIn alignment with the recommendations of the GRI, we consider the actual and potential negative and positive impacts of our business in order to determine our material sustainability topics. As part of our assessment, we considered a broad range of inputs, including BHP's group priority and emerging risks, information recorded in our internal event management system, our social value framework, insights from interviews with senior leaders and subject matter experts across the business and the sustainability issues OZ Minerals identified as material for disclosure through its materiality assessment in 2022. We sought to ensure our external partners' and stakeholders' perspectives informed our assessment by including consideration of issues raised at our Annual General Meeting and investor roundtables, industry sustainability standards and guidance, sustainability-related regulatory focus areas, relevant media articles about our impacts and input from the Forum on Corporate Responsibility. Our material sustainability topics were reviewed by the Sustainability Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our assessment refer to\n\nbhp.com/sustainability\n\nThe material sustainability topics identified through this assessment are shown against our social value pillars and are largely consistent with FY2022 as illustrated in the table on page 34.\n\n## Respecting human rights\n\nWe recognise sustainability topics, if not carefully managed, can adversely impact people's human rights.\n\n## Governance and capability\n\nThe basis for BHP's human rights approach is an ongoing commitment to operate in a manner consistent with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the 10 UN Global Compact Principles.\n\nOur Human Rights Policy Statement details our commitment to respecting human rights, including the additional issue-specific human rights standards we seek to adhere to, as well as the systems and processes set out for our people, business partners and other relevant parties. In FY2023, we completed a review of the Human Rights Policy Statement, identifying an opportunity to simplify its format and language to state our expectations for human rights due diligence and other practices more clearly. The updated Human Rights Policy Statement was approved by the Board in February 2023.\n\nOur Code of Conduct ( Our Code ) which applies to everyone who works for us, with us or on our behalf, and Our Code training covers our expectations in relation to human rights.\n\n## Due diligence\n\nWe recognise our business activities may create human rights risks and potential impacts across several different areas. In FY2023, all operated assets and exploration regions completed human rights baseline studies, which seek to provide an objective baseline of the external human rights context in the regions where we operate. These studies include a review of the national and regional human rights policies, frameworks and issues as well as analysis of priority human rights risks and issues for the communities that host our operations, such as labour conditions, environment, community wellbeing and Indigenous rights.\n\nBuilding on the findings of the baseline studies, we are progressing Human Rights Impact Assessments at all operated assets and exploration regions, expected to be completed in FY2024. These assessments seek to compare asset and exploration plans with the external context to identify and prioritise potential and actual human rights risks, impacts and opportunities for management.",

These are outlined in our social value scorecard below. Our scorecard provides clarity to our partners, stakeholders and our teams on our ambitions and allows us to measure and transparently report progress.\n\n## 2030 social value scorecard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2030 goals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Key metrics                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Short-term milestones   (FY2023 progress) Planet  \u00b7  People  \u00b7  Prosperity                                                                                                                                    | Short-term milestones   (FY2024 focus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Decarbonisation 41%  At least 30% reduction in operational  GHG emissions; support 40% emission  intensity reduction of BHP-chartered  shipping of our products, and support  development of technologies and  pathways capable of 30% emission  intensity reduction in integrated  steelmaking. 1,2 | 32%  reduction in operational  GHG emissions from FY2020 reduction 21  in emission  intensity of BHP-chartered  shipping of our products from  CY2008 US$114  million  committed in  steelmaking partnerships and  ventures to date 3 | FY2023:  95% of study  phase projects are  presented for tollgates  or meet milestones  as scheduled in  BHP's operational  decarbonisation plan FY2024:  Operationalise  five low/zero GHG  emission vessels | FY2024:  Delivery of equipment for  proof-of-concept trials for electrified Rail  and Excavator solutions FY2024:  Commence construction of  boiler diesel displacement solution FY2024:  Complete a pilot scale Electric  Smelter Furnace design study FY2024:  Engage the market to  introduce additional lower/zero GHG  emission BHP-chartered vessels |\n| Healthy environment 0  Create nature positive 4  outcomes by  having at least 30% of the land and  water we steward 5,  under conservation,  restoration or regenerative practices.

To demonstrate continual progress towards 2030, we intend to develop new short-term milestones each year and report annually on our performance. New and existing milestones planned for FY2024 to demonstrate annual progress towards the 2030 goals are presented in the scorecard, but are not intended to represent the full roadmap to 2030. We aim to continue to learn and improve our pathways to 2030 and anticipate developing new, additional metrics in the coming years.\n\nAt its core, our scorecard represents an emphasis on partnerships, listening and co-design, recognising that it is not for us alone to decide what is of value to communities or the environment and addressing challenges like climate change and nature loss requires collaboration.\n\nOur performance in FY2023 against the scorecard is provided on page 35, along with revised and updated milestones, to demonstrate our progress towards our 2030 goals. Additional information on how the metrics and milestones support progress towards our 2030 goals and the methods we use to measure progress are detailed in the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2023 available at bhp.com/sustainability.\n\n## Social investment\n\nIn FY2023, our voluntary social investment totalled US$149.6 million. This investment consisted of US$79.6 million in direct funding to community development and environmental projects and donations, US$14.7 million equity share to non-operated joint venture social investment programs, a US$34.5 million donation to the BHP Foundation and US$1.2 million under the Matched Giving Program. Administrative costs 1 to facilitate direct social investment activities totalled US$13.7 million and US$5.9 million and supported the activities of the BHP Foundation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on social investment, including case studies and other initiatives to support communities where we operate is available at bhp.com/social-investment\n\n- More information on the BHP Foundation is available at\n\nbhp-foundation.org\n\n## 6.6  People\n\nOur more than 80,000 employees and contractors around the world are the foundation of our business. We aim to attract and retain the best people.\n\nOur distinctive way of working through the BHP Operating System (BOS) empowers our people to bring the best of themselves to improve their work every day. We offer competitive remuneration and invest in the development of our people to build capability and drive stronger performance.\n\n## Developing our capabilities and an enabled culture\n\nIn FY2023, we completed integrated strategic workforce plans for each of our operating assets. Developed by leveraging data and insights, these workforce plans foreshadow our resourcing and capability needs for the business today and tomorrow.\n\nFootnotes refer to 2030 social value scorecard on previous page.\n\n- 1 With widespread adoption expected post-2030.\n- 2 For the definition of the terms used to express these positions, including 'target', 'goal', 'operational GHG emissions', 'net zero' and 'carbon neutral' refer to Additional information 10.4. For more information on the essential definitions, assumptions and adjustments for our targets and goals refer to Metrics, targets and goals in OFR 6.12.\n- 3 Excluding in-kind contributions.\n- 4 Nature positive is defined by the WBCSD/TNFD as 'A high-level goal and concept describing a future state of nature (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural capital) which is greater than the current state.' It includes land and water management practices that halt and reverse nature loss - that is, supporting healthy, functioning ecosystems.\n- 5 Excluding greenfield exploration licences (or equivalent tenements), which are located outside the area of influence of our existing mine operations. 30 per cent will be calculated based on the areas of land and water that we steward at the end of FY2030.

Once trained and qualified, employees move to one of our Australian assets.\n\nThe FutureFit Academy is designed as an inclusive learning environment, welcoming employees who are new to the industry and providing permanent employment from day one. Our student cohort includes 80 per cent female participation and is made up of an over 20 per cent Indigenous intake. The FutureFit Academy is recognised globally as an innovative learning facility.\n\nDuring FY2023, the FutureFit Academy continued to expand its innovative approach to developing apprentices and trainees. As a unique learning offering in the industry, the FutureFit Academy expanded its reach across Minerals Australia. The FutureFit Academy commenced an expansion project to be completed in late CY2023 to provide a larger footprint in Perth, Western Australia with the move to a purpose-built, state-of-the-art learning centre that includes fabrication and auto electrical trades in addition to the core mechanical fitting and heavy diesel programs. A satellite FutureFit Academy was also established in Newman, Western Australia, providing a belt splicing program for experienced students. Career pathways for vocational education is a core feature of the FutureFit Academy model and a retention rate of over 85 per cent has been consistently maintained for students relative to the industry average of less than 50 per cent.\n\nThe strong partnership with vocational educational institutions and our FutureFit Academy ensures the learning programs provide nationally accredited qualifications and are a unique attraction and retention lever for BHP.\n\nOur intern and graduate programs also serve to attract and develop emerging talent for critical skills we need for the future. In FY2023, 220 interns joined BHP for eight to 24 weeks to gain experience in their chosen field of study through on the job learning and working on mine sites alongside technical professionals. Our selected interns have early access to apply for our annual graduate program intakes. We expanded our graduate program to include Canada and the United States to meet the needs for future skills across our operations in those regions with 160 graduates onboarded globally in FY2023.\n\nAt least twice a year we ask our employees and contractors about their experiences working with BHP via an Engagement and Perception Survey. After each survey, our team leaders assess what is working well and what they can learn from others before taking action to address improvement areas. In March 2023, we had a response rate of 79 per cent of employees and 7,775 of our on-structure contractors. We achieved a strong engagement score of 84 per cent. In particular, 82 per cent of our employees and our embedded contractors who completed the survey recommend BHP as a great place to work, which places us in the top 25 per cent of global organisations as benchmarked by Qualtrics. 2\n\n- 1 Costs associated with implementing social investment activities, including labour, travel, research and development, communications and costs to facilitate the operation of the BHP Foundation.\n- 2 Qualtrics, LLC is a leading global employee and customer experience survey company, which provides external benchmarks via their online platform.\n- 12  Reduction in life-altering injury or illness: includes life-altering or long-term permanent disabling injuries and illnesses as defined by the BHP Risk Management Framework.\n- 13  The core components of the sexual harassment program included completion of Active Bystander training and Safety Stops, Positive Duty consultation with external experts and employees, development of the Priority Group Experience Framework, ongoing evaluation of the Minerals Australia Alcohol standard, sexual harassment Risk and Control Framework enhancements, contractor engagement, transparency and disclosure, response and support improvements, internal communications and embedment of learnings from external reviews into under-reporting.\n- 14  Co-design requires meaningful engagement and contribution to the plan from a variety of interested stakeholders.\n- 15  Net Promoter Scores show respective feedback from our customers and suppliers, and measures the willingness of our customers/suppliers to recommend BHP to others.

Our systems, processes and practices are designed to support fair and equitable treatment for our people. Our Inclusion and Diversity Position Statement confirms our vision, commitment and contributions to inclusion, equity and diversity. Since 2016, we have been embedding flexible working, partnering with our supply chain partners to support our commitment to inclusion and diversity, and undertaking work to mitigate bias in our systems with the aim of ensuring our workplaces are safe and inclusive for a diverse range of people.\n\nOur goal is to attract and retain a workforce that is representative of society. We intend to do this by addressing the barriers and impacts of bias and discrimination experienced by people within underrepresented groups through listening to their experience and gaining insights from our engagement surveys and the recently deployed self-identification survey, 'Tell Us About You'. So far, almost 11,000 people have confidentially shared with us information about themselves.\n\nTo help mitigate gender pay disparities, we have taken steps to reduce potential bias in remuneration offered at the time of recruitment and we conduct an annual gender pay review. The results of the pay review are reported to the BHP People and Remuneration Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For information on our approach to addressing workplace sexual harassment refer to OFR 6.7 and racism refer to OFR 6.6\n\n## Gender balance 1\n\nIn CY2016, we announced our aspiration to achieve gender balance within our employee workforce globally by the end of FY2025, which we define as a minimum 40 per cent women and 40 per cent men in line with the definitions used by entities such as the International Labour Organization.\n\nWe increased the representation of women working at BHP by 2.9 percentage points in FY2023, with over 10,000 more female employees at the end of FY2023 than in 2016. As at 30 June 2023, women represented 35.2 per cent of our employee workforce. Since we first set our gender balance aspiration in 2016, BHP has now doubled the representation of women (from 17.6 per cent to 35.2 per cent). We are confident of achieving gender balance by the end of FY2025.\n\n- 1 Based on a 'point in time' snapshot of employees as at 30 June 2023, including employees on extended absence, as used in internal management reporting for the purposes of monitoring progress against our goals. This does not include employees that transitioned from OZ Minerals on 2 May 2023 (24.6 per cent female at 30 June 2023); these employees are included in the overall BHP employee reporting from FY2024. 'People leaders' are defined as employees with one or more direct reports. Senior executives are defined as employees in the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and direct reports to the ELT in grade 15 and above roles.\n\nThe table below shows the gender composition of our employees, senior leaders and the Board over the last three financial years 1,2,3\n\n|                       | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Female employees      | 14,898 | 12,674 | 11,868 |\n| Male employees        | 27,421 | 26,536 | 27,953 |\n| Female people leaders | 2,006  | 1,695  | 1,439  |\n| Male people leaders   | 4,754  | 4,380  | 4,276  |\n| Female ELT 4  members | 5      | 5      | 5      |\n| Male ELT 4  members   | 5      | 5      | 5      |\n| Female Board members  | 4      | 4      | 4      |\n| Male Board members    | 6      | 8      | 8      |\n\n- 1 Based on a 'point in time' snapshot of employees as at 30 June, as used in internal management reporting for the purposes of monitoring progress against our goals. For 2023, this does not include employees that transitioned from the OZ Minerals business via acquisition on 2 May 2023, (359 female employees and 1,098 male employees at 30 June 2023). These employees are included in the overall BHP employee reporting from FY2024.\n- 2 For 2021 this included employees of BHP Petroleum, who left BHP via the merger with Woodside (approximately 1,000 employees) and BHP Mitsui Coal operations, which sold to Stanmore Resources (approximately 500 employees) during FY2022.\n- 3 In FY2023, some of our employees did not identify as male or female (<0.1% of total employees). We have excluded these employees from other data presented in the gender composition table to protect the privacy of those employees. We will explore options to include our employees who do not identify as male or female in our diversity reporting including 'Tell Us About You' survey data in future reporting periods and continuing to protect their privacy.\n- 4 ELT is Executive Leadership Team.\n\nThe gender breakdown of new hires in FY2023 was 51.9 per cent men and 48.1 per cent women. We improved our representation of women in leadership in FY2023 by 1.8 percentage points compared to FY2022. As at 30 June 2023, 29.7 per cent of people leaders were women and of our senior executives 40.7 per cent were women and 59.3 per cent were men.\n\n## Indigenous employment\n\nIndigenous peoples are critical partners of BHP's operations around the world. We recognise, as part of our global Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement, that we can contribute to the economic empowerment of Indigenous peoples through providing opportunities for employment, training and procurement and by supporting Indigenous enterprises.\n\nWe have set targets to increase Indigenous employment in our Minerals Australia operations, Minerals Americas operations in Chile and our Jansen Potash Project and operations in Canada.\n\n## Indigenous employee representation 1\n\n| Location                                                 | Period               |   Target   (%) |   30 June  2023  (%) |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| Minerals Americas operations  employees in Chile         | By the end of FY2025 |           10   |                  9.7 |\n| Minerals Australia operations  employees in Australia 2  | By the end of FY2027 |            9.7 |                  8.6 |\n| Jansen Potash Project and  operation employees in Canada | By the end of FY2026 |           20   |                  7.7 |\n\n- 2 Indigenous employee representation overall in Australia at 30 June 2023 was 7.7 per cent, including Minerals Australia operations, 8.6 per cent Indigenous, and non-operational locations, 2.7 per cent Indigenous. For FY2023 this does not include employees of OZ Minerals who joined BHP via acquisition on 2 May 2023, which has 3.8 per cent Indigenous employee representation at the operation in Australia at 30 June 2023.\n- 3 Indigenous workforce representation at Jansen Potash Project and operations of 20.8 per cent includes employees, 7.7 per cent Indigenous and contractors, 21.4 per cent Indigenous.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our 2030 goals related to Indigenous partnerships refer to OFR 6.15\n\n## Racial equity program\n\nWe recognise and acknowledge racism impacts our people's sense of identity, value, feeling of respect and psychological safety. There is no place for racism at BHP or anywhere in the community. We are taking action to better understand the prevalence of racism at BHP to promote an anti-racist workplace and ensure racial equity.\n\nIn 2022, we started our listening journey with a series of engagement sessions on racism led by Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) Vandita Pant. We dedicated listening sessions facilitated by external psychology and racial diversity experts and heard from 200 employees across BHP about their experience of racism at BHP. Our people reported a lack of capability in leaders and our processes in responding and reacting to racism. Our listening sessions, combined with learning from external experts, including the Australian Race Discrimination Commissioner, have helped inform our workplan to improve the lived experience of our racially and culturally diverse workforce. The current program of work is targeted to address behavioural racism as well as systemic racism as may be embedded in workplace policies, systems and practices. We are committed to partnering with our people and using EmBRace (Employees Beyond Race) employee resource groups, Indigenous employee networks and external experts to co-create solutions.\n\nOur actions to date include:\n\n- -  In April 2018, Our Code of Conduct was refreshed to provide guidance on racial discrimination and the Respectful Behaviours campaign was launched.\n- -  In September 2020, racism was classified as a Category A breach of Our Code of Conduct , requiring all events to be reported to EthicsPoint and all investigations to be undertaken by independent Ethics and Compliance teams.\n- -  In February 2022, the 'Tell Us About You' internal survey was released to obtain self-identified information about BHP's people, including ethnicity, cultural background and languages spoken. The data collected from the survey, which is always open, enables us to better recognise",

This group works alongside our Indigenous engagement teams in Australia, Chile and Canada to incorporate our Reconciliation Action Plan commitments.\n- -  In line with our commitment to have human centric and caring grievance processes, we expanded the Ethics Support Service, a team dedicated to providing support, options and coordination, as well as management of racism matters. This team is the first point of contact for people impacted by racism to guide and support them through the process.\n- -  In October 2022, we launched EmBRace our newest employee resource group focused on discussions around race and racial diversity. Local chapters have now been set up in Australia, Singapore and Manila\n- -  We launched an internal global awareness and communication campaign in December 2022, including featuring the 'People of BHP' to celebrate our diversity and started the conversation with a new campaign 'Let's talk about race!'\n- -  Throughout FY2023, we rolled out the Active Bystander Training for all leaders and employees, focused on 'calling it out', helping leaders take action, listen and act on what our people tell us.\n\nOver the next year we intend to continue to progress our work of identifying and addressing structural barriers to equity in recruitment, development and promotion processes, build awareness and capability in our leaders and continue to improve our grievance processes to support people who tell us when they have experienced racism.\n\n## LGBT+ inclusion\n\nOur LGBT+ ally employee inclusion group, Jasper, established in 2017, is a natural extension of our inclusion and diversity aspirations. Its membership base grew to around 2,800 in FY2023, with 16 chapters globally.\n\nIn FY2023, we continued to close gaps for LGBT+ inclusion, such as co-creating with Jasper inclusive grievance and support processes for people who experience sexual harassment.\n\n## Case study - Jasper and Ethics Support Service\n\nBHP's support systems, processes and resources aim to be LGBT+ inclusive and safe and accessible to all. To help achieve this, the Ethics Support Service worked with Jasper through inception and design phases to ensure the services offered promoted LGBT+ inclusion. This included ensuring Jasper was engaged in risk assessments, the design of procedures and empathy mapping to assess inclusion throughout the end-to-end support service processes. Feedback received via Jasper and the Ethics Support Service has been positive, with employees reporting they feel seen and heard and appreciate having someone to talk to as they navigate through a difficult situation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to\n\nbhp.com/people\n\n## Disability\n\nOur teams have been improving the accessibility of our workplaces in Chile for people with a disability. There are now 121 direct employees (1.59 per cent) in our Chilean workforce who live with a disability, and who are supported by a program of work to build knowledge and awareness and to implement workplace adjustments and inclusive infrastructure changes at our operations. We intend to build on these foundations by developing a global Disability Action Plan, informed by listening sessions and an audit conducted in FY2023. Our global employee resource group, Amber, was established in FY2023 and is playing a critical role in co-creating the plan and improvements.\n\n## Flexible working\n\nEnabling our people to work flexibly remains a critical pillar in our strategy to attract and retain a diverse, inclusive and high performing workforce. For our office-based teams this may include flexible workdays, or ad hoc agreed changes to hours to enable the employee to attend appointments\n\nor manage personal commitments. In FY2023, we updated our guidance on hybrid working for our corporate office-based employees and requested our people to spend at least two to three days together in the office each week and the remainder from home, for travel or working from other locations. By putting some structure around how we spend our time together in the office, we deliberately create opportunities for a more meaningful employee experience. In doing so, our people retain a degree of autonomy in how and where they work so they have both the benefits of flexibility and the social connection, collaboration and innovation that comes from being together in the office environment.\n\nFor operational teams we remain focused on roster and job re-design to give people more options to integrate life and work. For example, a new early start night shift option is now on offer for a crew of haul truck operators at WAIO's Newman Operations West to help our teams manage family and work commitments.\n\n## Employee relations\n\nIn Australia, the Federal Government introduced its first tranche of industrial relations legislative reforms in December 2022, bringing significant changes to the enterprise bargaining framework. The legislation introduced several changes to workplace laws in Australia, including changes relating to the approval and termination of enterprise agreements, the powers of the Fair Work Commission to intervene and make workplace determinations, when industrial action can be taken and access to multiemployer bargaining. We continue to monitor progress of further legislative reforms expected to be tabled in early FY2024, including the Federal Government's proposed 'Same Job, Same Pay' policy, which may have the potential to add to our labour costs.\n\nIn Chile, we are navigating a number of legal developments that may have implications for employee relations, for example, the new 40-hour shift regulation.\n\nDuring FY2023, Minerals Australia participated in 17 collective bargaining processes, with four enterprise agreements completed (three presently in operation and one before the Fair Work Commission for approval) and 13 subject to ongoing negotiations as at the date of this Report. Minerals Americas participated in two collective bargaining processes during FY2023. Across our operations, there were four rounds of collective bargaining where protected industrial action occurred during FY2023 three at our Minerals Australia operations (BMA Enterprise Agreement 2022, Operations Services Maintenance Enterprise Agreement and Operations Services Production Agreement) and one at our Minerals Americas operations in Chile (Spence Union 1).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to\n\nbhp.com/people\n\n## Review of employee allowances and entitlements\n\nIn FY2023, we identified issues with certain allowances and entitlements affecting a number of our current and former employees in Australia. A review has confirmed that certain rostered employees across our Australian operations have had leave incorrectly deducted on public holidays since 2010. Our preliminary review disclosed in June 2023 indicated there were approximately 28,500 affected current and former employees, with an average of six leave days in total that were incorrectly deducted from affected employees over this 13-year period. Following further review and verification of our payroll records, the number of affected current and former employees has increased to approximately 34,000 and the average number of incorrectly deducted leave days has decreased slightly to approximately five leave days in total. OZ Minerals was affected by a similar leave deduction issue before being acquired by BHP in May 2023.\n\nCurrent employees were first contacted in June 2023 to confirm that leave that has been incorrectly deducted will be re-credited with 10 per cent provided on top of what we owed to recognise that this should never have happened. We will contact former employees regarding remediation payments for leave incorrectly deducted and an additional 10 per cent top up. We have established a dedicated hotline and a website (bhp.com/payrollreview) to provide assistance to affected employees.\n\nIn addition, our preliminary review identified approximately 400 current and former employees at Port Hedland who may be entitled to additional allowances due to an error with the employment entity in their contract.",

Review and verification of our payroll records of this issue is ongoing.\n\nBased on currently available information, the cost of remediating the leave issue and the contracting issue is estimated to be US$280 million pre-tax, incorporating costs, including associated superannuation and interest payments (BHP share) and this has been reflected in the Group's FY2023 financial result.\n\nWe have self-reported to the Fair Work Ombudsman and engaged Protiviti, a global assurance firm, to conduct a review of our payroll systems.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nMinerals Australia removed the vaccine site access requirement for all workplaces with effect from 1 March 2023. Minerals Americas removed the vaccine, mask and distance requirements for all operated asset workplaces with effect from September 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on people refer to\n\nbhp.com/people\n\n## 6.7  Sexual harassment\n\nOur priority is to ensure our workplaces are safe and inclusive for everyone who works or engages with BHP. We acknowledge the presence of sexual harassment 1 in the mining industry. We consider sexual harassment to be a material health and safety risk, harmful to impacted individuals, bystanders, our partners and stakeholders.\n\nBHP welcomed the Anti-Discrimination and Human Rights Legislation Amendment (Respect at Work) Act 2022 (Cth) (Respect@Work Act), which came into effect in December 2022. This amended the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) to require employers to take reasonable and proportionate measures to eliminate, as far as possible, unlawful sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sex-based harassment, victimisation and work environments that are hostile on the grounds of sex.\n\n## Our approach to prevent sexual harassment\n\nIn CY2018, we defined sexual harassment as a health and safety risk, to be overseen in the same way as other work health and safety risks. Since this time, we have been engaging our workforce and external experts as we address harmful behaviours with a risk-based approach.\n\nIn FY2022, a Project Management Office (PMO) was established through the office of the CEO to provide central governance over all sexual harassment work, which included priority focus areas, such as driving progress toward gender balance, creating a safe and respectful workplace, building accountability and capability of leaders, upskilling our workforce to be active bystanders, enhancing our policies, processes and controls, and providing person-centred and trauma-informed response and support.\n\nIn FY2023, the Sexual Harassment Prevention PMO continued to increase transparency, drive accountability and rigorous governance, incorporate organisational lessons learned and best practice into key programs of work and regularly engage senior management and the Board.\n\nOur focus in FY2024 will be to continue:\n\n- -  focusing on initiatives that increase female representation across our operations\n- -  implementing our enhanced suite of sexual harassment prevention controls, which incorporate organisational learnings and third-party expert recommendations\n- 1 'Sexual harassment' is, as defined in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth), an unwelcome sexual advance, unwelcome request for sexual favours or other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, in circumstances where a reasonable person would have anticipated the possibility that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated and/or intimidated. Sexual harassment encompasses a range of conduct, including displaying sexually graphic images, sexually suggestive comments, suggestive or inappropriate looks, gestures or staring, non-consensual touching or acts of a sexual nature and sexual assault. We note the definition of sexual harassment may vary in different jurisdictions.\n- 2 EthicsPoint is our confidential reporting tool. It is accessible to all, including external partners and stakeholders and the public, to report conduct that may be unethical, illegal or inconsistent with Our Code of Conduct .\n- 3 This does not include investigations that are currently in progress and is exclusive of OZ Minerals data.\n- -  engaging and empowering our entire workforce to take action as active bystanders and enhancing their capabilities\n- -  encouraging increased incident reporting and enhancing our approach to supporting impacted persons to thrive at BHP\n\n## Reports of sexual harassment\n\nThere were 475 reports of sexual harassment in FY2023. We continue to take action to increase awareness and promote reporting, response and investigations in relation to these matters. Since October 2020, BHP managers and leaders have been required to enter any serious conduct issues raised directly with them, including sexual harassment, into EthicsPoint\u00b2 (anonymously if requested). As expected, with this focus on safe reporting and leadership reporting onus, the reported cases remain high. During the year, 44 per cent of sexual harassment reports received into EthicsPoint were logged by managers or leaders on behalf of their direct reports.\n\nIn FY2023, we reported all established cases of sexual harassment closed in this financial year regardless of when they were initially reported. This is a change from FY2022 where we disclosed established cases of sexual harassment that were reported and closed in FY2022. The change to the categorisation of cases was a result of BHP's continuous improvement efforts to better capture the types of conduct occurring.\n\nThis change in reporting has an impact in the comparability of the number of established sexual harassment cases between FY2022 and FY2023. Of the 167 established cases in FY2023, 43 cases were opened in FY2022 (or prior years) but closed this financial year.\n\nDuring FY2023, across BHP's global operations and offices, 167 investigated cases of sexual harassment conduct were established as having occurred. 3\n\nOf the 167 established cases:\n\n- -  one was a sexual assault\n- -  38 involved sexualised and indecent touching\n- -  41 involved sexually aggressive comments, stalking, grooming and image-based harassment\n- -  87 involved other forms of sexual harassment, including sexualised conversations or jokes\n- -  165 individuals responsible had their employment terminated (or were removed from site if a contractor) or resigned\n\nThis is an increase from 103 reported last financial year, which is partly due to 43 cases that were reported in years prior to FY2023 but closed this financial year.\n\nIn addition to the matters listed above, in FY2023 92 reports of sexual harassment were dealt with by way of non-investigative resolution pathways, instead of an investigation being conducted. These resolution pathways included supported conversations with respondents, additional training, monitoring or awareness raising on BHP's expectations of respectful behaviours in the workplace. This process only occurs where the resolution pathway is proportionate to the nature of the conduct and with the agreement of the impacted person. We continue to monitor and review the use of our resolution pathways to ensure they are meeting the needs of impacted people and to improve reporting to support organisational lessons learned.\n\nIn addition to non-investigative resolution pathways, there are cases of sexual harassment that cannot be investigated due to insufficient information. Examples include anonymous reports and non-participation of the impacted person. However, all cases are assessed for safety and other risks as part of preliminary investigative actions and all participants are offered support irrespective of whether the matter can be formally investigated.\n\n## Leadership\n\nOur position on sexual harassment is reinforced through regular senior leadership communications. These include messages from our CEO, Executive Leadership Team and on-site signage regarding our expectations and avenues for support. Executive and senior leader remuneration are linked to Group-wide performance criteria, which includes progress towards greater inclusion, diversity and gender representation. This includes the program of work to address sexual harassment.\n\nRespectful behaviour and sexual harassment prevention and response training is provided to BHP line leaders, aimed at setting clear expectations",

Our approach includes conducting risk assessments to identify scenarios in which sexual harassment risks may arise, their potential causes and the controls we can implement to prevent them and reduce harm. This process identified factors that can contribute to the risk of workplace sexual harassment that are more pronounced in the mining industry, (including isolated or remote working locations, a largely maledominated workforce and accommodation villages), as well as factors that are common across all industries and workplaces.\n\nIn FY2023, we worked to further enhance our current controls to help prevent sexual harassment and reduce its harmful impacts. Engagements with external experts, as well as members of our workforce, have identified a need for further focus on preventative controls, particularly with respect to culture and behaviours. Our core controls to prevent sexual harassment include recruitment processes; training; security measures at accommodation villages; contractor and third-party engagement; emergency response; trauma-informed care for impacted persons; accessible, confidential reporting, person-centred response and investigations; and appropriate disciplinary action. We will also embed new controls related to leadership, technology and continuous improvement in FY2024.\n\n## Culture\n\nBHP has a clear aspiration to have a gender-balanced employee workforce by FY2025. A diverse and inclusive workforce in every team and at every level is an important part of our approach to preventing sexual harassment.\n\nBHP recognises that suppliers and contractors in our ecosystem have shared values around preventing sexual harassment and sex-based discrimination in our industry and communities. Third-party contractors are expected to comply with Our Code of Conduct and have access to BHP EthicsPoint, Support Service, Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and other related care and medical/psychological treatment pathways. Contractors are also embedded in many aspects of BHP's way of working, including in routines such as toolbox talks and safety shares, perception surveys and required training.\n\n## Knowledge of sexual harassment prevention, response and support\n\nSince FY2018, we have been continuing to develop a sustained program of work designed to increase the capability of our workforce to identify and call out disrespectful behaviour, including sexual harassment, racism and bullying.\n\nBHP prioritises the wellbeing, psychological safety and needs of all people affected by sexual harassment, sex-based discrimination and victimisation. We established our global Support Service in FY2022 to provide dedicated, end-to-end case coordination for anyone impacted by sexual harassment, which is designed to assist them to obtain appropriate support and information. The Support Service can also provide resolution options when an investigation is not wanted by the impacted person or cannot proceed. In FY2023, improvements were made to the Support Service, including increased resourcing and support for participants of racism cases.\n\n## Reporting\n\nWe encourage our workforce to report concerns, including by providing centralised and confidential reporting tools and mandatory reporting requirements for line leaders. We do not tolerate any form of retaliation for raising a concern. We ceased using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) or imposing confidentiality obligations on complainants in respect of their experiences in settlement agreements relating to sexual harassment in March 2019. We do not enforce any NDAs or confidentiality obligations on complainants of sexual harassment in historical agreements.\n\nInvestigations of reports of sexual harassment are conducted by our specialised Response and Investigations team, which is independent from our other business units. This team includes experts trained in a personcentred, trauma-informed approach to help place the impacted person\n\nat the centre of decisions made during the investigation process and to minimise the risk of further harm to that individual.\n\nWe took steps to further improve our reporting and response processes in FY2023, including the implementation of a new response and investigation framework to help ensure BHP's response to all alleged misconduct is trauma-informed and proportionate to potential harm. Improvements have also been made to the reporting and sharing of misconduct outcomes.\n\n## Measuring\n\nDe-identified information and trend analysis data on the number of complaints, nature of complaints, resolution pathways, outcomes and timelines are accessible by leadership to raise awareness and support continuous improvement of how we prevent and mitigate the impacts of sexual harassment.\n\nWe measure our progress and are committed to continually improving our approach. In FY2023 we:\n\n- -  engaged Kristen Hilton (former Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commissioner) to enhance our sexual harassment prevention and response framework, review the program of work being undertaken by the sexual harassment PMO and identify areas for prioritisation\n- -  conducted an internal sexual harassment prevention program audit across our Minerals Australia and Minerals Americas operated asset workforce, following audits conducted in FY2021 and FY2022\n- -  conducted a number of assurance reviews to test and improve the operational effectiveness of the critical controls in place at BHP's assets and workplaces\n- -  contributed to knowledge sharing with other industry participants in relation to addressing sexual harassment and considered broader learnings from external reports, such as the Australian Human Rights Commission's Respect@Work: Sexual Harassment National Inquiry Report (2020), Time for respect: Fifth national survey of sexual harassment in Australian Workplaces (2022), and the WA Parliamentary Inquiry report 'Enough is enough' Sexual harassment against women in the FIFO mining industry\n- -  undertook a series of listening workshops with employees, with a particular focus on improving our critical controls\n- -  undertook consultation sessions to inform our global action plan for FY2024 and FY2025\n\nWe also remain committed to working with others in the industry and beyond to address sexual harassment risks. BHP is a member of the Minerals Council of Australia's Respect@Work Taskforce and the Chamber of Minerals and Energy Western Australia's Safe and Respectful Behaviours Working Group. Both groups aim to build industry capability and capacity though sharing knowledge and developing shared resources.\n\n## 6.8  Health\n\nWe set clear mandatory minimum performance standards to identify, assess and manage health risks and their potential impacts, and monitor the health of our workforce.\n\n## Occupational exposures\n\nExposure data in this Report in all cases is presented without considering protection from the use of personal protective equipment (where required as outlined in the Our Requirements for Health standard).\n\nBHP follows the hierarchy of controls to reduce exposures to as low as reasonably practicable. Our Risk Framework and minimum requirements emphasise preventive controls that reduce the likelihood of chemical and physical hazards in the atmospheres where workers undertake their routine work. When these preventive controls are inefficient or ineffective, we implement mitigating controls, such as respiratory protective equipment until appropriate preventive controls are identified, implemented and verified to consistently reduce exposure well below occupational exposure limits. Occupational exposure limits indicate the level of permissible exposure for a length of time (usually eight hours) to a chemical or physical hazard that is not likely to affect the health of a worker. Occupational exposure limits for our most material exposures are set according to the latest scientific evidence.\n\nIn FY2023, for our most material exposures of diesel particulate matter (DPM), respirable silica and coal mine dust we had a 33 per cent reduction in the",

This includes no workers potentially exposed to coal mine dust, 35 per cent reduction in the number of workers with potential exposure to DPM and 32 per cent reduction in the number of workers potentially exposed to respirable silica. When exposure reduction is considered over the last six years, we have achieved a 79 per cent reduction to our most material exposures.\n\nWe are committed to having no AL4 (fatalities and life-threatening illnesses) events and a reduction in life-altering injuries and illnesses. Due to the latency between initial exposure and diagnosis of disease for our most material airborne contaminant exposures, we must demonstrate ongoing exposure reduction and effectiveness of controls, where exposures may remain elevated. As we continue to manage exposures to as low as reasonably practicable, in FY2023, we had reduction plans developed at the asset level. The exposure reduction plans were prioritised based on risk with a focus on the assets' most material exposures. The implementation of these exposure reduction projects and sustaining the results achieved will continue to be a focus in FY2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Data excludes Discontinued operations as follows: BHP Mitsui Coal (sale completed on 3 May 2022) and BHP's oil and gas portfolio (merger with Woodside completed on 1 June 2022).\n- 2 Occupational exposures data excludes Projects.\n- 3 As of FY2021, the occupational exposure limit for Coal was reduced to 1.5 mg/m 3 compared to 2.0mg/m3 in previous years.\n\n## Occupational illness\n\nThe reported occurrence of occupational illness for employees in FY2023 was 304, which was 4.35 per million hours worked. This represented an increase in incidence compared with FY2022, which was 4.11 per million hours worked. For our contractor workforce, the reported occupational illness in FY2023 was 202, which was 1.99 per million hours worked, representing an increase in incidence compared with FY2022, which was 1.70 per million hours worked. Due to regulatory regimes and limited access to data, we do not have full oversight of the incidence of contractor noise-induced hearing loss cases.\n\nMusculoskeletal illness is the predominant occupational illness category representing 72 per cent of our workforce illnesses. These conditions affect the musculoskeletal system and connective tissues caused by repetitive workrelated stress, strain or exposure over time. Musculoskeletal illness does not include disorders caused by slips, trips, falls or similar incidents.\n\nNoise-induced hearing loss represents 7 per cent of illnesses. Workers exposed to noise above acceptable levels participate in hearing conservation programs, which include a periodic hearing test and hearing protection fit testing. We have established design recommendations that seek to eliminate or reduce high or prolonged noise exposures by focusing on the source of the noise. Other illness categories include skin diseases, temperature-related illnesses, mental illness, bites, stings and other unspecified illnesses.\n\nHeat stress contributed to 2 per cent of our reported occupational illnesses. High temperatures and strenuous activity place some of our workforce at an increased risk of heat illness. Currently, high-risk work groups are identified and a range of controls are in place to manage heat stress. In FY2024, further heat stress awareness training through field leadership, guidance material and awareness campaigns, along with targeted heat stress management, including hydration testing, will be introduced to support the management\n\nof tasks completed in high temperatures. In recognition that climate change may exacerbate existing heat stress risks, we are also piloting an approach at Olympic Dam site to better understand and quantify the potential impact of heat stress on our workforce under different future climate scenarios.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor a case study on how we are assessing the potential impact of extreme heat on critical infrastructure and equipment under different climate scenarios, refer to\n\nbhp.com/news/case-studies/2023/08/heat-stress\n\nAs part of our approach to managing occupational illnesses, we monitor and assess some of our workers' health through health surveillance that involves a systematic evidence-based collection of health data. These surveillance programs may reduce the severity or progression of disease.\n\n## Coal mine dust lung disease\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, nine cases of coal mine dust lung disease 1 were reported to the Queensland Department of Natural Resources Mines and Energy (DNRME). 2 Four of the accepted coal mine dust lung disease claims in FY2023 were current BHP employees, while the remaining five were former workers. For cases involving current employees, we offer counselling, medical support and redeployment options where relevant. Former employees are subject to workers' compensation insurance and associated care is managed through that process outside of BHP.\n\n## Mental health\n\nThe wellbeing and safety of our people is of paramount importance as we continue to work towards enhancing the safety, inclusiveness and future-readiness of our workforce. In FY2023, to make meaningful and positive improvement, we built stronger relationships through our active contributions to the Global Business Collaboration for Better Workplace Mental Health. Wellness Committees have been set up across our operated assets and corporate offices. There is strong ongoing participation in global health campaigns, such as Mental Health Month, RUOK day and Movember, which aim to increase awareness and overall mental wellbeing.\n\nBuilding on the momentum of FY2021 when we introduced our first global BHP Mental Health Month, our focus for the FY2023 campaign was to educate our teams on identifying workplace psychosocial hazards. These campaigns are designed to promote awareness of the importance of individual and team wellbeing and educate leaders on the role they play in supporting our people when they seek support and the various resources available to them at BHP.\n\nIn FY2023, the Psychosocial Risk Assessment Program was established in recognition of the importance of understanding any psychosocial hazards that may be impacting wellbeing at work. The program utilised industry best practice research with business consultation activities to identify the most significant psychosocial hazards within our business. This has laid the foundation for a number of best practice mitigating and preventative controls at both local and global levels that are designed to address the risk arising from these hazards.\n\n## 6.9  Ethics and business conduct\n\n## Our conduct\n\nOur Code of Conduct (Our Code) 3 brings our values to life so we can make the right choices every day. It applies to everyone who works for us, with us or on our behalf. To ensure all employees and contractors understand how Our Code applies, regular training is undertaken. There are consequences for breaching Our Code and we encourage people to speak up where a decision or action is not in line with Our Code or Our Charter.\n\nBHP encourages individuals to speak up and report concerns about any conduct that is inconsistent with Our Charter , Our Code or internal requirements, or conduct that may be illegal or improper. BHP requires reports of business conduct concerns to be treated with appropriate confidentiality and prohibits\n\n- 1 Coal mine dust lung disease is the name given to the lung diseases related to exposure to coal mine dust and includes coal workers' pneumoconiosis, silicosis, mixed dust pneumoconiosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n- 2 Cases reported to DNRME are not an indication of work relatedness.

These reports may also be made to regulators. We consider all forms of retaliation to be misconduct and grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. We have a number of key policy and process documents to support a safe to speak up culture, including our BHP whistleblower policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Code is available in five languages and accessible at\n\nbhp.com/our-approach/our-company/our-code-of-conduct/\n\nIn FY2023, 5,289 business conduct concerns were received (out of a total 6,447 reports into EthicsPoint. 1 These include reports directly made by employees, contractors or community members. It also includes reports made to leaders (28 per cent) who are then required to register them in EthicsPoint. There is a global service to support people involved in sexual harassment and racism incidents and to discuss resolution options, which also encourages employees and contractors to report instances of sexual harassment and racism. There continues to be a greater awareness and focus on health and wellbeing in the workplace which may be a contributing factor to the increase in FY2023 reports of bullying and harassment.\n\nOf the business conduct reports received, 36 per cent were made anonymously. 2 Of the total business conduct reports closed during FY2023, 38 per cent contained one or more established allegations. 3\n\n| Harassment and bullying (3,067)            | 58.0%   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Health, safety or environment breach (522) | 9.9%    |\n| Fraud (520)                                | 9.8%    |\n| Sexual Harassment (475)                    | 9.0%    |\n| Discrimination (377)                       | 7.1%    |\n| Cybersecurity or data privacy breach (216) | 4.1%    |\n| Retaliation for speaking up (68)           | 1.3%    |\n| Other* (44)                                | 0.8%    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Other: Inclusions are Deficiencies in a business conduct investigation; Anti-competitive behaviour; Attempting to identify an anonymous reporter; Ask a question; Improper political or governmental conduct.\n\nEmployees and contractors can raise their concerns through a number of channels, including through leaders. Anyone, including external partners and stakeholders and the public, can lodge a concern in the form of a report, either online in EthicsPoint or via the 24-hour, multilingual call service. Reporters of misconduct concerns can choose to raise their concern anonymously.\n\n- 1 Some EthicsPoint reports are enquiries, or are not related to business conduct concerns, or are a duplicate of an existing report. Case classification is made at the time of the report, however the classification can be changed as more information is uncovered during the investigation process. The data captures a point in time and is subject to change as some cases will be re-classified.\n- 2 This excludes reports not containing a business conduct concern and excludes reports logged by leaders on behalf of others.\n- 3 The calculation is based on reports completed in FY2023, containing one or more established allegations. Not all reports resulted in a finding. This can occur if there is insufficient information, the respondent is not able to be identified, was previously terminated, or the impacted person did not wish to proceed. This figure includes cases opened in FY2023 and prior to FY2023.\n\nReports received are assessed by the Ethics and Investigations team and an appropriate response is applied, which may include an investigation or other resolution. In assessing the appropriate response, BHP applies a proportionate and person-centred approach to the report considering all participants. People impacted by reports of sexual harassment and racism are offered specialised support by the Ethics Support Service, which enables people impacted to have input into the response. In determining the appropriate response, the type and severity of the alleged misconduct is considered and may include an investigation, training, facilitated conversations, a line leader intervention or verbal/written warnings. Quarterly reporting on the most serious reports is provided to senior leaders and the BHP Board Risk and Audit Committee, and includes reported case metrics, outcomes and insights. The reporting supports leadership awareness and informs priorities for ongoing improvement. Feedback is obtained regularly from stakeholders, including case participants, external experts and management, to continually improve our response to reports.\n\n## Transparency and accountability\n\nWe support initiatives by governments of the countries where we operate to publicly disclose the content of our licences or contracts for the development and production of minerals that form the basis of our payments to government, as outlined in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Standard.\n\nOther initiatives include our work with Transparency International chapters, representation on the Board of the EITI, financial support for and Steering Committee membership of the Bribery Prevention Network (in Australia) and funding of the BHP Foundation, including its Natural Resource Governance Global Program.\n\nIn FY2023, we continued our active and public support for ultimate beneficial ownership transparency. We published information on how we use beneficial ownership information as part of our anti-corruption due diligence on investments, partners, contractors and suppliers. We also made clear via published statements and web content that we do not partner or contract with entities that are assessed as presenting a high corruption risk that decline to provide beneficial ownership information as part of our due diligence process. In parallel with these steps, we published a list of entities in which BHP Group Limited's effective interest is 100 per cent and certain entities in which BHP Group Limited's effective interest is less than 100 per cent, including all controlled subsidiaries operating in the mining sectors, all mining operations joint ventures generating material revenue for BHP (and available information in relation to the other legal owners in these joint ventures) and entities in which we hold a partial interest (with some exclusions - refer to bhp.com/ethics).\n\nThese efforts are complementary to the BHP Foundation's partnership with EITI and Open Ownership to support governments to transform the availability and use of beneficial ownership data for effective governance in the extractive sector.\n\nMulti-lateral measures to improve governance such as these are intended to help ensure transparency and accountability as cornerstones of a successful energy transition that benefits the citizens of countries bestowed with critical minerals.\n\n## Anti-corruption\n\nWe continue our commitment to contribute to the global fight against corruption in the resources industry. Our commitment to anti-corruption is embodied in Our Charter and Our Code .\n\nAs part of this commitment, we prohibit authorising, offering, giving or promising anything of value directly or indirectly to anyone to influence them in their role, or to encourage them to perform their work disloyally or otherwise improperly. We also prohibit facilitation payments, which are payments to government officials for routine government actions. Our people must take care that third parties acting on our behalf do not violate anti-corruption laws. Disciplinary action, including dismissal or termination of contractual relationships, may follow from a breach of these requirements.\n\nTo manage corruption risk, we work to ensure optimal resource allocation to areas of our business with the highest exposure to corruption risks. The identification, assessment and management of corruption risks associated with growth opportunities remains a significant area of focus for our Compliance function, via a sub-team dedicated to supporting functions",

In FY2023, Compliance conducted monitoring focused on verifying the operation of anti-corruption controls in relation to higher risk relationships and activities, including the provision of community donations and sponsorships, identification and management of potential conflict of interest circumstances in local procurement, and governance in relation to sole source procurement decisions.\n\nOur Compliance function regularly reviews our anti-corruption framework for compliance with the requirements of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, the Australian Criminal Code and the applicable laws and regulatory developments of all places where we do business. These laws are consistent with the standards of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.\n\nOur Compliance function is independent of our assets and regions and reports to the Chief Legal, Governance and External Affairs Officer. The Chief Compliance Officer also reports quarterly to the Risk and Audit Committee on compliance issues and meets at least annually with the Risk and Audit Committee Chair.\n\nThe Compliance function also participates in anti-corruption risk assessments in respect of our operated assets or functions, our interests in non-operated assets and new business opportunities that we consider are exposed to material anti-corruption risks. In FY2023, the function provided input into 29 anti-corruption risk assessments.\n\nRisk awareness in first-line employees remains a critical preventative measure. Anti-corruption training is required to be provided to all employees and contractors as part of mandatory annual training on Our Code undertaken in the financial year. Our Compliance function also regularly communicates and engages with identified higher-risk roles. In FY2023, additional risk-based anti-corruption training was undertaken by 6,833 employees and contractors, as well as employees of some of our business partners and community partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on ethics and business conduct refer to bhp.com/ethics\n\n## 6.10  Digital security and data privacy\n\n## Digital security\n\nOur business and operational processes across our value chain are increasingly dependent on the effective application and adoption of technology, which we use as a lever to deliver on our current and future operational, financial and social objectives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our approach to digital security refer to OFR 8.1\n\n## Data privacy\n\nWe are committed to responsibly handling and protecting our people's personal data.\n\nOur commitment to protecting personal information and privacy is embodied in Our Code and BHP's Data Privacy Principles.\n\nBHP primarily collects and uses personal data from our candidates, employees and contractors for the purposes of managing our business operations and to ensure the health, safety and protection of our workforce. We believe transparency and respect for any personal data collected by BHP and our third parties are foundational to BHP's Data Privacy Framework.\n\nOur Data Privacy Office is independent and oversees the implementation and monitoring of BHP's Data Privacy framework by the functions and assets that collect and use personal data. We monitor for changes to BHP's operating environment and consider the impacts to the operation of BHP's Data Privacy Framework. With rapid changes to regulation and community expectations, we engage regularly with various external experts on changes to data privacy regulations and regulatory enforcement activities.\n\nData is a key enabler to maintaining a safe, inclusive, and future-ready workforce, which includes recent key initiatives, such as BHP's pandemic response, fatality elimination, Indigenous engagement, and to meet our inclusion and diversity objectives.\n\nPersonal data collection by BHP is expected to adhere to BHP's Privacy by Design Framework. High data privacy risk activities that require the collection and use of personal data are required to undergo a data privacy impact assessment. This assessment considers the appropriateness of the activity and defines the safeguards for the protection and responsible use of personal data.\n\nSenior leaders who are accountable for data privacy risks monitor key metrics on a regular basis, meeting at least annually to review changes to our global data privacy risk profile and share knowledge to improve consistency in how an individual's data is handled.\n\nData privacy breach simulations are conducted periodically to assess our readiness to respond to data privacy incidents. BHP takes a peoplecentric approach, prioritising activities that support and seek to rectify any potential harm or loss of rights caused to an individual.\n\nData privacy training is required for all employees and contractors who handle personal data as part of their responsibilities. This includes a new joiners eLearn and periodic refresher courses. The FY2023 data privacy refresher eLearn was assigned to 12,083 employees and contractors.\n\n## 6.11  Value chain sustainability\n\n## Responsible supply chains\n\nResponsible supply chains is one of our six social value pillars, with our 2030 goal being to create sustainable, ethical and transparent supply chains together with our partners.\n\nThe following programs of work support our progress towards this goal and indirectly support other pillars in our social value scorecard. These programs are intended to help ensure that minerals are responsibly sourced, produced and traced.\n\n## Responsible production and sourcing standards\n\nBHP is committed to the adoption of a set of standards for the responsible production and sourcing of minerals and metals. The adoption of these standards is primarily aimed at ensuring we continuously improve against industry best practices. By being independently assessed against these standards, we can more transparently demonstrate to our stakeholders our intent to be a responsible actor within the mining and metals industry and for the global value chains we serve. This also allows us to align with ESG-related requirements set out by national mining associations, industry associations, commodity exchanges and emerging regulations.\n\nDuring FY2023, we commenced implementation of the sustainability standards strategy we outlined in our Annual Report 2022. Our strategy defines our pathway for the implementation of responsible production and sourcing standards and is focused on the foundations needed to enable a more efficient adoption of standards to better position BHP's participation in the sustainability standards landscape.\n\nIn FY2023, we socialised our approach to standards and external engagement with the Forum on Corporate Responsibility. We also worked on standards development in collaboration with industry associations, standards bodies, commodity exchanges and industry schemes, such as the International Council for Mining and Metals (ICMM), Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM), The Copper Mark, ResponsibleSteel, the London Metal Exchange (LME) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This included emphasising the importance of harmonising standards to improve the focus on effective implementation and comparability between companies' disclosures about their performance. We expect to continue our work with the standards ecosystem in FY2024, to further improve harmonisation of the standards landscape.",

The ICMM Mining Principles require member companies to conduct a prioritisation process to determine which assets will be subject to third-party validation across a three-year cycle. All of BHP's long-term operated assets (excluding NSW Energy Coal and acquired OZ Minerals assets) have completed self-assessments against the ICMM Mining Principles and the associated Performance Expectations and the external validation sequence has been determined in consideration of commitments made by BHP to other standards, to enable operational efficiencies.\n\n## Metals and minerals due diligence\n\nOur Responsible Minerals Program is our minerals and metals supply chain due diligence management system, which is aligned with the OECD's Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECD Guidance). The program requires fit-for-purpose due diligence with respect to the upstream minerals and metals supply chains for our operated assets and third-party trading activities.\n\nThe program prioritises due diligence over suppliers of minerals and metals where our operated assets or the inbound supply chain for the products those assets produce have any extraction, transportation or trade association with a conflict-affected and/or high-risk area. The program applies exclusively to suppliers selling minerals and/or metals directly into our operated assets that will physically form a part of our products or selling minerals and/or metals to BHP that BHP intends to market to a third party.\n\nWe commenced implementation of the Responsible Minerals Program in FY2023, including the publication of our Responsible Minerals Policy. In FY2024, we plan to undergo an assessment against the Joint Due Diligence Standard for Copper, Lead, Molybdenum, Nickel and Zinc for applicable sites, and we intend to publish our Step 5 1 report on our website in accordance with the OECD Guidance. The Joint Due Diligence Standard was established by The Copper Mark in collaboration with relevant metals associations to promote responsible minerals and metals supply chains for these commodities, aligned with the OECD Guidance.\n\n## Traceability\n\nWe see our core products as being important to the world's energy transition. We strive to provide quality products in a responsible and more sustainable way. Against a backdrop of emerging regulations and standards globally, we see product traceability as a key enabler to help future-proof our supply chains.\n\nIn FY2023, we engaged with our customers, downstream partners, industry experts and technology partners to define a multi-year product traceability strategy. The strategy builds on BHP's responsible supply chain objectives and is focused on partnering with multi-stakeholder alliances to shape the transparency and traceability ecosystem and building the foundations needed to enable efficient adoption of emerging standards and regulations.\n\nWhile the strategy has been developed based on existing and likely future regulatory and customer requirements, we will continue to actively monitor and respond to new developments within the traceability landscape.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6.12  Climate change\n\n## Our position\n\nOur position on climate change continues to be shaped, broadened and strengthened by our strategic interests and the dynamic global response.\n\nWe believe:\n\n- -  warming of the climate is unequivocal, the human influence is clear and physical climate-related impacts are unavoidable\n- -  the world must continue to increase both the levels of ambition and pace of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions to meet the aims of the Paris Agreement\n- -  demand for renewable and low to zero GHG emission energy and lower GHG emission technologies is likely to grow at unprecedented rates as the world seeks to meet the aims of the Paris Agreement while supporting responsible global economic development, including progress on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\n- -  commodities and materials we produce underpin this transition and are critical to achieving global climate ambitions\n- -  a circular economy plays an important role in reducing GHG emissions associated with the extraction and use of mining products\n- -  an acceleration of global effort to drive energy efficiency is a critical element in avoiding, reducing and removing GHG emissions\n- -  policies to encourage rapid action should be implemented in an equitable manner to address competitiveness concerns, achieve lowest cost abatement and support equitable change and transition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the full statement of our position and more information on our actions on climate change refer to Our position at bhp.com/climate",

The CTAP was published before Australia (where our global headquarters are located) published its Long-Term Emissions Reduction Plan and passed legislation to enshrine its national targets for 2030 and net zero by 2050. We continue to monitor and take into consideration the evolving policy and regulatory landscape in our relevant jurisdictions as part of the periodic review by Management and the Board of the setting of and progress towards our operational and value chain GHG emission reduction targets and goals.\n\nBHP's CTAP was approved with 84.9 per cent of votes in favour in the 'Say on Climate' advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meetings. As part of that process, we proposed holding an advisory vote in relation to BHP's CTAP every three years and will hold the next advisory vote in 2024.\n\n## Operational GHG emission reductions\n\n## Overview\n\nIn FY2023, we reduced operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 from our operated assets) by 11 per cent from FY2022 and our operational GHG emissions have fallen 32 per cent since FY2020, the baseline year for our target and goal (adjusted for methodology changes and divestments; for more information refer to Metrics, targets and goals later in this OFR 6.12). This represents positive, early action towards reducing GHG emissions to a level aligned to our medium-term target. However, the challenge to decarbonise in coming years is anticipated to grow due to expanding\n\nbusiness activity and the current lack of available technology solutions, particularly for diesel displacement. Progress towards our medium-term target is expected to be non-linear, but we remain on track to meet it by FY2030. We did not account for the retirement of any carbon credits in FY2023 to achieve this reduction or to support meeting our operational GHG emission reduction medium-term target and long-term goal.\n\nDespite our reduction of operational GHG emissions, total operational energy consumption increased by 4 per cent from FY2022 (adjusted for methodology changes and divestments; for more information refer to Metrics, targets and goals later in this OFR 6.12). This was largely driven by increased fuel and electricity consumption at Olympic Dam compared to FY2022 when the asset was undergoing scheduled maintenance, as well as increased electricity usage at Escondida and Spence and increased fuel usage at BMA.\n\nThe GHG emission intensity of our operated assets in CY2022 is estimated to rank in the first quartile (iron ore and nickel) or first half (copper and metallurgical coal) of global mining operations analysed, 1 based on CY2022 data from Skarn Associates and reported BHP data for CY2022 (as Skarn Associates' data is prepared on a calendar year basis). For more information on how we calculate and compare GHG emissions intensity, refer to the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2023, available at bhp.com/climate.\n\nOur operational GHG emission reduction strategy continues to prioritise structural abatement in areas that are technically and commercially feasible, while working in collaboration with our suppliers, partners and peers on accelerating the development of other potential decarbonisation technologies.\n\nIn June 2023, we updated investors on our progress and plans to achieve our operational GHG emission reduction medium-term target and long-term goal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information on our progress and plans for operational decarbonisation refer to\n\nbhp.com/news/media-centre/reports-presentations/2023/06/ operational-decarbonisation-investor-presentation\n\n## Medium-term target (FY2030) and long-term goal (CY2050)\n\n- -  Reduce operational GHG emissions by at least 30 per cent from FY2020 levels by FY2030.\n- -  Achieve net zero operational GHG emissions by 2050.\n\n## Progress against adjusted baseline\n\n- -  FY2023: 9.8 MtCO2-e\n- -  FY2022: 11.0 MtCO2-e\n- -  FY2021: 14.6 MtCO2-e\n- -  FY2020 baseline: 14.5 MtCO2-e\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBaseline and subsequent years have been adjusted for methodology changes and divestments. For more information on the essential definitions, assumptions and adjustments for this target and goal refer to Metrics, targets and goals, later in this OFR 6.12\n\n## Delivered in FY2023\n\n- -  reduced operational GHG emissions by 11 per cent from FY2022 (adjusted for methodology changes and divestments; for more information refer to Metrics, targets and goals, later in this OFR 6.12). This was achieved primarily through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for renewable and lower GHG emission electricity (such as hydro and gas generation) for our operated assets\n- -  signed two new renewable PPAs. The first, with Neoen, is to provide renewable electricity to Olympic Dam commencing in FY2026 and the second, with Alinta Energy, is to provide renewable electricity to WAIO's Port Hedland port facilities commencing in FY2025\n- -  began a 12-month trial at Olympic Dam of a fully electric Jumbo (used in underground mining development to drill holes) that does not emit any GHG emissions in operation. This trial builds on other electric vehicle initiatives at Nickel West and BMA's Broadmeadow mine, building towards the maturation, scale and deployment of technological alternatives to diesel-based vehicles and material movement\n- -  signed new and progressed work under existing partnership agreements with strategic original equipment manufacturers, such as Caterpillar, Komatsu, ProgressRail and Wabtec, to accelerate diesel displacement technologies for material movement\n- -  deepened our understanding of the measurement and quantification of fugitive methane emissions from BMA using emerging technologies, such as methane emissions-sensing satellites, drones and on-site measurements. We also began a vent air methane destruction project (where methane is vented from a mine in a way that it can be captured and combusted) at BMA's Broadmeadow mine\n- -  met our social value scorecard short-term milestone through completion or progression of study phase projects in BHP's operational decarbonisation plan\n- 1 Global mining operations analysed cover seaborne iron ore operations, export metallurgical coal mines, copper mines and nickel mines and processing plants.",

        "page_content": "## Shifting to renewable and other low to zero GHG emission electricity\n\nMost of our operated assets are grid-connected in geographic areas that have access to renewable electricity through a network. This has enabled us to sign a number of renewable electricity PPAs for a proportion of our demand (on current projections) rapidly and at-scale. We aim to prioritise and incentivise new generation where commercially feasible, with eight out of nine of our current PPAs wholly or partially enabling new generation. All PPAs to date have been commercially attractive and operationally low risk, which has enabled reductions to our operational GHG emissions at low or no additional cost. Renewable electricity PPAs for our operated assets have been the primary reason for a reduction of our Scope 2 emissions by 70 per cent since FY2020 (adjusted for methodology changes and divestments; for more information refer to Metrics, targets and goals, later in this OFR 6.12)\n\nSwitching from diesel to electricity to power our material movement is likely to significantly increase the amount of electricity required at our sites. We are studying the spare network capacity and the ability to meet this load growth with existing networks. We continue to monitor commitments by our peers that are expected to increase future electricity demand and to work with our network service providers to understand and plan for future capacity. Some on-site renewable or other low to zero GHG emission electricity may be required due to future lack of available capacity, as well as to achieve potential savings on network costs.\n\n## Displacement of diesel\n\nPrimarily used for material movement, diesel represents our largest source of operational GHG emissions and displacement is a core technical challenge. Our studies indicate that electrification through battery electric vehicles is the most technically feasible and commercially attractive solution for material movement for most of our operated assets.\n\nWe are working with original equipment manufacturer partners and industry peers to accelerate the availability of battery electric vehicle technology for mining vehicles and equipment. We have seen progress with our original equipment manufacturer partners and peer collaboration to date. We expect original equipment manufacturers to be ready to produce battery electric vehicles at scale in the latter half of this decade.\n\nGiven this trajectory, there may be instances where vehicle fleets will need to be replaced by diesel haul trucks to ensure continued safe and efficient production. For example, a significant proportion of our WAIO mining fleet is due for replacement prior to the anticipated availability of battery electric vehicle solutions, which would require us to purchase a significant quantity of diesel haul trucks. This is factored into our decarbonisation planning.\n\nIn relation to hard-to-electrify uses of diesel, such as for bulldozers, most are anticipated to be addressed in the 2030s under the assumption of improved technical capabilities associated with electric options, more commercially attractive sources of sustainable biofuels or other technically feasible pathways.\n\n## Managing fugitive methane\n\nFugitive methane emissions from coal mining operations, although relatively small in relation to other GHG emission sources at BHP's operated assets, are considered hard-to-abate as there are very few available solutions that are at a satisfactory technological and commercial readiness level for use in the mines we operate. Those fugitive methane abatement technologies that are proven do not address 100 per cent of the methane emissions, so it is likely that a sizeable residual volume will remain untreated without significant technological progress and further investment.\n\nIn the short term, we have begun a vent air methane destruction project at BMA's Broadmeadow, our only underground metallurgical coal mine. This project offers co-benefits by reducing fugitive methane emissions and reducing safety risks for workers when underground.\n\nWe are working with satellite imaging and data companies to help increase our understanding of fugitive methane emission levels over time as well as any potential changes associated with mining levels (given the general tendency for methane density to increase as coal mines deepen).\n\nOur other mines at BMA, which are open-cut operations, have geological and technology readiness challenges for reduction of fugitive methane emissions. Draining is currently the dominant technology used in methane abatement at open-cut coal mining operations, but the majority of draining occurs prior to mining activities. Therefore, the ability to retrofit a draining\n\nsolution for an existing coal mine remains unclear. We continue to monitor for new and evolving abatement technologies, with funding allocated to further explore suitable opportunities as they arise.\n\nWe plan to begin drilling at multiple BMA sites in FY2024 to obtain a deeper understanding of methane quality and quantity (in both magnitude and density) and to help inform future versions of our methane management plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our measurement methods for coal mine fugitive methane emissions refer to BHP Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology 2023, available at\n\nbhp.com/climate\n\n## Capital allocation towards pathways and solutions\n\nDecarbonisation is embedded in our annual investment and prioritisation processes. All investment decisions consider the quantity of GHG emissions associated with the project, the cost per tonne of CO2-e associated with the project and the alignment with the Group pathways to a net zero trajectory.\n\nIn FY2023, we spent US$122 million on initiatives associated with operational GHG emission reductions, together with value chain GHG emission reductions in areas such as steelmaking and shipping, and BHP Ventures investments. This figure does not include the operating expenditure associated with renewable electricity arrangements established at a number of our operated assets, which collectively represented the main source of operational GHG emission abatement for BHP in FY2023.\n\nFrom FY2024 to FY2030, we expect to spend around US$4 billion (nominal value) on operational decarbonisation, with plans reflecting an annual capital allocation of between approximately US$250 million and approximately US$950 million per year over the next five years.\n\nOn current assumptions, the overall portfolio of decarbonisation projects to support achievement of our medium-term target is expected to deliver a positive net present value (NPV) for the Group, while to date, most implemented projects have delivered a positive or neutral NPV.\n\nBHP Ventures also continues to build a portfolio of investments to help accelerate innovation in the mining industry through assessment and execution of additional investments across emerging technology areas, including long-duration energy storage solutions, diesel displacement and carbon dioxide removal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information on our range of investments to drive decarbonisation and sustainable growth refer to\n\nbhp.com/about/our-businesses/ventures\n\n## Projected and potential operational abatement pathways and capacity\n\nOur operational GHG emission abatement pathway to FY2030 sets out our material decarbonisation projects and initiatives that are intended to achieve our medium-term target (as shown in the chart 'Projected operational GHG emission abatement pathway to FY2030' on the next page). Importantly, we are not planning to use carbon credits to offset GHG emissions to meet our medium-term target.\n\nMany of the decarbonisation projects planned to commence in the 2020s are likely to extend beyond our medium-term target period and to make a substantial contribution towards our long-term goal. We seek to prioritise projects that are both technically and commercially de-risked, with preference given to projects that can be delivered with a positive NPV. Potential projects are evaluated and ranked based on key variables that help to evaluate their risk (threat and opportunity), including technology readiness, operational integration, the maturity and certainty of abatement and the financial metrics associated with the project.\n\nAs we look beyond our medium-term target towards our long-term goal of net zero operational GHG emissions, we will continue to embed decarbonisation objectives into mine designs and processing options while continuing initiatives to reduce existing GHG emission sources through our plans for widespread diesel displacement. We intend to do this largely via electrification and reducing gas consumption at our smelters and refineries using options such as direct electrification and green hydrogen, subject to evaluation of their risk. Fugitive methane is likely to remain a hard-to-abate GHG emission source. However, we estimate up to 50 per cent of BMA's total forecast fugitive methane emissions could be extracted and actively managed with the use of currently available technologies.",

Our current cumulative planned performance has us on track to remain within the cumulative budget until around FY2040, in part as a result of early action taken to date. The potential emergence of accelerated decarbonisation options in the 2030s and 2040s may further accelerate our GHG emission reductions.\n\nThe role of offsetting in our operational decarbonisation pathway Because of our prioritisation of structural abatement, our decarbonisation pathway to FY2030 does not assume the use of carbon credits to meet our medium-term target. However, if our planned abatement projects fail to deliver the expected GHG emission reduction, we retain the flexibility to use high-\n\narbon credits (those that meet our integrity standards) to manage our pathway to FY2030.\n\nLooking beyond FY2030, we may purchase and retire high-integrity carbon credits to offset operational GHG emissions that we have determined cannot be entirely avoided due to technological, physical or financial constraints. These carbon credits may be used to offset operational GHG emissions and support achievement of our long-term goal. For example, carbon credits may be used to offset fugitive methane emissions considered hard-to-abate.\n\nOur individual operated assets may also be subject to regulated GHG emission thresholds and regional carbon pricing (including GHG emission trading schemes). In cases where our direct GHG emission reductions are not able to meet the requirements specified for these schemes, we may purchase and retire eligible carbon credits to meet our compliance obligations. We do not intend to account for these carbon credits in order to reach our medium-term target.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on how we expect to use carbon credits, our integrity standards for carbon credits and the anticipated impact of Australia's Safeguard Mechanism refer to Carbon credits and offsetting at bhp.com/climate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiesel\n\nNatural gas\n\n- 1 Future operational GHG emission estimates are based on latest annual business plans.

'Decarbonisation pathway' represents planned decarbonisation activities to reach BHP's operational GHG emission reduction target and goal. 'Uncertainty range' refers to higher-risk options currently identified that may enable faster or more substantive decarbonisation, but which currently have a relatively low Technology Readiness Level, higher operational integration risk and/or are not yet commercially available and includes projects that may require changes to recognition of carbon sequestration such as mineral carbonation.

'Negative GHG emission solutions' include carbon credits (avoidance, reductions or removals) or other technologies that result in emission reductions. This shows the requirement in order to reach net zero if decarbonisation at the lower line of the 'Uncertainty range' were achieved (but does not reflect probability). 'Fugitive methane and other sources' includes (as part of 'other sources') other feedstocks and heat sources, such as coal, coke, fuel oil and LPG, and use of self-generated carbon credits. GHG emission calculation methodology changes may affect the information presented in these charts. 'Fugitive methane and other sources' is estimated in accordance with the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting measurement methodology and does not reflect the tendency for methane density to increase as coal mines deepen, due to current uncertainty with respect to future opportunities to manage methane at our BMA mines.

Achievement of this goal is uncertain, particularly given the challenges of a net zero pathway for our customers in steelmaking, and we cannot ensure the outcome alone.\n\n## Progress against restated baseline\n\n- -  FY2023: 370.5 MtCO2-e\n- -  FY2022: 401.3 MtCO2-e\n- -  FY2021: 400.6 MtCO2-e\n- -  FY2020 baseline: 413.0 MtCO2-e\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBaseline and subsequent years have been restated for methodology changes. For more information on the essential definitions, assumptions and adjustments for this goal refer to Metrics, targets and goals, later in this OFR 6.12\n\nWe seek to address Scope 3 emissions by focusing on how we invest, partner and influence to support GHG emission reductions in our value chain.\n\nOur reported Scope 3 emission inventory for FY2023 remains dominated by the downstream GHG emissions from the use of iron ore and metallurgical coal to produce steel (84 per cent) and the combustion of energy coal (10 per cent). In hard-to-abate sectors, such as steelmaking and shipping, our investments and collaborations may not begin to make a material impact on value chain GHG emissions associated with our business for a decade or more. However, our planned closure of NSWEC by the end of FY2030 is anticipated to result in a material reduction in our reported Scope 3 Category 11, Use of sold product emissions. This closure is intended to almost entirely reduce downstream GHG emissions from energy coal combustion in our inventory, although a small residual amount of these GHG emissions may remain in our reported Scope 3 emission inventory from our BMA operations, as BHP has historically marketed a small portion of BMA products against energy coal indexes.\n\nFor additional transparency to assist tracking of our progress, we are disclosing a baseline year of FY2020 for our value chain GHG emission long-term goal, consistent with our operational GHG emission longterm goal of net zero, together with a baseline year of FY2020 for our medium-term goal for steelmaking and CY2008 for our medium-term goal for shipping (the latter for alignment with the International Maritime Organisation). We are reviewing our approach to baseline adjustments for material acquisitions and divestments for our Scope 3 targets and goals, and may calculate and include adjusted baselines in future reports. As measurement of our inventory improves, this may also lead to changes to the baseline figures for Scope 3 emissions. We did not account for the retirement of any carbon credits in FY2023 for the purposes of calculating our progress towards achieving our value chain GHG emission targets and goals.\n\nImproving GHG emission measurement is essential to quantifying the GHG emission reductions in our value chain, as our current Scope 3 emission estimations may not reflect or track the impact of some of the actions we are taking now to progress towards our long-term goal. We do not anticipate significant reductions in our reported Scope 3 emission inventory in the medium term, in part due to the way we currently estimate Scope 3 emissions, which is generally not supplier- or customer-specific and therefore would not reflect the GHG emission reductions they achieve.\n\nWe are seeking ways to improve the availability of data. For example, in shipping we have had early successes in developing a carbon accounting and decision support system tailored to ship chartering (DNV's Veracity data platform). In other areas, we aim to progressively improve Scope 3 measurement capability and we intend to partner with our GHG emission intensive customers and suppliers to address these challenges. We are preparing cradle-to-gate life cycle assessments of some of our products, starting with nickel and metallurgical coal with an aim to complete these in FY2024 in order to meet customer requests and growing market expectations.\n\n## Steelmaking\n\n## Overview\n\nBHP is supporting the industry and our customers to develop solutions to reduce GHG emission intensity from steelmaking through a mix of research, customer partnerships and industry advocacy.\n\n## Medium-term goal (CY2030)\n\n- -  Support industry to develop technologies and pathways capable of 30 per cent emissions intensity reduction in integrated steelmaking, with widespread adoption expected post-2030.\n\n## Progress against goal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -  Metric: Financial value committed in steelmaking partnerships and ventures to date\n- -  FY2023: US$114 million to date (excluding in-kind contributions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the essential definitions, assumptions and adjustments for this goal refer to Metrics, targets and goals, later in this OFR 6.12\n\n## Delivered in FY2023\n\n- -  we now have collaborative partnerships with ArcelorMittal, China Baowu, JFE Steel, HBIS Group, POSCO, Tata Steel and Zenith Steel who collectively represent approximately 19 per cent of reported global steel production (World Steel in Figures 2023, World Steel Association). These partners account for direct sales in FY2023 of approximately 33 per cent of our iron ore and metallurgical coal\n- -  continued lab and pilot scale trials of electrolytic iron production from our iron ores through our BHP Ventures investment companies Boston Metal and Electra\n- -  engaged with steelmaking customers who account for approximately 83 per cent of our FY2023 direct sales to exchange views on potential decarbonisation pathways and discuss ways to align GHG emission calculation methodologies\n\n## Pathways and strategy\n\nOur collaboration partnerships in the steel sector (described in the following table) reflect the multiple paths being explored to reach, and our initial steps towards, a potential 'green end state', which is the label we give to the stage in our steel decarbonisation framework where widespread 'near zero emission steel' production could be achievable (as per the ResponsibleSteel International Standard 2.0 Performance Level 4 threshold).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information on the potential primary steelmaking technology pathways for our Pilbara ores refer to\n\nbhp.com/news/prospects/2023/06/pathways-to-decarbonisationepisode-seven-the-electric-smelting-furnace\n\n| Partners                                                    | Projects                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace potential pathway    | Blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace potential pathway                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| China Baowu                                                 | -

We seek to influence the supply chain and broader market by creating demand for lower and zero GHG emission fuels and energy efficient technologies in shipping.\n\n## Medium-term goal (CY2030)\n\n- -  Support 40 per cent emission intensity reduction of BHP-chartered shipping of BHP products.\n\n## Progress against baseline\n\n-  FY2023: 3.2 gCO2-e per deadweight tonne (dwt) per nautical mile (nm)\n\n- -  CY2008 baseline: 5.4 gCO2-e/dwt/nm 2\n\n## Long-term target (CY2050)\n\n- -  Net zero by 2050 for the GHG emissions from all shipping of BHP products.\n\n## Progress against baseline\n\n- -  FY2023: 6.1 MtCO2-e\n- -  FY2022: 7.4 MtCO2-e\n- -  FY2021: 7.5 MtCO2-e\n- -  FY2020 baseline: 7.1 MtCO2-e\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the essential definitions, assumptions and adjustments for this goal refer to Metrics, targets and goals, later in this OFR 6.12\n\n## Delivered in FY2023\n\n- -  GHG emission intensity of BHP-chartered shipping is 41 per cent below CY2008, the baseline year for our medium-term goal, representing positive, early action towards reducing GHG emission intensity to a level aligned to our medium-term goal. The challenge to maintain and reduce GHG emission intensity even further in coming years will grow due to expanding business activity and the availability of lower and zero GHG emission intensity solutions, however, we remain on track to meet this goal\n- -  chartered four additional dual-fuelled liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels capable of reducing GHG emissions by up to 30 per cent per voyage when run on LNG compared to conventional fuel and taking into account efficiency of the vessel design. BHP now has five dual-fuelled LNG vessels in our time-chartered fleet. We view LNG as a transitional fuel and are exploring other interim GHG emission abatement options for shipping, such as biofuels, pending suitable availability of low to zero GHG emission fuels\n- -  collaborated with a consortium of miners, shippers and the Global Maritime Forum to analyse the feasibility of usage of lower and zero GHG emission ammonia. The subsequent report 'Fuelling the decarbonisation of iron ore shipping between Western Australia and East Asia with clean ammonia' and its findings are available at globalmaritimeforum.org\n- -  issued an Expression of Interest to establish an ammonia value chain for design and build of ammonia-fuelled vessels and supply of ammonia as a fuel. This proposed project aims to support establishment of infrastructure related to the supply of ammonia and build regulatory alignment in jurisdictions across the shipping supply chain for safe handling, bunkering and storage\n- -  executed a fixed-term (one year) agreement to introduce biofuels into the fuel mix for shipping of BHP's products for certain voyages, resulting in up to 19 per cent GHG emission reduction per voyage leg compared to conventional fuel (with the level of reduction depending on the bunkering specification). The biofuels used are certified under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification system\n- -  pioneered real-time measurement, exchange and analysis of quality-assured voyage data with ship owners through DNV's Veracity data platform to enable BHP to optimise and introduce chartering choices as a strategic lever by selecting vessels with a comparatively lower GHG emission profile\n\n1\n\n## Pathways and strategy\n\nVessel propulsion is still primarily powered by the combustion of fuel oil. The long distances travelled, need for suitable port infrastructure, long life of vessels, safety concerns and nascent alternative fuel options contribute to making this a hard-to-abate sector. As a large shipping customer, we play a number of important roles, including to:\n\n- -  help create demand for lower and zero GHG emission fuels, such as ammonia, which assists to accelerate the adoption of technologies once proven and provide suppliers confidence to make investment decisions\n- -  partner to bring new vessel propulsion technologies (e.g. wind assisted propulsion) to maturity to reduce or eliminate the use of bunker fuel\n- -  advocate for industry regulations to increase the speed and scale of shipping decarbonisation\n- -  use real-time data analytics to optimise vessel and route selection to improve efficiency\n\n## Suppliers\n\n## Overview\n\nIn FY2023, we spent approximately US$20.6 billion on goods and services from approximately 8,000 suppliers. Our top 500 suppliers by spend make up approximately 70 per cent of this spend and we are prioritising our engagement with this cohort as part of the first steps towards our long-term target.\n\nWe are not currently able to measure the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions of our direct suppliers (the specific boundary of this target), and therefore Scope 3 Category 1 Purchased goods and services GHG emissions are currently used as a proxy for both the FY2020 baseline and subsequent years of our longterm target for suppliers.\n\n## Long-term target (CY2050)\n\n- -  Net zero by 2050 for the operational GHG emissions of our direct suppliers.\n\n## Progress against restated baseline\n\n- -  FY2023: 9.1 MtCO2-e\n- -  FY2022: 8.8 MtCO2-e\n- -  FY2021: 9.3 MtCO2-e\n- -  FY2020 baseline: 9.2 MtCO2-e\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBaseline and subsequent years have been restated for methodology changes. For more information on the essential definitions, assumptions and adjustments for this target refer to Metrics, targets and goals, later in this OFR 6.12\n\n## Delivered in FY2023\n\n- -  assessed the decarbonisation targets of our top 500 suppliers, including through direct engagement, to understand their alignment with our long-term target of net zero by CY2050 for the operational GHG emissions of our direct suppliers, with 55 per cent aligned in FY2023 (compared to 27 per cent in FY2022)\n\n## Pathways and strategy\n\nBHP's opportunity to influence our suppliers to set their own targets and goals for decarbonisation is broad: from the types of goods and services we procure, to the way we assess tenders and how we set and evaluate performance expectations. Over the long-term, we intend to continue to engage with and seek to influence our suppliers to set goals and targets that align with BHP's long-term target. Once suppliers are aligned, we consider them best placed to operationally manage achievement of their own goals and targets and BHP intends to monitor their progress. We seek to enhance our contracting arrangements with suppliers to meet this aim.\n\n## Carbon credits and offsetting\n\nBHP prioritises structural abatement of our operational GHG emissions to achieve our medium-term target and long-term goal and to fulfil our regulatory obligations. While we prioritise structural abatement, we acknowledge that carbon credits are likely to be needed to offset hard-toabate GHG emissions with limited or no technological solution and in a temporary capacity as abatement options are being studied, or to ensure compliance with local or regional GHG emission pricing schemes.\n\n- 1 Data to show our progress towards this goal has been published for the first time for FY2023 reporting.\n- 2 CY2008 was selected as the baseline year for this goal to align with the base year for the International Maritime Organisation's 2030 emission intensity goal and its corresponding reasoning and strategy.",

We define risks to include both threats and opportunities. Our Risk Framework provides a common foundation for the management of climate-related risks together with all our risks and supports the integration of processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks into BHP's approach to decision-making and strategy formation. This enables the relative significance of climate-related risks to be considered and addressed in the context of BHP's overall risk profile.\n\nThreats are assessed to determine their potential impacts and likelihood. To do this, BHP considers a range of aspects (including environment, ecosystems, community, company reputation, investment attractiveness and ability to access opportunities) using a standard severity table that measures the maximum foreseeable loss, linked to our mandatory minimum performance requirements for risk management. These requirements also set a process to determine the maximum foreseeable gain for an opportunity.\n\nWe then implement controls designed to prevent, minimise or mitigate threats and enable or enhance opportunities. Risks and controls are required to be assessed at least annually and are also assessed on an ad hoc basis as needed, to evaluate performance and determine if remediation is required. We recognise that climate change may influence or exacerbate risks across our risk profile, impacting issues including asset integrity, pricing of inputs, access to markets, changes to regulation and access to funding. Decisions on the prioritisation of actions to manage threats or pursue opportunities such as these are made consistent with our standard risk, planning and investment processes. Using a consistent approach allows us to consider climate-related risks across our business, integrated through our risk profile, to focus our actions on those that are material and integrate management of them into our core activities and business plans. We continue to embed climate-related risk across our risk profile and to build out the controls required to manage threats or enhance opportunities.\n\nWe also continue to review the completeness of our climate-related risk profile, seeking to identify, assess and manage emerging climaterelated risks.\n\nBHP recognises that the transition to a low-carbon economy and physical climate-related impacts, together with their potential significant financial, social and environmental effects, are risk factors for the Group (for a description of material risk factors for BHP, including those that are climate-related, refer to OFR 8.1). Climate-related risk factors are broadly categorised as:\n\n- -  transition risks, which arise from existing and emerging policy, regulatory, legal, technological, market and other societal responses to the challenges posed by climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. We have provided detailed disclosures on the management of risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy, later in this OFR 6.12\n- -  physical risks, which refer to acute risks that are event-driven, including increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events and chronic risks resulting from longer-term changes in climate patterns. We have provided detailed disclosures on the management of these risks in Physical climate-related risk and adaptation, later in this OFR 6.12\n\nIn setting and monitoring delivery of our strategy, the Board and Management consider climate-related risks (threats and opportunities), both physical and transition, across the following time horizons:\n\n- -  short-term (up to two years), aligning with our two-year budget process\n- -  medium-term (two to five years), defining supportive actions and initiatives that sit outside of our two-year budget process in order to support our long-term strategy\n- -  long-term (five to 30 years), given our supply, demand and pricing forecasts and our scenarios for portfolio analysis extend to 2050 and in some cases beyond. Given the long-term nature of some climaterelated risks, we qualitatively and quantitatively explore scenarios across a range of climate-related outcomes and assess the impact they could have\n\nAs climate change has the potential to influence or exacerbate risks across our risk profile, many of which may have a material financial impact (negative from threats and positive from opportunities) to BHP, climaterelated risks arise or require management across each of these time horizons. As such, while time horizons help us to assess potential impacts and plan our response, we do not use them specifically to categorise climate-related risks. The linkage of these time horizons to our planning processes and activities and strategy formation informs our decisionmaking and enables us to take appropriate and timely actions to manage these risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the management of risks, which include climate-related risks, within BHP's Risk Framework and the process to formally transition OZ Minerals' operations and functions to BHP's Risk Framework refer to OFR 8\n\n## Transition to a low-carbon economy\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nIn CY2020, BHP developed a 1.5\u00b0C scenario 1 for the purpose of analysing the resilience of our portfolio to accelerated global action on climate change. We consider a range of inputs, including our 1.5\u00b0C scenario, when testing the resilience of our portfolio, forming strategy and making investment decisions. The energy and resources modelling from BHP's 1.5\u00b0C scenario conducted in 2020 remains consistent with the updated carbon budget released in the Working Group I report as the first part of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report in 2021. In addition, we periodically benchmark our 1.5\u00b0C scenario against a number of published scenarios that align with a 1.5\u00b0C carbon budget, such as the IPCC and third-party energy and resource research organisations (including the International Energy Agency, IHS Markit, Wood Mackenzie, Bloomberg New Energy Finance and CRU). We are currently preparing an updated 1.5\u00b0C scenario to be completed in FY2024.\n\n- 1 This scenario requires steep global annual GHG emission reduction, sustained for decades, to stay within a 1.5\u00b0C carbon budget. 1.5\u00b0C is above pre-industrial levels. For more information about the assumptions, outputs, and limitations of our 1.5\u00b0C scenario refer to the BHP Climate Change Report 2020, available at bhp.com/climate",

However, as governments, institutions, companies and society increasingly focus on addressing climate change, the potential for a non-linear and/or more rapid transition and the subsequent impact on threats and opportunities increases.\n\nOur operational planning, price outlooks and strategy formation are informed (together with other market sources of information) by our operational planning cases. As an input to our operational planning cases, we use our current estimates (as updated in FY2023) of the most likely high-, mid- and low-range of future states for the global economy and associated sub-systems; three pathways that we refer to collectively as our 'One Energy View'. These are proprietary assessments of the likely future demand and supply of key commodities, rather than climate scenarios designed to test the resilience of our portfolio to different global climate action trajectories. However, our One Energy View pathways implicitly present a global average temperature outcome given they cover the energy sector. Among other changes in FY2023, our updated One Energy View reflects an acceleration in action on climate change over the past few years, resulting in all three of its pathways ultimately reaching global net zero GHG emissions, albeit employing different technological and policy assumptions and different underlying macro-economic growth assumptions to get there. In all three One Energy View pathways, most developed economies reach net zero around 2050, while other large economies reach net zero in 2060 and 2070, and they result in an implied global average temperature outcome of around 2\u00b0C by 2100.\n\nWe seek to maximise our exposure to products with significant opportunity under all pathways and scenarios and to minimise the risk that capital may be stranded in a rapidly decarbonising world. Our assessment in CY2020 indicated that the portfolio we then held would be resilient and have potentially higher financial value overall under our 1.5\u00b0C scenario when compared to our then current central planning cases that were associated with higher implied global average temperature outcomes. Since that assessment, we have continued to consider our 1.5\u00b0C scenario in our decision-making and strategy formation. We have made changes to our portfolio, including the divestment of our Petroleum business, all but one energy coal asset (NSWEC, at which we intend to cease mining by the end of FY2030) and our interest in lower-grade metallurgical coal assets, all of which would be expected to increase the resilience of our portfolio as a whole under our 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\n## Impact on our business, strategy and capital alignment and allocation\n\nThe results of our climate-related risk (threats and opportunities) assessment across our short-, medium- and long-term time horizons (for more information refer to Climate-related risk management, earlier in this OFR 6.12), as well as our 1.5\u00b0C scenario, continued to be systematically integrated into our strategy and capital allocation process during FY2023, enabling us to test the extent to which our business, strategy and capital allocation are aligned with a rapidly decarbonising global economy. For an overview of how climate-related issues have impacted our operational activities and our approach with respect to our value chain refer to Operational GHG emission reductions and Value chain GHG emission reductions, earlier in this OFR 6.12. For more information on how consideration of climate-related issues serves as an input to our financial processes, including the potential impact of climate-related issues on financial performance and financial position, refer to Financial Statements, Note 16, pages 162-165.\n\nWe continue to engage with investors, industry and standard setters to explore ways of establishing clear methodologies for classification and measurement of 'green revenue' 1 and associated capital expenditure within the resources sector, including engagement with the investor-led initiative Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) as part of the development of its proposed Net Zero Standard for Diversified Mining. We note that there are still divergent and evolving views on what constitutes 'green revenue', with no clear definition or expectations for other sustainability indicators, for the resources sector.\n\n- 1 'Green revenue' is a label referenced externally, including by standard setters and in investor-led benchmarks, which is intended as a measure of the extent to which products and services contribute to the transition to a low-carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive economy. For more information refer to unep.org/regions/asia-and-pacific/regional-initiatives/supporting-resourceefficiency/green-economy.\n\nTraceability of end use for many commodities, such as copper, still remains a challenge as they undergo multiple stages of processing and have a diverse range of end uses. Given this continued uncertainty, this year we have presented multiple classifications of our commodities to reflect a view on their actual or potential contribution to the transition to a lowcarbon economy.\n\nThe table on the next page outlines our FY2022 and FY2023 production, revenue and associated capital expenditure for our major commodities, including the identification of key transition materials as defined in the draft Net Zero Standard for Diversified Mining, as well as what we classify as our future-facing commodities (i.e. those that BHP determines to be positively leveraged in the energy transition and broader global response to climate change, with potential for decades-long demand growth to support emerging mega-trends like electrification and decarbonisation). 2\n\nThis table is intended only to present an indicative approach pending clear and resolved methodologies for the identification of the key transition materials that contribute to the transition to a low-carbon economy and the calculation of the revenues they generate. We also acknowledge that the classifications in the table focus primarily on the theme of enabling the transition to a low-carbon economy to mitigate climate change and that broader sustainability indicators in relation to how these commodities are produced are also important to consider.\n\nAlthough steelmaking materials (iron ore and higher quality metallurgical coal) are not included in the classifications above, we have included them in the table for completeness and we believe they also play an important role in the transition.\n\nWe are consolidating our remaining metallurgical coal portfolio to focus on the higher-quality coal used for steelmaking to meet expected ongoing demand for steel. The use of higher-quality coal enables more efficient steelmaking and lower GHG emission intensity, which may help steelmakers in their medium-term GHG emission reduction efforts. We see the blast furnace with carbon capture, utilisation and storage route, which would require metallurgical coal as an input, as an important part of the journey towards the end-state objective of widespread 'near zero emission steel' production. External analysis, such as the International Energy Agency's net zero by 2050 scenario, supports the role of the blast furnace with carbon capture, utilisation and storage route in the end-state.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information on the International Energy Agency's\n\nnet zero by 2050 scenario refer to\n\niea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050\n\nIn FY2022, we announced that we would retain (rather than sell) NSWEC, our only remaining energy coal asset, in our portfolio. We intend to seek the relevant approvals with the New South Wales and Australian Governments to continue mining beyond its current mining consent that expires in CY2026 and proceed with a managed process to cease mining at the asset by the end of FY2030. Additional capital is expected to be required for the proposed life extension of the Mt Arthur Coal mine through to the end of FY2030, should relevant approvals be received. Spend in FY2023 and all currently approved spend for this asset is limited to maintenance capital.\n\nOur capital expenditure plans are increasingly focused on future-facing commodities between FY2024 and FY2028, as illustrated in the 'Capital spend in future-facing commodities' chart on the next page.",

FY2022 figures are inclusive of BMC (divestment of our interest in BMC completed on 3 May 2022). FY2022 figures do not include commodities associated with our divested Petroleum business (merger with Woodside completed on 1 June 2022). FY2023 figures include OZ Minerals. Copper equivalent production has been calculated based on FY2023 average realised product prices using a boundary based on the accounting treatment in BHP's consolidated financial statements. In some instances, the sum of percentages may not equal 100% due to rounding.\n- 2 Other capital expenditure includes maintenance and decarbonisation capital, improvement capital and exploration. Negative figures for Potash result from the accounting treatment for this category.\n- 3 It has not been possible to differentiate based on end use, therefore figures represent totals, rather than the proportion that we identify as contributing to the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n- 4 CA100+ Net Zero Standard for Diversified Miners: Consultation Draft, May 2023. Final classifications may differ.\n- 5 Battery-suitable nickel is defined as nickel briquettes, nickel powder and nickel sulphate. It does not include off-specification nickel metal. Calculated based on gross revenue from battery suitable nickel multiplied by percentage of BHP's sales of battery-suitable nickel, as applicable to battery material suppliers. Where a customer's planned end use is not known with certainty to be for battery supply, assumptions of usage have been made using historical nickel usage for those customers.\n- 6 Capital expenditure is presented for all of nickel as it is not possible to disaggregate between 'Battery-suitable' and 'Other' due to the integrated nature of the operations.\n- 7 FTSE Russell's Green Revenues Classification System, v1.1, February 2023.\n- 8 Capital expenditure for uranium is included within copper's capital expenditure as it is not possible to disaggregate due to the integrated nature of operations.\n- 9 Other includes by-products cobalt, gold, lead, molybdenum, silver and zinc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 10  'Future-facing commodities' means copper, nickel and potash (the major commodities we classify as our future-facing commodities). Major capital represents projects > US$250M. FY2022 'Percentage of capital expenditure in future-facing commodities' is calculated from a total that excludes our divested Petroleum business (merger with Woodside completed on 1 June 2022).",

Similarly, the competitiveness of our products and the downstream processes in which they are used are subject to carbon pricing legislation in customer countries. We use an explicit regulatory carbon price forecast for major BHP operational and customer countries that aligns with our One Energy View pathways framing and associated regional net zero ambitions.\n\nIn determining our outlook, we consider factors such as a country's current and announced climate change policies, targets and goals (including net zero) and societal factors, such as public acceptance and demographics.\n\nOur forecast of ranges of regional carbon prices for major BHP operational countries and key customer countries is outlined below.\n\n| January 2022 US$ real  per tCO2   |   FY2030   Low |   FY2030  High |   FY2050  Low |   FY2050  High |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Australia                         |             25 |             75 |           150 |            225 |\n| Brazil                            |              5 |             50 |           125 |            200 |\n| Chile                             |              8 |             41 |           150 |            225 |\n| Canada                            |             65 |            102 |           200 |            225 |\n| Key customer countries            |              0 |            175 |            25 |            250 |\n\nFor more than a decade we have incorporated regional carbon price assumptions in our planning, investment decisions and asset valuations. Carbon prices are used together with our operational planning cases based on the current economic outlook for asset planning, asset valuations and operational decision-making as well as when considering initiatives to meet our operational GHG emission reduction medium-term target and long-term goal.\n\nOur carbon price forecasts are also used along with other qualitative and quantitative metrics, such as the outcomes of our 1.5\u00b0C scenario analysis, in assessing investments under the Capital Allocation Framework and to inform our portfolio strategy and investment decisions.\n\n## Equitable change and transition\n\nThere are communities around the world that rely on mining of certain commodities for their economic and financial livelihood. These communities may be disproportionately impacted by the transition to a low-carbon economy. Solutions that aim to provide an equitable transition away from mining of those commodities requires a multistakeholder approach including the local community, investors, financiers, government at all levels and resource companies such as BHP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on our principles for how we respond to the issue of 'just transition' refer to\n\nbhp.com/local-communities\n\n- For examples of how we plan, consult and implement our approach, such as for the intended closure and transition of NSWEC refer to OFR 6.14\n\n## Policy engagement\n\nBHP recognises the role we must play in helping the world achieve the aims of the Paris Agreement. Part of this involves taking concrete steps to progress towards achieving our operational and value chain GHG emission reduction targets and goals. It also involves engaging with governments and the broader community in support of policies that enable a global transition to net zero.\n\nAchieving the aims of the Paris Agreement will require supportive policy across jurisdictions, globally. The policy-making process is complex and change is unlikely to be smooth or linear. We believe BHP can best support policy development by ensuring we meet our own climate targets and goals and strategies, continuing to make the case for the economic opportunities arising from the energy transition and focusing on those policy areas where we are likely to have the greatest ability to influence change.\n\nOur Climate Policy Principles outline our views on how governments can best pursue the aims of the Paris Agreement, with a focus on both the principles we believe should guide how governments approach policymaking, and the policy outcomes we believe governments should seek. We first released our Climate Policy Principles (then referred to as our Global Climate Policy Standards) in August 2020.\n\nReflecting recent changes to our strategy and portfolio, and the evolving nature of climate policy debates, we published an updated version of our Climate Policy Principles in May 2023. We commit to conducting our own advocacy efforts consistent with our Climate Policy Principles, and to using our Climate Policy Principles to seek to influence the advocacy of the industry associations of which we are a member.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can read our Climate Policy Principles at bhp.com/sustainability/ climate-change/advocacy-on-climate-policy\n\n## Direct advocacy\n\nBHP engages directly and regularly with governments on issues relating to climate change and the transition to net zero GHG emissions. We remain committed to developing policy advocacy positions that align with our support for global efforts to meet the aims of the Paris Agreement, harnessing opportunities to decarbonise our operations as cost effectively as possible and promoting policies that support our key markets, including for commodities with significant positive exposure to the energy transition.\n\nWe focus our direct advocacy efforts on areas where we have the greatest ability to influence change. For example, over the past year, we have:\n\n- -  supported the increase in Australia's 2030 GHG emission reduction target from 26-28 per cent to 43 per cent\n- -  engaged with the Australian Government on its proposed reforms to the Safeguard Mechanism\n- -  advocated in favour of climate-related disclosure requirements that are decision-useful, appropriately contextual and globally consistent\n- -  contributed to the Australian Industry Energy Transitions Initiative, which included a 'call to action' for government, industry and investors to collaborate on developing pathways to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors, such as steelmaking, consistent with the aims of the Paris Agreement\n- -  advocated for greater efforts in the decarbonisation of international shipping\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information on our approach to direct advocacy on climate change refer to\n\nbhp.com/sustainability/climate-change/advocacy-on-climate-policy\n\n## Indirect advocacy\n\nBHP is a member of industry associations around the world. We believe these associations perform a number of functions that can lead to better outcomes on public policy, practice and standards.\n\nJust as we do to ourselves, we hold the industry associations of which we are a member to high standards. We expect them to act with integrity, be constructive in their engagements with stakeholders and reflect the views and positions of their members.\n\nIn June 2023, we published our fourth and latest industry association review. This review assessed the climate policy advocacy of 15 industry associations we consider to be material. 1 Of these 15 industry associations, the review found:\n\n- -  10 were aligned with the Global Climate Policy Standards we released in August 2020\n- -  five had some non-material misalignment. Taking into account the nature of misalignment and the associations' broader activities and consistent with our principles for participating in industry associations, we decided to remain a member of these five associations, while actively encouraging them to address the identified areas of misalignment\n\nIn February 2023, we engaged with investors and other stakeholders on possible further improvements we could make to our industry association review approach. Based on the feedback we received, we intend to increase the frequency of our industry association reviews to every two years. In the intervening years, we expect to publish (as relevant) an update on the progress we have made in addressing identified areas of misalignment and any relevant findings from our real-time monitoring.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our approach to industry associations refer to bhp.com/about/operating-ethically/industry-associations\n\n- 1 These 15 associations satisfied at least one of our two materiality criteria as at July 2022: (1) Our base membership fee was equal to or greater than US$100,000; and/or (2) there is significant stakeholder interest in the advocacy of the association (as determined by whether the association was listed on InfluenceMap's ranking of industry associations).",

        "page_content": "## Physical climate-related risk and adaptation\n\n## Our approach\n\nBHP's operations are exposed to physical climate-related risks and these risks may be exacerbated by climate change. Our adaptation strategy outlines the proactive and collaborative approach we intend to progressively take to enhance the safety, productivity and climate resilience of our operated assets, investments, portfolio, supply chain, communities and ecosystems by adapting to physical climate-related risks.\n\nOur approach to further evaluate and progressively seek to quantify our operational physical climate-related risks and ultimately embed management of these risks deeper into business processes, including capital allocation, is illustrated in the diagram below.\n\nOur approach considers the inherent uncertainty in climate scenario projections, including by seeking to establish a knowledge base, using a globally consistent climate dataset and undertaking asset-level risk evaluations to identify the range of potential climate hazards projected by different models under different climate scenarios. For physical climaterelated risks, we use Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios used by the IPCC, incorporating an ensemble of latest generation (CMIP6) climate models in order to explore the potential changes to climate-related hazards that drive physical risks. 1 This includes in a high GHG emission future (SSP5-8.5) with around a 4.4\u00b0C increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, where greater risk would be expected, and a medium GHG emission future (SSP2-4.5), representing an increase of around 2.7\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. 2\n\n## Climate-related data\n\nWe have obtained a bespoke dataset of latest-generation climate projections from WTW, 3 an insurance advisor to BHP, which covers all of our operated assets, the current climate and three future time horizons (2035, 2055 and 2075) and three climate scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP24.5 and SSP5-8.5. This dataset provides a globally consistent basis to underpin our ongoing assessment of physical climate-related risks and design of appropriate adaptation measures. The dataset covers more than 20 climate-related hazards relevant to our global operations, with data downscaled from General Circulation Models, to focus in on our operated assets. Hazards related to physical climate-related risks identified as having the highest potential impact 4 (and which we started to evaluate further during FY2023) include extreme high temperature, extreme precipitation, flood, tropical cyclones, sea level rise and storm surge.\n\n## Evaluation of priority risks\n\nIn FY2023, we progressed asset-level impact evaluations of physical climate-related risks to better understand and work towards quantifying the potential impacts to site operations, safety, productivity and cost for our operated assets (excluding for acquired OZ Minerals assets). This has built upon the initial risk identification and assessment processes conducted in previous years.\n\nRisks evaluated have focused on those with among the highest potential impact 4 at our operated assets, 5 including:\n\n- -  flooding of mine and/or key production infrastructure (e.g. plants, conveyor belts) due to extreme precipitation - applicable to all operated assets\n- -  disruption and/or damage to port and coastal infrastructure and operations due to higher sea levels, cyclones, storm surge and changes in marine ecosystems - applicable to WAIO, BMA and Escondida\n- -  disruption and/or damage to electrical infrastructure (e.g. motors, cooling and control systems) due to extreme temperatures applicable to all Minerals Australia assets\n- -  disruption and/or damage to water supply infrastructure due to extreme precipitation or flooding - applicable to Escondida, Pampa Norte and Olympic Dam\n- -  workforce health and safety incidents due to extreme events (e.g. extreme temperature causing heat stress) - pilot study conducted at Olympic Dam\n\nAs part of the impact evaluation work, we developed risk transmission channels to seek to understand the direct and indirect potential impacts of an extreme climate hazard occurring and how these could translate into financial impacts. For example, extreme precipitation may flood mine pits and other critical infrastructure, leading to disruptions in production and additional costs for pumping and repairs. Similarly, extreme heat or precipitation may cause safety risks triggering response plans, which may include operational stoppages.\n\nThe recently acquired OZ Minerals assets face many of the same physical climate-related risks as our other operated assets, while some risks are specific to their locations such as reduced annual rainfall in Brazil potentially increasing power costs and creating supply disruptions due to reduced hydroelectric power generation. The materiality of physical climate-related risks previously identified by OZ Minerals will be assessed in accordance with BHP's Risk Framework and where deemed material, we intend to further evaluate them using the risk evaluation and quantification approach outlined earlier.\n\n## Quantification and embedment of management of operational physical climate-related risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Scenarios used to inform strategy and transition planning are referenced in Transition to a low-carbon economy, earlier in this OFR 6.12. These scenarios consider physical climate-related risk through the potential impact on capital degradation, but are primarily focused on transition risk that stems from the pace of change, technology innovation and policy drivers. As part of our ongoing work to consider physical climate-related risks in more detail through our climate hazard evaluations, we apply the widely accepted practice of using SSPs, paired with greenhouse gas and aerosol concentration pathways that align to different climate outcomes to explore a range of plausible climate futures.\n- 2 IPCC, 2021, Climate Change 2021. The Physical Science Basis: Summary for Policymakers, Table SPM.1.\n- 3 Data developed for BHP by WTW's Climate and Resilience Hub https://www.wtwco.com/en-au/solutions/climate.\n- 4 Risks were assessed in accordance with BHP's Risk Framework. Hazards with the highest potential impact were determined through the Maximum Foreseeable Loss severity rating for the associated risks, which may relate to a range of impacts including financial, health and safety, environmental, community or reputational.\n- 5 The risks with the highest potential impact for each of our operated assets (excluding acquired OZ Minerals assets) are available in our Annual Report 2022 and at bhp.com/climate.",

        "page_content": "## 6  Sustainability\n\nIn FY2024, we intend to continue our work on the impact assessments being conducted with respect to site operations, safety, productivity and costs at our operated assets, as well as our work on the subsequent steps of calculating potential financial impacts to feed into a future value-at-risk assessment and prioritisation of additional adaptation measures.\n\n## Value chain risk assessment\n\nWe have conducted an assessment to understand how physical climaterelated risks may exacerbate selected existing risks within our value chain, such as for the delivery and storage of critical production inputs and supplies and ability to get our products to market. Our assessment used a climate data mapping exercise to understand which key roads, railways, warehouses and load and discharge ports used for our supplies and products are most at risk of exposure to climate-related hazards. We have applied natural catastrophe models to quantify the projected annual downtime for certain flood-related risks along our value chain under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 climate scenarios and three future time horizons consistent with the climate dataset for our operated assets. This assessment suggested the aggregated changes in risk profile compared to the current climate baseline were either modest or not significant. The results of these assessments are being incorporated into routine annual risk evaluations, which will assess if additional risk controls are needed (for more information refer to OFR 8). In FY2024, we intend to develop a workplan to assess additional value chain risks.\n\n## Ecosystems and communities\n\nWe recognise climate change has a vast range of intersecting potential impacts and similarly the adaptation measures we take can bring broader social value benefits, including in the areas of biodiversity, nature and community resilience. We are building our understanding of the ecosystem-based adaptation options available to our business and continuing our investment in nature-based solutions and other innovative adaptation measures, including through our social investment commitment aligned with our social value framework. For example, we have launched a pilot for parametric insurance for a coral reef ecosystem in Fiji, to enable quick response in the event of a cyclone and greater long-term resilience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information and case studies on work with ecosystems and communities refer to\n\nbhp.com/environment and bhp.com/communities\n\nWe are building our capability to take a proactive and collaborative approach to engaging the communities in which we operate (including communities surrounding our legacy assets) on the topic of climate resilience, recognising climate vulnerability and resilience intersects with many other matters of importance to communities. This includes targeted analysis of the factors that may influence the level of vulnerability or adaptive capacity within each community. We acknowledge the importance of an inclusive and equitable approach to community adaptation that involves Indigenous and local knowledge.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Structure and activities\n\nClimate change is a material governance and strategic issue for BHP. The Board's oversight of and Management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks (threats and opportunities) are explained in the diagram on the following page.\n\nThe Board and its Committees and Management regularly considered climate change-related items during FY2023, including as part of discussions and decisions on performance, strategy, risk, sustainability and executive remuneration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the role and composition of the Board and its Committees and each Committee's key activities in FY2023, including in relation to climate-related matters, refer to Corporate Governance Statement 3, 4 and 5\n\n## Board experience\n\nThe Board maintains a skills matrix that identifies the skills and experience the Board needs for the next period of BHP's development, considering BHP's circumstances and the changing external environment.\n\nThe Board skills matrix (refer to Corporate Governance Statement 4.5) reflects BHP's current purpose and identifies the future-facing skills the Board intends to build, acquire and retain over the medium-term\n\nin anticipation of the company's needs as it pursues its strategy of securing growth options in future-facing commodities. Examples of skills in the matrix include:\n\n- -  operating risk - which includes extensive experience with the development and oversight of complex frameworks focused on the identification, assessment and assurance of operational workplace, health, safety, environmental, climate and community risks\n- -  mining - which includes a proven record in terms of health, safety and environmental performance and results\n- -  social value, community and stakeholder engagement - which includes an extensive track record of positive external stakeholder engagement including in relation to community issues and social responsibility\n\nNon-executive Directors are required to have significant experience across multiple Board skill areas and are expected to contribute to all elements of the strategy and Risk Framework. The Board collectively possesses all the skills and experience set out in the Board skills matrix and Directors participate in an ongoing training and development program. For more information on the skills matrix, the process for Board evaluation and director training, induction and development refer to Corporate Governance Statement 4.\n\n## Metrics, targets and goals\n\nThe primary metrics we consider when assessing and managing climaterelated risks (threats and opportunities) include:\n\n- -  Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions\n- -  capital allocation and alignment, including by reference to financial spend in US$ (refer to Operational GHG emission reductions and Transition to a low-carbon economy both earlier in this OFR 6.12)\n- -  production, reserves and resources (refer to Production and Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in Additional Information 4 and 5)\n\nFor information on the proportion of Management's Cash and Deferred Plan linked to climate change factors, refer to pages 118-126 of the Remuneration Report.\n\nFor information on our approach to carbon prices, refer to Transition to a low-carbon economy earlier in this OFR 6.12.\n\nWe report on a number of other sustainability-related metrics (e.g. water use, biodiversity) in our sustainability disclosures at bhp.com/sustainability and in the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2023, available at bhp.com/climate, and recognise their interconnection with climate change. However, we do not currently use these as our core metrics for the assessment and management of climate-related risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our social value and sustainability-related goals, metrics and milestones refer to OFR 6.5\n\nIn the following tables, we present operational energy consumption and Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG emission metrics, as well as definitions, assumptions and adjustments for our GHG emission reduction targets and goals.\n\n## Operational energy consumption: Operational control basis\n\n- -  Fuel and electricity consumption refers to the annual quantity of energy consumed by BHP from the combustion of fuel and operation of our facilities, together with energy consumed resulting from the electricity, heat, steam or cooling purchased by BHP for our use.\n- -  Organisational boundary: We have made our calculations based on an operational control approach in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.\n- -  Data has been rounded to the nearest 1 PJ.\n- -  Data in italics indicates that it has been adjusted since reported in our Annual Report 2022.\n- -  Operational energy consumption from renewable sources includes third-party supplied renewable electricity as evidenced by renewable energy certificates or supplier-provided documentation, in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. FY2023 operational energy consumption from renewable sources includes third-party supplied renewable electricity and a small volume of hydrotreated vegetable oil associated with a trial at WAIO's Yandi iron ore operations.\n- -  FY2022 operational energy consumption from renewable sources has been restated from 17.1 per cent, after our Cerro Colorado copper operation surrendered renewable energy certificates for all electricity consumption in CY2022.",

Previously reported operational energy intensity was 21 GJ/t copper equivalent production for FY2021 and 18 GJ/t copper equivalent production for FY2022.\n\n## Operational energy consumption: Operational control basis (continued)\n\n- -  Divestments are our interest in BMC (sale completed on 3 May 2022) and our Petroleum business (merger with Woodside completed on 1 June 2022).\n\n| Year ended 30 June Energy consumption (PJ) - on a Total operations  basis, unless otherwise indicated   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Consumption of fuel                                                                                     |        |        |        |\n| -  Coal and coke                                                                                        | 1      | 1      | 1      |\n| -  Natural gas                                                                                          | 11     | 22     | 23     |\n| -  Distillate/gasoline                                                                                  | 85     | 87     | 91     |\n| -  Other                                                                                                | 2      | 2      | 3      |\n| Consumption of electricity                                                                              | 38     | 37     | 37     |\n| Total operational energy consumption                                                                    | 137    | 149    | 155    |\n| Total operational energy consumption adjusted                                                           | 137    | 132    | 137    |\n| for divestments                                                                                         |        |        |        |\n| Operational energy consumption from   renewable sources                                                 | 25.7   | 17.3   | 0.5    |\n| Consumption of electricity from grid                                                                    | 34     | 33     | 33     |\n| Operational energy intensity (GJ per tonne of  copper equivalent production)                            | 18     | 19     | 19     |\n\n## Scopes 1 and 2 emissions: Operational control basis\n\n- -  Scope 2 refers to indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat or cooling that is consumed by our operated assets. Our Scope 2 emissions have been calculated using the market-based method in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, unless otherwise specified.\n- -  Organisational boundary: Scopes 1 and 2 emissions have been calculated based on an operational control approach in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Scope 1 refers to direct GHG emissions from our operated assets.\n- -  Data has been rounded to the nearest 0.1 MtCO2-e.\n- -  Data in italics indicates that it has been adjusted since reported in our Annual Report 2022.\n- -  Operational GHG emission intensity has been restated due to a change in methodology for calculating copper equivalent production. For FY2021 to FY2023 copper equivalent production has been calculated based on FY2023 average realised product prices, to allow comparison between years. Production figures used are consistent with operational GHG emission reporting boundaries (i.e. BHP operational control) and are taken on a 100 per cent basis. Previously reported operational GHG emission intensity was 2.2 tCO2-e/t copper equivalent production in FY2021 and 1.5 tCO2-e/t copper equivalent production in FY2022.\n- -  FY2021 and FY2022 percentages of Scope 1 emissions covered under a GHG emission-limiting regulation have been restated upon confirming that GHG emissions from our Jansen Potash Project were not covered under emission-limiting regulation for those periods. Previously reported percentages were 81 per cent for FY2021 and 78 per cent for FY2022.\n- -  The final validation for surrender of the rights to claim GHG emission reductions assigned via the Chilean energy market's Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) system is expected to occur by June 2024 with respect to the FY2023 period. As a result, we will re-calculate our Scope 2 GHG emission with respect to Escondida and Pampa Norte following the final validation and restate those figures as part of our annual reporting for FY2024 if required to adjust for any differences.\n- -  Divestments are our interest in BMC (sale completed on 3 May 2022) and our Petroleum business (merger with Woodside completed on 1 June 2022).\n\n| Year ended 30 June Operational GHG emissions (MtCO2-e) - on a Total  operations basis, unless otherwise indicated   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1 emissions                                                                                                   | 8.0    | 9.2    | 10.1   |\n| Scope 2 emissions                                                                                                   | 1.8    | 3.1    | 6.2    |\n| Total operational GHG emissions                                                                                     | 9.8    | 12.3   | 16.3   |\n| Carbon credits retired                                                                                              | 0      | 0      | 0.3    |\n| Total operational GHG emissions   minus retired carbon credits                                                      | 9.8    | 12.3   | 16.0   |\n| Scope 1 emissions adjusted for divestments                                                                          | 8.0    | 7.9    | 8.8    |\n| Scope 2 emissions adjusted for divestments                                                                          | 1.8    | 3.0    | 6.1    |\n| Total operational GHG emissions adjusted  for divestments                                                           | 9.8    | 11.0   | 14.9   |\n| Scope 2 emissions (location-based)                                                                                  | 3.8    | 4.8    | 5.0    |\n| Operational GHG emission intensity (tCO2-e per  tonne of copper equivalent production)                              | 1.3    | 1.6    | 2.0    |\n| Scope 1 emissions covered under GHG emission- limiting regulation (%)                                               | 81%    | 71%    | 74%    |\n| Scope 1 emissions from methane (%)                                                                                  | 15%    | 18%    | 22%    |\n\n## Scope 3 emissions\n\n- -  Organisational boundary: Downstream Scope 3 emissions are estimated and reported on an equity share basis, but for upstream Scope 3 emissions the boundary is defined on a category-by-category basis due to data limitations.\n- -  Scope 3 emissions have been calculated using methodologies consistent with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Scope 3 emission reporting necessarily has a degree of overlap in reporting boundaries due to our involvement at multiple points in the life cycle of the commodities we produce and consume.\n- -  Data in italics indicates that it has been adjusted since reported in our Annual Report 2022.\n- -  In FY2023, we updated the spend-based data methodology to account for inflation. This new methodology was applied to FY2020 to FY2023 data and impacts Category 1, Category 4, Category 6 and Category 7 where spendbased data is used. For each reporting year, an inflation correction value was applied to the emission factors sourced from the GHG Protocol Quantis Scope 3 Evaluator tool. This has resulted in the restatement of Category 1, which was 10.1 MtCO2-e in FY2021 and 9.9 MtCO2-e in FY2022, and Category 4, which was 4.6 MtCO2-e in FY2022.\n- -  In FY2023, we updated the emission factor used for calculating distillate and gasoline emissions in Category 3 after a more accurate emission factor was published in the National Greenhouse Accounts Factors (2022). This new emission factor was applied to FY2020 to FY2023 data, resulting in restatements. Previously reported data for Category 3 was 1.1 MtCO2-e for FY2021 and 1.0 MtCO2-e for FY2022.\n- -  Category 15 was restated from 2.7 MtCO2-e for FY2022 due to an increase in GHG emissions reported by Tamakaya Energ\u00eda SpA (Kelar Power plant).\n- -  Comparing progress in Scope 3 emission reduction between years should consider the role that divestments played in the reduction of GHG emissions. Data excludes divestments from the completion date or effective economic date (as applicable) of the divestment. Divestments reflected in the table below include the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside (completed on 1 June 2022), divestment of our interest in the ROD Integrated Development (completed in April 2022), divestment of our interest in BMC (completed on 3 May 2022), and divestment of our interest in Cerrej\u00f3n (with an effective economic date of 31 December 2020). The most material changes between years occurred in Category 11 and Category 15. To further aid in comparability between years, we disclose total Scope 3 emissions adjusted for divestments in the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2023, available at bhp.com/climate.",

Over the past year, we have seen increasing societal focus on the need to halt and reverse current trends in nature loss in the coming decade, including the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework during the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in December 2022. We intend to contribute our part towards the global efforts to halt and reverse nature loss, which includes progressively assessing and disclosing our risks, impacts and dependencies on nature and taking appropriate actions to contribute towards nature-positive 1 outcomes through our 2030 Healthy environment goal.\n\nAs defined by the TNFD, nature has four major components, or realms: land, oceans, fresh water and atmosphere. At BHP, we are evolving our environmental sustainability reporting to align with this concept of nature.\n\nThere is growing pressure on and competition for natural resources with climate change amplifying certain sensitivities of our natural systems. Where and how we operate is critical to ensuring the ongoing viability of our business and our contribution to global efforts to protect the vital ecosystems and realms of nature on which the world depends. With the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the rapid evolution of frameworks for corporate disclosures (such as the TNFD) and for business action on nature, BHP is continuing to review and consider how to evolve our existing environmental disclosures in line with these emerging frameworks, initiatives and regulatory reforms, including environmental policy and law, in the jurisdictions where we operate.\n\n## BHP's approach to environmental management\n\nBHP's operations and growth strategy depend on obtaining and maintaining the right to access natural resources. We remain committed to maintaining effective environmental management systems to implement our approach to environmental management and to drive continuous improvement in our environmental performance.\n\nSpecific environmental aspects, such as water, land and biodiversity, may involve higher levels of risk to the health and resilience of our business, the natural environment and our partners and stakeholders. We have developed specific strategies and programs of work to help manage these risks as discussed later in this section.\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, BHP owned, leased or managed an area of just under 6.5 million hectares 2 with just over 2 per cent disturbed for mining operation purposes. Most of the area we steward is located in Australia and is for non-operational land uses, such as pastoral leases or land set aside for conservation. BHP's approach to environmental management is tailored to different area types in our portfolio. See Figure below for a visualisation of this approach.\n\nOur primary approach to preventing or minimising our adverse environmental impacts (to air, water, land and biodiversity) within our operational footprint is to apply the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, mitigate, rehabilitate, compensatory actions). For an example of how we apply the 'avoid' pillar refer to our no-go commitments on page 62.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on governance of sustainability topics, including nature refer to OFR 6.3\n\n- 1 Nature positive is defined by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)/TNFD as 'A high-level goal and concept describing a future state of nature (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural capital) which is greater than the current state.' It includes land and water management practices that halt and reverse nature loss - that is, supporting healthy, functioning ecosystems.\n- 2 This figure excludes areas we hold under greenfield exploration licences (or equivalent tenements) and does not include the areas that we now steward following the acquisition of OZ Minerals. The OZ Minerals areas will be included in our land, water and biodiversity data from FY2024. The area we own, lease or manage has decreased by less than 1 per cent from FY2022.\n\n## In FY2023, BHP owned, leased or managed an area of just under 6.5 million hectares 2 consisting of:\n\n98%\n\n6.3 million hectares nonoperational area\n\nThe areas we hold for strategic purposes or alternative use (e.g. pastoral or conservation)\n\n154,000 hectares operational area\n\nThe area we hold for mining\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Outside BHP footprint\n\nOn areas held by others, BHP seeks to contribute to nature-positive outcomes on a global scale, including thought leadership on approach to assessment of nature positive outcomes\n\n## Non-operational areas\n\n## Outcome we seek\n\n- -  focus area for delivering at least 30% of the land and water we steward 1 under conservation, restoration or regenerative practices\n- -  build resilience of natural environment\n\n## Operational areas\n\n## Outcome we seek\n\n- -  no net loss of biodiversity over mine life cycle\n- -  compliance with environmental permits\n\n## Outside BHP footprint\n\n## Outcome we seek\n\n- -  contributing to global scale conservation and nature positive outcomes\n\n## How we manage\n\n- -  2030 Healthy environment goal\n- -Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard\n\n## How we manage\n\n- -  2030 Healthy environment goal\n- -Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard\n- -  Mitigation hierarchy\n- -  no-go commitments\n- -  Asset Environmental Management System\n- -  Risk management\n\n## How we manage\n\n- -  BHP Social Investment Strategy, portfolio and funding\n\nAmount contributed: almost US$100 million since 2011 3\n\n- 1 Excluding greenfield exploration licences (or equivalent tenements) which are outside the area of influence of our existing mine operations. 30 per cent will be calculated based on the areas of land and water that we steward at the end of FY2030.\n- 2.

These requirements outline an integrated, risk-based approach to managing any actual or reasonably foreseeable adverse and positive impacts (direct, indirect and cumulative) on nature and/or natural resources. This includes a requirement to establish and implement environmental risk monitoring and review practices in our business planning and project evaluation cycles. Our mandatory minimum performance standards require development and implementation of Environmental Management Systems that align with global environmental frameworks such as ISO 14001, which is verified either by ISO 14001 certification or through our internal assurance processes. They also require our operated assets to define the intended asset-level environmental objectives by setting target environmental outcomes that are consistent with the assessed risks and potential impacts.\n\nUnder our 2030 Healthy environment goal, we seek to create nature-positive outcomes by having at least 30 per cent of the land and water we steward under conservation, restoration or regenerative practices by the end of FY2030. Our non-operational areas are the primary focus of our 2030 Healthy environment goal due to their size. Nevertheless, both the 2030 goal and mitigation hierarchy are expected to be used as management approaches for both operational and non-operational areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information on our 2030 goals refer to OFR 6.4\n\nBeyond BHP's footprint, we commit to making voluntary contributions to support environmental resilience across the regions where we operate through social investment, on ground action and thought leadership.\n\nOur collaborative work with strategic partners, including Conservation International, research organisations and local communities, is focused on contributing to enduring environmental and social benefits through projects and programs focused on conservation and ecosystem restoration, water stewardship and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Our preference is to invest our voluntary social investment funds in projects that contribute to cultural, economic and community benefits in addition to environmental resilience.\n\nSince FY2011, we have invested almost US$100 million of our social investment funds in voluntary environmental resilience initiatives outside our operational area. This funding is in addition to our investment in day-to-day environmental management activities relating to our operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our environmental approach refer to Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard and our environmental management and governance processes at bhp.com/environment\n\n## Key progress in FY2023\n\nOur 2030 Healthy environment goal is supported by successive short-term milestones that we intend to develop and disclose each year until FY2030.\n\nDuring FY2023, as part of our progress to achieve our 2030 Healthy environment goal, we completed the following milestones:\n\n- -  published our asset-level context based water targets (CBWTs) 1 that were informed by catchment-scale risk assessments and Water Resource Situational Analyses. For more information refer to the Oceans and fresh water section below.\n- -  completed baseline mapping of Important Biodiversity and/or Ecosystems (IBE) - for all land and water areas at our operated assets in Minerals Australia and Minerals America (excluding OZ Minerals and legacy assets 2 ), and formalised our approach to biodiversity and land management in a Group-level biodiversity strategic framework that identified three priority areas - valuing natural capital, innovation and collaboration and nature-related disclosures. For more information refer to the Biodiversity section on the following page.\n- -  continued to invest in voluntary conservation projects and thought leadership related to areas beyond BHP's footprint, as part of our contribution to environmental resilience more broadly. This included the release of our Natural Capital Accounting for the Mining Sector - Beenup Site Pilot Case Study bhp.com/news/media-centre/releases/2023/05/bhp-case-study-a-firstfor-natural-capital-accounting-in-mining to progress collective thinking on the application of natural capital accounting principles for the mining sector.\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, we had 82,132 hectares under nature-positive management practices 3 , which is 1.3 per cent of the land and water we steward 3 . Development of natural capital accounts for our operated assets has not yet commenced, but will be guided by the insights and learnings from the Beenup Site pilot case study.\n\n## Oceans and fresh water\n\nAccess to safe, clean water is a basic human right and water is essential to maintaining healthy ecosystems. Water is integral to what we do and vital to the longevity of BHP. We depend on access to water and cannot operate without it.\n\nOur Water Stewardship Position Statement outlines our vision for a water secure world by 2030 and this vision is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Our position statement is supported by our Water Stewardship Strategy, which focuses on understanding and managing water-related risk, disclosure, contributing to the resolution of shared water challenges, valuing water and sharing innovations and learning.\n\nWe strive to effectively manage our interactions with and prevent or minimise our adverse impacts on water resources. We work to reduce stress on water resources from our operations by requiring our operated assets, as part of the BHP Risk Framework, to identify, assess and manage water-related risk and make strategic business decisions in line with our risk appetite statement. BHP's portfolio of long-life operated assets means we plan in decades and must take into account the needs and circumstances of future generations in our decisions. We consider both our operated assets' needs and the potential for regional changes to water resources due to our activities, climate change, pollution, population growth and changing expectations. We consider the interactions that we and external parties have with water resources within catchments, shared marine regions and groundwater systems, and the need to manage waterrelated risks for the different physical environments, hydrological systems and socio-political and regulatory contexts in which we work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the water-related risks (both threats and opportunities), impacts and dependencies that we have evaluated and the actions we take to seek to prevent, mitigate or enhance them refer to bhp.com/water\n\nFor information on BHP's risk process, including effectiveness of actions taken, refer to OFR 8\n\n- 1 CBWTs are intended to apply at the asset-level for our operated assets. Due to the previous divestment review of NSWEC, the development of CBWTs for this asset is planned to be completed in FY2024, along with CBWTs for our legacy assets. We will review the need to revise or develop new or additional CBWTs when there are substantial changes to our portfolio or one of our operated assets moves into the operational phase, which may firstly require a Water Resource Situational Analysis (WRSA) to the extent that an existing WRSA is not applicable.\n- 2 Legacy assets refer to those BHP-operated assets, or part thereof, located in the Americas that are in the closure phase.\n- 3 Area under stewardship that has a formal management plan, including conservation, restoration or regenerative practices. 1.3 per cent is calculated based on areas of land and water that we stewarded at 30 June 2023.

        "page_content": "Beyond our operational activities, we engage across communities, government, business and civil society to catalyse actions to improve water governance, increase recognition of water's diverse values and advance sustainable solutions. Our key collaboration in FY2023 was our engagement of third parties (e.g. universities) to review publicly available information and engage with partners and stakeholders (e.g. communities, Indigenous groups, policymakers and other private corporations within our catchment areas) to identify shared water challenges through Water Resource Situation Analyses (WRSAs). The WRSAs for our operated assets that are currently operational (except for NSWEC due to the previous divestment review) were published on our website in FY2023 and are intended to support continued collaboration between partners and stakeholders to understand and manage shared water resources within our operating regions. While water challenges vary across our catchments, some of the common challenges identified in the WRSAs include data sharing, frameworks for collaboration and balancing different values for water - economic, social and cultural. More information on the WRSAs is available at bhp.com/sustainability/environment/water/shared-waterchallenges/what-is-wrsa. We also partner with others to advance the thinking in our priority areas of action. During FY2022 and FY2023, we collaborated with the University of Notre Dame to develop a framework for corporations and policymakers to consider the human right to water to support social equity and reduce corporate risk. The draft was presented at the United Nations 2023 Water Conference and will now be expanded to consider broader environmental rights.\n\nWe report on water metrics at bhp.com/water and in the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2023 available at bhp.com/sustainability, in line with the ICMM's Water Reporting, Good Practice Guide (2 nd Ed) (ICMM guidance) and the Minerals Council of Australia's Water Accounting Framework (WAF). These reporting frameworks are generally aligned with the reporting requirements of the GRI Standards, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the CEO Water Mandate 1 . Detailed information on water accounting and reporting of metrics required by the ICMM guidance is available at bhp.com/water.\n\nWater data and accounting relies on a variety of data sources, including from water modelling, direct measurement and estimation techniques based on available known methodologies (e.g. estimation of evaporation from water storages). In line with our commitment to continuous improvement of our water accounts and data, we continue to review our assumptions for accounting for water metrics and refine our methodology in water models and water balances, recognising that water modelling and balances contain a degree of uncertainty. Water models and measurement techniques will continue to evolve and our understanding and knowledge will grow over time. Our focus in FY2024 will be a review and refinement of our water accounts and model at our Nickel West asset.\n\nWe continue to seek opportunities to source our water from lower grade sources (e.g. seawater) rather than use high quality (as defined in ICMM Guidance and the WAF) water resources from the catchments where we operate. In FY2023, seawater continued to be our largest source of water withdrawal; groundwater (a mixture of high and low-quality water) remained our most significant non-seawater source and the amount withdrawn was similar to FY2022. The magnitude of our global water withdrawal, discharge and consumption data changed during FY2023 following the divestment of our Petroleum and BMC assets in late FY2022. Detailed data is available at bhp.com/water. The definitions of water quality types are available in section 2.4.2 of ICMM Guidance. In FY2023, we continued to use the data obtained from our water accounting to identify and assess water efficiency and treatment opportunities within our operated assets.\n\nWe committed in our Water Stewardship Position Statement to developing context-based water targets (CBWTs). In FY2023, we released our first suite of CBWTs that will apply until 2030. These targets were informed by BHP's view of water-related risks in the relevant catchment and by the shared water challenges identified in the WRSAs. The CBWTs aim to improve our internal BHP water management and contribute to collective benefit and shared\n\n- 1 The CEO Water Mandate is a UN Global Compact initiative that mobilises business leaders on water, sanitation, and the Sustainable Development Goals. Companies that endorse the CEO Water Mandate commit to continuous progress against six core elements of their water stewardship practice and, in so doing, better understand and manage their own water risks. The six core areas are: Direct Operations, Supply Chain & Watershed Management, Collective Action, Public Policy and Community Engagement and Transparency. BHP is an active signatory to the Mandate.\n\napproaches to water management in the regions where we operate. They also support BHP's 2030 Healthy environment goal and are expected to contribute to the protection or restoration of water-dependent ecosystems in the vicinity of our operated assets. The CBWTs are underpinned by a series of milestones (for more information refer to bhp.com/sustainability/environment/water/ shared-water-challenges). We intend to report on our progress against these milestones and targets from the FY2024 annual reporting period onwards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our approach to water stewardship, progress against our Water Stewardship Strategy, water performance in FY2023 and case studies on activities we are undertaking to progress towards meeting our water stewardship vision refer to bhp.com/water\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nWe have a Group-level biodiversity strategy that outlines our purpose and strategic priorities, and which is designed to inform operational decision-making across the full life cycle of mining operations at our operated assets. The Group-level strategy provides a clear direction that enables alignment of asset-level biodiversity and land objectives and supports delivery of the 2030 Healthy environment goal. The focus areas in the biodiversity strategy are valuing natural capital, innovation and collaboration, and nature-related disclosures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our 2030 goals refer to OFR 6.4 and for information on our biodiversity strategy refer to bhp.com/biodiversity\n\nOur operated assets are required to have plans and processes that capture local biodiversity, land risks and regulatory requirements and detail how to prevent or minimise any actual or potential impacts.\n\nIn May 2023, we published the Natural Capital Accounting for the Mining Sector - Beenup Pilot Case Study, which was based on BHP's former mineral sands site located in Western Australia. The site was closed in 1999 and rehabilitation and restoration of the site was completed over the period from 2000 to 2015. The objective of the case study was to pilot how natural capital might be valued in the mining context, to determine the data requirements to build a set of natural capital accounts (NCAs) and to evaluate the use of natural capital accounting as a tool to track progress on contributing to nature-positive outcomes aligned with our 2030 Healthy environment goal. The Beenup pilot case study is intended to be used as a guide for future studies and a basis of learning and improvement to contribute to development of a consistent and meaningful approach to natural capital accounting in the mining sector. Insights from the Beenup case study are being piloted at an operational site in Minerals Australia and are intended to assist us as we progress towards all of our operated assets having NCAs in line with one of the key metrics for our 2030 Healthy environment goal.\n\nBiodiversity initiatives supported through social investment continued through FY2023. Our voluntary social investment projects were focused in three areas:\n\n- -  Thought leadership - testing of natural capital accounting principles through the Natural Capital Accounting for the Mining Sector - Beenup Site Pilot Case Study\n- -  On ground action - monitoring and evaluation and the use of environmental DNA to develop indices of ecosystem health\n- -  Environmental resilience - through support for research on coral reef restoration to build resilience on coral reefs, and the application of Conservation International's seascapes framework to build resilience in coastal communities, which is currently being piloted in the Lau Region, Fiji\n\nIn FY2023, BHP participated in a pilot of the TNFD beta framework, coordinated by the ICMM, as part of the market consultation and testing phase of the draft disclosure framework.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our approach to biodiversity and land management and current performance refer to bhp.com/biodiversity",

Our emission of nitrous oxides, particulates and sulphur dioxide are considered non-material in comparison to global emissions as determined by the GRI materiality assessment process. We have extensive particulate monitoring and management programs at some of our operated assets. We report air emissions (such as particulates and nitrous oxides) as part of the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2023, available at bhp.com/ sustainability, and discuss our approach and management to these on our environment webpage at bhp.com/environment.\n\n## Legal cases - Environment\n\nWe are facing ongoing legal cases involving environmental matters. Examples are: Lagunillas (Cerro Colorado) and Monturaqui (Escondida), as described below.\n\n## Lagunillas (Cerro Colorado)\n\nIn 2021, an individual filed an environmental damage claim against Cerro Colorado (CMCC) before the Chilean Environmental Court, alleging CMCC's water extraction from the Lagunillas aquifer had damaged the aquifer, as well as a nearby lagoon and wetlands. The substantive case was heard in FY2022 and an agreement was reached between the two parties to seek to settle the claim. The settlement proposal was submitted to the Environmental Court for approval, which decided it would not rule on the proposal but would instead issue a ruling on the merits of the case. In May 2023, the Court indicated that the Presiding Judge had submitted a draft ruling on the case's underlying merits for the other judges to review. In parallel, the Antofagasta Court of Appeals intervened and granted an appeal filed by CMCC seeking to reverse an earlier decision by the Environmental Court that denied the parties the opportunity to be heard in relation to the settlement proposal's adequacy. The Court of Appeals ordered the Environmental Court to schedule a special hearing to assess the adequacy of the environmental measures included in the settlement proposal and to decide whether to approve or reject the proposal.\n\n## Monturaqui (Escondida)\n\nIn March 2022, the Chilean Environmental Regulator (SMA) sanctioned Escondida, concluding it had breached its environmental permit causing irreparable environmental damage due to its water extraction from the Monturaqui aquifer. Escondida's infraction was classified as 'very serious' and the SMA imposed a fine of ~US$ 8.3 million. Escondida filed a reconsideration motion before the same regulator, which was rejected in January 2023. In February 2023, Escondida filed a further appeal before the First Environmental Court seeking to annul the SMA decision. The appeal is pending.\n\nShortly after the March 2022 SMA decision, an environmental damage claim was filed in the Environment Court by the Chilean Attorney General's Office against Escondida (and two other operators), in which it was alleged that the defendants' extraction of water from the Monturaqui aquifer has caused environmental damage. In March 2022, the Peine Indigenous Community filed a claim against Escondida based on the same facts as the SMA sanction. Both the Chilean Attorney General's Office and the Peine claims have been consolidated into a single case. In May 2023, the three defendants submitted a joint settlement proposal to the claimants. The substantive case was heard from 24 July to 28 July 2023. At the hearing, the Court ordered a site visit to take place during August 2023, following which the Court will schedule a hearing to enable the parties to deliver closing arguments.\n\n## 6.14 Community\n\nThe core business activities and supplementary social, economic and environmental initiatives of BHP can significantly contribute to improved outcomes for the communities where we operate and in return secure sustained support for our operations. We recognise the continuously evolving nature of society, communities and our business requires us to maintain a dual approach to community relations, where we acknowledge and address immediate risks, impacts and opportunities to the communities where we operate, while having an agile long-term strategy that enables broader shifts in the ways we approach community engagement and investment in response to community values and expectations. In FY2023, we progressed the management of short-term risks, impacts and opportunities as well as the development of a long-term strategic approach.\n\n## Community understanding\n\nWe apply the same approach to community engagement and research across all our operated assets and exploration regions globally. This includes:\n\n- -  Community perception surveys - snapshots of the communities where we operate and key opinion leaders' perspectives on their community priorities and of sector and BHP performance, completed every two years. The last surveys were completed in late FY2022\n- -  Community baseline studies - desktop assessments that provide quantitative and qualitative data on social, cultural, economic and political characteristics of the communities where we operate. These were completed in FY2023\n- -  Community impact and opportunity assessments - analysis of the surveys and baseline studies against asset plans to identify and prioritise actual and potential community risks, impacts and opportunities. The assessments utilise our Risk Framework to support integration into the risk profile for our operated assets and functions. These commenced in FY2023 and are expected to be completed in FY2024\n- -  Community engagement and social investment indicators - data collected related to community engagements (e.g. number of community concerns and use of the operational grievance mechanisms) and social investment partnerships (e.g. outcome indicators of a particular project) that provide insights to the communities' relationships with us\n\nIn FY2023, we generally observed that communities continued to value the economic and other opportunities associated with BHP's operations, although they also continued to hold strong interests about the impacts of mining. Primarily these relate to environmental performance, economic resilience and some of the social and cultural impacts mining can have. Many communities have provided feedback that engagement should be more purposeful and occur early enough in the planning process to allow community feedback to be practically taken into consideration, with solutions designed in partnership.\n\nSocial investment is positively received as a tool to contribute value. However, it is not seen by many communities as an offset for other impacts the community may experience or perceive from our activities. Furthermore, social investment is seen as marginal relative to the upside opportunities realised through increases in procurement and employment. At a regional and local level, we know each community has a diverse range of interests across infrastructure, economic opportunities, healthcare, environment and sociocultural values. The unique nature of each community's priorities requires flexibility in the approach to engagement and investment taken by our operated assets.\n\nThis feedback has informed the strategy for our goal under the thriving, empowered communities pillar of our social value framework, which includes the co-design of plans within each community as a key metric. We are working to develop Group-level principles that will provide guidance on co-design leading practice, while each operated asset will have the ability to engage in a manner that is preferred by the local community and address the highest priority focus areas for that community through business activities, advocacy and social investment.\n\n## Community events, complaints and grievances\n\nIn FY2023, there were 154 community concerns and complaints received globally across our operated assets through our local complaints and grievance mechanisms (zero of which were classified as grievances). 1,2 This represents a total 1 per cent decrease from FY2022 figures.\n\nThe map opposite shows stakeholder concerns reflecting complaints received through our local grievance mechanisms and other sources, such as community perception surveys.\n\n## FY2023 progress and initiatives\n\nIn response to the lessons learned from prior community engagement and due diligence, in FY2023 we progressed:\n\n- -  design and testing of a stakeholder management system that enables us to maintain improved records of community engagements and our commitments, as well as an improved external facing complaints and grievance portal to improve accessibility for community members to provide direct feedback to us. We intend to launch these systems in FY2024\n- -  updates to our internal standards, designed to provide improved guidance for community engagement and social investment leading practice as well as enhance integration with our existing business processes, such as asset planning and risk assessments. Embedment of the revised standards is planned to commence in FY2024",

This ambition is underpinned by BHP's social value framework and our equitable change and transitions principles. We recognise the importance of bringing a positive contribution to local communities, including our contribution to creating long-term prosperity and resilience as the Upper Hunter region enters a transitional period.\n\nAn important part of Pathway to 2030 is to seek the relevant approvals to continue mining past the existing end of CY2026 consent expiry. This is intended to provide the time to work with our people and the local community on an equitable change and transition approach and the detailed plan for mine closure. Work continues on the modification application, which is intended to be submitted in the second half of 2023.\n\nAs part of our Pathway to 2030 commitment, BHP has engaged extensively with partners and stakeholders following the decision to cease mining at NSWEC. Dialogue has included detailed information sessions with our employees, contractors and suppliers, the community (including members of local communities, local Business Chambers, Indigenous partners and industry representatives) and multiple levels of government. Over the coming period, we intend to continue to work together with our people and the community to progress the Pathway to 2030 engagement program with partners and stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on our approach to community is available at bhp.com/communities\n\n- 1 An event or community complaint relating to an adverse impact/event that has escalated to the point where a third-party intervention or adjudication is required to resolve it.\n- 2 Data excludes OZ Minerals.\n\n## 6.15  Indigenous peoples\n\nIndigenous peoples are important partners for BHP. Around the world, BHP operates on or close to the traditional lands of Indigenous peoples and we have a deep respect for their distinct cultures, rights, perspectives and aspirations. BHP is committed to working collaboratively with Indigenous peoples to develop long-term partnerships based on trust and mutual benefit. It is through this commitment that we aim to support reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and contribute to improved social, economic and environmental outcomes.\n\nFirst adopted in FY2015, our Global Indigenous Peoples Framework was reviewed in FY2022 to bring it into greater alignment with BHP's purpose and social value framework, and to strengthen our consideration of the collective rights and perspectives of Indigenous peoples in a changing global context. Our revised global Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement (IPPS), released in FY2023 is the product of extensive consultation internally with BHP leaders and employees and externally with Indigenous peoples and organisations, leading external experts, non-government organisations and investors. Our IPPS outlines a global approach to engaging and partnering with Indigenous peoples including our approach to free, prior and informed consent (FPIC). A global Indigenous Engagement team coordinates our approach and standards for BHP's engagement with Indigenous peoples across our operated assets and functions within each region and globally across BHP. Regionally, Indigenous Peoples Plans are being co-designed with Indigenous peoples to outline how we will engage with Indigenous communities and partners in accordance with our IPPS and the priority topics on which we intend to focus our engagement in each country or region where we operate.\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of a diverse workforce that understands the lived experiences of and cultural nuances and protocols that exist within Indigenous societies. Dedicated Indigenous Engagement teams work at both the local and global level, and are responsible for managing BHP's policies, relationships and agreements with Indigenous peoples. The Indigenous Engagement teams work across the organisation with our leadership to maintain a high level of cultural competence, including supporting BHP to follow our processes for seeking FPIC, assessing and mitigating adverse impacts to Indigenous peoples' collective rights, cultural heritage management, procurement from Indigenous businesses, Indigenous employment and our efforts to contribute to the economic and social development of Indigenous communities where we operate.",

In FY2023, we completed a milestone toward this goal with the release of a revised Global Indigenous Peoples Strategy (now described as our Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement (IPPS)). We also made progress against a milestone of increasing formal Indigenous voice mechanisms in decisionmaking, through the global consultations in FY2023 for the new IPPS and consultations for the regional Indigenous Peoples Plans in Australia and Canada respectively, as well as through our ongoing engagement mechanisms with Indigenous peoples and communities on whose traditional lands we operate our assets. We initiated a global program of research with Indigenous partners and organisations in FY2023, to support our aim of reporting on the health of our relationships with Indigenous partners in FY2024.\n\nWe also revised one of the key metrics for our 2030 Indigenous partnerships goal in FY2023. The original metric for FY2024, published in June 2022, stated that we would 'co-create plans which define priorities and are designed to deliver mutually beneficial outcomes'. We updated this metric to be: 'Indigenous voices and perspectives are incorporated into co-designed priorities in each region'. This update clarifies the deliverable and aligns with our new IPPS commitments to incorporate Indigenous voices and perspectives in our work.\n\nWe are making progress against our social value scorecard metrics for Indigenous workforce participation and Indigenous procurement. Indigenous employment teams developed and implemented Indigenous workforce initiatives in FY2023 to provide pathways to employment, support our Indigenous workforce, build a more culturally capable non-Indigenous workforce and meet our employment metrics. In Australia, our Indigenous employment was at 8.6 per cent in FY2023 1 and our target is to reach 9.7 per cent by FY2027. In Chile, our Indigenous employment was at 9.7 per cent in FY2023 1 and our target is to reach 10 per cent by FY2025. In Canada, our Indigenous employment was at 7.7 per cent in FY2023 1 and our target is to reach 20 per cent by FY2026.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about Indigenous employment refer to OFR 6.6\n\nIn FY2023, we expanded our global program to improve engagement with Indigenous businesses across all our operating locations with the goal of\n\nincreasing direct procurement spend to over US$400 million by FY2025. Compared to FY2022, our direct global spend with Indigenous businesses increased by 122 per cent to $US332.6 million in FY2023 and the number of Indigenous vendors engaged rose by 50 per cent to 219. Through this program, we have seen continued growth in spend with Indigenous businesses across our Australian assets with FY2023 direct spend of US$267.5 million. Jansen Stage 1 in Canada delivered direct spend of US$65 million in FY2023.\n\n## Minerals Australia\n\nIn FY2023, following a review of the status of all Native Title and cultural heritage agreements and negotiations with Indigenous peoples across Minerals Australia, BHP established an agreement-making program that is scheduled to be progressed over the next three to five years. This program seeks to modernise agreement making across Minerals Australia, enhance good practice and ensure greater alignment with our revised IPPS, including our approach to FPIC.\n\nMinerals Australia released its sixth Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in June 2023 for the period to the end of FY2027 to contribute towards reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and to take forward BHP's global IPPS in Australia. We developed the Elevate RAP in partnership with Traditional Owner groups, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Islander employees, businesses, organisations, communities and peak bodies across Australia.\n\nIn a planned ongoing initiative, BHP hosted its inaugural Traditional Owner Forum in November 2022, which brought together senior leaders from Traditional Owner groups across Australia, BHP leadership and relevant team members. The forum was called for by Traditional Owners, who requested the opportunity for two-way dialogue with BHP senior leaders.\n\nIn Minerals Australia, a new Cultural Heritage Technical Standard was developed in FY2023 that goes beyond existing legislative frameworks and requires all our Australian-based operated assets to meet the public targets defined in the Elevate RAP. This new standard puts good faith negotiation with Indigenous people at the centre of the process through cultural heritage agreement-making and the delivery of Cultural Heritage Management Plans. In FY2023, four new Heritage Agreements and 14\n\n- 1 Point in time data as at 30 June 2023.\n\n## BHP's Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement\n\nBHP's ambition is to create long-term relationships with Indigenous peoples based on trust and mutual benefit. We aim to support reconciliation with Indigenous peoples' and contribute to improved social, economic and environmental outcomes. Through this Policy Statement we will be guided by the aims of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples' as articulated in the Policy Statement's Principles, which are summarised below.\n\n## Incorporate Indigenous voices, values, knowledge and perspectives.\n\nBHP will seek out Indigenous voices, values, knowledge and perspectives in the way we work. We will connect with Indigenous peoples to better appreciate the historical, legal, social, environmental, cultural and political landscape where we operate or seek to operate, and how to better manage the environment we share.\n\n## Principles\n\n## Seek to obtain the free, prior and informed consent of potentially affected Indigenous peoples'\n\nBHP's default position will be that a proposed new operation or capital project should not proceed without consent; and where consent has not been provided, BHP will escalate senior management involvement in the process to determine if the new operation or capital project will proceed.\n\n## Respect Indigenous peoples' cultural and intellectual property and data sovereignty\n\nBHP acknowledges the value and ownership of information related to Indigenous cultural heritage and the rights to information regarding Indigenous peoples' narratives, traditions and lore.\n\n## Strengthen engagement with Indigenous peoples through dialogue and co-design\n\nBHP will engage early and support meaningful dialogue with Indigenous peoples by sharing knowledge and information both ways and ensure our processes allow for active participation in appropriate aspects of the design, implementation and monitoring of plans that impact Indigenous peoples.",

These Cultural Heritage Management Plans mainly covered existing operations at WAIO and were an outcome of our commitment to modernise existing government approvals through further consultation. In line with our social value agenda, new heritage protection areas were agreed through the Cultural Heritage Management Plans for significant heritage values as identified by Traditional Owners.\n\n## Minerals Americas\n\nWe have continued to work towards building partnerships with Indigenous peoples in the Americas regions where we operate or plan to operate.\n\nWe continue to strengthen our cultural heritage practices for our operated assets in Minerals Americas through the development of a management system framework that considers tangible and intangible cultural heritage across the life cycle of our projects. We have established a team specialising in cultural heritage both at regional and operational levels. This work has raised the visibility of cultural heritage in Minerals Americas and further embedded consideration of potential impacts to cultural heritage in the processes and planning of BHP's activities.\n\n## Chile\n\nAt Escondida, we continued to advance the implementation of the settlement concerning the environmental sustainability of the Salar de Punta Negra, signed at the end of FY2021 between Escondida, the Chilean Attorney General's Office, the Peine Atacame\u00f1a Indigenous community and the Council of Atacame\u00f1a Peoples. We are progressing the first of three phases of the agreement, which focuses on diagnosing the environmental condition of the Salar de Punta Negra after groundwater extraction for operational purposes ceased in 2019. We intend to undertake eight different studies to complete the diagnosis. Along with the studies, this phase also included the development of a governance framework to implement the settlement with the participation of Escondida, the Chilean Attorney General's Office, the Peine Atacame\u00f1a and the Council of Atacame\u00f1a Peoples, together with a Promotion and Enhancement Plan.\n\nOur Cerro Colorado operation is preparing for closure at the end of CY2023 due to the expiration of its permits to operate. We intend to continue developing technical studies to inform potential mine life extension in the future as well as technical studies for final closure if life extension is not feasible. We are engaging with impacted Indigenous peoples to include their voices during study phases for both scenarios.\n\nWe continue to work on implementing our agreements with Indigenous peoples, including fulfilling our commitments and investing in social projects. We completed improvements to the community town hall and of culturally significant walls in the Parca locality. We are also investing in an agricultural development program that seeks to promote and improve crop production in local Indigenous communities, delivering new knowledge and tools to the farmers of Parca, Iquiuca, Mami\u00f1a and Quipisca.\n\nIn Mami\u00f1a, Macaya and Iquiuca, we are supporting innovative solutions for Indigenous communities to adapt to potential climate-related impacts through the Kuskalla project (meaning 'together' in Quechua language), which is optimising the management of energy, water and organic waste using solar panels, water models and a biodigester.\n\n## Canada\n\nThere are six primary First Nations communities in the vicinity of our Jansen Potash Project. BHP has entered into Opportunity Agreements with all six First Nations to formalise our relationships in a range of areas, including providing local employment and business opportunities and building the skills and capabilities of local residents. During FY2023, progress was made towards implementation of these agreements, including through key projects, such as the opening of the Muskowekwan Family Healing and Wellness Centre, to support addressing the systemic impacts of historical trauma faced by First Nations peoples.\n\nBHP is developing an Indigenous Partnership Plan to operationalise our global IPPS and advance our existing and new relationships with Indigenous peoples in Canada. We are developing the plan through a co-design process with the relevant Indigenous peoples. We commenced consultations on the Indigenous Partnerships Plan with the six First Nations communities that are directly impacted by our Jansen\n\nPotash Project before expanding to regional and national Indigenous organisations. We held an open community forum in March 2023 with the six First Nations partners to our Jansen Potash Project, as well as surrounding regional First Nations, Metis groups, educational institutions and other First Nation economic development groups. We expect to complete the Indigenous Partnership Plan in FY2024.\n\n## Resolution Copper\n\nResolution Copper Mining is owned by Rio Tinto (55 per cent) and BHP (45 per cent) and managed by Rio Tinto. We acknowledge the Resolution Copper project area includes areas of cultural significance for Native American Tribes and their members. Development of the project continues to be studied and remains subject to regulatory reviews by federal, state and local governments. Resolution Copper Mining continues to cooperatively engage in these regulatory processes and has publicly stated its commitment to deepening ongoing engagement with Native American Tribes and other stakeholders to understand and seek to mitigate potential negative impacts, while also collaborating to create shared value opportunities. We are monitoring and support Resolution Copper Mining's engagement processes.\n\n## 6.16  Tailings storage facilities\n\nA primary focus is on managing the safety and integrity of our tailings storage facilities (TSFs) across our operated and closed assets, to protect people, the environment and communities where we operate.\n\nTSFs are dynamic structures that accommodate the left-over materials from the processing of mined ore. A failure event has the potential to impact people, communities, the environment and the economy. In 2015, the tragic failure of the Fund\u00e3o TSF at Samarco, a non-operated joint venture (NOJV) owned 50 per cent by BHP, led to increased focus on the management of our TSFs. We remain committed to strengthened tailings management to deliver operations that are safer for the environment and community. We will continue to work with stakeholders, share our progress and apply learnings to realise positive outcomes at BHP and across the industry.\n\nIn FY2023, we continued works aimed at reducing our TSF risk, for example:\n\n- -  At the WAIO Boodarie TSF, we progressed the TSF to a state of safe closure, as defined by the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM), when we completed the embankment reshaping and capping of tailings.\n- -  The construction of buttresses commenced at Olympic Dam's TSF5, BMA's Peak Downs Old Tailings Dam TSF and legacy asset's Solitude TSF, to further reduce the low likelihood of a failure event.\n- -  We made progress at our operated and closed assets to align with the GISTM.\n\nBHP added four operated TSFs to our portfolio as a result of the OZ Minerals acquisition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information about the Fund\u00e3o TSF failure at Samarco and our progress with the response refer to OFR 7\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur short-term strategy focuses on improvement of key risk indicator (KRI) performance, including options studies to reduce and mitigate potential downstream impacts, particularly to those who could be at risk in the event of a TSF failure. We are also committed to aligning with tailings industry standards, including the GISTM and Towards Sustainable Mining.\n\nOur medium- and long-term strategies focus on complex risk reduction projects and the identification and use of improved tailings management and storage solutions. Where feasible, we replace traditional above ground TSFs with in-pit TSFs and we are collaborating with others to progress tailings technology. For example, we have partnered with Rio Tinto to develop technology that may significantly increase water recovery from mine tailings. In addition, while our NOJVs are independently controlled and have their own operating and management standards, we encourage NOJVs to consider alternative tailings solutions as an option in asset planning where appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## 6  Sustainability\n\n## Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management\n\nWe are committed to achieving alignment with the GISTM for all operated TSFs. The Accountable Executive model is embedded in our tailings management processes and four Accountable Executives, who oversee TSF operations (three) and governance (one) in accordance with defined terms of reference, are direct reports of the BHP Chief Executive Officer and accountable to the Board's Sustainability Committee.\n\nAs of August 2023, all extreme and very high consequence classification operated TSFs 1 align with the GISTM, 2 and a public disclosure document for these TSFs is published on our website.\n\n## Governance and risk management\n\nOur Tailings Storage Facility Policy Statement was updated in FY2023 and is available at bhp.com/sustainability/tailings-storage-facilities.\n\nIt outlines our commitment to the safe management of TSFs, governance and risk management, transparency, emergency preparedness, response and recovery in the event of a failure. We proactively engage with partners and stakeholders on emergency preparedness and response in relation to TSF risk.\n\nOngoing governance activities identify risk reduction and improvement opportunities and allow effective management of TSF failure risk. KRIs are set by management and help to monitor performance of our TSFs against our risk appetite in dam integrity and design, overtopping/ flood management and emergency response planning. KRIs are routinely reported to the Sustainability Committee and the Risk and Audit Committee.\n\nWe also use the 'three lines model' for risk governance. We mandate three key first-line roles across our operated assets: Dam Owner, Responsible Tailings Facility Engineer and Engineer of Record. Annual performance reviews, dam safety reviews, independent tailings review boards and project-specific independent peer reviews provide independent and objective assurance through the second line. Third-line assurance of the overall governance and control framework is provided through internal audits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on BHP's approach to risk management including KRIs refer to OFR 8\n\n## Transparency and disclosure\n\nWe support detailed, transparent and integrated disclosure regarding TSF management, including updating our Church of England Disclosure 3 and publishing a public disclosure document for our priority TSFs 4 , in alignment with the GISTM. Our work continues with industry partners to support the development of disclosure standards and improvements for tailings storage management across the mining industry, including through the ICMM Tailings Working Group and our support of the Investor Mining and Tailings Safety Initiative.\n\nActively engaging with our affected partners and stakeholders regarding our TSFs is also a priority. For example, in FY2023, following consultation with three Indigenous groups, the design and build methodology of the Olympic Dam TSF buttress was changed to preserve certain identified cultural heritage sites.\n\n## Operated and non-operated tailings portfolio\n\nThe consequence classifications described in this Report align to the GISTM for priority TSFs and the Canadian Dam Association (CDA) classification system for all other TSFs. The TSF consequence classification reflects the modelled consequences of a failure and it is not a reflection of the current physical stability of the TSF. The TSF consequence classification can also change over time, for example, following the construction of an embankment raise.\n\n- 1 Excludes any OZ Minerals TSFs while their GISTM consequence classifications are evaluated.\n- 2 Based on BHP's assessment of the requirements for GISTM conformance, which utilises the ICMM Conformance Protocols for GISTM. We keep this guidance under review.\n- 3 In April 2019, the Church of England Pensions Board and the Council on Ethics Swedish National Pension Funds wrote to approximately 700 mining firms to request specific disclosures of their TSFs. Our updated disclosure is included in our ESG Standards and Databook available at bhp.com/sustainability.\n- 4 Prioritised BHP operated and closed asset TSFs are those classified as extreme or very high by the GISTM consequence classification guidance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 For the purposes of this chart, GISTM classifications have been used for extreme and very high consequence classification TSFs and the CDA classification system for all other TSFs.\n- 2 We keep TSF classifications under review. As we transition the classification of all TSFs to the GISTM, changes in consequence classifications may occur due to differences in the GISTM and CDA consequence classification matrices.\n- 3 SP1/2 and SP3 TSF at New South Wales Energy Coal are inactive TSFs, which have been assessed to have no credible failure modes and are therefore shown as not having a CDA classification.\n- 4 Boodarie TSF is classified as being in a 'state of safe closure', as defined by the GISTM.\n\n## Case study - BHP and Rio Tinto collaboration\n\nA collaboration agreement between BHP and Rio Tinto aims to accelerate the development of technology that could significantly increase water recovery from mine tailings, in turn reducing the TSF environmental footprint and moisture content. In addition, the water recovered from tailings by filtration could be re-used in processing facilities, reducing overall water consumption. It also creates opportunities to productively re-use tailings, for example as raw material for glass, construction or agriculture industries.\n\nBHP Chief Technical Officer, Laura Tyler, said: 'The world will need more critical minerals in the decades to come to support economic development and decarbonisation pathways. It is important that we continue to work together across the global mining sector to raise standards and make sure our operations are as safe and sustainable as they can be. Responsible management of tailings and improved water use is a big part of that.'\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, there were 76 TSFs 5 at our operated and closed assets, including four TSFs acquired from OZ Minerals in FY2023, and:\n\n- -  58 are inactive, 6 most are associated with our North American legacy assets portfolio\n- -  two are classified as extreme and another 20 are classified as very high under the GISTM\n\nThere are 10 TSFs at our NOJVs, which are all located in the Americas. Three are active TSFs - one is located at Antamina in Peru and two are located at Samarco in Brazil. In addition, there are seven inactive TSFs - two upstream facilities at Samarco in Brazil (with decommissioning activities underway), 7 four facilities at Resolution Copper in the United States and one facility at Bullmoose in Canada.\n\n- 5 The number of TSFs is based on the definition in the GISTM. We keep this definition under review.\n- 6 'Inactive' includes TSFs in construction, not in operational use, under reclamation, reclaimed, closed and/or in post-closure care and maintenance.\n- 7 Samarco's Germano TSFs have commenced decommissioning activities following the February 2019 ruling by the Brazilian Government regarding upstream TSFs.",

This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the subject matter, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Our approach to conducting the review\n\nWe conducted our assurance procedures in accordance with the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board's International Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ('ISAE 3000') and the Standard for Assurance on Greenhouse Gas Statements ('ISAE 3410') and the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with BHP on 6 February 2023.\n\nFor the limited assurance engagement, these standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to express a conclusion on whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Subject Matter is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report.\n\nFor the reasonable assurance engagement, these standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Subject Matter is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report.\n\nThe nature, timing and extent of the assurance procedures selected depend on our judgement, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Description of assurance procedures performed\n\nThe Limited Assurance procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included, but were not limited to:\n\n- -  Interviewing select corporate and site personnel to understand the reporting process at group, business, asset, and site level, including management's processes to identify BHP's material issues\n- -  Reviewing BHP policies and management standards to determine alignment with the ICMM's 10 Sustainable Development principles and position statements\n- -  Checking the BHP Annual Report 2023 to understand how BHP's identified material issues, risks and opportunities are reflected within the qualitative disclosures\n- -  Evaluating whether the information disclosed in the Limited Assurance Subject Matter is consistent with our understanding of sustainability management and performance at BHP\n\n-  Evaluating the suitability of the Criteria and that the Criteria\n\nhave been applied appropriately to the Subject Matter\n\n- -  Conducting virtual and in-person site procedures at BHP locations on a sample basis, based on our professional judgement, to evidence site level data collection and reporting to Group as well as to identify completeness of the sustainability performance data and statements included within the Subject Matter\n\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited\n\nLiability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -  Undertaking analytical procedures of the quantitative disclosures in the Subject Matter\n- -  Reviewing data, information or explanation about the sustainability performance data and statements included within the Subject Matter\n- -  Reviewing other information within the BHP Annual Report 2023 for consistency and alignment to other quantitative and qualitative information within the Subject Matter\n- -  On a sample basis, based on our professional judgement, re-performing calculations to check accuracy of claims within the Subject Matter\n- -  On a sample basis, based on our professional judgement, agreeing qualitative and quantitative statements within the Subject Matter and underlying data to source information to assess completeness of claims, including process conversations, review of invoices, incident reports, meter calibration records, and meter data.\n- -  Checking the water balance for each operated asset inclusive of understanding the methodologies used to consider consistency with the Criteria, and reviewing meter and calibration records on a sample basis, based on our professional judgement.\n\nAdditional reasonable assurance procedures we performed were based on professional judgement and included, but were not limited to:\n\n- -  For our reasonable assurance of Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, on a sample basis, based on our professional judgement, agreeing underlying data to source information to assess completeness of performance data, which included invoices, meter calibration records and meter data.\n\nWe believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable and limited assurance conclusions.\n\n## Inherent limitations\n\nWhile we considered the effectiveness of management's internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.\n\nThe greenhouse gas (GHG) emission quantification process is subject to scientific uncertainty, which arises because of incomplete scientific knowledge about the measurement of GHGs. Additionally, GHG procedures are subject to estimation and measurement uncertainty resulting from the measurement and calculation processes used to quantify GHG emissions within the bounds of existing scientific knowledge.\n\n## Additional inherent limitations - limited assurance scope\n\nProcedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance.\n\n## Additional inherent limitations -\n\n## reasonable assurance scope\n\nWhile our procedures performed for our reasonable assurance engagement are of a higher level of assurance, due to the use of sampling techniques, it is not a guarantee that it will always detect material misstatements.\n\n## Other matters\n\nWe have not performed assurance procedures in respect of any information relating to prior reporting periods, including those presented in the Limited and Reasonable Assurance Subject Matter. Our report does not extend to any disclosures or assertions made by BHP relating to future performance plans and/or strategies disclosed in the BHP Annual Report 2023, the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2023, and supporting disclosures online.\n\n## Use of our assurance report\n\nWe disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this assurance report to any persons other than management and the directors of BHP, or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared. Our review included web-based information that was available via web links as of the date of this statement. We provide no assurance over changes to the content of this web-based information after the date of this assurance report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nErnst & Young Melbourne, Australia 22 August 2023\n\nMathew Nelson Partner",

Tragically, 19 people died as a result of the failure. The communities of Bento Rodrigues, Paracatu de Baixo and Gesteira were flooded and other communities and the environment downstream in the Rio Doce basin were also affected.\n\nSamarco restarted its operations at a reduced production level in December 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on Samarco's operations refer to OFR 5.3\n\n## Our response and support for Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova\n\nBHP Brasil has been and remains fully committed to supporting the extensive ongoing remediation and compensation efforts of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova in Brasil.\n\nThe Framework Agreement entered into between Samarco, Vale and BHP Brasil and the relevant Brazilian authorities in March 2016 established Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova, a not-for-profit, private foundation that is implementing 42 remediation and compensatory programs. BHP Brasil provides support to Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova, including through representation on the foundation's governance structures.\n\nTo 30 June 2023, BHP Brasil has provided US$2.3 billion to fund Framework Agreement programs when Samarco has been unable to do so.\n\n## Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova\n\n## Compensation and financial assistance\n\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova continues to provide compensation to people impacted by the dam failure.\n\nCompensation and financial assistance of approximately R$14.4 billion (approximately US$2.9 billion) 1 has been paid to support approximately 427,000 people affected by the dam failure up until 30 June 2023. This includes:\n\n- -  Approximately R$9.6 billion (approximately US$1.9 billion) 1 has been paid to approximately 90,000 people under the court-mandated simplified indemnity system (known as the Novel system). The Novel system is designed to provide compensation for informal workers who have had difficulty proving the damages they suffered, such as cart drivers, sand miners, artisanal miners and street vendors.\n- -  Approximately 33,000 people received Emergency Financial Assistance.\n- -  Approximately 39,000 people received general damages (including loss of life, injury, property damage, business impacts, loss of income and moral damages) and more than 290,000 people have been paid a total of approximately R$305.5 million (approximately US$69 million) 1 for temporary water interruption.\n\nUpdates on the progress of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's compensation program are available at fundacaorenova.org/en/repair-data/indemnities-andproductive-resumption.\n\n## Resettlement\n\nA key priority for Renova is the resettlement of the communities of Bento Rodrigues, Paracatu and Gesteira. For Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu, this includes construction of houses and all infrastructure and public services such as roads, power, water and sewer networks, health and services centres and schools. At Gesteira, pursuant to an agreement finalised in May 2023 and ratified by the Courts, families and the public authorities have opted to receive compensation instead of building a new community.\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, approximately 75 per cent of resettlement cases have been completed 2 , either via completion of construction or cash payment for those families who have opted for this option instead of the other resettlement solutions offered by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova.\n\n- 1 USD amount is calculated based on actual transactional (historical) exchange rates related to Renova funding.\n- 2 Resettlement cases completed includes completed construction (families moved in or handover to families in progress) or cash payment solution.\n- 3 For those families who chose not to join the resettlement with their previous community and instead resettled elsewhere.\n\nDuring FY2023, families began moving into their new homes and as at 30 June 2023, there were more than 40 families living in their new homes, both in Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu, as well as other locations. 3 Approximately 10 per cent of the total resettlement cases were in progress as at 30 June 2023, the majority of which are expected to be completed by the end of CY2023.\n\nThe resettlements have involved ongoing engagement and consultation with a large number of stakeholders, including the affected community members, their technical advisers, state prosecutors, municipal leaders, regulators and other interested parties. New towns were designed on land chosen by the communities, to be as close as possible to the previous layout, attending to the wishes and needs of the families and communities while also meeting permitting requirements. Each family receives access to an architect to design their house within size parameters, which is then finalised and built by Renova.\n\nMandated COVID-19 workforce restrictions and suspensions of works on-site, increases to the technical scope for resettlement of the communities and permitting delays have impacted the timeline for completion. Ongoing efforts to accelerate completions while maintaining the safety requirements continued throughout FY2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Updates on the progress of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's resettlement program are available at\n\nfundacaorenova.org/en/repair-data/\n\nresettlement-and-infrastructure\n\n## Other socio-economic programs\n\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova continues to implement a wide range of socio-economic programs in addition to the compensation and resettlement programs. These programs cover health and infrastructure projects in the Rio Doce basin, promotion of economic development in the impacted communities and sewage treatment facilities to improve the water quality in the Rio Doce.\n\nOne of the infrastructure projects is related to the Risoleta Neves Hydroelectric Power Plant (Candonga), which was shut down after the Fund\u00e3o dam failure, and restarted its operations in the state of Minas Gerais in March 2023. By June 2023, all three generating units were successfully resumed and are now interconnected to the national grid, generating 46 megawatts of energy.\n\n## Environmental remediation\n\nSince December 2019, the riverbanks and floodplains have been vegetated, river margins stabilised and in general, water quality and sediment qualities have returned to historic levels. Long-term remediation work is continuing to re-establish agriculture and native vegetation.\n\nA ban on fishing activities along the coast of Esp\u00edrito Santo and a precautionary conservation restriction preventing fishing for native fish species in the Rio Doce in Minas Gerais remain in place. Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova continues to support the recovery of habitats and aquatic ecology and engage with the authorities with the goal of lifting the restrictions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Updates on the progress of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's environmental remediation programs are available at\n\nfundacaorenova.org/en/repair-data/ socio-environmental-repairs\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\nBHP Group Limited, BHP Group (UK) Ltd (formerly BHP Group Plc) and BHP Brasil are involved in legal proceedings relating to the Fund\u00e3o dam failure at Samarco.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on the significant legal proceedings involving BHP refer to Additional information 7",

        "page_content": "## 8  How we manage risk\n\n## Risk management helps us to protect and create value, and is central to achieving our purpose and strategic objectives.\n\nOur Risk Framework has four pillars: risk strategy, risk governance, risk process and risk intelligence.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of OZ Minerals on 2 May 2023, activity is underway to integrate OZ Minerals' operations and functions into our business. In order to maintain operational stability and safety, the OZ Minerals risk framework and associated processes and governance activities will continue to apply to OZ Minerals' operations and functions, until they formally transition to BHP's Risk Framework, which we anticipate will be completed by the end of CY2024.\n\n## Risk strategy\n\n## Risk classification\n\nWe classify all risks to which BHP is exposed using our Group Risk Architecture. This is a tool designed to identify, analyse, monitor and report risk, which provides a platform to understand and manage risks. Similar risks are considered together in groups and categories. This gives the Board and management visibility over the aggregate exposure to risks on a Group-wide basis and supports performance monitoring and reporting against BHP's risk appetite.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nBHP's Risk Appetite Statements, aligned to our Group Risk Architecture, are approved by the Board and are a foundational element of our Risk Framework. They provide guidance to management on the amount and type of risk we seek to take in pursuing our objectives.\n\n## Key risk indicators\n\nKey risk indicators (KRIs) are set by management to help monitor performance against our risk appetite. They also support decisionmaking by providing management with information about financial and non-financial risk exposure at a Group level. Each KRI has a target or optimal level of risk we seek to take, as well as upper and lower limits. Where either limit is exceeded, management will review potential causes to understand if BHP may be taking too little or too much risk and to identify whether further action is required.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nOur risk management approach is underpinned by a risk culture that supports decision-making in accordance with BHP's values, objectives and risk appetite. We use a common foundation across BHP to build the tools and capabilities required to enable us to understand, monitor and manage our risk culture. These include the inclusion of risk-culture assessments as part of our internal audit plan.\n\n## Strategic business decisions\n\nStrategic business decisions and the pursuit of our strategic objectives can inform, create or affect risks to which BHP is exposed. These risks may represent opportunities as well as threats. Our Risk Appetite Statements and KRIs assist in determining whether a proposed course of action is within BHP's risk appetite.\n\nOur focus when managing risks associated with strategic business decisions is to enable the pursuit of high-reward strategies. Therefore, as well as having controls designed to protect BHP from threats, we seek to implement controls to enable and/or enhance opportunities.\n\n## Risk governance\n\n## Three lines model\n\nBHP uses the 'three lines model' to define the role of different teams across the organisation in managing risk. This approach sets clear accountabilities for risk management and provides appropriate 'checks and balances' to support us in protecting and growing value.\n\nThe first line is provided by our frontline staff, operational management and people in functional roles - anyone who makes decisions, deploys resources or contributes to an outcome is responsible for identifying and managing the associated risks.\n\nThe Risk team and other second-line teams are responsible for providing expertise, support, monitoring and challenge on risk-related matters, including by defining Group-wide minimum standards.\n\nThe third line, our Internal Audit team, is responsible for providing independent and objective assurance over the control environment (governance, risk management and internal controls) to the Board and Executive Leadership Team. Additional assurance may also be provided by external providers, such as our External Auditor.\n\nThe Risk team and Internal Audit team were combined in August 2022 to form a Risk, Insurance and Audit sub-function, led by a Chief Risk and Audit Officer. This structure is designed to improve overall effectiveness of both teams, including through alignment of second and third line assurance activities across BHP, while maintaining the independence of our Internal Audit team through appropriate safeguards.\n\n## BHP Board and Committees\n\nThe Board reviews and monitors the effectiveness of the Group's systems of financial and non-financial risk management and internal control. The broad range of skills, experience and knowledge of the Board assists in providing a diverse view on risk management. The Risk and Audit Committee (RAC) and Sustainability Committee assist the Board by reviewing and considering BHP's material risk profile (covering operational, strategic and emerging risks) on a biannual basis.\n\nPerformance against risk appetite is monitored and reported to the RAC, as well as the Sustainability Committee for HSEC matters, supporting the Board to challenge and hold management to account.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on other Board Committee activities that support risk governance at BHP refer to Corporate Governance Statement 5",

        "page_content": "## Risk process\n\nOur Risk Framework requires identification and management of risks (both threats and opportunities) to be embedded in business activities through the following process:\n\n- -  Risk identification - threats and opportunities are identified and each is assigned an owner or accountable individual.\n- -  Risk assessments - risks are assessed using appropriate and internationally recognised techniques to determine their potential impacts and likelihood, prioritise them and inform risk treatment options.\n- -  Risk treatment - controls are implemented to prevent, minimise and/or mitigate threats, and enable and/or enhance opportunities.\n- -  Monitoring and review - risks and controls are reviewed periodically and on an ad hoc basis (including where there are high-potential events or changes in the external environment) to evaluate performance.\n- -  Communication - relevant information is recorded in our enterprise risk management system to support continuous improvement and share risk intelligence across the Group.\n\nOur Risk Framework includes requirements and guidance on the tools and process to manage current and emerging risks.\n\n## Current risks\n\nCurrent risks are risks that could impact BHP today or in the near future and comprise current operational risks (risks that have their origin inside BHP or occur as a result of our activities) and current strategic risks (risks that may enhance or impede the achievement of our strategic objectives).\n\nCurrent risks include material and non-material risks (as defined by our Risk Framework). The materiality of a current risk is determined by estimating the maximum foreseeable loss (MFL) if that risk was to materialise. The MFL is the estimated impact to BHP in a worstcase scenario without regard to probability and assuming all controls, including insurance and hedging contracts, are ineffective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on our risk factors refer to OFR 8.1\n\nOur focus for current risks is to prevent their occurrence or minimise their impact should they occur, but we also consider how to maximise possible benefits that might be associated with strategic risks (as described in the Risk strategy section). Current material risks are required to be evaluated once a year at a minimum to determine whether our exposure to the risk is within our risk appetite.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nEmerging risks are newly developing or changing risks that are highly uncertain and difficult to quantify. They are generally driven by external influences and often cannot be prevented.\n\nBHP maintains a 'watch list' of emerging themes and monitors associated signals to interpret external events and trends, providing an evolving view of the changing external environment and how it might impact our business. We use the watch list and signal monitoring to support the identification and management of emerging risks, as well as to inform and test our corporate strategy.\n\nOnce identified, our focus for emerging risks is on structured monitoring of the external environment, advocacy efforts to reduce the likelihood of the threats manifesting and identifying options to increase our resilience to these threats.\n\n## Risk intelligence\n\nThe Risk team provides the RAC, Sustainability Committee and senior management with insights on risk management across BHP. Risk reports may include trends and aggregate exposure for our most significant risks, performance against risk appetite, updates on the Risk Framework and risk management priorities, an overview of (and material changes in) BHP's material risk profile and updates on emerging risk themes and signals.\n\nWe maintain a risk insights dashboard designed to provide current, datadriven and actionable risk intelligence to our people at all levels of the business to support decision-making. This tool empowers the business to manage risks more effectively, with increased accuracy and transparency.\n\nThe Board, RAC and Sustainability Committee also receive other reports to support the Board to review and monitor the effectiveness of BHP's systems of financial and non-financial risk management. Examples of these include internal audit reports, ethics and investigations reports, compliance reports and the Chief Executive Officer's report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on our risk factors refer to OFR 8.1\n\n## 8.1  Risk factors\n\nOur risk factors are described below and may occur as a result of our activities globally, including in connection with our operated and non-operated assets, third parties engaged by BHP or through our value chain.\n\nThese risks, individually or collectively, could threaten our strategy, business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and reputation. They could also materially and adversely affect the health and safety of our people or members of the public, the environment, the communities where we or our third-party partners operate, or the interests of our partners and stakeholders, which could in each case lead to litigation, regulatory investigation or enforcement action (including class actions or actions arising from contractual, legacy or other liabilities associated with divested assets), or a loss of partner, stakeholder and/or investor confidence. References to 'financial performance' include our financial condition and liquidity, including due to decreased profitability or increased operating costs, capital spend, remediation costs or contingent liabilities. BHP is also exposed to other risks that are not described in this section.\n\nEach risk factor may present opportunities as well as threats. We take certain risks for strategic reward in the pursuit of our strategy and purpose, including to grow our asset portfolio and develop the right capabilities for the future of our business. Some of the potential threats and opportunities associated with each of our risk factors are described below, along with the key controls to manage them. These controls are not exhaustive and many Group-wide controls (such as Our Code of Conduct , Risk Framework, mandatory minimum performance requirements for risk management, health, safety and other matters, dedicated non-operated joint venture teams and our Contractor Management Framework) help to support effective and efficient management of all risks in line with our risk appetite. While we implement preventative and/or mitigating controls designed to reduce the likelihood of a threat from occurring and minimise the impacts if it does, these may not always be effective.",

        "page_content": "## 8  How we manage risk\n\n## Risk factor: Operational events\n\nRisks associated with operational events in connection with our activities globally, resulting in significant adverse impacts on our people, communities, the environment or our business.\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nWe engage in activities that have previously and have the potential to further cause harm to our people and assets, communities, other stakeholders and/or the environment, including serious injuries, illness and fatalities, loss of infrastructure, amenities and livelihood, and damage to sites of cultural significance. An operational event at our operated or non-operated assets or through our value chain could also cause damage or disruptions to our assets and operations, impact our financial performance, result in litigation or class actions and cause long-term damage to our licence to operate and reputation. Potential physical climate-related impacts could increase the likelihood and/or severity of risks associated with operational events. Impacts of operational events may also be amplified if we fail to respond in a way that is consistent with our corporate values, and partner and stakeholder expectations.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Air, land (road and rail) and marine transportation events (such as aircraft crashes or vessel collisions, groundings or hydrocarbon release) that occur while transporting people, supplies or products to exploration, operation or customer locations, which include remote and environmentally sensitive areas in Australia, South America, Asia, the United States, Canada and Sweden.\n- -  Failure of a water or tailings storage facility, such as the tragic failure of the Fund\u00e3o dam at Samarco in 2015 or a failure at one of our other facilities in Australia, Chile, Peru, the United States, Canada or Brazil.\n- -  Unplanned fire events or explosions (on the surface or underground).\n- -  Geotechnical instability events (such as failure of underground excavations, which may be subject to greater risk than surface mines, unexpected large wall instabilities in our open-pit mines, or potential interaction between our mining activities and community infrastructure or natural systems), including at our mines in Australia, Chile, Peru, the United States, Canada or Brazil.\n- -  Critical infrastructure, equipment, or hazardous materials containment failures (the risk of which may increase with potential physical climaterelated impacts), other occupational or process safety events or workplace exposures.\n- -  Operational events experienced by third parties, which may also result in unavailability of shared critical infrastructure (such as railway lines or ports) or transportation routes (such as the Port Hedland channel in Western Australia).\n- -  Our operations, workforce, communities, supply chains and customers may be exposed to changes in the frequency, intensity and/or duration of intense storms, drought, flooding, wildfire and other extreme weather or weather-related events and patterns (such as extreme heat).\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Our commitment to our communities, the environment and the safety and wellbeing of our people may increase operational resilience and partner and stakeholder confidence, enhancing our ability to attract and retain talent and access (or lower the cost of) capital.\n- -  Collaborating with industry peers and relevant organisations on minimum standards (such as the internationally recognised Flight Safety Foundation's Basic Aviation Risk Standard, Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management, Large Open Pit Project guidelines on open-pit mining design and management, and the Cave Mining 2040 Consortium on deep mining design and management) supports improvements to wider industry management of operational risks and may also identify opportunities to improve our own practices.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Planning, designing, constructing, operating, maintaining and monitoring surface and underground mines, water and tailings storage facilities, and other infrastructure and equipment in a manner designed to maintain structural integrity, prevent incidents and protect our people, assets, communities, the environment and other stakeholders.\n- -  Specifying minimum requirements and technical specifications, such as for transportation (including high-occupancy vehicles, fixed and rotary wing aircraft and their operators) and geotechnical (including characterisation, design, ground control and monitoring), and compliance with operating specifications, industry codes and other relevant standards, including BHP's mandatory minimum performance requirements.\n- -  Continuing to focus on improving our management of safety risk, including the investigation and response to the two fatal incidents at WAIO and Olympic Dam, and through programs such as the Fatality Elimination and Field Leadership Programs.\n- -  Defining key governance roles, such as a dam owner (an internal BHP individual who is accountable for maintaining effective governance and integrity of each tailings storage facility) and providing training and qualifications for our people.\n- -  Inspections, technical reviews, audits and other assurance activities, such as independent dam safety reviews and geotechnical review boards.\n- -  Maintaining evacuation routes, supporting equipment, crisis and emergency response plans and business continuity plans.\n- -  Incorporating future climate projections into risks associated with operational events through ongoing assessment of physical climate-related risks.\n\n## FY2023 insights\n\nOur acquisition of OZ Minerals has increased our operational footprint and consequently, our exposure to risks associated with operational events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to\n\nOFR 6.1 -

        "page_content": "## Risk factor: Significant social or environmental impacts\n\nRisks associated with significant impacts of our operations on and contributions to communities and environments throughout the life cycle of our assets and across our value chain.\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nThe long-term viability of our business is closely connected to the wellbeing of the communities and environments where we have a presence and our business is subject to increasing, complex and changing regulatory and stakeholder expectations. At any stage of the asset life cycle, our activities and operations may have or be perceived to have significant adverse impacts on communities and environments. In these circumstances, we may fail to meet the evolving expectations of our partners and stakeholders (including investors, governments, employees, suppliers, customers and Indigenous peoples and other community members) whose support is needed to realise our strategy and purpose. This could lead to loss of partner or stakeholder support or regulatory approvals, increased taxes and regulation, enforcement action, litigation or class actions, or otherwise impact our licence to operate and adversely affect our reputation, ability to attract and retain talent, ability to access capital, operational continuity and financial performance.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Engaging in or being associated with activities (including through nonoperated joint ventures and our value chain) that have or are perceived to have individual or cumulative adverse impacts on the environment, climate change, biodiversity and land management, water access and management, supply chain or responsible sourcing requirements, human rights or Indigenous peoples' rights or cultural heritage.\n- -  Failing to meet evolving partner or stakeholder expectations in connection with our alignment with global frameworks and societal goals, legal and regulatory obligations, acceptability of mining activities, relationships with Indigenous peoples, community wellbeing and the way we invest in communities or our approach to environment, climate change, biodiversity and land management, water access and management, supply chain or responsible sourcing requirements, human rights, Indigenous peoples' rights or cultural heritage priorities.\n- -  Political, regulatory and judicial developments (such as legislation to enact policy positions on climate change mitigation or, adaptation, nature-related risk or human rights) could increase uncertainty in relation to our operating environment, requiring us to adjust our business plans or strategy. For example, changes to regulations may require us to modify mine plans, limit our access to reserves and resources, alter the timing or increase costs associated with the development of and production from, or closure and rehabilitation of our assets, increase sourcing costs or expose BHP to unanticipated environmental or other legacy liabilities.\n- -  Failing to identify and manage physical climate-related risks and/ or nature-related risks to communities, biodiversity and ecosystems. For example, loss of important biodiversity and/or ecosystems as a result of operational activities (e.g. unauthorised clearing of vegetation) could result in land access restrictions, a decrease in demand for our products or limit our access to new opportunities.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Our support for responsible stewardship of natural resources may enhance the resilience of the environments and communities where we operate to threats (including potential physical climate-related impacts and nature loss). For example, BHP has released contextbased water targets for a number of our operated assets and has completed and published a pilot case study on the application of natural capital accounting principles at a closed and rehabilitated mine site to understand how we can better incorporate naturerelated threats and opportunities into our strategic planning, risk management and capital allocation decisions.\n- -  Strong social performance, including sustainable mining and a focus on the wellbeing of communities, could generate competitive advantage in the jurisdictions where we operate.\n- -  Our global social value framework and projects funded through social investment may improve partner and stakeholder relations, enhance community trust and increase investor confidence and demand for our commodities.\n- -  Greater clarity, transparency and standards associated with regulatory regimes that support and protect communities and the environment may increase requirements across our sector, generating competitive advantage for companies that have already invested in social and environmental performance.\n- -  Building our reputation for sustainable and responsible operating practices (for example, through certification of our operations to thirdparty standards such as The Copper Mark, which was awarded with full accreditation to three of our copper assets in FY2023, following provisional award in FY2022) may increase demand for some of our commodities and improve our access to talent and capital.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  The Our Requirements for Community and Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standards provide requirements and practices that are designed to strengthen our social, human rights and environmental performance. Our Human Rights Policy Statement, Water Stewardship Position Statement, Climate Transition Action Plan 2021 and Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement set out our targets, goals, commitments and/or approach to these matters.\n- -  Engaging in regular, open and transparent dialogue with partners and stakeholders to better understand their expectations, concerns and interests, undertaking research to better understand partner and stakeholder perceptions, and taking those considerations into account in planning and execution activities.\n- -  Building social value into our decision-making process, along with financial considerations, including through our social value framework and 2030 goals.\n- -  Building partner and stakeholder trust and contributing to environmental and community resilience, including through collaborating on shared challenges (such as climate change, nature and biodiversity loss and water stewardship), enhanced external reporting of our operated assets' potential impacts on nature and biodiversity, and maximising the value of social investments (including contributing to climate-related mitigation and adaptation initiatives and the delivery of nature-positive outcomes) through our social investment strategy.\n- -  Conducting regular research and impact assessments for operated assets to better understand the social, environmental, human rights, Indigenous peoples and economic context. This supports us to identify and analyse potential partner, stakeholder, community and human rights impacts, including modern slavery risks and emerging issues. We also complete risk-based due diligence screening on suppliers through our Ethical Supply Chain and Transparency program.\n- -  Integrating closure into our planning, decision-making and other activities through the life cycle of our operated assets, as set out in our mandatory minimum performance requirements for closure and legacy management.\n\n## FY2023 insights\n\nOur exposure to risks with potentially significant social or environmental impacts increased in FY2023 due to growing external expectations to meet targets and complexity and interconnectedness of climate, environment and community risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to\n\nOFR 6.6 - People\n\nOFR 6.12 - Climate change\n\nOFR 6.14 - Community\n\nOFR 6.15 - Indigenous peoples\n\nOFR 6.13 - Environment\n\nMore information can be found at\n\nbhp.com/sustainability",

        "page_content": "## 8  How we manage risk continued\n\n## Risk factor: Low-carbon transition\n\n## Risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nTransition risks arise from policy, regulatory, legal, technological, market and other societal responses to the challenges posed by climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. As a world-leading resources company, BHP is exposed to a range of transition risks that could affect the execution of our strategy or our operational efficiency, asset values and growth options, resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial performance, share price or reputation, including increased potential for litigation. Conversely, transition risks may also present opportunities for our diverse portfolio and through decarbonisation of our business. The complex and pervasive nature of climate change means transition risks are interconnected with and may amplify our other risk factors. Additionally, the inherent uncertainty of potential societal responses to climate change may create a systemic risk to the global economy and our business.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Introduction or improvement of low-carbon technologies or changes in customer preference for products that support the transition to a low-carbon economy may decrease demand for some of our products (which may be abrupt or unanticipated), increase our costs or decrease the availability of key inputs to production. For example:\n- -  Rapid shift to alternative steelmaking technology pathways (including electric arc furnace (EAF) and direct reduced iron (DRI) steelmaking) may reduce anticipated demand for our metallurgical coal (refer to OFR 6.12) and may result in the early closure or divestment of our metallurgical coal mines.\n- -  Increased recovery and reuse rates of commodities may reduce demand for our products.\n- -  New battery technologies that use no or less nickel could enter the market and reduce demand for our nickel products.\n- -  Adverse macroeconomic changes, such as a decline in global economic activity, could be exacerbated by the transition to a low-carbon economy and reduce anticipated demand for our future-facing commodities, such as copper and nickel.\n- -  Perceptions of climate-related financial risk and/or social concerns around climate change may result in investors divesting our securities or changing their expectations or requirements for investment in our securities, cause financial institutions not to provide financing or other products (such as insurance cover) to BHP or to our suppliers or customers, affect our suppliers' willingness to provide goods or services, and affect our customers' wish to procure our commodities. In turn, these factors could increase our costs and adversely impact our ability to optimise our portfolio and pursue growth opportunities.\n- -  Perceived or actual misalignment of BHP's climate actions (goals, targets and performance) with societal and investor expectations, or a failure to deliver our climate actions, may result in damage to our reputation, reduced investor confidence, climate-related litigation (including class actions) or give rise to other adverse regulatory, legal or market responses.\n- -  Sub-optimal selection, implementation or effectiveness of technology that is intended to contribute towards the delivery of our climate targets, goals and strategies, or unavailability of that technology (including due to the failure of trials of new technology, a failure of external equipment manufacturers to deliver on schedule or competition for limited supply) could prevent, limit, delay or increase costs in achieving our plans for operational decarbonisation.\n- -  Changes in laws, regulations, policies, obligations, government actions and our ability to anticipate and respond to such changes, including GHG emission targets, restrictive licensing, carbon taxes, carbon offsetting regulations, border adjustments or the addition or removal of subsidies, may give rise to adverse regulatory, legal or market responses. For example, the implementation of regulations intended to reduce GHG emissions in the steel industry in China could adversely impact demand for our metallurgical coal or iron ore. In addition, inadequate market supply of credible carbon credits or price volatility in carbon markets could increase our operating costs or result in adverse social value or compliance implications. Inconsistent regulatory regimes globally may increase the likelihood of an inadvertent failure to or inability to comply with some regulations and exacerbate the impacts of transition risks.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Our copper, nickel, iron ore, metallurgical coal and uranium provide essential building blocks for existing and new renewable and alternative power generation and electric vehicles, and can play an important part in the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n- -  Our potash fertiliser options can promote more efficient and profitable agriculture and help alleviate the increased competition for arable land, including due to implementation of nature-based solutions to help address climate change and global population growth.\n- -  Increased collaboration with customers, suppliers and original equipment manufacturers, such as BHP's partnerships with HBIS Group, China Baowu, JFE, POSCO and Tata Steel to explore technologies to reduce GHG emissions across the steel value chain, can provide opportunities for the development of new products and markets.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Establishing public positions on and mandatory minimum performance requirements for managing climate change threats and opportunities, which are set out in our Climate Change Report 2020, our Climate Transition Action Plan 2021 and the Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard.\n- -  Using climate-related scenarios (including our 1.5\u00b0C scenario), themes and signposts (such as monitoring policy, regulatory, legal, technological, market and other societal developments) to evaluate the resilience of our portfolio, allocate capital and inform our strategy.\n- -  Considering transition risks (including carbon prices) when making capital expenditure decisions or allocating capital through our Capital Allocation Framework, supporting the prioritisation of capital and investment approval processes.\n- -  Seeking to mitigate our exposure to risks arising from policy and regulation in our operating jurisdictions and markets by reducing our operational GHG emissions and taking a product stewardship approach to GHG emissions in our value chain.\n- -  Informing investors on progress to date and plans for achieving our operational (Scope 1 and Scope 2) emission targets and goals through our Operational Decarbonisation Presentation.\n- -  Advocating for the introduction of an effective, long-term policy framework that can deliver a measured transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n## FY2023 insights\n\nOur exposure to transition risks increased over FY2023 due to greater societal expectations for accelerated decarbonisation by companies and significant regulatory developments across the globe, including provisional agreement of the scope and implementation of the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States, which may help to accelerate the low-carbon transition. Additionally, Australia passed legislation to apply reforms to the 'Safeguard Mechanism' intended to reduce Scope 1 GHG emissions at its largest industrial facilities on a trajectory consistent with achieving the national GHG emission reduction targets. These external developments present both threat and opportunity for BHP as we continue to increase our portfolio exposure to future-facing commodities, including through our acquisition of OZ Minerals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to\n\nBHP Climate Change Report 2020\n\nBHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2021\n\nOFR 3 - Positioning for the future\n\nOFR 6.12 - Climate change\n\nMore information can be found at\n\nbhp.com/climate",

        "page_content": "## Risk factor: Adopting technologies and maintaining digital security\n\nRisks associated with adopting and implementing new technologies, and maintaining the effectiveness of our existing digital landscape (including cyber defences) across our value chain.\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nOur business and operational processes are increasingly dependent on the effective application and adoption of technology, which we use as a lever to deliver on our current and future operational, financial and social objectives. This exposes BHP to risks originating from adopting or implementing new technologies or failing to take appropriate action to position BHP for the digital future, which may impact the capabilities we require, the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations and our ability to compete effectively. New technology adopted in our business may not perform as anticipated and may result in unintended impacts on our operations. We may also fail to maintain the effectiveness of our existing and future digital landscape, including cyber defences, exposing us to technology availability, reliability and cybersecurity risks. These could lead to operational events, commercial disruption (such as an inability to process or ship our products), corruption or loss of system data, misappropriation or loss of funds, unintended loss or disclosure of commercial or personal information, enforcement action or litigation, which could also impact the environment and partners, suppliers and stakeholders across our value chain. Additionally, an inability to adequately maintain existing technology or implement critical new technology, or any sustained disruption to our existing technology may adversely affect our licence to operate, reputation, results of operations and financial performance.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Failure to invest in appropriate technologies or to keep pace with advancements in technology that support the pursuit of our objectives may adversely impact the effectiveness or efficiency of our business and erode our competitive advantage. For example, a failure to implement appropriate technologies that support our assets to produce higher-grade commodities or less waste from existing resources could limit our ability to sell our commodities or reduce costs.\n- -  Failure to identify, access and secure necessary infrastructure and key inputs (including electricity, internet bandwidth, data, software, licences or other rights in intellectual property, hardware and talent) to support new technology innovations and advanced technologies may adversely affect our ability to adopt, operate or retain access to those technologies. This includes AI and machine learning, process automation, robotics, data analytics, cloud computing, smart devices and remote working solutions. For example, adopting new technology to reduce GHG emissions using alternative energy sources may require new infrastructure, while effective implementation of new digital technologies (such as machine learning) may be heavily dependent on access to data.\n- -  Failure to adopt or successfully integrate new technology or technology enhancements may result in impacts to our business and operations. This could lead to operational stoppage events, commercial disruption (such as an inability to pay or accept payment), inability to disclose accurately or an inability to adequately maintain existing technology.\n- -  Failure or outage of our information or operational technology systems.\n- -  Cyber events or attacks on our information or operational technology systems, including on third-party partners and suppliers (such as our cloud service providers). For example, a cyber attack could result in a failure of business-critical technology systems at one or more of our assets, which may reduce operational productivity and/or adversely impact safety.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Applying digital solutions across our operations may unlock greater productivity and safety performance. For example, using predictive analytics to enable operations to identify asset condition and efficiencies may improve safety, production and equipment availability, and reduce maintenance and other costs.\n- -  Technology solutions to reduce GHG emissions may support BHP, our suppliers and customers in achieving climate action targets and goals. For example, in March 2023, BHP announced that it would collaborate with two of China's leading copper producers, China Copper and Daye Nonferrous, including to develop technology and innovations for copper smelting and refining, with the aim of supporting the global energy transition.\n- -  Developing and applying AI in mine planning, remote operation and advanced robotic technologies may identify or provide access to previously unknown or inaccessible deposits and development of end-to-end autonomous mining systems.\n- -  Using digital simulations and predictive trend modelling may enable us to optimise the deployment of new technologies, such as automation and electrification, support early identification of process variances and faults, and support the marketing of our products to customers.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Our assets, functions and projects are responsible for managing localised or project-specific exposure to technology and cyber risks, including risks associated with business-critical technology systems. Enterprise-level risks that are specific to technology, such as those that pose a greater threat to our wider business and strategic opportunities, are generally managed by our global Technology team and other relevant stakeholders to support delivery of our technology strategy.\n- -  A maturing Data Strategy that is enabling our ownership and management of critical data that drives our adoption of digital technologies.\n- -  We collaborate with industry and research partners to develop technological solutions.\n- -  We employ a number of measures designed to protect against, detect and respond to cyber events or attacks, including BHP's mandatory minimum performance requirements for technology and cybersecurity, cybersecurity performance requirements for suppliers, cybersecurity resilience programs, an enterprise security framework and cybersecurity standards, cybersecurity risk and control guidance, security awareness programs and training to build capability, security assessments and continuous monitoring, restricted physical access to hardware and crisis management plans.\n\n## FY2023 insights\n\nAs we continued to leverage technology and enable digital transformation in FY2023, our exposure to associated risks increased. Cybersecurity threat conditions remained elevated with multiple high-profile cyber incidents experienced by businesses. We continue to focus on strengthening management of cybersecurity risk across BHP, as well as monitoring any third-party events (including in relation to our suppliers) that might impact our business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to\n\n- OFR 2 - Why BHP",

It could also threaten the validity of our tenements or permits, or adversely impact our reputation, results of operations, financial performance or share price. Impacts may be amplified if our senior leaders fail to uphold BHP's values or address actual or alleged misconduct in a way that is consistent with societal, partner and stakeholder expectations. Our workplace culture may also be eroded, adversely affecting our ability to attract and retain talent. Risks and impacts are also heightened by the complex and continuously evolving legal and regulatory frameworks that apply to the jurisdictions where we operate and potentially conflicting obligations under different national laws.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Failing to prevent breaches of international standards, laws, regulations or other legal, regulatory, ethical, environmental, governance or compliance obligations, such as external misstatements, inaccurate financial or operational reporting or a breach of our continuous disclosure obligations.\n- -  Corruption (for example, in connection with the acquisition of earlystage options in a country with weaker governance standards), market misconduct or anti-competitive behaviour, including in relation to our joint venture operations.\n- -  Failing to comply with trade or financial sanctions (which are complex and subject to rapid change and may potentially result in conflicting obligations), health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, native title and other land right or tax or royalty obligations.\n- -  Failing to protect our people from harm (including to mental and physical health) due to misconduct that takes place in connection with their work, such as discrimination or sexual harassment.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Our capability to manage ethical misconduct risks may expand portfolio growth options by providing greater assurance that we can operate legally and ethically in high-risk jurisdictions.\n- -  Managing ethical misconduct risks in line with societal, partner and stakeholder expectations may distinguish BHP from competitors and enhance our ability to raise capital, attract and retain talent, engage with governments and communities in new jurisdictions, obtain permits, partner with external organisations or suppliers, or market our products to customers.\n- -  Playing a leading role in the management of ethical misconduct risks, such as sexual harassment risks, may help BHP to increase ethical and behavioural standards across the resources industry.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Setting the 'tone from the top' through Our Charter , which is central to our business and describes our purpose, values and how we measure success.\n- -  Implementing internal policies, standards, systems and processes for governance and compliance to support an appropriate culture and prioritise respectful behaviours at BHP, including:\n- -Our Code of Conduct and BHP's mandatory minimum performance requirements for business conduct, market disclosure and other matters\n- -  training on Our Code of Conduct and in relation to anti-corruption, market conduct and competition\n- -  ring fencing protocols to separate potentially competing businesses within BHP\n- -  governance and compliance processes, including classification of sensitive transactions, as well as accounting, procurement and other internal controls, and tailored monitoring of control effectiveness\n- -  oversight and engagement with high-risk areas by our Ethics and Investigations, Compliance and Internal Audit teams, and the Risk and Audit Committee\n- -  review and endorsement by our Compliance team of the highestrisk transactions, such as gifts and hospitality, engagement of third parties, community donations and sponsorships above defined thresholds\n- -  automated counterparty and transaction screening against lists of entities subject to trade sanctions\n- -  our EthicsPoint anonymous reporting service and complaints mechanism, supported by an ethics and investigations framework and central investigations team\n- -  campaigns and sessions held globally by our leaders to set expectations around racism, sexual harassment and other disrespectful behaviours, including our 'Active Bystander' training in FY2023 that is designed to empower everyone across BHP to call out disrespectful and harmful behaviours\n- -  Continuing to enforce Our Code of Conduct via appropriate investigations and responses, including disciplinary action, in addition to deployment of appropriate safety controls to prevent harm.\n- -  Requiring anti-corruption and human rights risks to be considered as part of our new country entry approval process.\n\n## FY2023 insights\n\nOur exposure to ethical misconduct risks increased in FY2023, including due to the acquisition of OZ Minerals and its operations in South America. Implementation of anti-corruption controls, including in-person anti-corruption training and due diligence on new and existing vendors is a key focus area for our Compliance and Integration teams. With BHP's continued focus on portfolio growth, there is a potential for further increases in exposure in higher-risk jurisdictions. Controls to manage these risks are informed by new country entry and counter party due diligence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to Our Charter and Our Code of Conduct OFR 6.7 - Sexual harassment OFR 6.9 - Ethics and business conduct Corporate Governance Statement",

These may include, for example, active portfolio changes (such as our acquisition of OZ Minerals and the proposed sale of the Daunia and Blackwater mines in Queensland) supporting innovative early-stage mineral exploration companies through BHP Xplor, and maturing and developing organic growth options across our existing portfolio. A strategy that does not support BHP's objectives and/or ill-timed execution of our strategy, or other circumstances, may lead to a loss of value that impacts our ability to deliver returns to shareholders and fund our investment and growth opportunities. It may also result in our asset portfolio being less resilient to climate-related risks or movements in commodity prices or inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors. In the short term, adverse movements in commodity prices may reduce our cash flow, ability to access capital and our dividends. A failure to optimise our asset portfolio for structural movements in commodity prices (including those arising from climate-related risks) over the long term may result in asset impairments and could adversely affect the results of our operations, financial performance and returns to investors.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Commodity prices have historically been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility, including due to global economic and geopolitical factors, industrial activity, commodity supply and demand (including inventory levels), technological change, product substitution, tariffs, interest rate movements and exchange rate fluctuations. Our usual policy and practice is to sell our products at prevailing market prices and, as such, movements in commodity prices may affect our financial performance. Long-term price volatility, sustained low prices or increases in costs may adversely impact our financial performance as we do not generally have the ability to offset costs through price increases.\n- -  Failure to optimise our portfolio through effective and efficient acquisitions, exploration, large project delivery, mergers, divestments or expansion of existing assets (including due to sub-optimal capital prioritisation) may adversely impact our performance and/or returns to investors.\n- -  Failure to identify potential changes in commodity attractiveness and missed entry or commodity exit opportunities, may result in decreased return on capital spend for or overpayment to acquire or invest in new assets or projects, stranded assets or reduced divestment proceeds.\n- -  Failure to achieve expected commercial objectives from assets or investments, such as cost savings, increased revenues or improved operational performance (including as a result of inaccurate commodity price assumptions or resources and reserves estimates), may result in returns that are lower than anticipated and loss of value. This could be exacerbated by impacts from factors such as climate-related risks, supply chain disruptions (for example, disruption in the energy sector impacting our end-user markets), labour shortages, inflationary pressures and unfavourable exchange rates, creating operational headwinds and challenging on-time and on-budget project delivery.\n- -  Renegotiation or nullification of permits, inability to secure new permits or approvals, increased royalties, such as the increase in coal royalties in Queensland and the mining royalty law in Chile, expropriation or nationalisation of our assets, or other legal, regulatory, political, judicial or fiscal or monetary policy instability or changes may increase our costs or adversely impact our ability to achieve expected commercial objectives from assets or investments, access reserves, develop, maintain or operate our assets, enter new jurisdictions, or otherwise optimise our portfolio.\n- -  Inability to predict long-term trends in the supply, demand and price of commodities and optimise our asset portfolio accordingly may restrict our ability to generate long-term returns from the portfolio. For example, slowing economic growth in China, political and trade tensions, market volatility or the global transition to a low-carbon economy may result in lower demand and prices for some of our products, which may in turn adversely impact our portfolio returns.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Acquisition of new resources or acceleration of organic growth options in future-facing commodities may strengthen and diversify our portfolio and protect and grow value over the long term.\n- -  Ability to predict long-term commodity demand, supply and price trends may lead to BHP being able to identify and acquire new future-facing commodities and assets ahead of our competitors or exit from declining commodities in a timely manner, strengthening our portfolio and leading to long-term, higher portfolio returns.\n- -  BHP may be perceived as a welcome and valued or preferred partner for the development of new resource opportunities, enabling us to secure new assets or exploration opportunities to create long-term optionality in the portfolio.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Strategies, processes and frameworks to grow and protect our portfolio and to assist in delivering ongoing returns to shareholders include:\n- -  our Capital Allocation Framework, corporate planning processes and investment approval processes\n- -  our annual reviews (including resilience testing) of portfolio valuations\n- -  our exploration, ventures (such as BHP Ventures), accelerators (such as BHP Xplor) and business development programs, which focus on replenishing our resource base and enhancing our portfolio (including creating and securing more options in future-facing commodities)\n- -  our long-term strategic outlook and ongoing strategic processes to assess our competitive advantage and enable the identification of threats to or opportunities for our portfolio through forecasting and scenario modelling\n- -  monitoring signals to interpret external events and trends, and designing commodity strategies and price protocols that are reviewed by management and the Board\n- -  our balance sheet and liquidity framework, which is designed to maintain a robust balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and access to diverse sources of funding, to enable us to be ready to pursue growth opportunities as and when they arise\n- -  Ongoing implementation of BHP's strategy including, for example, through the OZ Minerals acquisition (refer to FY2023 insights for further details), BHP Ventures investments and further investments in early-stage options in future-facing commodities.\n- -  Pursuing a considered approach to new country entry, including further building our capability to operate in higher-risk jurisdictions, in order to support portfolio opportunities.\n- -  Further developing BHP's social value proposition to position BHP as a preferred partner for the development of resource opportunities in line with the expectations of local communities, host governments and other global stakeholders.\n\n## FY2023 insights\n\nOur exposure to risks associated with optimising growth and portfolio returns remained stable in FY2023 as a result of the execution of key management actions in the context of continued volatility and uncertainty across global economies, fiscal regimes and industrial relations, and societal expectations. In FY2023, we completed our acquisition of OZ Minerals to increase portfolio exposure to future-facing commodities and provide us with the opportunity to realise synergies and add to our pipeline of growth options. We also announced the proposed sale of the Daunia and Blackwater mines in Queensland as we continue to optimise and consolidate our portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 3 - Positioning for the future OFR 9 - Performance by commodity Financial Statements note 23 'Financial risk management'",

Changes to laws, international trade arrangements, contractual terms or other requirements and/or geopolitical developments could result in physical, logistical or other disruptions to our operations in or the sale or delivery of our commodities to key markets. These disruptions could affect sales volumes or prices obtained for our products, adversely impacting our financial performance, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Government actions, including economic sanctions, tariffs or other trade restrictions, imposed by or on countries where we operate or into which we sell or deliver our products may prevent BHP from selling or make it more difficult for BHP to sell in key markets.\n- -  Physical disruptions to the delivery of our products to customers in key markets, including due to the disruption of shipping routes, closure or blockage of ports or land logistics (road or rail) or military conflict. In some cases, physical disruptions may be driven or intensified by weather and climate variability, including as potentially exacerbated or affected by climate change.\n- -  Legal or regulatory changes (such as royalties or taxes; governmentmandated price caps, port, export or import restrictions or customs requirements, shipping/maritime regulatory changes; restrictions on movements or imposition of quarantines; or changing environmental restrictions or regulations, including measures with respect to carbonintensive industries or imports) and commercial changes (such as changes to the standards, preferences and requirements of customers) may adversely impact our ability to sell, deliver or realise full market value for our products.\n- -  Failure to maintain strong relationships with customers or changes to customer demands for our products may reduce our market share or adversely impact our financial performance.\n- -  Increasing geopolitical tensions may adversely affect our strategic and business planning decisions and/or increase the time it takes us to manage our access to key markets, particularly if we fail to detect or anticipate deviations in the geopolitical environment in a timely manner.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Monitoring macroeconomic, societal, geopolitical and policy developments and trends may reveal new markets or commodities, identify opportunities to strengthen secondary markets for existing products or identify a potential competitive advantage or price premium for existing products.\n- -  Developing strategic partnerships and strong, mutually beneficial relationships with our customers may enable us to create value.\n- -  Building a deep understanding of geopolitical threats and opportunities and their potential impacts on global trade flows and our business could enhance our strategy, business planning and response, providing a potential future competitive advantage.\n- -  Identifying the potential for weather and climate variability, including as potentially exacerbated or affected by climate change, to disrupt delivery of products, and implementing management measures, may increase the resilience of our operations and value chain.\n- -  Monitoring signals and building relationships with and understanding the perspectives of influential partners and stakeholders may improve our ability to understand and provide input to policy development, and respond to and manage any impacts from policy changes (such as trade policies).\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Monitoring and assessing our ability to access key markets, and maintaining sales plans, product placement and business resilience strategies and relationships with relevant partners and stakeholders.\n- -  Maintaining response plans for various scenarios (including physical disruptions of logistics) to mitigate disruptions to our ability to access key markets.\n- -  Monitoring geopolitical and macroeconomic developments and trends, including through signal monitoring and our enterprise-level watch list of emerging themes, to provide an early indication of events that could impact our ability to access or offer opportunities in relation to key markets.\n- -  Identifying weather and/or climate-related vulnerabilities and implementing controls to mitigate disruptions to our ability to physically access key markets.\n- -  Diversifying our asset and commodity portfolio, such as our ongoing investment in potash through the Jansen Potash Project, to reduce exposure to market concentration risks.\n\n## FY2023 insights\n\nExposure to risks associated with our access to key markets increased in FY2023 due to changes in our external environment over which we have limited influence. The continuing Ukraine conflict, rising geopolitical tensions among major economies, increasing resource and economic nationalism as well as increased volatility and uncertainty in the international trading, business and financial environment, could cause disruption of global supply chains and affect macroeconomic conditions and our ability to sell to particular customers or markets.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factor: Inadequate business resilience\n\nRisks associated with unanticipated or unforeseeable adverse events and a failure of planning and preparedness to respond to, manage and recover from adverse events (including potential physical climate-related impacts).\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nIn addition to the threats described in our other risk factors, our business could experience unanticipated, unforeseeable or other adverse events (internal or external) that could harm our people, disrupt our operations or value chain, or damage our assets or corporate offices, including our non-operated assets in which BHP has a non-controlling interest. A failure to identify or understand exposure, adequately prepare for these events (including maintaining business continuity plans) or build wider organisational resilience may inhibit our (or our third-party partners') ability to respond and recover in an effective and efficient manner. This includes a failure to build resilience to physical climate-related risks. Material adverse impacts on our business include reduced ability to access resources, markets and the operational or other inputs required by our business, reduced production or sales of, or demand for, our commodities, or increased regulation, which could adversely impact our financial performance, share price or reputation and could lead to litigation (including class actions).\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Geopolitical, global economic, regional or local developments or adverse events, such as social unrest, strikes, work stoppages, labour disruptions, social activism, terrorism, bomb threats, economic slowdown, acts of war or other significant disruptions in areas where we operate or have interests.\n- -  Extreme weather and climate-related events, such as heatwaves, extreme precipitation and flooding, hurricanes, cyclones and fires. For example, significant wet weather in Australia contributed to a fall in production volumes in the December 2022 half year for iron ore, metallurgical coal and energy coal.\n- -  Other natural events, including earthquakes, tsunamis, solar flares and pandemics.\n- -  Potential physical climate-related impacts, such as acute risks that are event driven (including increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events) and chronic risks resulting from longer-term changes in climate patterns. Hazards may include changes in precipitation patterns, water shortages, rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, prolonged extreme temperatures and increased drought, fire and flooding.\n- -  Failure by suppliers, contractors or joint venture partners to perform existing contracts or obligations (including due to insolvency), such as construction of large projects or supply of key inputs to our business (for example, consumables for our mining equipment).\n- -  Failure of our risk management or other processes (including controls) to prepare for or manage any of the risks discussed in this Risk factors section may inhibit our (or our third-party partners') ability to manage any resulting adverse events and may disrupt our operations or adversely impact our financial performance or reputation.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Risk identification and management supports proactive, focused and prioritised deployment of resources to reduce exposure to adverse events. It may be used to inform priorities and strategies across BHP, supporting a proportionate and cost-effective response, which could provide a competitive advantage at a regional or global level.\n- -  Building wider organisational resilience may enable us to maintain dividends to shareholders amid adverse external events and make growth-generating, counter-cyclical investments, as well as to help us mitigate the impacts of unforeseeable adverse events.\n- -  Adaptation to climate change across our operations and in our value chain could enhance the safety, productivity and climate resilience of our operated assets, position BHP as a supplier of choice and enhance our ability to consistently grow value. Support for climatevulnerable communities and ecosystems may also improve our social value proposition.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Implementing Group-wide controls to enhance business resilience, including BHP's mandatory minimum performance requirements for security, crisis and emergency management and business continuity plans, and seeking to maintain an investment grade credit rating.\n- -  Monitoring our current state of readiness (preparedness, redundancy and resilience), including through scenario analysis and business resilience exercises, supporting organisational capability in our operations, functions and senior management to effectively and efficiently respond to and recover from adverse events should they materialise.\n- -  Monitoring the external environment, including political and economic factors, through signal monitoring, our geopolitical monitoring and public policy frameworks and our enterprise-level watch list of emerging themes, to support early identification of policy changes or adverse events for which we may need to increase preparedness.\n- -  Identifying security threats that could directly or indirectly impact our operations and people in countries of interest to BHP.\n- -  Implementing our Adaptation Strategy with respect to physical climate-related risks, including requiring operated assets and functions to identify and progressively assess physical climate-related risks (including to our value chain) and seeking to build climate change adaptation into their plans, activities and investments.\n- -  Maintaining quality, centralised climate data covering each of our operating locations so that our people have access to appropriate data to support climate studies that can be used to inform investment decisions around enhancing our operational resilience.\n\n## FY2023 insights\n\nOur exposure to risks associated with inadequate business resilience increased in FY2023. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat's NDC Synthesis Report (released in September 2022), the world is not currently on track to keep global average temperature increases below 2\u00b0C, and thus our exposure to climate-related risks continued to grow. Our acquisition of OZ Minerals has increased our operational footprint, and consequently, our exposure to physical climate-related risks. Significant natural disasters and prolonged weather events continue to be experienced across the globe, which may affect production at our assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to\n\nBHP Climate Change Report 2020\n\nBHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2021\n\nOFR 6.12 - Climate change\n\nOFR 6.13 - Environment\n\nOFR 6.10 - Security services\n\nbhp.com/sustainability",

Information relating to assets that are accounted for as equity accounted investments is shown to reflect BHP's share, unless otherwise noted, to provide insight into the drivers of these assets.\n\nFor more information as to the statutory determination of our reportable segments, refer to Financial Statements note 1 'Segment reporting'.\n\nUnit costs is one of our non-IFRS financial measures used to monitor the performance of our individual assets and is included in the analysis of each reportable segment. For the definition and method of calculation of our non-IFRS financial measures, including Underlying EBITDA and Unit costs, refer to OFR 10.\n\n## 9.1 Copper\n\nDetailed below is financial and operating information for our Copper assets comparing FY2023 to FY2022.\n\n| Year ended 30 June  US$M     | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue                      | 16,027 | 16,849 |\n| Underlying EBITDA            | 6,653  | 8,565  |\n| Net operating assets         | 34,542 | 27,420 |\n| Capital expenditure          | 2,698  | 2,528  |\n| Underlying ROCE              | 12%    | 16%    |\n| Total copper production (kt) | 1,717  | 1,574  |\n| Average realised prices      |        |        |\n| Copper (US$/lb)              | 3.65   | 4.16   |\n\n## Key drivers of Copper's financial results\n\n## Price overview\n\nCopper prices were volatile over the second half of FY2023, with two-way fluctuations based on expectations of China's recovery, and mounting demand risks in the OECD, with indicators of manufacturing weakness widespread. Historically extremely low global copper inventories and the sector's ongoing operational performance challenges have helped prices hold up relatively well - though our realised price was 12 per cent lower compared to FY2022.\n\nIn the near term, we expect demand to be met by a combination of rising primary and scrap supply. A small surplus or a balanced market is the most likely outcome for the current year, with operational disruptions being a key swing factor.\n\nIn the medium and longer term, traditional demand (such as home building, electrical equipment and household appliances) is expected to remain solid while the decarbonisation mega-trend is expected to bolster demand. In terms of meeting that demand, we anticipate that the cost curve is likely to steepen as challenges to the development of new resources (such as societal expectations, decarbonisation and water challenges) progressively increase. We anticipate that the industry is likely to enter the final third of this decade with a low inventory buffer and therefore elevated prices may endure throughout this period.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal Copper production for FY2023 increased by 9 per cent to 1,717 kt.\n\nEscondida copper production increased by 5 per cent to 1,055 kt primarily due to higher concentrator feed grade of 0.82 per cent, compared to 0.78 per cent in FY2022. The positive impact of the higher grade was partially offset by the impact of road blockades across Chile in the December 2022 quarter, which reduced availability of some key mine supplies.\n\nPampa Norte copper production increased by 3 per cent to 289 kt including a record 240 kt at Spence and 49 kt at Cerro Colorado. This was largely a result of higher concentrator throughput at the Spence Growth Option (SGO), partially offset by lower production at Cerro Colorado as it transitions towards closure.\n\nFollowing the completion of the acquisition of OZ Minerals Ltd (OZL), we are establishing the Copper South Australia province. Production from Copper South Australia was 232 kt, comprised of full-year production from Olympic Dam of 212 kt and two months of production from Prominent Hill and Carrapateena of 8 kt and 12 kt, respectively. Olympic Dam delivered record BHP copper production as a result of continued strong concentrator and smelter performance following the major smelter maintenance campaign (SCM21) in the prior period. Record annual gold and silver production was also achieved following the implementation of debottlenecking initiatives in the prior period, 27 per cent higher than the previous gold production record.\n\nAntamina copper production decreased by 8 per cent to 138 kt, reflecting the expected lower copper feed grades, partially offset by higher throughput. Zinc production was 1 per cent higher at 125 kt, reflecting higher throughput.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of OZL, Caraj\u00e1s produced 1.6 kt of copper and 1.2 troy koz of gold.\n\n## Financial results\n\nCopper revenue decreased by US$0.8 billion to US$16.0 billion in FY2023 due to lower average realised copper prices partially offset by higher sales volumes.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for Copper decreased by US$1.9 billion to US$6.7 billion. Price impacts, net of price-linked costs, decreased Underlying EBITDA by US$1.6 billion. Higher sales volumes increased Underlying EBITDA by US$1.4 billion due to record production at Olympic Dam in FY2023 following the planned major smelter maintenance campaign (SCM21) in the prior period, higher feed grade at Escondida and higher throughput at SGO.\n\nControllable cash costs increased by US$766 million, primarily due to planned unfavourable inventory movements to ensure consistent feed to SGO at Spence and drawdown of inventory built during SCM21 in the prior period at Olympic Dam.\n\nInflation negatively impacted Underlying EBITDA by US$701 million. Equity accounted investment profits attributable to Antamina decreased by US$269 million due to lower realised copper prices.\n\nEscondida unit costs increased by 17 per cent to US$1.40 per pound at realised exchange rates, primarily driven by inflationary cost pressures including higher contractor costs.\n\nSpence unit costs increased by 24 per cent to US$2.11 per pound at realised exchange rates, primarily driven by inflationary cost pressures and planned unfavourable inventory movements to ensure consistent feed to SGO.\n\n## Outlook\n\nTotal Copper production of between 1,720 and 1,910 kt is expected in FY2024.\n\nEscondida production of between 1,080 and 1,180 kt is expected in FY2024, reflecting both an expected increase in concentrator feed grade and concentrator throughput compared to FY2023.\n\nSpence production of between 210 and 250 kt is expected in FY2024, with planned higher concentrator grade and concentrator throughput but lower stacking grade for cathodes. Cerro Colorado continues to transition towards planned closure by December 2023, with production for the six months until closure expected to be approximately 9 kt.\n\nCopper South Australia production of between 310 and 340 kt is expected in FY2024 and will include the transfer of small volumes of copper concentrate from Prominent Hill to Olympic Dam for processing.\n\nAntamina copper production of 120 to 140 kt and zinc production of between 85 and 105 kt is expected in FY2024.\n\nEscondida unit costs in FY2024 are expected to be between US$1.40 and US$1.70 per pound (at an exchange rate of USD/CLP 810).\n\nSpence unit costs in FY2024 are expected to be between US$2.00 and US$2.30 per pound (at an exchange rate of USD/CLP 810).",

The first is how effectively China's stimulus policy is implemented, especially with regards to real estate. The second revolves around the breadth, timing and severity of any mandated steel production cuts. Our estimate of real-time cost support sits in the US$80-US$100/t range on a 62 per cent CFR (cost and freight) basis. That is unchanged from our previous reporting period.\n\nIn the medium term, China's demand for iron ore is expected to be lower than it is today as it moves beyond its crude steel production plateau and the scrap-to-steel ratio rises, though we expect demand for our products from elsewhere in developing Asia will offset this to a degree.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal Iron Ore production increased by 1 per cent to 257 Mt.\n\nWAIO achieved record production of 253 Mt (285 Mt on a 100 per cent basis), reflecting continued strong supply chain performance, including improved rail performance and increased car dumper utilisation. This was partially offset by the temporary suspension of operations following the fatality in February, unfavourable weather impacts from Tropical Cyclone Ilsa in the June 2023 quarter and the ongoing planned tie-in of Port Debottlenecking Project 1 (PDP1), which remains on track to be completed in CY2024.\n\nSouth Flank remains on track to ramp up to full production capacity of 80 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) by the end of FY2024. Current year performance has contributed to record annual production at the Mining Area C hub and record WAIO lump sales. Additionally, the deployment of autonomous haul trucks at South Flank was completed in May 2023.\n\nSamarco production increased by 11 per cent to 4.5 Mt (BHP share), as a result of higher concentrator throughput.\n\n## Financial results\n\nTotal Iron Ore revenue decreased by US$6.0 billion to US$24.8 billion in FY2023, reflecting lower average realised prices and lower sales volumes as a result of building inventory in China for portside sales.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for Iron Ore decreased by US$5.0 billion to US$16.7 billion primarily due to lower average realised prices, net of price linked costs, of US$5.0 billion. Other items such as inflation and higher fuel and energy costs, particularly higher diesel prices and increased labour and contractor costs, were partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rate impacts.\n\nWAIO unit costs increased by 6 per cent to US$17.79 per tonne at realised exchange rates predominantly due to inflationary cost pressures, net drawdown of inventory to support the supply chain and spend associated with the ramp up of South Flank, partially offset by favourable exchange rate movements.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWAIO production is expected to increase to between 250 and 260 Mt (282 and 294 Mt on a 100 per cent basis) in FY2024.\n\nWAIO unit costs in FY2024 are expected to be between US$17.40 and US$18.90 per tonne (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.67).\n\nSamarco production is expected to be between 4 and 4.5 Mt (BHP share) in FY2024.\n\n## 9.3  Coal\n\nDetailed below is financial and operating information for our Coal assets comparing FY2023 to FY2022.\n\n| Year ended 30 June  US$M                   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue                                    | 10,958 | 15,549 |\n| Underlying EBITDA                          | 4,998  | 9,504  |\n| Net operating assets                       | 7,266  | 7,650  |\n| Capital expenditure                        | 657    | 621    |\n| Underlying ROCE                            | 47%    | 91%    |\n| Total metallurgical coal production (Mt) 1 | 29     | 37     |\n| Total energy coal production (Mt) 2        | 14     | 18     |\n| Average realised prices                    |        |        |\n| Metallurgical coal (US$/t)                 | 271.05 | 347.10 |\n| Hard coking coal (HCC) (US$/t)             | 273.59 | 366.82 |\n| Weak coking coal (WCC) (US$/t)             | 251.13 | 296.51 |\n| Thermal coal (US$/t)                       | 236.51 | 216.78 |\n\n- 2 BHP divested its 33.3 per cent interest in Cerrej\u00f3n on 11 January 2022, which included 4.2 Mt of energy coal production.\n\n## Key drivers of Coal's financial results\n\n## Price overview\n\n## Metallurgical coal\n\nMetallurgical coal prices moved lower in FY2023 as the global energy shock receded, steel production in OECD importing regions declined, and supply conditions improved across multiple jurisdictions. Against this backdrop the re-opening of the Chinese import market for Australian coals has had little discernible impact on trade flows or pricing.\n\nAs has been the case in other commodities, India has been a bright spot in metallurgical coal, with imports expected to grow around 4.5 per cent in CY2023, against a two per cent decline for the remainder of the seaborne trade.\n\nIn the near term, we expect a modest improvement in seaborne demand from OECD importing regions as they see a gradual pickup in their steel industries, while India is expected to continue with its current momentum. The availability of landborne imports, and the operational performance of Chinese domestic mines, are key uncertainties for assessing what China's call on the seaborne trade might be in CY2024.\n\nOver the longer term, we believe that higher quality metallurgical coals (such as those produced by our BMA assets) will continue to be required in blast furnace steel making for decades, driven by the growth of the steel industry in hard coking coal importing countries such as India. In particular, such higher quality hard coking coals are expected to be valued for their role in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of blast furnaces. And with the major seaborne supply region of Queensland having become less conducive to long-life capital investment as a result of changes to the royalty regime, the scarcity value of higher quality hard coking coals may well increase over time.\n\n## Production\n\n## Metallurgical coal\n\nBMA production of 29 Mt (58 Mt on a 100 per cent basis) was in line with the prior period. The significant wet weather experienced in the first three quarters was offset by strong underlying operational performance, in particular continued improvement in truck productivity at Goonyella and Daunia following the completion of their transitions to autonomous fleet. Production for the period was further supported by a drawdown of raw coal inventory and improved labour availability compared to the prior period.",

        "page_content": "continued\n\n## 9  Performance by commodity\n\n## Energy coal\n\nNSWEC production increased by 3 per cent to 14.2 Mt driven by an improvement in weather conditions in the second half of the year and an uplift in truck productivity compared to the prior period. Additional deployed capacity into the new mining area also resulted in an uplift in prime stripping volumes.\n\n## Financial results\n\nCoal revenue decreased by US$4.6 billion to US$11.0 billion in FY2023 mainly due to lower average realised prices and divestment of BMC in the prior period.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by US$4.5 billion to US$5.0 billion. Price impacts decreased Underlying EBITDA by US$2.1 billion, while price-linked costs increased by US$0.5 billion, despite the lower price environment, as a result of the new Queensland Government royalty regime. The divestment of BMC in FY2022 reduced EBITDA in FY2023 by US$1.4 billion.\n\nLower volumes of US$0.2 billion were due to the timing of shipments while controllable cash costs increased by US$0.2 billion primarily due to increased maintenance activity, increased labour costs and inventory drawdowns due to significant wet weather. Other items such as inflation and fuel and energy costs reduced Underlying EBITDA by US$0.4 billion. This was partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rate impacts of US$0.3 billion.\n\nBMA unit costs increased by 8 per cent to US$96 per tonne primarily due to inflationary cost pressures, higher maintenance activity and the drawdown of mine inventories, which were partially offset by favourable exchange rate movements.\n\nNSWEC unit costs increased by 16 per cent to US$82 per tonne due to inflationary cost pressures and higher port toll charges at the NCIG coal export terminal, partially offset by favourable exchange rate movements.\n\n## Outlook\n\nBMA coal production for FY2024 is expected to be between 28 and 31 Mt (56 and 62 Mt on a 100 per cent basis).\n\nDuring FY2024, the Group plans to rebuild BMA's mine inventories which have been drawn down over the past three years to balance the supply chain and maximise value amidst the significant weather disruptions.\n\nWe are progressing with the sale of the Blackwater and Daunia mines for value.\n\nGiven the negative impact on investment economics of the Queensland Government's decision to raise coal royalty rates and the increase in sovereign risk as a result of this decision, we will not be investing in any further growth in Queensland, however we will sustain and optimise our existing operations.\n\nBMA unit costs in FY2024 are expected to be between US$95 and US$105 per tonne (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.67).\n\nNSWEC production for FY2024 is expected to be between 13 and 15 Mt.\n\n## 9.4  Other assets\n\nDetailed below is an analysis of Other assets' financial and operating performance comparing FY2023 to FY2022.\n\n## Nickel West\n\n## Key drivers of Nickel West's financial results\n\n## Price overview\n\nThe nickel industry moved into further surplus over the course of FY2023 as Indonesian supply continued to grow apace at a time of slowing economic growth. Battery demand is anticipated to record healthy growth across CY2023, but a de-stocking episode across the EV value chain early in the year made its presence felt across all the battery raw materials.\n\nRelatively tight fundamentals in Class-I exchange traded metal have continued to co-exist with considerable over-supply of intermediates and Class-II products.\n\nLonger term, we believe nickel will be a core beneficiary of the electrification mega-trend and that nickel sulphides will be particularly attractive.\n\n## Production\n\nNickel West production increased by 4 per cent to 80 kt due to an increased proportion of concentrate and matte products and inventory drawdowns. This was partially offset by the slower than planned ramp up of the refinery following planned maintenance in the December 2022 quarter and a heavy rain event at the Mt Keith operations in early April 2023 impacting mine progression.\n\nDuring the year, Nickel West experienced ongoing issues with the quality and volume of ore deliveries from Mincor Resources containing high levels of arsenic, and in March 2023 advised that it would no longer accept offspecification product. In the second half, Nickel West purchased more thirdparty products compared to the first half, including higher cost third-party concentrate to offset the impact of the ore supply issues.\n\n## Financial results\n\nRevenue increased by US$0.1 billion to US$2.0 billion in FY2023 reflecting higher realised prices for nickel metal due to the sales mix offset by lower realised prices for intermediate products.\n\nNickel West's Underlying EBITDA decreased from US$0.4 billion in FY2022 to US$0.2 billion in FY2023. Controllable cash costs increased by US$0.2 billion driven by inventory drawdowns to mitigate disruption caused by the heavy rain event at Mt Keith, unplanned outages and third-party ore delivery issues. Other items such as inflation and fuel and energy costs reduced Underlying EBITDA by US$0.2 billion. This was partially offset by higher volumes of US$0.1 billion and favourable foreign exchange rate impacts of US$0.1 billion.\n\n## Outlook\n\nProduction is expected to be between 77 and 87 kt in FY2024, weighted to the second half of the year due to planned refinery maintenance in the first half.\n\nThe West Musgrave nickel project in Western Australia is in early stages of execution following the final investment decision by OZL in September 2022 (prior to the acquisition by BHP).\n\n## Potash\n\nPotash recorded an Underlying EBITDA loss of US$205 million in FY2023, compared to a loss of US$147 million in FY2022.\n\nOur major potash project under development at Jansen is tracking to plan with first production still targeted for the end of CY2026, compared to the initial target of CY2027. During FY2024, we intend to transition from civil works into steel and equipment installation on the surface and underground, as well as continuing with equipment procurement. Port construction is also expected to continue. The feasibility study for Jansen Stage 2 continues to progress and is on track to be completed during FY2024.\n\n## 9.5  Impact of changes to commodity prices\n\nThe prices we obtain for our products are a key driver of value for BHP. Fluctuations in these commodity prices affect our results, including cash flows and asset values. The estimated impact of changes in commodity prices in FY2023 on our key financial measures is set out below.\n\n|                                    |   Impact on profit  after taxation  (US$M) |   Impact on  Underlying   EBITDA   (US$M) |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| US\u00a21/lb on copper price            |                                         24 |                                        34 |\n| US$1/t on iron ore price           |                                        159 |                                       227 |\n| US$1/t on metallurgical coal price |                                         12 |                                        17 |\n| US$1/t on energy coal price        |                                          9 |                                        13 |\n| US\u00a21/lb on nickel price            |                                          1 |                                         1 |",

Depreciation, amortisation and impairments includes non-exceptional impairments of US$75 million (FY2022: US$515 million).\n- 2 Collectively, we refer to the change in operating cash costs and change in exploration and business development as Change in controllable cash costs. Operating cash costs by definition do not include non-cash costs. The change in operating cash costs also excludes the impact of exchange rates and inflation, changes in fuel, energy costs and consumable costs, changes in exploration and evaluation and business development costs and one-off items. These items are excluded so as to provide a consistent measurement of changes in costs across all segments, based on the factors that are within the control and responsibility of the segment.",

Notwithstanding that this Report may include production, financial and other information from non-operated assets, non-operated assets are not included in the BHP Group and, as a result, statements regarding our operations, assets and values apply only to our operated assets unless stated otherwise. BHP Group Limited has, a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. BHP holds a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange, a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and an ADR program listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n## 11.2  Forward-looking statements\n\nThis Report contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include all statements, other than statements of historical or present facts, including: statements regarding trends in commodity prices and currency exchange rates; demand for commodities; global market conditions, reserves and resources and production forecasts; expectations, plans, strategies and objectives of management; climate scenarios; approval of certain projects and consummation of certain transactions; closure, divestment, acquisition or integration of certain assets, operations or facilities (including associated costs or benefits); anticipated production or construction commencement dates; capital costs and scheduling; operating costs and supply of materials and skilled employees; anticipated productive lives of projects, mines and facilities; the availability, implementation and adoption of new technologies; provisions and contingent liabilities; and tax, legal and other regulatory developments. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of terminology, including, but not limited to, 'intend', 'aim', 'ambition', 'aspiration', 'goal', 'target', 'project', 'see', 'anticipate', 'estimate', 'plan', 'objective', 'believe', 'expect', 'commit', 'may', 'should', 'need', 'must', 'will', 'would', 'continue', 'forecast', 'guidance', 'trend' or similar words. These statements discuss future expectations or performance, or provide other forward-looking information.\n\nExamples of forward-looking statements contained in this Report include, without limitation, statements describing (i) our strategy, our values and how we define our success; (ii) our expectations regarding future demand for certain commodities, in particular copper, nickel, iron ore, metallurgical coal, potash and steel, and our intentions, commitments or expectations with respect to our supply of certain commodities, including copper, nickel, iron ore, potash, uranium and gold; (iii) our future exploration and partnership plans and perceived benefits and opportunities, including our focus to grow our copper, nickel and potash assets; (iv) the structure of our organisation and portfolio and perceived benefits and opportunities; (v) our business outlook, including our outlook for long-term economic growth and other macroeconomic and industry trends; (vi) our projected and expected production and performance levels and development projects; (vii) our expectations regarding our investments, including in potential growth options and technology and innovation, and perceived benefits and opportunities; (viii) our reserves and resources; (ix) our plans for our major projects and related budget and capital allocations; (x) our expectations, commitments and objectives with respect to sustainability, decarbonisation, natural resource management, climate change and portfolio resilience and timelines and plans to seek to achieve or implement such objectives, including our 2030 goals and 'Pathway to 2030', our approach to equitable change and transitions, our Climate Transition Action Plan, Climate\n\nChange Adaptation Strategy and goals, targets and strategies to seek to reduce or support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and related perceived costs, benefits and opportunities for BHP; (xi) the assumptions, beliefs and conclusions in our climate change related statements and strategies, including in our Climate Change Report 2020, for example, in respect of future temperatures, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and climate-related impacts; (xii) our commitment to social value; (xiii) our commitments to sustainability reporting, frameworks, standards and initiatives; (xiv) our commitments to improve or maintain safe tailings storage management; (xv) our commitments to achieve certain inclusion and diversity targets, aspirations and outcomes; (xvi) our commitments to achieve certain targets and outcomes with respect to Indigenous peoples and the communities where we operate; and (xvii) our commitments to achieve certain health and safety targets and outcomes.\n\nForward-looking statements are based on management's expectations and reflect judgements, assumptions, estimates and other information available, as at the date made. BHP cautions against reliance on any forward-looking statements. These statements do not represent guarantees or predictions of future financial or operational performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements contained in this Report. For example, our future revenues from our assets, projects or mines described in this Report will be based, in part, on the market price of the commodities produced, which may vary significantly from current levels. These variations, if materially adverse, may affect the timing or the feasibility of the development of a particular project, the expansion of certain facilities or mines, or the continuation of existing assets. In addition, there are limitations with respect to scenario analysis, including any climate-related scenario analysis, and it is difficult to predict which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate. Scenario analysis is not an indication of probable outcomes and relies on assumptions that may or may not prove to be correct or eventuate.\n\nOther factors that may affect the actual construction or production commencement dates, revenues, costs or production output and anticipated lives of assets, mines or facilities include: (i) our ability to profitably produce and deliver the products extracted to applicable markets; (ii) the impact of economic and geopolitical factors, including foreign currency exchange rates on the market prices of the commodities we produce and competition in the markets in which we operate; (iii) activities of government authorities in the countries where we sell our products and in the countries where we are exploring or developing projects, facilities or mines, including increases in taxes and royalties or implementation of trade or export restrictions; (iv) changes in environmental and other regulations; (v) political or geopolitical uncertainty; (vi) labour unrest; and (vii) other factors identified in the risk factors set out in OFR 8.1.\n\nExcept as required by applicable regulations or by law, BHP does not undertake to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future performance.\n\n## Emissions and energy consumption data\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty and limitations in measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and operational energy consumption under the calculation methodologies used in the preparation of such data, all GHG emissions and operational energy consumption data or references to GHG emissions and operational energy consumption volumes (including ratios or percentages) in this Report are estimates. There may also be differences in the manner that third parties calculate or report GHG emissions or operational energy consumption data compared to BHP, which means third-party data may not be comparable to our data.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on how we calculate our GHG emissions and operational energy consumption data refer to the BHP Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology 2023 available at\n\nbhp.com/climate\n\nThis Report is made in accordance with a resolution of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ken MacKenzie\n\nChair\n\nDated: 22 August 2023\n\n- 1 References in this Annual Report to a 'joint venture' are used for convenience to collectively describe assets that are not wholly owned by BHP.

Some Directors hold or have previously held positions in companies that BHP has commercial relationships with. The Board has assessed the relationships between BHP and the companies in which Directors hold or held positions and has concluded that the relationships do not interfere with the Directors' exercise of objective, unfettered or independent judgement, or their ability to act in the best interests of BHP.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nIn accordance with Australian law, if a situation arises for consideration where a Director has a material personal interest, the affected Director takes no part in decision making unless approval is provided by the non-interested Directors. Provisions for Directors' interests are set out in the Constitution of BHP Group Limited.\n\n## 4.3  Board appointments and succession planning\n\nBHP adopts a structured and rigorous approach to Board succession planning to guard against unforeseen departures and facilitate the orderly replacement of current Directors, and oversees the development of a diverse pipeline. This process is continuous, allowing the Board to ensure there is a right balance on the Board between experience and fresh perspectives, and the Board continues to be fit for purpose.\n\nAs part of this process, John Mogford and Malcolm Broomhead retired from the Board in October 2022 and November 2022 respectively.\n\nBefore the Board formally appoints a person or puts a person forward for election, the Board, with the assistance of external consultants, will conduct appropriate background and reference checks as to that person's character, experience, education and criminal and bankruptcy history.\n\nThe Board has adopted a letter of appointment that contains the terms on which Non-executive Directors will be appointed, including the basis upon which they will be indemnified by the Group. The letter of appointment defines the role of Directors, including the expectations in terms of independence, participation, time commitment and continuous improvement. Written agreements are in place for all Nonexecutive Directors.\n\n## 4.4  Director induction, training and development\n\nUpon appointment, each new Non-executive Director undertakes an induction program tailored to their needs. Non-executive Directors also undertake an induction program when they join a new Committee, which is tailored to the areas specific to that Committee's role and the Director's previous experience.\n\nFollowing the induction program, Non-executive Directors participate in continuous improvement activities through a training and development program, which is overseen by the Nomination and Governance Committee to help ensure that Directors, individually and collectively, develop and maintain the skills and knowledge to assist them in performing their role effectively. The training and development program is periodically reviewed to maximise effectiveness and to ensure it is tailored to Directors' needs and the Board's areas of focus.\n\nThroughout the year, the Chair discusses development areas with each Director. Board Committees review and agree their needs for more briefings. The benefit of this approach is that induction and learning opportunities can be tailored to Directors' Committee memberships, as well as the Board's specific areas of focus. This approach is also intended to ensure a coordinated process for succession planning, Board renewal, training and development and Committee composition. In turn, these processes are relevant to the Nomination and Governance Committee's role in identifying appropriate Non-executive Director candidates.\n\nExamples of activities in the training and development program include:\n\n- -  briefings and development sessions to provide each Director with a deeper understanding of the activities, environment, key issues and direction of the assets, along with broader sustainability, climate-related and geopolitical considerations\n- -  site visits to provide insights into key issues at the site and to provide an opportunity for direct engagement with a cross-section of workforce, community members, contractors and other stakeholders\n- -  engagement with the Forum on Corporate Responsibility (FCR), which comprises civil society leaders in various fields of sustainability, to discuss FCR members' views on current and emerging trends and risks\n\n## 4.5  Director skills, experience and attributes\n\n## Overarching statement of Board requirements\n\nAt BHP, we know inclusive and diverse teams are safer and more productive. This is because people in these teams feel safe to speak up, share their ideas and different points of view, and work together to solve problems and make better decisions.\n\nThe BHP Board is no different, and believes its members should comprise Directors with a broad range of skills and diversity for the Board to:\n\n- -  provide the breadth and depth of understanding necessary to effectively create long-term shareholder value\n- -  protect and promote the interests of BHP and the creation of social value\n- -  ensure the talent, capability and culture of BHP support the long-term delivery of our strategy\n\n## Attributes and commitment to role\n\nAll Directors are expected to comply with Our Code of Conduct , act with integrity, lead by example and promote the desired culture.\n\nThe Board believes each Non-executive Director has demonstrated the attributes of sufficient time to undertake the responsibilities of the role, honesty and integrity, and a preparedness to question, challenge and critique throughout the year through their participation in Board meetings, and the other activities they have undertaken in their roles.",

We define gender balance as a minimum 40 per cent women and 40 per cent men, in line with the definitions used by entities such as the International Labour Organization.\n\nThe Board is responsible for approving the measurable objectives for achieving diversity in the composition of the Board, senior executives and workforce generally and assessing the Group's progress in achieving those measurable objectives.\n\nIn FY2023, the Board approved the objective to increase the representation of women across the BHP workforce by 3 per cent from the FY2022 objective of 32.8 per cent. During FY2023, BHP increased the representation of women working at BHP by 2.9 percentage points, with women now representing 35.2 per cent of the global workforce. For more information on our focus areas for diversity during FY2023 and the respective proportions of men and women on the Board, in senior executive positions and across the whole workforce, refer to OFR 6.6.\n\nThe Board's composition reflects gender balance and a diversity of experience, education and geographic background.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdditional diversity data is also available in the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2023 available at bhp.com/sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 4  Board composition and succession\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, 40 per cent of Directors are female and the BHP Board satisfies the target in the UK Listing Rules and the guidance of having at least 30 per cent of Directors of each gender in accordance with the ASX Fourth Edition. BHP also satisfies the UK Listing Rule target of having at least one Director from a minority ethnic background on the Board.\n\nBHP does not currently satisfy the UK Listing Rule target that at least one of the senior positions on the Board (which for BHP is the Chair, Chief Executive Officer and Senior Independent Director) is held by a woman. Prior to Gary Goldberg taking on the role of Senior Independent Director in December 2020, that position had been held by a woman since 2015. As part of its succession planning, the Board reviews the skills and diversity (including gender, age, personal strengths and social and ethnic backgrounds) represented by Directors on the Board and determines whether the composition and mix of those skills and diversity remains appropriate to achieve BHP's purpose and strategy.\n\nThe tables in Additional information 7 set out the information required under the UK Listing Rules on diversity as at 30 June 2023. The data presented in these tables was collected by requesting all members of the Board, ELT and Group Company Secretary self-report in questionnaires that include the tables prescribed by the UK Listing Rules.\n\n## 4.7  Board evaluation\n\nThe Board is committed to transparency in assessing the performance of Directors. The Board conducts regular evaluations of its performance, the performance of its Committees, the Group Chair, Directors and the governance processes that support the Board's work.\n\nAn external board evaluation is conducted approximately every three years and was conducted in FY2023. The evaluation assessed the performance of the Board as a whole and its Committees. The scope of the review included Board and Committee performance and effectiveness. It considered the balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Group on the Board, its diversity and culture, and the operation of governance processes.\n\n## Review of individual Director performance\n\nThe Board has adopted a policy for all Non-executive Directors to seek re-election annually. The Board uses the results of Director performance evaluations in considering whether to nominate a Director for re-election by shareholders.\n\nIn FY2023, an assessment was conducted of each Director's performance with the assistance of an external service provider that does not have any other connection with the Group or individual Directors.\n\nThe assessment of Directors focused on the contribution of each Director to the work of the Board and its Committees, and the expectations of Directors as set out in BHP's governance framework. In addition, the assessment focused on how each Director contributes to Board cohesion and effective relationships with fellow Directors, commits the time required to fulfil their role and effectively performs their responsibilities. Directors were asked to comment on areas where their fellow Directors contribute the greatest value and potential areas for development.\n\nThe reviewer provided feedback received to the Chair, which was then discussed with Directors. Feedback relating to the Chair was discussed with the Chair by the Senior Independent Director. As a result of these outcomes, the review supported the Board's decision to recommend each Director standing for re-election.\n\n## Committee assessments\n\nFollowing an assessment of its work, each Committee concluded that it had met the requirements under its Terms of Reference in FY2023.\n\n## 5  Board Committees\n\nThe Board has four standing Committees and has delegated a number of duties to each Committee to assist the Board in exercising its responsibilities and discharging its duties. Each Committee's Charter sets out the Committee's roles and responsibilities. These Charters were reviewed and updated in FY2023 as part of the governance review. The aim was to review Board and Committee responsibilities and streamline and modernise the documents in order to best support BHP's strategy and purpose. The updated Charters took effect from 1 July 2023 and are available at bhp.com/governance.\n\nBHP's Board and Committee governance structure facilitates a considered and integrated approach on key matters, for example:\n\n- -  Climate change is a Board-level issue. The Board is responsible for the governance and oversight of climate change issues, including in relation to our strategic approach, risk management and public disclosures. The Board approves significant social, community and sustainability policies, including those related to climate change and public sustainability goals and targets, and oversees performance against our strategy, goals and targets. The Board is supported by each of its Committees:\n- -  The Nomination and Governance Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on the Group's significant social, community and sustainability policies, including those related to climate change. The Committee also reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on the Group's public sustainability-related goals and targets.\n- -  The Risk and Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in overseeing and reviewing emerging and priority group risks, including those that are climate-related risks, risk management and internal controls. The Risk and Audit Committee also reviews and recommends to the Board public financial disclosures related to sustainability matters including climate change reports and climate transition action plans.\n- -  The Sustainability Committee is responsible for assisting the Board with overseeing climate performance and reviews the performance of the Group in relation to climate-related decisions and actions.\n- -  The People and Remuneration Committee is responsible for considering and assessing performance measures for the ELT and performance outcomes against those measures. In doing so, the Committee considers recommendations from the Sustainability Committee in relation to health, safety, environment, climate and community measures.\n- -  Sexual harassment is a Board-level issue, supported by the Risk and Audit Committee on the risk and compliance aspects and the Sustainability Committee on the safety, operational aspects and security controls.\n- -  Technology and cyber risk are Board-level issues, supported by the Risk and Audit Committee, which reviews emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including cyber risk.\n\nThe Board appoints the members and Chair of each Committee. Only independent, Non-executive Directors can be Committee Chairs.\n\nThe members and key roles and responsibilities of each Committee are set out below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor Committee attendance and members during FY2023 refer to Directors' Report 2",

A talent deep dive is conducted by the Board at least once a year to evaluate these pipelines, including the diversity of the pipeline.\n\nSenior management succession is viewed from a five-year perspective that considers the readiness of successors across time horizons, contexts and future capability demands. Select Board members are involved in the interview process for executive-level appointments one level below the CEO and occasionally for roles two levels below the CEO.

BHP has a written agreement with each ELT member setting out the terms of their appointment.\n\n## 6.3  Performance evaluation of executives\n\nThe performance of executives and other senior employees is reviewed on an annual basis.

This includes business technology security, cyber risk, climate-related risk and legal and ethical compliance programs. The Board requires the CEO to implement a system of control for identifying and managing risk. The Risk team is accountable for this system, known as BHP's Risk Framework, and also supports, challenges and verifies risk management activities to give assurance to management and the Board. The Directors, through the RAC, monitor and, at least annually, will review the effectiveness of the Group's systems of risk management and internal control and make a recommendation to the Board on whether they continue to be sound and whether the Group is operating with due regard to the risk appetite set by the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nrefer to OFR 8\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit team provides assurance to the Board, CEO and Executive Leadership Team on whether risk management, internal control and governance processes are adequate and functioning. The Internal Audit team is independent of the External Auditor. The RAC evaluates and, if thought fit, approves the Terms of Reference of the Internal Audit team and the annual internal audit plan and monitors the effectiveness of the internal audit activities.\n\nThe RAC approves the appointment and dismissal of the Chief Audit Officer (which is currently the Chief Risk and Audit Officer) and assesses their performance, independence and objectivity. During FY2023, the Chief Risk and Audit Officer reported directly to the RAC and functional oversight of the Internal Audit team was provided by the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n## Effectiveness of systems of internal control and risk management\n\nIn delegating authority to the CEO, the Board has established CEO limits, outlined in the Board Governance Document. These limits require the CEO to ensure there is a system of control in place for identifying and managing risk in BHP. Through the RAC, the Directors regularly review these systems for their effectiveness. These reviews include assessing whether processes continue to meet evolving external governance requirements.\n\nThe RAC oversees and reviews the internal controls and risk management systems (including procedures, processes and systems for, among other things, budgeting and forecasting, provisions, financial controls, financial reporting and reporting of reserves and resources, compliance, preventing fraud and serious breaches of business conduct, speak-up procedures, and protecting information and data systems). Any material breaches of Our Code of Conduct , including breaches of our anti-bribery and corruption requirements and any material incidents reported under our speak-up procedures are reported quarterly to the RAC by the Chief Compliance Officer. These reports are then communicated to the Board through the report-out process.\n\nDuring FY2023, management presented an assessment of the material risks facing BHP and the effectiveness of the Group's systems of risk management. The reviews were overseen by the RAC, with findings and recommendations reported to the Board. In addition to considering key risks facing BHP, the Board assessed the effectiveness of internal controls over key risks identified through the work of the Board Committees.\n\nHaving carried out a review during FY2023, the Board is satisfied with the effectiveness of BHP's risk management and internal control systems.\n\n## Environmental and social risks\n\nBHP's risk factors (including material exposure to environmental and social risks) and how we manage these risks are described in OFR 8.\n\n## 9.2  External audit and financial reporting\n\n## Integrity of Financial Statements\n\nThe RAC assists the Board in assuring the integrity of the Financial Statements. The RAC evaluates and makes recommendations to the Board about the appropriateness of accounting policies and practices, areas of judgement, compliance with accounting standards, stock exchange and legal requirements and the results of the external audit.\n\n## CEO and CFO assurance\n\nFor the FY2023 full year and half year, the CEO and CFO have certified that in their opinion, BHP's financial records have been properly maintained and those Financial Statements present a true and fair view of our financial condition and operating results and are in accordance with accounting standards and applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nThe CEO and CFO have also certified to the Board that this opinion was formed on the basis of a sound system of risk management and internal control and the system is operating efficiently and effectively. The RAC considered these certifications when recommending the Financial Statements to the Board for approval.\n\n## External Auditor\n\nThe RAC manages the relationship with the External Auditor on behalf of the Board. It considers the independence and reappointment of the External Auditor each year, as well as remuneration and other terms of engagement and makes a recommendation to the Board.\n\n## Evaluation of External Auditor and external audit process\n\nThe RAC evaluates the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor and the quality and effectiveness of the external audit arrangements, including through:\n\n- -  reviewing the terms of engagement of the External Auditor\n- -  considering the external audit plan, in particular to gain assurance that it is tailored to reflect changes in circumstances from the prior year and reviewing the plan during the audit engagement\n- -  meeting with the audit partners, particularly the lead audit engagement partners, throughout the year and without management present\n- -  discussing with the audit engagement partners the skills and experience of the broader audit team\n- -  considering the quality of the External Auditor's performance following the completion of the audit\n\nIn addition, the RAC reviews the integrity, independence and objectivity of the External Auditor and assesses whether there is any element of the relationship that impairs or appears to impair the External Auditor's judgement or independence. The External Auditor also certifies its independence to the RAC.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nAlthough the External Auditor provides some non-audit services to the Group, the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor are safeguarded through restrictions on the provision of these services with some services prohibited from being undertaken.",

The RAC monitors the audit services engagements and if necessary, approves any changes in terms and conditions resulting from changes in audit scope, Group structure or other relevant events.\n- -  Audit-related and other assurance services - work that is outside the scope of the statutory audit but is consistent with the role of the external statutory auditor. This category includes work that is reasonably related to the performance of an audit or review and is a logical extension of the audit or review scope, is of an assurance or compliance nature and is work that the external auditors must or are best placed to undertake and is permissible under the relevant applicable standard.\n- -  Tax services - identification of public subsidies and tax incentives and support regarding tax inspections by tax authorities, but only when support from the external auditor or audit firm is required by law.\n\nActivities outside the scope of the categories above are not 'pre-approved' and must be approved by the RAC prior to engagement, regardless of the dollar value involved. In addition, any engagement for other services with a value over US$250,000, even if listed as a 'pre-approved' service, requires the approval of the RAC.\n\nAll engagements for non-audit services, whether 'pre-approved' or not and regardless of the dollar value involved, are reported quarterly to the RAC. While not prohibited by BHP's policy, any proposed engagement of the External Auditor relating to internal control requires specific prior approval from the RAC. In addition, while the categories of 'pre-approved' services include a list of certain pre-approved services, the use of the External Auditor to perform these services will always be subject to our overriding governance practices as articulated in the policy.\n\nIn addition, the RAC did not approve any services during the year ended 30 June 2023 pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of SEC Regulation S-X (provision of services other than audit).\n\nFees paid to BHP's External Auditor during FY2023 for audit and other services were US$14.230 million, of which 72 per cent comprised audit fees (including in relation to SOX matters), 13 per cent for audit-related fees and 15 per cent for all other fees. No fees were paid in relation to tax services. For information on the fees paid refer to Financial Statements note 36 'Auditor's remuneration'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Our Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor policy is available at bhp.com/governance\n\n## Management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, the effectiveness of BHP's internal control over financial reporting was evaluated based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Controls - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as at 30 June 2023. BHP acquired 100 per cent of OZ Minerals Limited on 2 May 2023 and therefore, management has excluded this business from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of 30 June 2023. Total assets and revenues of this business excluded from the assessment represented approximately 8.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent, respectively, of BHP's consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 30 June 2023. There were no material weaknesses in BHP's internal controls over financial reporting identified by management as at 30 June 2023\n\nBHP has engaged independent registered public accounting firm, EY, to issue an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting for inclusion in the Financial Statements of the Annual Report and the Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during FY2023 that materially affected or were reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nDuring FY2023, the RAC reviewed our compliance with the obligations imposed by SOX, including evaluating and documenting internal controls as required by section 404 of SOX.\n\n## Management's assessment of disclosure controls and procedures\n\nManagement, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as at 30 June 2023. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the material financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed by BHP, including in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarised and reported on a timely basis. This information is accumulated and communicated to BHP's management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, management (including the CEO and CFO) concluded that, as at 30 June 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing that reasonable assurance.\n\nThere are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\n\nIn the design and evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, management was required to apply its judgement in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\n\n## 10  US requirements\n\nBHP Group Limited is a registrant with the SEC in the United States. It is classified as a foreign private issuer and has American Depositary Shares listed on the NYSE.\n\nWe have reviewed the governance requirements applicable to foreign private issuers under SOX, including the rules promulgated by the SEC and the rules of the NYSE, and are satisfied that we comply with those requirements.\n\nUnder NYSE rules, foreign private issuers such as BHP are required to disclose any significant ways our corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US companies under the NYSE corporate governance standards. After a comparison of our corporate governance practices with the requirements of Section 303A of the NYSE-Listed Company Manual followed by US companies, two significant differences were identified:\n\n- -  Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act requires NYSE-listed companies to ensure their audit committees are directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the External Auditor unless the company's governing law or documents or other home country legal requirements require or permit shareholders to ultimately vote on or approve these matters. Under the terms of our Constitution, our shareholders are ultimately responsible for the appointment and retention of the External Auditor and are required to vote on the appointment of the External Auditor from time to time (as required under Australian law). The RAC remains directly responsible for the compensation and oversight of the work of the External Auditor.\n- -  Under Section 303A.08 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equitycompensation plans and material revisions thereto, with certain exemptions. Under Australian law, BHP Group Limited is not required to provide for shareholder votes on all equity-compensation plans or revisions thereto. Shareholder approval is required for issues of shares to Directors and accordingly is sought only for certain incentive awards to the CEO. The Remuneration Report voted on by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting describes Board and executive remuneration. All incentive programs offered to the Board and/or Executives are intended to comply with our remuneration framework.",

The Operating and Financial Review (OFR), the Remuneration Report and the 'Lead Auditor's Independence Declaration' are incorporated by reference into and form part of this Directors' Report.\n\n## 1   Review of operations, principal activities and state of affairs\n\nA review of the operations of BHP during FY2023, the results of those operations during FY2023 and the expected results of those operations in future financial years are set out in the OFR 1-7, 9 and 11. Information on the likely developments in BHP's operations in future years and the expected results of those operations also appears in that section.\n\nWe have excluded certain information from the OFR, to the extent permitted by Australian law, on the basis that such information relates to impending developments or matters in the course of negotiation and disclosure would be seriously prejudicial to the interests of BHP. This is because such disclosure could be misleading due to the fact it is premature or preliminary in nature, relates to commercially sensitive contracts, would undermine confidentiality between BHP and our suppliers and clients, or would otherwise unreasonably damage BHP. The categories of information omitted include forward-looking estimates and projections prepared for internal management purposes, information regarding BHP's assets and projects, which is developing and susceptible to change, and information relating to commercial contracts and pricing modules.\n\nOur principal activities, including significant changes in the nature of BHP's principal activities during FY2023 are disclosed in the OFR.\n\nThere were no significant changes in BHP's state of affairs that occurred during FY2023 and no significant post balance date events other than as disclosed in the OFR and Financial Statements note 35 'Subsequent events'.\n\nNo other matter or circumstance has arisen since the end of FY2023 that has significantly affected or is expected to significantly affect the operations, the results of operations or state of affairs of BHP in future years.\n\n## 2 Directors\n\nThe Directors who served at any time during FY2023 or up until the date of this Directors' Report are listed in the Board and Board Committee attendance table below. Information on the current Directors, including their terms of service, qualifications, experience and special responsibilities, and directorships of other listed companies held in the last three years, is set out in the Corporate Governance Statement. This information is incorporated by reference into and forms part of this Directors' Report.\n\n## Director attendances at meetings\n\nThe Board meets as often as required. During FY2023, the Board met 15 times.\n\nMembers of the Executive Leadership Team and other members of senior management attend meetings of the Board by invitation.\n\nEach Board Committee provides a standing invitation for any Non-executive Director to attend Committee meetings (rather than just limiting attendance to Committee members). Committee agendas and papers are provided to all Directors to ensure they are aware of matters to be considered.\n\n## Board and Board Committee attendance in FY2023\n\n|                     | Board   | Risk and Audit  Committee   | Nomination and  Governance Committee   | People and  Remuneration  Committee   | Sustainability  Committee   |\n|---------------------|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Terry Bowen         | 15/15   | 10/10                       | 5/5                                    |                                       |                             |\n| Malcolm Broomhead 1 | 7/7     |                             |                                        |                                       |                             |\n| Xiaoqun Clever      | 15/15   | 10/10                       |                                        |                                       |                             |\n| Ian Cockerill       | 15/15   | 10/10                       |                                        |                                       | 5/5                         |\n| Gary Goldberg       | 15/15   |                             | 5/5                                    |                                       | 5/5                         |\n| Mike Henry          | 15/15   |                             |                                        |                                       |                             |\n| Michelle Hinchliffe | 15/15   | 10/10                       |                                        |                                       |                             |\n| Ken MacKenzie       | 15/15   |                             | 5/5                                    |                                       |                             |\n| John Mogford 2      | 6/6     |                             |                                        |                                       | 2/2                         |\n| Christine O'Reilly  | 15/15   | 10/10                       | 5/5                                    | 5/5                                   |                             |\n| Catherine Tanna     | 15/15   |                             |                                        | 5/5                                   | 5/5                         |\n| Dion Weisler        | 14/15 3 |                             |                                        | 5/5                                   | 5/5                         |\n\n- 1 Malcolm Broomhead served as a Non-executive Director from 31 March 2010 until his retirement from the Board on 10 November 2022.\n- 2 John Mogford served as a Non-executive Director from 1 October 2017 until his retirement as a member of the Board and the Sustainability Committee on 31 October 2022.\n- 3 Dion Weisler was unable to attend the Board meeting on 9 November 2022 due to a pre-existing commitment.\n\n## 3  Share interests\n\n## Directors' shareholdings\n\nDetails of Directors' shareholdings in BHP as at the date of this Directors' Report are shown in the table below.

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report\n\n## 5 Secretaries\n\nStefanie Wilkinson is the Group Company Secretary. For details of her qualifications and experience refer to Corporate Governance Statement 4.1. Prakash Kakkad, LLB, LPC is also a Company Secretary of BHP Group Limited as at 30 June 2023. Both have experience in a company secretariat role or other relevant fields arising from time spent in other large listed companies or other relevant entities.\n\n## 6  Indemnities and insurance\n\nRule 146 of the BHP Group Limited Constitution requires the company to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each Officer of BHP Group Limited against liability incurred in or arising out of the conduct of the business of BHP or the discharge of the duties of the Officer. The Directors named in 4.1 of the Corporate Governance Statement, the Company Secretaries and other Officers of BHP Group Limited have the benefit of this requirement, as do individuals who formerly held one of those positions.\n\nIn accordance with this requirement, BHP Group Limited has entered into Deeds of Indemnity, Access and Insurance (Deeds of Indemnity) with its Directors.\n\nWe have a policy that BHP will, as a general rule, support and hold harmless an employee, including an employee appointed as a Director of a subsidiary who, while acting in good faith, incurs personal liability to others as a result of working for BHP.\n\nIn addition, as part of the arrangements to effect the demerger of South32, we agreed to indemnify certain former Officers of BHP who transitioned to South32 from certain claims and liabilities incurred in their capacity as Directors or Officers of South32.\n\nThe terms of engagement for certain services include that we must compensate and reimburse EY for, and protect EY against any loss, damage, expense, or liability incurred by EY in respect of third-party claims arising from a breach by BHP of any obligation under the engagement terms.\n\nWe have insured against amounts that we may be liable to pay to Directors, Company Secretaries or certain employees (including former Officers) pursuant to Rule 146 of the Constitution of BHP Group Limited or that we otherwise agree to pay by way of indemnity. The insurance policy also insures Directors, Company Secretaries and some employees (including former Officers) against certain liabilities (including legal costs) they may incur in carrying out their duties. For this Directors' and Officers' insurance, we paid premiums of US$17.2 million excluding taxes during FY2023.\n\nNo indemnity in favour of a current or former Officer of BHP Group Limited or in favour of the External Auditor, was called on during FY2023.\n\n## 7 Dividends\n\nA final dividend of 80 US cents per share will be paid on 28 September 2023, resulting in total cash dividends determined in respect of FY2023 of 170 US cents per share.\n\nFor information on the dividends paid refer to Financial Statements note 17 'Share capital' and note 19 'Dividends'.\n\n## 8 Auditors\n\nA copy of the declaration given by our External Auditor to the Directors in relation to the auditors' compliance with the independence requirements of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and the Professional Code of Conduct for External Auditors is set out in Financial Statements 3.\n\nNo current Officer of BHP has held the role of director or partner of the Group's current external auditor.\n\n## 9  Non-audit services\n\nFor information on the non-audit services undertaken by BHP's External Auditor, including the amounts paid for non-audit services, refer to Financial Statements note 36 'Auditor's remuneration'. All non-audit services were approved in accordance with the process set out in the Policy on Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor. No non-audit services\n\nwere carried out that were specifically excluded by the Policy on Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor. Based on advice provided by the Risk and Audit Committee, the Directors have formed the view that the provision of non-audit services is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors, and that the nature of non-audit services means that auditor independence was not compromised. The reason for this view is that the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor are safeguarded through restrictions on the provision of these services with some services prohibited from being undertaken.\n\nFor more information about our policy in relation to the provision of nonaudit services by the external auditor refer to 'External audit and financial reporting' in our Corporate Governance Statement 9.2.\n\n## 10  Exploration, research and development\n\nCompanies within the Group carry out exploration and research and development necessary to support their activities. Details are provided in OFR 5 'Our assets', OFR 9 'Performance by commodity' and Resources and Reserves in the Annual Report.\n\n## 11  ASIC Instrument 2016/191\n\nBHP Group Limited is an entity to which the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 applies. Amounts in this Directors' Report and the Financial Statements, except estimates of future expenditure or where otherwise indicated, have been rounded to the nearest million dollars in accordance with ASIC Instrument 2016/191.\n\n## 12  Proceedings on behalf of BHP Group Limited\n\nNo proceedings have been brought on behalf of BHP Group Limited, nor has any application been made, under section 237 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001.\n\n## 13  Performance in relation to environmental regulation\n\nBHP seeks to be compliant with all applicable environmental laws and regulations relevant to its operations. We monitor compliance on a regular basis, including through external and internal means, to minimise the risk of non-compliance. For more information on BHP's performance in relation to health, safety and the environment refer to OFR 6.8, 6.1 and 6.13.\n\nFor the purposes of section 299 (1)(f) of the Australian Corporations Act 2001, in FY2023 BHP was levied 10 fines in relation to environmental laws and regulations at our operated assets, the total amount payable being US$69,692.39.\n\n## 14  Additional information\n\nBHP Group Limited has a branch registered in the United Kingdom. The Group, through various subsidiaries, has also established branches in a number of other countries.\n\nThe Directors' Report is approved in accordance with a resolution of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDated: 22 August 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMike Henry Chief Executive Officer",

        "page_content": "## People and Remuneration Committee Chair letter to shareholders\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nI am pleased to introduce BHP's Remuneration Report for the financial year to 30 June 2023. During FY2023, the Remuneration Committee ( Committee ) continued to focus on achieving remuneration outcomes that both fairly reflect the performance of BHP and the contribution of our employees, and are aligned with the interests of shareholders and other key stakeholders.\n\n## Our approach and framework\n\nIn a year where we have reported two tragic fatalities, it is important we draw on our performancebased remuneration framework for BHP executives, which reinforces that health and safety is our most pressing priority. Understandably, and with the support of management, there has been an impact on remuneration outcomes from these events. Further detail is provided below.\n\nMore broadly, the Committee is focused on a remuneration approach that supports the Group's global strategy and enables us to attract, retain and motivate our executives while incentivising them to build a long-term sustainable and value-adding business. This is critical to delivering the best outcomes for all BHP shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs BHP is a global organisation, the Committee is also mindful of navigating the remuneration priorities and expectations of our executives and shareholders in multiple jurisdictions. At the 2022 AGM, we pleasingly received strong support for our remuneration framework and outcomes, with over 97 per cent voting in favour of the Remuneration Report.\n\nFY2023 represents the fourth year of operating our revised remuneration framework and we believe it is continuing to serve shareholders well. The key changes to variable remuneration for the CEO that took effect from 1 July 2019 were to significantly reduce the LTIP grant size from 400 per cent of base salary (on a face value basis) to 200 per cent, and to rebalance to a CDP award with a long-term focus. The CDP award is determined by a balanced scorecard and is delivered one-third as a cash award and two-thirds as an equity award that is deferred equally for two-year and five-year periods. This structure aligns participants' incentive remuneration with performance over the short, medium and long-term.\n\nAs of 1 July 2023, the Committee has become the People and Remuneration Committee. The focus on people has expanded and includes overseeing the implementation of the Group's key strategies and policies relating to people, including for the attraction, recruitment, motivation and retention of employees, remuneration, employee engagement, leadership and talent development, industrial relations and employee conduct.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe tragic deaths of two of our colleagues during the year have been deeply felt. Our absolute priority remains to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries at BHP.\n\nOur financial results for the year were strong, underpinned by reliable production together with capital and cost discipline as we managed lower commodity prices and inflationary pressures. Our balance sheet is robust and deliberately positioned to support portfolio growth in the commodities the world needs for population growth, urbanisation and decarbonisation.\n\nIn Canada, our investment in potash progresses at pace with first production at Jansen on track for the latter half of 2026, and we are creating a new copper province in South Australia following the acquisition of OZ Minerals. We are investing strategically in new ideas, technologies and countries through exploration and early-stage copper and nickel prospects to capture future growth opportunities.\n\nWe continue to build an inclusive, high-performance culture and a more sustainable business, which are key to our future competitiveness and ability to deliver sector-leading returns. Today, more than 35 per cent of our employees are female and we have increased Indigenous representation globally. We are taking action to reduce our operational GHG emissions through renewable electricity supplies and supporting the development of electric trucks, trains and light vehicles. As of today, BHP has among the lowest absolute operational GHG emissions of the major miners.\n\nCommodity demand has remained relatively robust in China and India even as developed world economies have slowed substantially. In the near term, China's trajectory is contingent on the effectiveness of recent policy measures. We expect buoyant growth in India with strong construction activity underpinning an expansion in steelmaking capacity. More broadly, there is increased recognition of the importance of critical minerals and strategies across the globe to incentivise investment in supply and demand, which provides opportunities and challenges.\n\n## FY2023 CDP\n\nThe FY2023 CDP scorecard used to assess Mike Henry's annual performance comprises stretching performance measures based on three elements - safety and sustainability (S&S, referred to in prior years as HSEC), financial and personal performance with respect to delivering a number of group performance elements. The Committee assessed the CEO's performance against these scorecard elements, which resulted in a FY2023 CDP outcome of 96 per cent against a target of 100 per cent (and 64 per cent of the maximum). Despite strong financial performance and having progressed a number of important strategic objectives, the CEO was uncomfortable with this level of award in the current environment and, having reflected on the two fatalities during the year after a four-year period of no fatalities, expressed his view to the Committee that it should consider a reduced CDP outcome for him of 90 per cent. The Committee took on board this feedback and exercised its downward discretion to determine a final outcome of 90 per cent against a target of 100 per cent (and 60 per cent of the maximum). The Board and Committee believe this outcome is appropriately aligned with BHP's values, the shareholder experience, and the interests of the Group's other key stakeholders.\n\nFor the S&S measures, the outcome took into account the two tragic fatalities at BHP's operated sites during FY2023. The weighting for significant HSEC events is 10 per cent of a total 25 per cent for the S&S measures. A negative 10 per cent impact was applied (before a further downwards discretion was applied as described above) and resulted in a zero outcome for significant HSEC events in FY2023. The progress in mitigating significant HSEC events during the year has otherwise been sound, with continued progress on the implementation of controls for sexual harassment, but with more to be done. For the sustainability measures within S&S, strong progress was made against both our climate change and Indigenous partnerships targets, and as a consequence of this, the CDP scorecard assessment for the S&S measures overall was 22 per cent out of a target of 25 per cent.\n\nFor the financial measures, after fully eliminating the impacts of commodity prices during the year, operating performance at our assets was slightly below the challenging targets set at the commencement of the year. The CDP scorecard assessment for the financial measure was 47 per cent out of a target of 50 per cent.\n\nThe financial measures outcome includes a negative 3 per cent impact from the costs of remediating the two issues relating to employee entitlements and allowances announced on 1 June 2023. These issues, dating back a number of years, affect a number of our current and former employees in Australia. Further detail is discussed in 6.6 People. Based on currently available information, the cost of remediating these issues is estimated to be US$280 million pre-tax, incorporating on-costs including associated superannuation and interest payments and this has been reflected in the Group's FY2023 financial results. BHP has self-reported to the Fair Work Ombudsman and engaged Protiviti, a global assurance firm, which is currently undertaking a thorough review of our payroll systems. We will monitor the outcome of the review and engagement with the regulatory authorities and these may consequently impact remuneration outcomes in the future.\n\nFrom a personal contribution perspective, the Committee considered Mike Henry's performance against his group measures. These included projects and initiatives in respect of social value, people, performance and portfolio. The Committee considered Mike's performance against his group objectives was slightly ahead of expectations and assessed it as 27 per cent against the target of 25 per cent.",

        "page_content": "The CDP scorecard outcomes for other ELT members and the short-term incentive pool applicable to the majority of BHP employees below the ELT level, were, like the CEO, below the 100 per cent target. For the same reasons as the CEO, the ELT also proposed a moderation to their final CDP outcomes to the Committee for consideration. The Committee considered this input and applied a downwards exercise of discretion to the CDP outcomes for this group, in addition to the zero outcome for significant HSEC events in FY2023.\n\n## 2018 LTIP award\n\nThe vesting outcome for the 2018 LTIP award was 100 per cent. The LTIP performance condition is relative TSR against two separate index measures - a sector peer group and MSCI World Index. BHP outperformed both the sector peer group and the MSCI World Index. The value of the 2018 LTIP award at the time of vesting in 2023 is above the value of the award at the time it was granted in 2018 due to the increase in share price and strong dividends during the five-year vesting period. In terms of value realised, 48 per cent is due to the value at the time the awards were granted and 52 per cent is due to share price appreciation and dividends. This reflects the experience of shareholders over the period.\n\nIn considering vesting of the 2018 LTIP award, the Board and Committee have also conducted their normal holistic review of business performance over the five years since the award was granted to ensure this level of vesting was appropriate. More information on the 2018 LTIP vesting outcome, including the five-year holistic business review covering S&S performance, profitability, cash flow, balance sheet health, returns to shareholders, corporate governance and conduct, is included in 3.3 FY2023 LTIP performance outcomes and 3.4 Overarching discretion and vesting underpin.\n\nAs noted above, from FY2020, we revised our remuneration framework to reduce the weighting of future LTIP grants in the overall CEO and other Executive KMP remuneration packages. Pre-existing grants remained on foot and vesting of these awards would be determined on the basis of existing service and performance conditions.\n\nMore information on the overall remuneration outcomes for the CEO for the year, and how the outcomes are aligned to performance during FY2023, is provided in 3.1 FY2023 remuneration received by the CEO. Having considered the overall remuneration outcome for the CEO carefully, the Committee concluded it was a fair reflection of performance and the experience of shareholders, and the application of any downwards discretion to the vesting of the LTIP was not warranted.\n\n## FY2024 remuneration\n\nFor FY2024, the Committee determined that the CEO's base salary would increase by 4 per cent, effective 1 September 2023. In making this decision, we have conducted updated benchmarking and considered the external market demand for global senior executive talent. We benchmark the CEO and other executives' remuneration against CEO and executive roles in other global companies of similar complexity, reach and industry, and also have regard to the relative size of comparator companies. This detailed benchmarking ensures BHP's executive remuneration remains competitive to attract, motivate and retain key talented executives and is consistent with the global market.\n\nThe Committee considers the CEO's base salary increase to be modest in this context, and it is below the median salary increase applied for other BHP employees. Other components of the CEO's total target remuneration (pension contributions, benefits, CDP and LTIP) remain unchanged and, where relevant, as percentages of base salary. A summary of the CEO's arrangements for FY2024 is set out below.\n\n| Fixed remuneration                                                                    | CDP                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | LTIP                                                                                                                                                                |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| -  Base salary US$1.820 million per  annum, an increase of 4% from  1 September 2023. | -  Target cash award of 80% of base salary (maximum 120%). -  Plus two awards of deferred shares each of equivalent value  to the cash award, vesting in two and five years, respectively. -  Three performance categories: | -  The LTIP grant is based on a face value of  200% of base salary. -  Our LTIP awards have challenging relative TSR  performance hurdles measured over five years. |\n| -  Pension contribution 10% of  base salary.                                          | -  S&S - 25% -  Financial - 50%                                                                                                                                                                                             | -  The LTIP grant is based on a face value of  200% of base salary. -  Our LTIP awards have challenging relative TSR  performance hurdles measured over five years. |\n\nThe majority of the CEO's remuneration package continues to be delivered in BHP equity, not in cash, and the CEO's remuneration is deliberately tied to the performance of the business. In addition, the CEO is required to meet a MSR of five times pre-tax base salary and this applies for two years post-retirement. This ensures the CEO's remuneration is aligned to the experience of BHP's shareholders. As at the date of this Report, the CEO's BHP shareholding is in excess of his MSR.\n\nThe Committee has also reviewed the base salaries and total target remuneration packages for other Executive KMP. The Committee determined these would also increase by 4 per cent, effective 1 September 2023. This increase is also based on updated benchmarking data and has regard to the global market for senior executive talent. An additional increase has been determined for Ragnar Udd reflecting his continued strong performance and development in role. Other aspects of other Executive KMP remuneration arrangements remain unchanged.\n\n## Remuneration outcomes for the Chair and Non-executive Directors\n\nFees for the Chair and Non-executive Directors are reviewed annually and are benchmarked against global companies of similar complexity, size, reach and industry. As a consequence of considering the updated benchmarking, global market positioning and peer company relativities, a decision has been made that the following fees will increase with effect from 1 July 2023: the Chair fee and the Non-executive Directors base fee will rise by 5 per cent and the fees for the Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Risk and Audit Committee will rise by 10 per cent. This is the first increase in fees for the Chair and Nonexecutive Directors since 2011 (and reductions were made in 2015 and 2017). The increases are considered appropriate given current benchmarking and the increased expectations, accountabilities and workloads of each of the Chair and Non-executive Directors. Having conducted this review, it was determined that there was no change required to the fees for other Committee roles or other allowances.\n\nIn FY2023, BHP acquired OZ Minerals, and as a consequence, modest fees were paid to certain Non-executive Directors for additional or extra services performed in FY2023 in connection with the acquisition.\n\n## Summary\n\nOur approach to executive remuneration is to deliberately align remuneration with performance and provide a significant component as at-risk variable pay. We are confident the outcomes this year are consistent with the performance of BHP and the experience of our shareholders while also recognising our critical need to attract, motivate and retain our executives in order to progress our strategic objectives and deliver the best outcomes for all BHP shareholders.\n\nWe look forward to ongoing dialogue with and the support of BHP's shareholders. As always, we welcome your feedback and comments on any aspect of this Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristine O'Reilly\n\nChair, People and Remuneration Committee",

No Director or executive is involved in deciding their own remuneration. The objective of the remuneration framework is to:\n\n- -  support the execution of the Group's business strategy\n- -  encourage and sustain a culture aligned to BHP's values, purpose and risk appetite, including in relation to non-financial risk\n- -  provide competitive remuneration, which is linked to performance, to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled executives on a global basis\n\nThe Board approves the remuneration arrangements and outcomes for the Chair and CEO on recommendation from the Committee.\n\n## People and Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Board has established the Committee to support and advise the Board on people and remuneration matters, as set out in the Committee Charter available at bhp.com. Each of the Committee members are independent Non-executive Directors. The current members of the Committee are: Christine O'Reilly (Chair), Catherine Tanna and Dion Weisler.\n\nFurther detail on the role and focus of the Committee can be found in 5.4 of the Corporate Governance Statement, and details of meeting attendances can be found in 2 Directors' Report.\n\nThe Committee has extensive access to members of senior management and regularly invites them to attend meetings to provide reports and updates. However, members of management are not present when decisions are considered or taken concerning their own remuneration. The Committee can also draw on services from a range of external sources, including independent remuneration advisers.\n\nThe Committee sets the remuneration framework for the Executive KMP, including the CEO. The Committee is briefed on and considers prevailing market and economic conditions where our Executive KMP are based, the competitive environment and the positioning and relativities of pay and employment conditions across the wider BHP workforce.\n\nThe Committee's approach to remuneration outcomes is that the fundamental driver should be performance and overall remuneration should be fair to the individual, and remuneration levels should be market competitive and accurately reflect the CEO's and other Executive KMP's responsibilities and contributions, while aligning with the expectations of our shareholders and considering the positioning and relativities of pay and employment conditions across the wider BHP workforce.\n\nThe Committee considers shareholder views and those of the wider community when setting this remuneration framework. We proactively engage directly with our institutional and investor representative shareholders regularly around the world to discuss remuneration and governance matters. This feedback is used as input into decision-making in relation to our remuneration framework and its application and ensures Directors are aware of matters raised and have a deep understanding of current shareholder and other stakeholder views when formulating remuneration decisions.\n\n## Engagement of independent remuneration advisers\n\nThe Committee may appoint and instruct expert advisers who are advisers solely to the Committee, including remuneration consultants to assist the Committee with advice in relation to the Group's remuneration strategy, framework and policies. The Committee may meet with external advisers without management being present. Potential conflicts of interest are taken into account when remuneration consultants are selected and their terms of engagement regulate their level of access to, and require their independence from, BHP's management.\n\nPwC was appointed to act as an independent remuneration adviser in FY2016 and is currently the only remuneration adviser appointed by the Committee. In that capacity, PwC may provide remuneration recommendations in relation to KMP, however, it did not provide any remuneration recommendations in FY2023.\n\n## Service contracts\n\nThe terms of employment for the CEO and Executive KMP are formalised in their employment contracts. The current contracts of the CEO and Executive KMP are not fixed term. BHP may choose to terminate a contract on up to 12 months' notice. BHP can require an executive to work through the notice period or may terminate the individual's contract immediately by paying base salary plus pension contributions in lieu of the notice period. The CEO and Executive KMP must provide up to 12 months' notice for voluntary resignation.\n\n## KMP for FY2023\n\nThis Remuneration Report describes the remuneration policies, practices, outcomes and governance for the KMP of BHP during FY2023. At BHP, KMP consists of the Directors (including the CEO), as well as certain members of our ELT who have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group directly or indirectly. For FY2023, after due consideration, the Committee determined the KMP comprised the following individuals:\n\n- -  Mike Henry, CEO and Executive Director\n- -  Edgar Basto, President Minerals Australia from 1 July 2022 to 30 September 2022 and Chief Operating Officer from 1 October 2022 to 30 June 2023. The Chief Operating Officer role is a new position that was created with effect from 1 October 2022\n- -  David Lamont, Chief Financial Officer\n- -  Geraldine Slattery, Senior Executive Officer from 1 July 2022 to 30 September 2022 and President Australia from 1 October 2022 to 30 June 2023. The Senior Executive Officer role ceased to exist from 1 October 2022\n- -  Ragnar Udd, President Americas\n- -  All Non-executive Directors - for details of Non-executive Directors, including dates of appointment or cessation (where relevant), refer to 2 Directors' Report\n\nThese individuals have held their positions and were KMP for the whole of FY2023, unless stated otherwise.",

        "page_content": "## 2  Executive KMP remuneration framework\n\nBHP has an overarching remuneration framework for Executive KMP that guides the Committee's decisions and is designed to support our strategy and reinforce our culture and values.\n\n## 2.1  How the remuneration framework is set\n\nThe four principles that underpin the remuneration framework for Executive KMP are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarket competitive to attract, motivate and retain high-quality and experienced executives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReinforce BHP's purpose and support the delivery of our strategy and behaviours aligned to Our Charter valuesRewards achievement of outperformance that balances long-term sustainability and risk appetite with shareholder wealth creation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimple and transparent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2  Remuneration framework operation\n\nThese principles are the same as those that apply to other employees, however Executive KMP arrangements have a greater emphasis on and a higher proportion of remuneration that is at-risk as performance-related variable pay.\n\nThe table below shows the components of our remuneration framework.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nMarket competitive fixed remuneration is paid in order to attract, motivate and retain high-quality and experienced executives, and provide appropriate remuneration for these important roles in the Group.\n\nBase salary, pension contributions and benefits.\n\nCompetitive fixed remuneration is aligned to global complexity, size, reach and industry, and reflects executives' responsibilities, location, skills, performance, qualifications and experience.\n\n## CDP\n\n## LTIP\n\nThe CDP is an annual cash and equity award that encourages and focuses executives' efforts for the relevant financial year on the delivery of the Group's strategic priorities, balancing financial and nonfinancial performance, to deliver short, medium and long-term success aligned to our purpose and Our Charter, and to motivate executives to strive to achieve stretch performance objectives.\n\nCash and deferred shares.\n\nAnnual variable pay opportunity provided in cash and two and five-year deferred shares with the outcome determined by the assessment of performance against a balanced scorecard linked to execution of business strategy. A balanced scorecard of short, medium and long-term elements including S&S (25% weighting), financial (50% weighting) and individual performance measures (25% weighting) are chosen on the basis that they are expected to have a significant short, medium and long-term impact on the success of the Group, with appropriate targets for each measure that will appropriately motivate executives to achieve outperformance that contributes to the long-term sustainability of the Group and shareholder wealth creation.\n\nThe LTIP is a long-term equity award that focuses executives' efforts on the achievement of sustainable long-term value creation and success of the Group (including appropriate management of business risks).\n\nPerformance rights.\n\nAnnual long-term variable pay opportunity allocated as awards of performance rights, which are subject to a five-year relative TSR performance condition. The performance rights are designed to align executives' reward with sustained shareholder wealth creation in excess of relevant comparator group(s), through the relative TSR performance condition.\n\nRelative TSR has been chosen as an appropriate measure as it enables an objective external assessment over a sustained period on a basis that is familiar to shareholders.",

This is an important mitigation against the risk of unintended award outcomes.\n\nCDP awards are provided as cash and two awards of deferred shares, each of equivalent value to the cash award, vesting in two and five years, respectively.\n\nAwards of deferred shares comprise rights to receive ordinary BHP shares in the future at the end of the deferral periods. Before the awards vest, these rights are not ordinary shares and do not carry entitlements to ordinary dividends or other shareholder rights; however, a DEP is provided on vested awards. The Committee also has a discretion to settle CDP deferred shares in cash.\n\nVesting of five-year deferred shares under the CDP is underpinned by a holistic review of performance at the end of the five-year vesting period, including a review of S&S performance, profitability, cash flow, balance sheet health, returns to shareholders, corporate governance and conduct over the five-year period.\n\nOn cessation of employment, a 'good leaver' 1 may receive a pro-rated cash award based on performance for that year. For a 'good leaver', their unvested CDP deferred awards generally remain on foot (wholly or in part) unless the Committee determines otherwise. If the executive is not a 'good leaver', all unvested CDP deferred awards will lapse.\n\nVesting of the LTIP award is dependent on BHP's TSR relative to the TSR of relevant comparator group(s) over a five-year performance period.\n\nAchievement against each TSR hurdle is assessed by the Committee and the Board, based on external data reviewed and confirmed by independent remuneration consultants.\n\n25% of the award will vest where BHP's TSR is equal to the median TSR of the relevant comparator group(s), as measured over the performance period. Where TSR is below the median, awards will not vest.\n\nVesting occurs on a sliding scale between the median TSR of the relevant comparator group(s) up to a nominated level of TSR outperformance over the relevant comparator group(s), as determined by the Committee, above which 100% of the award will vest.\n\nWhere the TSR performance condition is not met, there is no retesting and awards will lapse. The Committee also retains discretion to lapse any portion or all of the award where it considers the vesting outcome is not appropriate given Group or individual performance, or other circumstances apply that makes the vesting outcome an inappropriate outcome. This is an important mitigation against the risk of unintended outcomes.\n\nLTIP awards consist of rights to receive ordinary BHP shares in the future if the performance and service conditions are met.\n\nBefore vesting, these rights are not ordinary shares and do not carry entitlements to ordinary dividends or other shareholder rights; however, a DEP is provided on vested awards. The Committee also has a discretion to settle LTIP awards in cash.\n\nVesting of five-year performance rights under the LTIP is underpinned by a holistic review of performance at the end of the five-year performance period, including a review of S&S performance, profitability, cash flow, balance sheet health, returns to shareholders, corporate governance and conduct over the five-year period.\n\nOn cessation of employment, for a 'good leaver' 1 their unvested LTIP awards generally remain on foot on termination and are pro-rated for the portion of the vesting period served. These awards are eligible for vesting in the ordinary course, subject to any applicable performance conditions. If the executive is not a 'good leaver', all unvested LTIP awards will lapse.\n\nIn FY2022 we enhanced our malus and clawback policy.

        "page_content": "## 3  Remuneration for the CEO and other Executive KMP\n\nThe amount of remuneration actually received each year depends on the achievement of business and individual performance measures that generate sustained shareholder value. Before deciding on the final incentive outcomes for the CEO and other Executive KMP, the Committee considers the achievement of pre-determined performance conditions. The Committee then applies its overarching discretion to determine what it considers to be a fair and commensurate remuneration level in order to decide if the outcome should be reduced. In this way, the Committee believes it can set a remuneration level for the CEO and other Executive KMP that is sufficient to incentivise and is also fair and commensurate with shareholder expectations and prevailing market conditions.\n\n## 3.1  FY2023 remuneration received by the CEO\n\nThe table below is a voluntary non-statutory disclosure of the remuneration received by the CEO during FY2023 and FY2022. This table is unaudited and differs from the audited remuneration calculated in accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards (refer to 5.1 KMP remuneration table and Financial Statements note 26 'Employee share ownership plans'). This table is designed to provide greater transparency for shareholders and reflects actual remuneration received, with the CDP and LTIP included below representing those amounts that have been received as a consequence of satisfying performance conditions in the relevant financial year.\n\nThe difference between the disclosure in the table below and the remuneration disclosed in 5.1 KMP remuneration table relates to the CDP and LTIP. The remuneration calculated in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards requires the fair value of the CDP and LTIP to be calculated at the time of grant and to be amortised over the relevant vesting periods regardless of the performance outcome. This may not reflect what the executive receives. In the table below, the CDP and LTIP values relate to the performance outcomes and actual amount received each year under the CDP (i.e. against the CDP scorecard) and the LTIP (i.e. based on the LTIP vesting outcome).\n\nDetails of the components of remuneration are contained in 2 Executive KMP remuneration framework and the values in the table are explained further in the notes below.\n\n| US$('000)   |        | Base salary   |   Benefits 1 |   Pension 2 | CDP   | LTIP 4   | Total   |\n|-------------|--------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------|----------|---------|\n| Mike Henry  | FY2023 | 1,742         |            7 |         174 | 3,762 | 8,032    | 13,717  |\n|             | FY2022 | 1,700         |          168 |         170 | 3,917 | 9,353    | 15,308  |\n\n- 3 The values shown are the full CDP value (cash and deferred equity) earned based on performance during FY2023 and FY2022. The FY2023 CDP award will be provided one-third in cash in September 2023 and two-thirds in deferred equity, with one-third due to vest at the end of FY2025 and one-third due to vest at the end of FY2028 (on the terms of the CDP). The FY2022 CDP award was provided one-third in cash in September 2022 and two-thirds in deferred equity, with one-third due to vest at the end of FY2024 and one-third due to vest at the end of FY2027 (on the terms of the CDP).\n- 4   The LTIP award values for FY2023 and FY2022 are based on the full awards Mike Henry received in 2018 and 2017, respectively, when he was President Operations, Minerals Australia (prior to becoming and with no proration applied for time as CEO), and 100 per cent of the awards vesting. The 2018 LTIP award value in FY2023 is an estimate calculated on the average share price for the month of July 2023 (which will be updated for the actual share price on the vesting date in the 2024 Remuneration Report); whereas the 2017 LTIP award value in FY2022 was calculated on the actual share price on the vesting date (and updated from the 2022 Remuneration Report in which the value was an estimate calculated on the average share price for the month of July 2022).\n\nA revised remuneration framework took effect from 1 July 2019 and significantly reduced the LTIP grant size for the CEO from 400 per cent of base salary (on a face value basis) to 200 per cent and a rebalancing to a CDP award with a long-term focus. As a result, the remuneration for Mike Henry reported above reflects the transition to this structure and includes the full amounts of the CDP award earned during FY2023 and FY2022 (i.e. irrespective that some elements of the CDP award are deferred) together with the full amounts of the pre-existing LTIP awards vesting at the end of FY2023 and FY2022 which were granted in 2018 and 2017, respectively (i.e. when the LTIP award size was double the current grant size).\n\nHad the current remuneration framework been in place when Mike's 2018 and 2017 LTIP awards were granted and a reduced size awarded, the reported LTIP values would have been US$4.016 million for FY2023 and US$4.677 million for FY2022 (instead of US$8.032 and US$9.353 million in the table above). The reported total remuneration would have therefore been US$9.701 million for FY2023 and US$10.632 million for FY2022 (instead of US$13.717 million and US$15.308 million in the table above).\n\n## 3.2  FY2023 CDP performance outcomes\n\nThe Board and the Committee assessed the Executive KMP's CDP outcomes in light of the Group's performance in FY2023 and took into account performance against the measures in each Executive KMP's CDP scorecard.\n\nFor the CEO, the Board and the Committee assessment against the CDP scorecard measures resulted in a CDP outcome for FY2023 at 96 per cent against the target of 100 per cent (or 64 per cent against maximum). Despite strong financial performance and having progressed a number of important strategic objectives, the CEO was uncomfortable with this level of award in the current environment and, having reflected on the two fatalities during the year after a four-year period of no fatalities, expressed his view to the Committee that it should consider a reduced CDP outcome for him of 90 per cent. The Committee took on board this feedback and exercised its downward discretion to determine a final outcome of 90 per cent against a target of 100 per cent (and 60 per cent of the maximum).\n\nThe CEO's final CDP scorecard outcome for FY2023 is summarised in the following tables, including a narrative description of each performance measure and the CEO's level of achievement, as determined by the Committee and approved by the Board. The level of performance for each measure is determined based on a range of threshold (the minimum necessary to qualify for any reward outcome), target (where the performance requirements are met), and maximum (where the performance requirements are significantly exceeded).\n\n## Summary of outcomes for the CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Performance measure   | Performance measure                             | Weighting   for FY2023   | Threshold   | Target   | Maximum   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|----------|-----------|\n|                       | S&S                     Significant HSEC events | 10%                      |             |          |           |\n|                       | Sustainability                                  | 15%                      |             |          |           |\n| Financial             | Financial                                       | 50%                      |             |          |           |\n| Group                 | Group                                           | 25%                      |             |          |           |\n| Sub-total             | Sub-total                                       | 100%                     |             |          |           |\n| Committee discretion  | Committee discretion                            |                          |             |          |           |\n| Total                 | Total                                           | 100%                     |             |          |           |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As it has done for several years, when assessing S&S performance against the scorecard targets, the Committee seeks guidance from the Sustainability Committee. The Committee has taken a holistic view of Group performance in critical areas, including considering any additional matters outside the scorecard targets that the Sustainability Committee has provided and considers relevant.\n\nThe performance commentary below is provided against the significant HSEC events (including fatalities) scorecard targets, which were set on the basis of operated assets only.\n\n## Significant HSEC events\n\n## Scorecard targets\n\nNo significant health, safety (including fatalities), environment or community events during the year.\n\n## Performance against scorecard targets\n\n- -  In what is clearly a tragic and unacceptable outcome, we lost two of our colleagues during FY2023, one in February 2023 at Western Australia Iron Ore and one in April 2023 at Olympic Dam. Our imperative is to continue to build our focus on fatality elimination and safety through field leadership, hazard identification and effective risk management.\n- -  The weighting of fatalities is 10 percentage points of the total 25 percentage points allocated to the whole S&S category. This results in a zero outcome for this measure.\n- -  No other significant health, environment or community incidents occurred during FY2023.\n\nMeasure outcome Zero\n\nThe performance commentary below is provided against the sustainability scorecard targets, which were set on the basis of operated assets only\n\n## Climate change\n\n## Scorecard targets\n\nReported Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions at our operated assets in FY2023 are at 10.7MtCO2-e.\n\n>95% of study phase decarbonisation projects are presented for tollgates or milestones as scheduled.\n\nDeliver majority of laboratory scale research scoped for FY2023, progress Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) level commitments to detailed project proposals, and complete design study on the potential for a multiparty consortium.\n\nMeasure outcome Above target, close to maximum\n\n## Indigenous partnerships\n\n## Scorecard targets\n\nNo significant cultural heritage events during the year.\n\nAchieve significant uplift from FY2022 total global spend on Indigenous, Traditional Owner and First Nations vendor procurement, achieve FY2023 Indigenous employment participation targets and release a revised Global Indigenous Peoples Strategy.\n\n## Performance against scorecard targets\n\n- -  For FY2023, we improved on our operational GHG emissions scorecard target of 10.7 MtCO2-e, with an outcome of 9.8 MtCO2-e. This was better than performance of 5% or more below the target, which was required for a maximum outcome. However, having reviewed actual production levels at certain operated assets, the outcome for this measure was determined by the Committee to still be above target, but not quite at a maximum outcome\n- -  100% of study phase decarbonisation projects were progressed as planned, exceeding the scorecard target outcome. A decarbonisation trial in relation to a CAT battery early learner truck was commenced, which was required for a maximum outcome.\n\n## Performance against scorecard targets\n\n- -  No significant cultural heritage incidents occurred during FY2023.\n- -  Indigenous, Traditional Owner and First Nations vendor procurement significantly exceeded targets set with US$333 million in Indigenous procurement spend in FY2023 (a 122% uplift from FY2022). Our overall FY2023 Indigenous employment participation targets were met.\n- -  The delivery of 100% of laboratory scale research scoped for FY2023 was achieved; MOU level commitments towards GHG emission reduction were achieved, including under agreements with JFE Steel, HBIS Group, ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel, POSCO, Zenith Steel and China Baowu; a design study on the potential for a multiparty consortium was achieved for a carbon capture, utilisation and storage hub and we announced a partnership with Hatch to commence a design study to pilot an electric smelting furnace (all required to achieve the scorecard target). Additionally, we have secured agreements for pilots and trials with customers targeted at enabling the reduction of carbon emission intensity by at least 10% (this being required to achieve a maximum outcome).\n\nWe released a revised global Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement following global consultation with Indigenous partners (all required to achieve target). Additionally, we implemented formal mechanisms in all regions to incorporate Indigenous voices in decision making (this being required to achieve a maximum outcome).\n\nMeasure outcome Maximum\n\nThe overall outcome against the total S&S measures for FY2023 was 22 per cent out of the target of 25 per cent, with a zero outcome against a target of 10 per cent for the significant HSEC events measure and an outcome of 22 per cent against a target of 15 per cent for sustainability measures.",

ROCE is the key financial measure against which CDP outcomes for our senior executives are measured and is, in our view, a relevant measure to assess the financial performance of the Group for this purpose. While ROCE excludes exceptional items, the Committee reviews each exceptional item to assess if it should be included in the result when determining the ROCE CDP outcome.\n\nWhen we are assessing management's performance, we make adjustments to the ROCE result to allow for changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange movements and other material items (from the levels assumed in setting the targets) to ensure the assessment appropriately measures outcomes that are within the control and influence of the Group and its executives. Of these, changes in commodity prices have historically been the most material due to volatility in prices and the impact on Group revenue and ROCE. As it has done for several years, the Committee seeks guidance each year from the Risk and Audit Committee when assessing financial performance against scorecard targets.\n\n## ROCE\n\n## Scorecard targets\n\nFor FY2023, the target for ROCE was 29.9%, with a threshold of 25.6% and a maximum of 33.5%.\n\nAchievement of the ROCE target will result in a target CDP outcome. The ROCE target considers the upside opportunities and downside risks inherent in BHP's businesses, and is an outcome the Committee believes would be a level of performance that shareholders would view positively. The maximum and threshold are an appropriate range of ROCE outcomes, given the upside opportunities and downside risks, which represent an upper limit of stretch outperformance that would represent the maximum CDP award, and a lower limit of underperformance below which no CDP award should be made.\n\nThe performance range around target is subject to a greater level of downside risk than there is upside opportunity, mainly due to physical and regulatory asset constraints. Accordingly, the range between threshold and target is somewhat greater than that between target and maximum. For maximum, the Committee takes care not to create leveraged incentives that encourage executives to push for short-term performance that goes beyond our risk appetite and current operational capacity.\n\nThe Committee retains and has a track record of applying downward discretion (but not upwards discretion) to ensure the CDP outcome is appropriately aligned with the overall performance of the Group for the year, and is fair and equitable to management and shareholders.\n\n## Performance against scorecard targets\n\nROCE of 28.8% was reported by BHP for FY2023. Adjusted for the factors outlined below, ROCE is 29.3%, which is slightly below target. The following adjustments were made to ensure the outcomes appropriately reflect the performance of management for the year:\n\n- -  The full elimination of the impacts of movements in commodities prices and exchange rates decreased ROCE by 0.8 percentage points.\n- -  Adjustments for other material items made to ensure the outcomes reflect the performance of management for the year increased ROCE by 1.3 percentage points. This was mainly due to the elimination of the negative effect on reported ROCE outcomes of higher asset values in the closing balance sheet due to the acquisition of OZ Minerals late in FY2023. This adjustment was necessary to ensure the basis of the ROCE outcome for CDP purposes was the same as the basis upon which the ROCE target for FY2023 was set.\n- -  Having reviewed the FY2023 exceptional items (as described in Financial Statements note 3 'Exceptional items'), the Committee determined these should not be considered for the purposes of determining the FY2023 ROCE CDP outcome and that no further action was required in respect of exceptional items.\n\nThe key driver of the FY2023 ROCE outcome of 29.3% being slightly below the target for FY2023 of 29.9% set at the commencement of the year was the inclusion of the costs of remediating the two employee entitlements and allowances issues announced on 1 June 2023. Otherwise, in Minerals Australia and Minerals Americas, performance was broadly in line with the CDP targets set at the commencement of the year.\n\nMeasure outcome Slightly below target\n\nThe outcome against the ROCE measure for FY2023 was 47 per cent out of the target of 50 per cent.\n\nAs noted above, the financial measures outcome includes a negative 3 per cent impact from the costs of remediating the two employee entitlements and allowances issues announced on 1 June 2023. These issues, dating back a number of years, affect a number of our current and former employees in Australia. Further detail is discussed in 6.6 People. Based on currently available information, the cost of remediating these issues is estimated to be US$280 million pre-tax, incorporating on-costs including associated superannuation and interest payments and this has been reflected in the Group's FY2023 financial results. BHP has self-reported to the Fair Work Ombudsman and engaged Protiviti, a global assurance firm, which is currently undertaking a thorough review of our payroll systems. We will monitor the outcome of the review and engagement with the regulatory authorities and these may consequently impact remuneration outcomes in the future.",

The application of group measures remains an important element of effective performance management. These measures seek to provide a balance between the financial and non-financial performance requirements that maintain our position as a leader in our industry. The CEO's group measures for FY2023 included contribution to BHP's overall performance and the management team, and the delivery of projects and initiatives within the scope of the CEO role as specified by the Board, as set out in the table below.\n\n## Social value\n\n## Scorecard targets\n\nFinalise the launch and successful public positioning of the revised global Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement and ensure it is embedded across the business.\n\n## Measure outcome Above target\n\n## People\n\n## Scorecard targets\n\nIncrease in female participation by 3 percentage points.\n\nEngagement and Perception Survey (EPS) improvement survey-on-survey over the year and substantively improve lower performing teams.\n\nEnsure the successful execution of the FY2023 critical programs of work under the Sexual Harassment strategy.\n\nMeasure outcome Slightly below target\n\n## Performance\n\n## Scorecard targets\n\n>90% of BHP Operating System (BOS) deployments completed, >90% Operational Excellence Indicator (OEI) improving assessment-on-assessment for sites in 'sustain', and OEI > 40 at end of deployments.\n\nSimplification of the capital investment lifecycle, improved culture, capability and standards embedded globally to accelerate improvements in capital efficiency.\n\nDeliver material progress on the Brazil strategy.\n\nMeasure outcome Slightly below target\n\n## Portfolio\n\n## Scorecard targets\n\nExecute against the strategy and plan with respect to OZ Minerals as agreed by the Board.\n\nProgress growth levers:\n\n- -  investments in early-stage future-facing commodity growth options;\n- -  develop and embed Innovation options in the business plan;\n- -  accelerate Jansen Stage 2; and\n- -  continue to build the exploration pipeline and commence exploration activities in new areas.\n\nMeasure outcome Above target\n\nOverall, the performance of the CEO against the group measures for FY2023 was assessed as slightly ahead of expectations and warranted an outcome of 27 per cent against the target of 25 per cent.\n\n## Performance against scorecard targets\n\n- -  The global Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement was developed and successfully launched following extensive engagement with Traditional Owners and First Nations organisations, investors, and employees.\n- -  In conjunction with this, we accelerated mutually beneficial relationships with 12 Traditional Owners and 10 First Nations groups through agreement making programs in support of asset plans. Assets partnered with our Indigenous Engagement teams to progress sensitive cultural heritage issues with Traditional Owners and worked with Traditional Owners to achieve exploration agreements, together with entering into several significant Indigenous partnerships.\n\n## Performance against scorecard targets\n\n- -  Female participation increased in FY2023 by 2.9 percentage points to 35.2% at 30 June 2023, compared to 32.3% at 30 June 2022.\n- -  Our EPS survey results continue to see us placed in the top quartile of the Global Companies Benchmark, with an improvement survey-on-survey over the year, with engagement increasing 1 percentage point since last year. There was a 25% improvement in lower performing teams, which was a focus for the EPS.\n- -  In FY2023, the Sexual Harassment Prevention Project Management Office continued to increase transparency, drive accountability and rigorous governance, incorporate organisational lessons learned and best practice into key programs of work and regularly engage senior management and the Board. Most critical programs of work were delivered, however, there is more to do in respect of Active Bystander and Contractor training.\n\n## Performance against scorecard targets\n\n- -  Our BOS deployment is ahead of target (94% deployment across assets and functions versus the target of >90%). There has been an improvement in OEI scores assessment-on-assessment for 88% of all sites, while only 80% of sites in sustain (against target of >90%) have shown an improvement. 85% of sites reached an OEI >40 by the end of their deployment.\n- -  Initiatives implemented in FY2023 to simplify the investment lifecycle, reduce schedule time and increase efficiency, included simplifying the Our Requirements for Capital Projects standard to reduce review time for less complex projects, deploying a Global Projects Onboarding Tool and deploying a centralised resource hub for projects standards, tools, and templates to improve efficiency and reduce rework. Key capabilities and standards were embedded globally to improve capital efficiency, including the creation of a Global Value Optimisation tool to facilitate the capture of capital efficiency improvements.\n- -  Significant progress has been made on the Renova Priority Programs. Over 500 community resettlement cases were completed. More than 94,000 compensation payments have been made and 301,000 compensation claims closed. In relation to Samarco's judicial reorganisation, negotiations with a group of Samarco's lenders have resulted in an 'in principle' agreement which will form the basis for a resolution of the reorganisation.\n\n## Performance against scorecard targets\n\n- -  The OZ Minerals acquisition was successfully executed via a Scheme of Arrangement with an approval from OZ Minerals shareholders. Day one proceeded to plan with safe and stable operations. The critical milestones of the first payroll and first month-end reporting also ran smoothly. Integration is on track, with a strong focus on people and synergies.\n- -  Progress has been positive with respect to growth levers. We evaluated over 10 opportunities which led to the completion of 4 investments in future-facing commodities. In the Innovation space 2 initiatives moved from the develop stage to the demonstrate phase. The Jansen Stage 2 identification phase study was approved in October 2022. There has been strong progress in exploration screening activities and physical exploration work has commenced in 5 new search spaces.",

        "page_content": "The CDP performance measures for other Executive KMP for FY2023 are similar to those of the CEO outlined above. However, for the other Executive KMP, the weighting of each performance measure will vary to reflect the focus required from each Executive KMP role. As with the CEO, individual performance measures are determined at the start of the financial year. These include the other Executive KMP's contribution to the delivery of projects and initiatives within the scope of their role and the overall performance of the Group. Individual performance of other Executive KMP was reviewed against these measures by the Committee and, on average, were considered to have largely met expectations but warranted an outcome slightly below target. For the same reasons as the CEO, the ELT also proposed a moderation to their final CDP outcomes for consideration. The Committee considered this input and applied a downwards exercise of discretion to the CDP outcomes for this group, in addition to the zero outcome for significant HSEC events in FY2023.\n\nThe diagram below represents the FY2023 CDP weightings and outcomes against the original scorecard for other Executive KMP.\n\n|            | Performance categories   | Other Executive  KMP with region  responsibility   | Other Executive  KMP without region  responsibility   | Threshold   | Target   | Maximum   |\n|------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|-----------|\n| S&S        | Group                    | 12.5%                                              | 25%                                                   |             |          |           |\n|            | Region                   | 12.5%                                              | 0%                                                    |             |          |           |\n| Financial  | Group                    | 25%                                                | 50%                                                   |             |          |           |\n|            | Region                   | 25%                                                | 0%                                                    |             |          |           |\n| Individual |                          | 25%                                                | 25%                                                   |             |          |           |\n\n- BHP Minerals Australia Minerals America\n\n## 3.3  FY2023 LTIP performance outcomes\n\nThe five-year performance period for the 2018 LTIP award for relevant Executive KMP ended on 30 June 2023. Vesting is subject to the achievement of the relative TSR performance conditions and any discretion applied by the Committee (refer to 3.4 Overarching discretion and vesting underpin).\n\nFor the 2018 LTIP award to vest in full, BHP's TSR over the performance period from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2023 must have been at or exceeded the 80th percentile of the Sector Group TSR and the MSCI World Index TSR (World TSR). TSR includes returns to BHP shareholders in the form of share price movements along with dividends paid and reinvested in BHP (including cash and in-specie dividends).\n\nBHP's TSR performance was positive 128.4 per cent over the five-year period from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2023. This is above the 80th percentile of the Sector Group TSR of positive 97.3 per cent and above the 80th percentile of the World TSR of positive 92.0 per cent over the same period. This level of performance results in 100 per cent vesting for the 2018 LTIP award. The value of the CEO's vested 2018 LTIP award has been reported in 3.1 FY2023 remuneration received by the CEO.\n\nThe graph below shows BHP's performance relative to comparator groups.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe value of the 2018 LTIP award at the time of vesting in 2023 is higher than the value of the award at the time it was granted in 2018. The share price has risen appreciably during the five-year period and there have been strong dividends. Of the value realised, 48 per cent is due to the value at the time the awards were granted and 52 per cent is due to share price appreciation and dividends. This value increment due to share price appreciation and dividends is consistent with the experience of shareholders over the period.\n\n## 3.4  Overarching discretion and vesting underpin\n\nThe rules of the CDP and LTIP and the terms and conditions of the awards provide the Committee with an overarching discretion to reduce the number of awards that will vest, notwithstanding that the performance conditions or the relevant service conditions have been met.\n\nThis overarching discretion is a holistic, qualitative judgement and is applied as an underpin test before final vesting is confirmed. It is an important risk management tool to ensure vesting is not simply driven by a formula or the passage of time that may give unexpected or unintended remuneration outcomes.\n\nThe Committee considers its discretion carefully each year ahead of the scheduled vesting of CDP and LTIP equity awards in August. It considers performance holistically over the five-year period, including a five-year 'look back' on S&S performance, profitability, cash flow, balance sheet health, returns to shareholders, corporate governance and conduct. For the five years from FY2019 to FY2023, the Committee noted BHP's continued progress in S&S outcomes (noting, however, the two fatalities in the current year have been taken into account in determining CDP outcomes for FY2023), strong",

The Committee noted the two employee entitlements and allowances issues announced on 1 June 2023, including the impact on CDP outcomes for FY2023, and intends to monitor the outcome of the review underway and engagement with the regulatory authorities and this may consequently impact remuneration outcomes in the future.\n\nSecondly, in respect of the vesting of the 2018 LTIP five-year performance rights, the formulaic outcome of the 2018 LTIP was 100 per cent vesting. Having undertaken the 'look back' review described above, the Committee concluded the vesting outcome was appropriate given Group and individual performance, and that no reasons were identified to warrant the exercise of its downwards discretion. There is no upwards discretion available to the Committee in respect of the LTIP and the overarching discretion may only reduce the number of awards that may vest.\n\n## 3.5  LTIP allocated during FY2023\n\nFollowing shareholder approval at the 2022 AGM, 118,853 LTIP awards (in the form of performance rights) were granted to the CEO on 22 November 2022. The face value of the CEO's award was 200 per cent of his base salary of US$1.750 million at the time of grant. The fair value of the awards is ordinarily calculated by multiplying the face value of the award by the fair value factor of 41 per cent (for the current plan design, as determined by the independent adviser to the Committee). The 118,853 LTIP awards for the CEO was determined based on the US$ face value of the LTIP awards of US$3.500 million and calculated using the average share price and US$/A$ exchange rate over the 12 months up to and including 30 June 2022. LTIP awards granted to other Executive KMP during FY2023 were determined on the same basis as described above for the CEO, except that awards for other Executive KMP had a face value of 175 per cent of base salary.\n\nIn addition to the LTIP terms set out in 2 Executive KMP remuneration framework, the Committee determined the following terms for the 2022 LTIP:\n\n| Performance period      | -  1 July 2022 to 30 June 2027                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performance  conditions | -  Vesting is conditional on two relative TSR performance measures. -  BHP's TSR relative to the median TSR of the MSCI World Metals and Mining Index (Sector Group TSR) and the MSCI World Index                      |\n| Performance  conditions | -  An averaging period of six months will be used in the TSR calculations.                                                                                                                                             |\n| Performance  conditions | (World TSR) will determine the vesting of 67% and 33% of the award, respectively.  -  For each portion of the award to vest in full, BHP's TSR must be at or exceed the 80th percentile of the Sector Group TSR or the |\n\n## 3.6  FY2024 remuneration for the CEO and other Executive KMP\n\nThe remuneration for the CEO and other Executive KMP in FY2024 will be in accordance with 2.2 Remuneration framework operation and the main elements are set out in the table below.\n\n| Base salary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | CDP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Base salaries are reviewed and benchmarked  annually against external market demand for  senior executive talent to ensure they remain  competitive.

Non-executive  Directors are paid a base fee and relevant committee membership fees.  Committee Chairs and the Senior Independent Director are paid an  additional fee to reflect their extra responsibilities.  All fee levels are reviewed annually and any changes are ordinarily  effective from 1 July.  Fee levels reflect the size and complexity of the Group and the  geographies where the Group operates. The economic environment | Travel allowances are paid on a per-trip basis reflecting the  considerable travel burden imposed on members of the Board as  a consequence of the global nature of the organisation and apply  when a Director needs to travel to attend a Board meeting or site  visits at our multiple geographic locations. As a consequence of our prior dual listed company structure, Non- executive Directors are required to prepare personal tax returns  in Australia and the UK, regardless of whether they reside in one  or neither of those countries. They are accordingly reimbursed for |\n\n## Letters of appointment\n\nThe Board has adopted a letter of appointment that contains the terms on which Non-executive Directors will be appointed, including the basis upon which they will be indemnified by the Group. The Board has adopted a policy under which all Non-executive Directors must seek re-election at the AGM each year. As a result of requiring re-election each year, Non-executive Directors do not have a fixed term in their letter of appointment.\n\nThe maximum aggregate fees payable to Non-executive Directors (including the Chair) were approved by shareholders at the 2008 AGMs at US$3.800 million per annum. This sum includes base fees, Committee fees and pension contributions. Travel allowances and non-monetary benefits are not included in this limit.\n\n## Payments on early termination or loss of office\n\nThere are no provisions in any of the Non-executive Directors' appointment arrangements for compensation payable on early termination of their directorship. A Non-executive Director may resign on reasonable notice. No payments are made to Non-executive Directors on loss of office.\n\n## 4.2  Non-executive Directors' remuneration in FY2023 and FY2024\n\nThe remuneration for the Non-executive Directors was paid in FY2023 and will be paid in FY2024 in accordance with the remuneration framework set out above. Fee levels for the Non-executive Directors and the Chair are reviewed annually. The review includes benchmarking against peer companies, with the assistance of external advisers (but not by the Committee-appointed independent remuneration adviser).\n\nAs a consequence of considering the updated benchmarking, global market positioning and peer company relativities, a decision has been made that the following fees will increase with effect from 1 July 2023: the Chair fee and the Non-executive Directors base fee will rise by 5 per cent and the fees for the Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Risk and Audit Committee will rise by 10 per cent. This is the first increase in fees for the Chair and Nonexecutive Directors since 2011 (and reductions were made in 2015 and 2017). The increases are considered appropriate given current benchmarking and the increased expectations, accountabilities and workloads of each of the Chair and Non-executive Directors. Having conducted this review, it was determined that there was no change required to the fees for other Committee roles or other allowances.\n\nThe below table sets out the annualised total remuneration and total fixed fees for both FY2023 and FY2024 (including the increases from 1 July 2023). Non-executive Directors do not have any performance-based at-risk remuneration or receive any equity awards as part of their remuneration, therefore the totals shown below are total remuneration and total fixed fee.\n\n| Levels of fees and travel allowances for Non-executive Directors (in US$)   | FY2023                              | FY2024                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Base annual fee                                                             | 160,000                             | 168,000                             |\n| Plus additional fees for:                                                   |                                     |                                     |\n| Senior Independent Director                                                 | 48,000                              | 53,000                              |\n| Committee Chair:                                                            |                                     |                                     |\n| Risk and Audit                                                              | 60,000                              | 66,000                              |\n| People and Remuneration                                                     | 45,000                              | 45,000                              |\n| Sustainability                                                              | 45,000                              | 45,000                              |\n| Nomination and Governance                                                   | No additional fee No additional fee | No additional fee No additional fee |\n| Committee membership:                                                       |                                     |                                     |\n| Risk and Audit                                                              | 32,500                              | 32,500                              |\n| People and Remuneration                                                     | 27,500                              | 27,500                              |\n| Sustainability                                                              | 27,500                              | 27,500                              |\n| Nomination and Governance                                                   | 18,000                              | 18,000                              |\n| Travel allowance: 1                                                         |                                     |                                     |\n| Less than 10 hours                                                          | 7,000                               | 7,000                               |\n| 10 hours or more                                                            | 15,000                              | 15,000                              |\n| Chair's fee                                                                 | 880,000                             | 925,000                             |\n\n- 1 In relation to travel for Board and shareholder meetings, the time thresholds relate to a flight time in excess of three hours to travel to the meeting location (i.e. one way flight time).

CDP is provided one-third in cash and two-thirds in deferred equity (which are included in the Share-based payments columns of the table). The cash portion of CDP awards is paid in September of the year following the relevant financial year. The minimum possible value awarded to each individual is nil and the maximum is 360 per cent of base salary (120 per cent in cash and 240 per cent in deferred equity). For FY2023, Executive KMP earned the following CDP awards as a percentage of the maximum (the remaining portion has been forfeited): Mike Henry 60 per cent, Edgar Basto 60 per cent, David Lamont 63 per cent, Geraldine Slattery 58 per cent, and Ragnar Udd 65 per cent.\n- 3 Non-monetary benefits are non-pensionable and include items such as net leave accruals, private family health insurance, car parking, fringe benefits tax and personal tax return preparation in required countries.\n- 4 Other benefits are non-pensionable and for FY2023 include a one-off relocation allowance (with no trailing entitlements) provided to Geraldine Slattery relating to her international relocation from the United States to Australia. For FY2022, other benefits include a sign-on award provided to David Lamont on commencement of employment; an encashment of annual leave entitlements under the US annual leave policy for Geraldine Slattery, together with a retention award for Geraldine to ensure her services were retained by BHP after the August 2021 announcement of the merger of the Petroleum business with Woodside. The majority of the amounts disclosed for benefits for Non-executive Directors are usually travel allowances (amounts of between US$nil and US$105,000 for FY2023) however, the COVID-19 pandemic restricted Non-executive Director travel during FY2022. For FY2023, amounts of between US$nil and US$3,000 are included in respect of tax return preparation; and amounts of between US$nil and US$1,400 are included in respect of the reimbursement of the tax cost associated with the provision of taxable benefits.\n- 5 Retirement benefits for each Executive KMP in FY2022 and FY2023 were 10 per cent of base salary as per the remuneration framework, with the exception of the retirement benefits reported for Geraldine Slattery of 15 per cent of base salary for FY2022 in accordance with prior remuneration framework. Non-executive Director fees are inclusive of minimum superannuation contributions of up to 10.5 per cent of remuneration for FY2023 in accordance with Australian superannuation legislation. No other pension contributions were paid.\n- 6 The IFRS fair value of CDP and LTIP awards is estimated at grant date. Refer to Financial Statements note 26 'Employee share ownership plans'.\n- 7 The FY2023 remuneration for Malcolm Broomhead and John Mogford relates to part of the year only, as they retired from the Board on 10 November 2022 and 31 October 2022, respectively.

Uplift awards for the CEO were granted on 22 November 2022 following the approval at the 2022 AGM and for other Executive KMP were granted on 17 June 2022.\n- 2 Where the vesting date is not yet known, the estimated vesting month is shown. Where awards lapse, the lapse date is shown. If the vesting conditions are met, awards will vest on or as soon as practicable after the first non-prohibited period date occurring after 30 June of the preceding year of vest. The year of vesting is the second (CDP two-year awards), third (MAP), fourth (MAP) or fifth (MAP, CDP five-year awards and LTIP) financial year after grant. All awards are conditional awards and have no exercise period, exercise price or expiry date; instead ordinary fully paid shares are automatically delivered upon the vesting conditions being met. Where vesting conditions are not met, the conditional awards will immediately lapse.\n- 3 The market price shown is the closing price of BHP shares on the relevant date of grant. No price is payable by the individual to receive a grant of awards. The IFRS fair value of the CDP and LTIP awards granted in FY2023 at the grant date of 22 November 2022 are as follows: CDP - A$43.48 and LTIP - A$30.44.\n- 4 The market price shown is the closing price of BHP shares on the relevant date of vest.\n- 5 The gain on awards is calculated using the market price on date of vesting or exercise (as applicable) less any exercise price payable. The amounts that vested and were lapsed for the awards during FY2023 are as follows: CDP - 100 per cent vested; LTIP - 100 per cent vested; MAP - 100 per cent vested. The gain on the uplift award granted to the CEO in November 2022 was calculated using the market price on 22 November 2022.\n- 6 Sign-on performance shares granted on employment as a consequence of forfeiting shares from prior employment with CSL. In FY2022 the Committee exercised its discretion and determined to vest 80 per cent or 69,023 performance shares. The amount not vested was lapsed. A holding lock applies to the vested shares until August 2023.\n\n## 5.3  Estimated value range of equity awards\n\nThe current face value (and estimate of the maximum possible total value) of equity awards allocated during FY2023 and yet to vest are the awards as set out in the previous table multiplied by the current share price of BHP Group Limited. The minimum possible total value of the awards is nil. The actual value that may be received by participants in the future cannot be determined as it is dependent on and therefore fluctuates with the share price of BHP Group Limited at the date that any particular award vests or is exercised.\n\n## Five-year share price, dividend and earnings history\n\nThe table below provides the five-year share price history for BHP Group Limited, history of dividends paid and the Group's earnings.\n\n|                                                | FY2023   | FY2022   | FY2021   | FY2020   | FY2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Share price at beginning of year (A$)          | 40.05    | 48.22    | 35.82    | 41.68    | 33.60    |\n| Share price at end of year (A$)                | 44.99    | 41.25    | 48.57    | 35.82    | 41.16    |\n| Dividends paid (A$)                            | 3.92     | 10.18\u00b9   | 2.07     | 2.13     | 3.08\u00b2    |\n| Attributable profit (US$ million, as reported) | 12,921   | 30,900   | 11,304   | 7,956    | 8,306    |\n\n- 1 The FY2022 dividends paid includes A$5.38 in respect of the in-specie dividend associated with the merger of the Petroleum business with Woodside.\n- 2 The FY2019 dividends paid includes A$1.41 in respect of the special dividend associated with the divestment of Onshore US.\n\nThe highest and lowest closing share price during FY2023 were A$49.95 and A$36.10 respectively.\n\n## 5.4  Ordinary shareholdings and transactions\n\nThe number of ordinary shares in BHP Group Limited held directly, indirectly or beneficially, by each individual (including shares held in the name of all close members of the Director's or Executive KMP's family and entities over which either the Director or Executive KMP or the family member has, directly or indirectly, control, joint control or significant influence) is shown below. No shares are held nominally by any KMP or their related parties. These are ordinary shares held without performance conditions or restrictions and are included in MSR calculations for each individual.\n\n|                        | Held at 1 July 2022   | Purchased   | Received as  remuneration 1   | Sold    | Held at  30 June 2023   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|---------|-------------------------|\n| Mike Henry             | 521,592               | -           | 293,984                       | 138,358 | 677,218                 |\n| Edgar Basto            | 130,038               | -           | 31,649                        | 14,881  | 146,806                 |\n| David Lamont           | 6,345                 | -           | 79,890                        | -       | 86,235                  |\n| Geraldine Slattery 2 3 | 127,382               | -           | 60,527                        | 23,821  | 164,088                 |\n| Ragnar Udd             | 118,955               | -           | 23,790                        | 11,186  | 131,559                 |\n| Terry Bowen            | 11,000                | -           | -                             | -       | 11,000                  |\n| Malcolm Broomhead      | 19,000                | -           | -                             | -       | 19,000                  |\n| Xiaoqun Clever         | 8,000                 | 539         | -                             | -       | 8,539                   |\n| Ian Cockerill          | 14,299                | -           | -                             | -       | 14,299                  |\n| Gary Goldberg 2        | 12,000                | 4,000       | -                             | -       | 16,000                  |\n| Michelle Hinchliffe    | 8,508                 | -           | -                             | -       | 8,508                   |\n| Ken MacKenzie          | 52,351                | 6,095       | -                             | -       | 58,446                  |\n| John Mogford 4         | 13,938                | -           | -                             | -       | 13,938                  |\n| Christine O'Reilly     | 9,420                 | -           | -                             | -       | 9,420                   |\n| Catherine Tanna        | 10,400                | -           | -                             | -       | 10,400                  |\n| Dion Weisler           | 7,544                 | -           | -                             | -       | 7,544                   |\n\n- 1 Includes DEP in the form of shares on equity awards vesting, where applicable, as disclosed in 5.2 Equity awards.\n- 2 The following BHP Group Limited shares were held in the form of American Depositary Shares: 2,042 for Geraldine Slattery and 8,000 for Gary Goldberg.\n- 3 The opening balance for Geraldine Slattery has been adjusted to include an additional 150 shares.\n- 4 Shares shown as held by Malcolm Broomhead and John Mogford at 30 June 2023 are their balances at the date of their retirement from the Board on 10 November 2022 and 31 October 2022, respectively.",

        "page_content": "## 5.5  Prohibition on hedging of BHP shares and equity instruments\n\nThe Executive KMP may not use unvested BHP equity awards as collateral or hedge the value of any unvested BHP equity awards or the value of shares and securities held as part of meeting the MSR.\n\nAny securities that have vested and are no longer subject to restrictions, or not held as part of meeting the MSR, may be subject to hedging arrangements or used as collateral, provided that prior consent is obtained.\n\n## 5.6  Share ownership guidelines and the MSR\n\nThe share ownership guidelines and the MSR help to ensure the interests of Directors, executives and shareholders remain aligned.\n\nThe CEO and other Executive KMP are expected to grow their holdings to the MSR from the scheduled vesting of their employee awards over time. The MSR is tested at the time that shares are to be sold. Shares may be sold to satisfy tax obligations arising from the granting, holding, vesting, exercise or sale of the employee awards or the underlying shares whether the MSR is satisfied at that time or not.\n\n## For FY2023:\n\n- -  The MSR for the CEO was five times annual pre-tax base salary. At the end of FY2023, the CEO met the MSR.\n- -  The MSR for other Executive KMP was three times annual pre-tax base salary. At the end of FY2023, the other Executive KMP met the MSR, except for David Lamont, as he was appointed as Executive KMP on 1 December 2020.\n- -  No Executive KMP sold or purchased shares during FY2023, other than sales to satisfy taxation obligations.\n\nA two-year post-retirement shareholding requirement for the CEO applies from the date of retirement, which will be the lower of the CEO's MSR or the CEO's actual shareholding at the date of retirement.\n\nSubject to securities dealing constraints, Non-executive Directors have agreed to apply at least 25 per cent of their remuneration (base fees plus Committee fees) to the purchase of BHP shares until they achieve an MSR equivalent in value to one year of remuneration (base fees plus Committee fees). Thereafter, they must maintain at least that level of shareholding throughout their tenure. At the end of FY2023, each Non-executive Director met the MSR.\n\n## 5.7  Transactions with KMP\n\nDuring the financial year, there were no transactions between the Group and its subsidiaries and KMP (including their related parties) (2022: US$ nil; 2021: US$ nil). There were no amounts payable by or loans with KMP (including their related parties) at 30 June 2023 (2022: US$ nil).\n\nA number of KMP hold or have held positions in other companies (i.e. personally related entities) where it is considered they control or significantly influence the financial or operating policies of those entities. There have been no transactions with those entities and no amounts were owed by the Group to personally related entities or any other related parties (2022: US$ nil; 2021: US$ nil).\n\nThis Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 22 August 2023 and signed on its behalf by:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Christine O'Reilly\n\nChair, People and Remuneration Committee\n\n22 August 2023",

Disclosure may be considered material and relevant if the dollar amount is significant due to its size or nature, or the information is important to understand the:\n\n- -  Group's current year results\n- -  impact of significant changes in the Group's business or\n- -  aspects of the Group's operations that are important to future performance\n\nThe Board of Directors resolved to authorise the issue of the financial report on 22 August 2023.\n\n## Basis of preparation and measurement\n\nThe Group's Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2023:\n\n- -  are a consolidated general purpose financial report\n- -  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of:\n- -  the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act 2001)\n- -  Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) (collectively referred to as IFRS)\n- -   are prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors:\n- -  have made an assessment of the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for the 12 months from the date of this report\n- -  consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Group's Financial Statements\n- -  measure items on the basis of historical cost principles, except for the following items:\n- -  derivative financial instruments and certain other financial assets and liabilities, which are carried at fair value\n- -  non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as heldfor-sale or held-for-distribution, which are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell\n- -  include significant accounting policies in the notes to the Financial Statements that summarise the recognition and measurement basis used and are relevant to an understanding of the Financial Statements\n- -  apply a presentation currency of US dollars, consistent with the predominant functional currency of the Group's operations. Amounts are rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated, in accordance with ASIC (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191\n- -  present reclassified comparative information where required for consistency with the current year's presentation\n- -  adopt all new and amended standards and interpretations under IFRS that are mandatory for application in periods beginning on 1 July 2022. None had a significant impact on the Financial Statements. Refer note\n- 39 'New and amended accounting standards and interpretations and changes to accounting policies' for details\n- -  have not early adopted any standards and interpretations that have been issued or amended but are not yet effective, other than as outlined in note 39 'New and amended accounting standards and interpretations and changes to accounting policies'\n\nThe accounting policies are consistently applied by all entities included in the Financial Statements.\n\nIn assessing the appropriateness of the going concern assumption over the going concern period, management has stress tested BHP's most recent financial projections to incorporate a range of potential future outcomes by considering BHP's principal risks. The Group's financial forecasts, including downside commodity price and production scenarios, demonstrate that the Group believes that it has sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due throughout the going concern period. As such, the Financial Statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nIn preparing the Financial Statements, the effects of all intragroup balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nA list of significant entities in the Group, including subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates at 30 June 2023 is contained in note 30 'Subsidiaries', note 31 'Investments accounted for using the equity method' and note 32 'Interests in joint operations'.\n\nSubsidiaries: The Financial Statements of the Group include the consolidation of BHP Group Limited (the Company or parent entity) and its subsidiaries, being the entities controlled by the parent entity during the year (and, in prior periods, BHP Group Plc and its subsidiaries while the DLC was in effect). Control exists where the Group:\n\n- -  has power over the investee\n- -  is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity\n- -  has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity\n\nThe ability to approve the operating and capital budget of an entity and the ability to appoint key management personnel are decisions that demonstrate that the Group has the existing rights to direct the relevant activities of an entity.\n\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in profit or loss from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nWhere the Group's interest is less than 100 per cent, the interest attributable to outside shareholders is reflected in non-controlling interests.\n\nChanges in the Group's interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.\n\nThe financial information of subsidiaries is prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the Group's business combinations.\n\nJoint arrangements: The Group undertakes a number of business activities through joint arrangements, which exist when two or more parties have joint control. Joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, based on the contractual rights and obligations between the parties to the arrangement:\n\n- -Joint operations : A joint operation is an arrangement in which the Group shares joint control, primarily via contractual arrangements with other parties. In a joint operation, the Group has rights to the underlying assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.",

In relation to the Group's interest in a joint operation, the Group recognises: its assets and liabilities, including its share of any assets and liabilities held or incurred jointly; revenue from the sale of its share of the output and its share of any revenue generated from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and its expenses including its share of expenses incurred jointly. All such amounts are allocated in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in proportion to the Group's interest in the joint operation.\n\nThe Group accounts for the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation in accordance with the IFRS Standards applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.\n\n- -Joint ventures : A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A separate vehicle, not the parties, will have the rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. More than an insignificant share of output from a joint venture is sold to third parties, which indicates the joint venture is not dependent on the parties to the arrangement for funding, nor do the parties have an obligation for the liabilities of the arrangement. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method as outlined below.\n\nAssociates: The Group accounts for investments in associates using the equity method as outlined below. An entity is considered an associate where the Group is deemed to have significant influence but not control or joint control. Significant influence is presumed to exist where the Group:\n\n- -  has over 20 per cent but less than 50 per cent of the voting rights of an entity, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case or\n- -  holds less than 20 per cent of the voting rights of an entity; however, has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions affecting the entity\n\nThe Group uses the term 'equity accounted investments' to refer to joint ventures and associates collectively.\n\nUnder the equity method, an investment in an associate or a joint venture is recognised initially at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the\n\n## Significant accounting policies, judgements and estimates\n\nThe Group's accounting policies require the use of judgement, estimates and assumptions. All judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on the most current facts and circumstances and are reassessed on an ongoing basis. Actual results in future reporting periods may differ for these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\n\nFurther information regarding the Group's significant judgements and key estimates and assumptions, being those where changes may materially affect financial results and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities to be reported in the next reporting period, are embedded within the following notes:\n\n|   Note |                                               |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|      4 | Significant events - Samarco dam failure      |\n|      6 | Taxation                                      |\n|     11 | Overburden removal costs                      |\n|     11 | Depreciation of property, plant and equipment |\n|     13 | Impairment of non-current assets              |\n|     15 | Closure and rehabilitation provisions         |\n|     22 | Leases                                        |\n|     29 | Business combinations                         |\n\nAdditional information including sensitivity analysis, where appropriate, has been provided in the relevant notes to enhance an understanding of the impact of key estimates and assumptions on the Group's financial position and performance.\n\n## Reserve estimates\n\nReserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be demonstrated to be able to be economically and legally extracted from the Group's properties. In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required about a range of technical and economic factors, including\n\ncontinued\n\nGroup's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. When the Group's share of losses of an associate or a joint venture exceeds the Group's interest in that associate or joint venture, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nTransactions related to the Group's worldwide operations are conducted in a number of foreign currencies. The majority of the subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates within each of the operations have assessed US dollars as the functional currency, however, some subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates have functional currencies other than US dollars.\n\nTransactions and monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars as follows:\n\n| Foreign currency item           | Applicable exchange rate       |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Transactions                    | Date of underlying transaction |\n| Monetary assets and liabilities | Period-end rate                |\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from translation are recognised in the income statement, except for qualifying cash flow hedges (which are deferred to equity) and foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency provisions for site closure and rehabilitation costs (which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment for operating sites).\n\nOn consolidation, the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of foreign operations with non-US dollar functional currencies are translated into US dollars using the following applicable exchange rates:\n\n| Foreign currency amount   | Applicable exchange rate       |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Income and expenses       | Date of underlying transaction |\n| Assets and liabilities    | Period-end rate                |\n| Equity                    | Historical rate                |\n| Reserves                  | Historical rate                |\n\nForeign exchange differences resulting from translation are initially recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve and subsequently transferred to the income statement on disposal of a foreign operation.\n\nquantities, qualities, production techniques, recovery efficiency, production and transport costs, commodity supply and demand, commodity and carbon prices and exchange rates.\n\nEstimating the quantity and/or quality of reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies to be determined by analysing geological data, such as drilling samples and geophysical survey interpretations. Economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from periodto-period as additional technical and operational data is generated. This process may require complex and difficult geological judgements to interpret the data.\n\n## Reserve impact on financial reporting\n\nEstimates of reserves may change from period-to-period as the economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change and additional geological data is generated during the course of operations. Changes in reserves may affect the Group's financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including:\n\n- -  asset carrying values may be affected due to changes in estimated future production levels\n- -  depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged to the income statement may change where such charges are determined on the units of production basis, or where the useful economic lives of assets change\n- -  overburden removal costs recorded on the balance sheet or charged to the income statement may change due to changes in stripping ratios or the units of production basis of depreciation\n- -  closure and rehabilitation provisions may change where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about the timing or cost of these activities\n- -  the carrying amount of deferred tax assets may change due to changes in estimates of the likely recovery of the tax benefits",

Revenue is recognised when or as control of the promised goods or services passes to the customer. In most instances, control passes when the goods are delivered to a destination specified by the customer, typically on board the customer's appointed vessel. Revenue from the provision of services is recognised over time as the services are provided, but does not represent a significant proportion of total revenue and is aggregated with the respective asset and product revenue for disclosure purposes.\n\nThe amount of revenue recognised reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services.\n\nWhere the Group's sales are provisionally priced, the final price depends on future index prices. The amount of revenue initially recognised is based on the relevant forward market price. Adjustments between the provisional and final price are accounted for under IFRS 9/AASB 9 'Financial Instruments' (IFRS 9), separately recorded as other revenue and presented as part of the total revenue of each asset. The period between provisional pricing and final invoicing is typically between 60 and 120 days.\n\nRevenue from the sale of significant by-products is included within revenue. Where a by-product is not significant, revenue is credited against costs.\n\nThe Group applies the following practical expedients:\n\n- -  expected consideration is not adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the period between the delivery and when the customer pays for the promised good or service is one year or less\n- -  no disclosure is provided for information relating to unfulfilled performance obligations, either due to the expected duration of the contract term being one year or less, or for longer term contracts, because the entity has a right to consideration (and can recognise revenue) for goods delivered",

On 13 July 2023, the Constitutional Court finalised its review of certain aspects of the Royalty Bill, relating only to the distribution of proceeds.\n\nApplying judgement, it was determined that the proposed tax rates were substantively enacted prior to 30 June 2023, as the scope of the Constitutional Court review did not extend to reviewing the tax rates.\n\nWhile the timing of when the Group's operations will be impacted by the reform depends on existing stability agreements, relevant deferred tax positions have been remeasured by US$283 million in the Group's FY2023 financial statements.\n\nThe exceptional items relating to the years ended 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021 are detailed below.\n\n## 30 June 2022\n\n| Year ended 30 June 2022                   | Gross   US$M   | Tax   US$M   | Net   US$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Exceptional items by category             |                |              |              |\n| Samarco dam failure                       | (1,032)        | (31)         | (1,063)      |\n| Impairment of US deferred tax assets      | -              | (423)        | (423)        |\n| Corporate structure unification costs     | (428)          | -            | (428)        |\n| BHP Mitsui Coal (BMC) gain on disposal    | 840            | -            | 840          |\n| Total                                     | (620)          | (454)        | (1,074)      |\n| Attributable to non-controlling interests | -              | -            | -            |\n| Attributable to BHP shareholders          | (620)          | (454)        | (1,074)      |\n\n## Samarco Minera\u00e7\u00e3o S.A.

Deferred consideration of US$222 million comprised US$100 million in cash, outstanding at 30 June 2022 and subsequently received on 3 November 2022, with potential for an additional amount of up to US$150 million (US$122 million discounted) in a price-linked earnout payable in the 2024 calendar year.\n\n## Details of the gain on disposal is as follows:\n\n|                                                 | US$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| BHP share of net assets disposed                | 631    |\n| Gross consideration                             | 1,318  |\n| Transaction and other directly applicable costs | (69)   |\n| Income tax expense                              | -      |\n| Deferred consideration                          | 222    |\n| Gain on disposal                                | 840    |\n\n## 30 June 2021\n\n| Year ended 30 June 2021                   | Gross  US$M   | Tax  US$M   | Net  US$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Exceptional items by category             |               |             |             |\n| Samarco dam failure                       | (1,087)       | (71)        | (1,158)     |\n| COVID-19 related costs                    | (499)         | 138         | (361)       |\n| Impairment of Energy coal assets          | (1,523)       | (651)       | (2,174)     |\n| Impairment of Potash assets               | (1,314)       | (473)       | (1,787)     |\n| Total                                     | (4,423)       | (1,057)     | (5,480)     |\n| Attributable to non-controlling interests | (34)          | 10          | (24)        |\n| Attributable to BHP shareholders          | (4,389)       | (1,067)     | (5,456)     |\n\n## Samarco Minera\u00e7\u00e3o S.A.

At the time, COVID-19 was considered a single protracted globally pervasive event.\n\nHowever, as the pandemic has continued to evolve, certain impacts that were initially considered to be potentially short-term in nature are now expected to continue over a number of reporting periods. These activities are now considered to be part of business as usual operations and, as such, from FY2022 any incremental costs have not been classified as an exceptional item.\n\n## Impairment of Energy coal assets\n\nThe Group recognised an impairment charge of US$1,704 million (after tax) in relation to New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) reflecting the status of the divestment process and current market conditions for thermal coal, the strengthening Australian dollar and changes to the mine plan. In addition, the Group recognised an impairment charge of US$470 million (after tax) for Cerrej\u00f3n, reflecting the expected net sales proceeds.\n\n## Impairment of Potash assets\n\nThe Group recognised an impairment charge of US$1,787 million (after tax) in relation to Potash. The impairment charge reflected an analysis of market perspectives and the value that we expected a market participant to attribute to our investments to date.",

(Samarco) iron ore operation in Minas Gerais, Brazil, experienced a tailings dam failure that resulted in a release of mine tailings, flooding the communities of Bento Rodrigues, Gesteira and Paracatu and impacting other communities downstream (the Samarco dam failure). Refer to section on 'Samarco' in the Operating and Financial Review.\n\nSamarco is jointly owned by BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda (BHP Brasil) and Vale S.A. (Vale). BHP Brasil's 50 per cent interest is accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture investment. BHP Brasil does not separately recognise its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of Samarco, but instead records the investment as one line on the balance sheet. Each period, BHP Brasil recognised its 50 per cent share of Samarco's profit or loss and adjusted the carrying value of the investment in Samarco accordingly. Such adjustment continued until the investment carrying value was reduced to US$ nil, with any additional share of Samarco losses only recognised to the extent that BHP Brasil has an obligation to fund the losses.

The provision only reflects the future cost estimates associated with the delivery of programs set out in the Framework Agreement (see below).\n\nContingent liabilities will only be resolved when one or more uncertain future events occur or related impacts become capable of reliable measurement and, as such, determination of contingent liabilities disclosed in the financial statements requires significant judgement regarding the outcome of future events. A number of the claims below do not specify the amount of damages sought and, where this is specified, amounts could change as the matter progresses.\n\nUltimately, future changes in all those matters for which a provision has been recognised or contingent liability disclosed could have a material adverse impact on BHP's business, competitive position, cash flows, prospects, liquidity and shareholder returns.\n\nThe following table summarises the current status of significant ongoing matters relating to the Samarco dam failure, along with developments during the financial year, and the associated treatment in the Financial Statements:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Item                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Provision   | Contingent  liability   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------|\n| Samarco dam failure - Framework Agreement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |             |                         |\n| On 2 March 2016, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale entered into a Framework Agreement with the Federal Government of Brazil, the states  of Espirito Santo and Minas Gerais, and certain other public authorities to establish a foundation (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova) that is developing  and executing environmental and socio-economic programs (Programs) to remediate and provide compensation for damage caused by the  Samarco dam failure (the Framework Agreement). |             |                         |\n| Key programs include those for financial assistance and compensation of impacted persons and those for remediation of impacted areas and  resettlement of impacted communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |             |                         |\n| Samarco has primary responsibility for funding Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova with each of BHP Brasil and Vale having secondary funding obligations  in proportion to their 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.

These claims were filed on behalf of certain individuals, governments, businesses and communities in Brazil allegedly  impacted by the Samarco dam failure.                                                                                                                                               |             |                         |\n| The amount of damages sought in these claims is unspecified. A trial in relation to BHP's liability for the dam failure is listed for October 2024. In December 2022, the BHP defendants filed their defence and a contribution claim against Vale. The contribution claims contends that if  BHP's defence is not successful and the BHP defendants are ordered to pay damages to the claimants, Vale should contribute to any amount                                                                        |             |                         |\n| payable. Vale contested the jurisdiction of the English courts to determine this contribution claim, with the court dismissing Vale's application  on 7 August 2023. Subject to the outcome of any appeals by Vale in relation to jurisdiction and directions from the Court, the contribution  claim will proceed in the UK.                                                                                                                                                                                 |             |                         |\n| Criminal charges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |             |                         |\n| BHP Brasil rejects outright the charges against the company and the Affected Individuals and is defending itself from all charges while fully  supporting each of the Affected Individuals in their defence of the charges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |             |                         |\n| The Vila Lenira Residents Association, State of Espirito Santo Rural Producers and Artisans Association, Colatina Velha Neighbourhood  Residents Association, and United for the Progress of Palmeiras Neighbourhood Association have filed a lawsuit against Samarco, BHP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |             |                         |\n| employees of BHP Brasil (Affected Individuals) in the Federal Court of Ponte Nova, Minas Gerais.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |             |                         |\n| The lawsuits include claims for compensation, environmental reparation and violations of Brazilian environmental and other laws, among  other matters.

        "page_content": "## 4  Significant events - Samarco dam failure continued\n\n## Commitments\n\nUnder the terms of the Samarco joint venture agreement, BHP Brasil does not have an existing obligation to fund Samarco.\n\nHowever, BHP Brasil has agreed to fund a total of up to US$915 million for the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova programs during calendar year 2023. Any additional requests for funding or future investment provided would be subject to a future decision by BHP Brasil, accounted for at that time.\n\n## Samarco judicial reorganisation\n\nSamarco filed for Judicial Reorganisation (JR) in April 2021, with the Second Business State Court for the Belo Horizonte District of Minas Gerais, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil (JR Court), after multiple enforcement actions taken by certain financial creditors of Samarco which threatened Samarco's operations.\n\nThe JR is an insolvency proceeding that provides a means for Samarco to seek to restructure its financial debts and establish a stable financial position that allows Samarco to continue to rebuild its operations and strengthen its ability to meet its Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova related funding obligations. Samarco's operations have continued during the JR proceeding.\n\nOn 31 May 2023, Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (RSA) with certain Samarco financial creditors. The RSA outlines the proposed parameters for a restructure of Samarco's financial debts, to be implemented through a consensual judicial reorganisation plan (Consensual Plan), subject to approval by the creditors of Samarco and ratification by the JR Court.\n\nOn 28 July 2023, Samarco and one of the financial creditors jointly filed the Consensual Plan with the JR Court, that aims at implementing and is consistent with the transactions contemplated in the RSA. Concurrent with the filing of the Consensual Plan, the parties also filed terms of adhesion that demonstrate approval of the Consensual Plan by the majority of Samarco's creditors as required under Brazilian Bankruptcy Law.\n\nOnce ratified by the JR Court and confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, the Samarco debt restructure, including payments to Samarco employees and suppliers as stipulated in the Plan and the issuance of new debt instruments to financial creditors is expected to be executed in the first half of FY2024.\n\nThe proposed terms of the Plan are not expected to impact Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's ability to undertake the remediation and compensation Programs. Samarco's funding of Renova is proposed to be capped at US$1 billion for the period CY2024 to CY2030. BHP Brasil has considered this proposed cap, along with Samarco's long-term forecast cash flows, when determining the dam failure related provision at 30 June 2023.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nJudgements: The outcomes of litigation are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgement has been applied in assessing the likely outcome of legal claims and determining which legal claims require recognition of a provision or disclosure of a contingent liability. The facts and circumstances relating to these cases are regularly evaluated in determining whether a provision for any specific claim is required.\n\nManagement has determined that a provision can only be recognised for obligations under the Framework Agreement as at 30 June 2023. It is not yet possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures to BHP in connection to the contingent liabilities noted above, given their status.\n\nEstimates: The provision for the Samarco dam failure reflects the Group's estimate of the remaining costs to complete Programs under the Framework Agreement and requires the use of significant judgements, estimates and assumptions. Based on current estimates, it is expected that approximately 85 per cent of remaining costs for Programs under the Framework Agreement will be incurred by June 2025, largely attributable to the finalisation of the resettlement program and closure of the Novel system (application system for impacted individuals to lodge compensation claims).\n\nWhile the provision has been measured based on the latest information available as at 30 June 2023, changes in facts and circumstances are likely in future reporting periods and may lead to material revisions to these estimates. However, it is currently not possible to determine what facts and circumstances may change, therefore revisions in future reporting periods due to the key estimates and factors outlined below cannot be reliably measured.\n\nThe key estimates that may have a material impact upon the provision in the next and future reporting periods include the:\n\n- -  number of people eligible for financial assistance and compensation and the corresponding amount of expected compensation; and\n- -  costs to complete key infrastructure programs.\n\nThe provision may also be affected by factors including but not limited to:\n\n- -  potential changes in scope of work and funding amounts required under the Framework Agreement including the impact of further technical analysis, community participation required under the Governance Agreement and rulings made by the Federal Court;\n- -  the outcome of ongoing negotiations with State and Federal Prosecutors, including review of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's Programs as provided in the Governance Agreement;\n- -  actual costs incurred;\n- -  updates to discount and foreign exchange rates; and\n- -  the outcomes of Samarco's judicial reorganisation and resolution of uncertainty in respect of the nature and extent of Samarco's long-term cash generation.\n\nIn addition, the provision may be impacted by decisions in, or resolution of, existing and potential legal claims in Brazil and other jurisdictions, including the outcome of the United Kingdom group action and the negotiations seeking a definitive and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155 billion (approximately US$32 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim.\n\nOutcomes of the negotiations are highly uncertain and it is therefore not possible to provide a reliable estimate of potential outcomes.\n\nGiven these factors, future actual cash outflows may differ from the amounts currently provided and changes to any of the key assumptions and estimates outlined above could result in a material impact to the provision in the next and future reporting periods.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 4  Significant events - Samarco dam failure continued\n\nThe following section includes disclosure of amounts recognised or disclosed by Samarco in its financial statements for matters to which Samarco (and not the Group) is a party.\n\n## Samarco\n\n## Dam failure related provision and contingencies\n\nIn addition to its obligations under the Framework Agreement as at 30 June 2023, Samarco has recognised a provision of US$0.4 billion (30 June 2022: US$0.3 billion), based on currently available information. The magnitude, scope and timing of these additional costs are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and Samarco has indicated that it anticipates that it will incur future costs beyond those provided. These uncertainties are likely to continue for a significant period and changes to key assumptions could result in a material change to the amount of the provision in future reporting periods. Any such unrecognised obligations are therefore contingent liabilities and, at present, it is not practicable to estimate their magnitude or possible timing of payment. Accordingly, it is also not possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of total potential future exposures at this time.\n\nSamarco is also named as a defendant in a number of other legal proceedings initiated by individuals, non-governmental organisations, corporations and governmental entities in Brazilian Federal and State courts following the Samarco dam failure. The lawsuits include claims for compensation, environmental rehabilitation and violations of Brazilian environmental and other laws, among other matters. The lawsuits seek various remedies including rehabilitation costs, compensation to injured individuals and families of the deceased, recovery of personal and property losses, moral damages and injunctive relief. In addition, government inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by numerous agencies of the Brazilian government and are ongoing. Given the status of proceedings it is not possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of total potential future exposures to Samarco.\n\nAdditional lawsuits and government investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure could be brought against Samarco.\n\n## Samarco insurance\n\nSamarco has standalone insurance policies in place with Brazilian and global insurers. Insurers' loss adjusters or claims representatives\n\ncontinue to investigate and assist with the claims process for matters not yet settled. As at 30 June 2023, an insurance receivable has not been recognised by Samarco in respect of ongoing matters.\n\n## Samarco commitments\n\nAt 30 June 2023, Samarco has commitments of US$1.0 billion (30 June 2022: US$0.7 billion). Following the dam failure, Samarco invoked force majeure clauses in a number of long-term contracts with suppliers and service providers to suspend contractual obligations.\n\n## Samarco non-dam failure related provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nThe following non-dam failure related matters pre-date and are unrelated to the Samarco dam failure. Samarco is currently contesting both of these matters in the Brazilian courts. Given the status of these tax matters, the timing of resolution and potential economic outflow for Samarco is uncertain.\n\n## Brazilian Social Contribution Levy\n\nSamarco has received tax assessments for the alleged non-payment of Brazilian Social Contribution Levy for the calendar years 20072014. Based on its assessment of currently available information as at 30 June 2023, Samarco recognised gross provisions of US$1.1 billion, US$0.9 billion net of US$0.2 billion court deposits paid (30 June 2022: nil) and disclosed contingent liabilities of US$0.2 billion (30 June 2022: US $1.2 billion). As at 30 June 2023, BHP Brasil's 50% share of the impact of the provision recognised by Samarco is reflected in the Group's equity accounting for Samarco.\n\n## Brazilian corporate income tax rate\n\nSamarco has received tax assessments, and disclosed contingent liabilities, for alleged incorrect calculation of Corporate Income Tax (IRPJ) in respect of the 2000-2003 and 2007-2014 income years totalling approximately US$1.1 billion (30 June 2022: US$0.9 billion).\n\n## 5  Expenses and other income\n\n|                                                                                     | 2023   US$M   | 2022   US$M   | 2021   US$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Employee benefits expense:                                                          |               |               |               |\n| Wages and salaries                                                                  | 4,539         | 4,197         | 4,018         |\n| Employee share awards                                                               | 97            | 109           | 88            |\n| Social security costs                                                               | 4             | 4             | 3             |\n| Pension and other post-retirement obligations                                       | 339           | 338           | 274           |\n| Less employee benefits expense classified as exploration and evaluation expenditure | (35)          | (30)          | (26)          |\n| Changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress                       | 301           | (774)         | (321)         |\n| Raw materials and consumables used                                                  | 6,710         | 5,991         | 4,899         |\n| Freight and transportation                                                          | 2,299         | 2,319         | 1,900         |\n| External services                                                                   | 4,768         | 4,525         | 4,640         |\n| Third-party commodity purchases                                                     | 1,878         | 2,959         | 2,220         |\n| Net foreign exchange (gains)/losses                                                 | (197)         | (326)         | 293           |\n| Fair value change on derivatives 1                                                  | 135           | (29)          | 87            |\n| Government royalties paid and payable                                               | 3,841         | 4,014         | 3,080         |\n| Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred and expensed in the current period  | 294           | 199           | 134           |\n| Depreciation and amortisation expense                                               | 5,061         | 5,683         | 5,084         |\n| Net impairments:                                                                    |               |               |               |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                                       | 73            | 515           | 2,474         |\n| Goodwill and other intangible assets                                                | 2             | -             | 33            |\n| All other operating expenses                                                        | 1,764         | 2,677         | 1,991         |\n| Total expenses                                                                      | 31,873        | 32,371        | 30,871        |\n| Insurance recoveries                                                                | -             | (4)           | (46)          |\n| (Gain)/loss on disposal of subsidiaries and operations 2                            | (8)           | (840)         | 2             |\n| Dividend income 3                                                                   | (19)          | (241)         | (2)           |\n| Other income 4                                                                      | (367)         | (313)         | (334)         |\n| Total other income                                                                  | (394)         | (1,398)       | (380)         |\n\n- 1 Fair value change on derivatives is principally related to commodity price contracts, foreign exchange contracts and embedded derivatives used in the ordinary course of business as well as derivatives used as part of the funding of dividends.\n- 2 Mainly relates to the divestment of BMC in FY2022. Refer to note 3 'Exceptional items' for further information.\n- 3 During FY2022, the Group received dividends of US$238 million from Cerrej\u00f3n, which reduced completion proceeds net of transaction costs to US$50 million. On 11 January 2022, BHP completed the sale of its 33.33 per cent interest in Cerrej\u00f3n to joint venture partner, Glencore plc.\n- 4 Other income is generally income earned from transactions outside the course of the Group's ordinary activities and may include certain management fees from non-controlling interests and joint arrangements, royalties and commission income.",

In response to this uncertainty, on 23 May 2023 and 27 June 2023, respectively, the IASB and AASB issued amendments to IAS 12 'Income taxes' introducing a mandatory temporary exception to the requirements of IAS 12 under which a company does not recognise or disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the proposed OECD/G20 BEPS Pillar Two model rules. The Group applied the temporary exception at 30 June 2023.\n\n## Uncertain tax and royalty matters\n\nThe Group operates across many tax jurisdictions. Application of tax law can be complex and requires judgement to assess risk and estimate outcomes. These judgements are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of tax assets and tax liabilities, including deferred tax, recognised on the balance sheet and the amount of other tax losses and temporary differences not yet recognised. The evaluation of tax risks considers both amended assessments received and potential sources of challenge from tax authorities. The status of proceedings for these matters will impact the ability to determine the potential exposure and in some cases, it may not be possible to determine a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of the potential exposure.\n\nTax and royalty matters with uncertain outcomes arise in the normal course of business and occur due to changes in tax law, changes in interpretation of tax law, periodic challenges and disagreements with tax authorities and legal proceedings.\n\nTax and royalty obligations assessed as having probable future economic outflows capable of reliable measurement are provided for as at 30 June 2023. Matters with a possible economic outflow and/or presently incapable of being measured reliably are contingent liabilities and disclosed in note 34 'Contingent liabilities'. Details of uncertain tax and royalty matters relating to Samarco are disclosed in note 4 'Significant events - Samarco dam failure'.",

These deferred tax liabilities caused principally by retained earnings held in foreign tax jurisdictions are recognised unless repatriation of retained earnings can be controlled and is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn FY2023, judgement was applied in determining the Chilean Royalty Bill was substantively enacted at the reporting date. It was considered that the process of enactment was complete and the remaining steps for enactment would not change the outcome of the tax rates to be applied in measuring the deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nEstimates: The Group assesses the recoverability of recognised and unrecognised deferred taxes, including losses in Australia, the United States and Canada on a consistent basis. Estimates and assumptions relating to projected earnings and cash flows as applied in the Group impairment process are used for operating assets.\n\nThese forecasts are also used to estimate the royalty related tax rates to apply when the deferred tax assets are realised and deferred tax liabilities are settled, in revaluing the deferred tax balances following the substantive enactment of the Chilean Royalty Bill.\n\n## 7  Earnings per share\n\n|                                                  | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Earnings attributable to BHP shareholders (US$M) |        |        |        |\n| - Continuing operations                          | 12,921 | 20,245 | 11,529 |\n| - Total                                          | 12,921 | 30,900 | 11,304 |\n| Weighted average number of shares (Million)      |        |        |        |\n| - Basic                                          | 5,064  | 5,061  | 5,057  |\n| - Diluted                                        | 5,073  | 5,071  | 5,068  |\n| Basic earnings per ordinary share (US cents)     |        |        |        |\n| - Continuing operations                          | 255.2  | 400.0  | 228.0  |\n| - Total                                          | 255.2  | 610.6  | 223.5  |\n| Diluted earnings per ordinary share (US cents)   |        |        |        |\n| - Continuing operations                          | 254.7  | 399.2  | 227.5  |\n| - Total                                          | 254.7  | 609.3  | 223.0  |\n| Headline earnings per ordinary share (US cents)  |        |        |        |\n| - Basic                                          | 256.1  | 439.0  | 284.8  |\n| - Diluted                                        | 255.7  | 438.1  | 284.2  |\n\nRefer to note 28 'Discontinued operations' for basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for Discontinued operations.\n\nEarnings on American Depositary Shares represent twice the earnings for BHP Group Limited ordinary shares.\n\nHeadline earnings is a Johannesburg Stock Exchange defined performance measure and is reconciled from earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders as follows:\n\n|                                                                                | 2023   US$M   | 2022   US$M   | 2021   US$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Earnings attributable to BHP shareholders                                      | 12,921        | 30,900        | 11,304        |\n| Adjusted for:                                                                  |               |               |               |\n| (Gain)/loss on sales of PP&E, Investments and Operations 1                     | (9)           | (95)          | (50)          |\n| Impairments of property, plant and equipment, financial assets and intangibles | 75            | 515           | 2,633         |\n| Samarco impairment expense                                                     | -             | -             | 111           |\n| Cerrej\u03ccn impairment expense                                                    | -             | -             | 466           |\n| Gain on disposal of BHP Mitsui Coal                                            | -             | (840)         | -             |\n| Gain on merger of Petroleum                                                    | -             | (8,167)       | -             |\n| Tax effect of above adjustments                                                | (17)          | (97)          | (60)          |\n| Subtotal of adjustments                                                        | 49            | (8,684)       | 3,100         |\n| Headline earnings                                                              | 12,970        | 22,216        | 14,404        |\n| Diluted headline earnings                                                      | 12,970        | 22,216        | 14,404        |\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nDiluted earnings attributable to BHP shareholders are equal to the earnings attributable to BHP shareholders.\n\nPrior to the Group's corporate structure unification, the calculation of the number of ordinary shares used in the computation of basic earnings per share was the aggregate of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc outstanding during the period after deduction of the number of shares held by the Billiton Employee Share Ownership Trust and the BHP Group Limited Employee Equity Trust (previously known as 'BHP Billiton Limited Employee Equity Trust').

The Group's only potential dilutive ordinary shares are share awards granted under the employee share ownership plans for which terms and conditions are described in note 26 'Employee share ownership plans'.

Trade receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less an allowance for impairment, except for provisionally priced receivables which are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9.\n\nThe collectability of trade and other receivables is assessed continuously. At the reporting date, specific allowances are made for any expected credit losses based on a review of all outstanding amounts at reporting period-end. Individual receivables are written off when management deems them unrecoverable. The net carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nTrade receivables generally have terms of less than 30 days. The Group has no material concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty and is not dominantly exposed to any individual industry.\n\nCredit risk can arise from the non-performance by counterparties of their contractual financial obligations towards the Group. To manage credit risk, the Group maintains Group-wide procedures covering the application for credit approvals, granting and renewal of counterparty limits, proactive monitoring of exposures against these limits and requirements triggering secured payment terms. As part of these processes, the credit exposures with all counterparties are regularly monitored and assessed on a timely basis. The credit quality of the Group's customers is reviewed and the solvency of each debtor and their ability to pay the receivable is considered in assessing receivables for impairment.\n\nThe 10 largest customers represented 31 per cent (2022: 34 per cent) of total credit risk exposures managed by the Group.\n\nReceivables are deemed to be past due or impaired in accordance with the Group's terms and conditions. These terms and conditions are determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the customer's credit quality, payment performance and prevailing market conditions. As at 30 June 2023, trade receivables of US$8 million (2022: US$103 million) were past due but not impaired. The majority of these receivables were less than 30 days overdue.\n\nAt 30 June 2023, trade receivables are stated net of provisions for expected credit losses of US$9 million (2022: US$3 million).\n\n## 9  Trade and other payables\n\n|                | 2023   US$M   | 2022   US$M   |\n|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Trade payables | 4,893         | 5,360         |\n| Other payables | 1,407         | 1,327         |\n| Total          | 6,300         | 6,687         |\n| Comprising:    |               |               |\n| Current        | 6,296         | 6,687         |\n| Non-current    | 4             | -             |\n\n## 10 Inventories\n\n|                               | 2023   US$M   | 2022   US$M   | Definitions                                                                                                           |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Raw materials and consumables | 2,106         | 1,713         | Spares, consumables and other supplies yet to be utilised in the production process or  in the rendering of services. |\n| Work in progress              | 3,514         | 3,827         | Commodities currently in the production process that require further processing by the  Group to a saleable form.     |\n| Finished goods                | 1,003         | 710           | Commodities ready-for-sale and not requiring further processing by the Group.                                         |\n| Total 1                       | 6,623         | 6,250         |                                                                                                                       |\n| Comprising:                   |               |               | Inventories classified as non-current are not expected to be utilised or sold within                                  |\n| Current                       | 5,220         | 4,935         | 12 months after the reporting date or within the operating cycle of the business.                                     |\n| Non-current                   | 1,403         | 1,315         | Inventories classified as non-current are not expected to be utilised or sold within                                  |",

Cost is determined primarily on the basis of average costs and involves estimates of expected metal recoveries and work in progress volumes, calculated using available industry, engineering and scientific data. These estimates are periodically reassessed by the Group taking into account technical analysis and historical performance.\n\nFor processed inventories, cost is derived on an absorption costing basis. Cost comprises costs of purchasing raw materials and costs of production, including attributable mining and manufacturing overheads taking into consideration normal operating capacity.\n\nInventory quantities are assessed primarily through surveys and assays.\n\n## Resource assets\n\n## 11  Property, plant and equipment\n\n|                                                          | Land and  buildings  US$M   | Plant and  equipment  US$M   | Other mineral  assets   US$M   | Assets under  construction  US$M   | Exploration  and evaluation  US$M   | Total   US$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Net book value -

Refer to notes 3 'Exceptional items' and 28 'Discontinued operations' for more information.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Cost is the fair value of consideration given to acquire the asset at the time of its acquisition or construction and includes the direct costs of bringing the asset to the location and the condition necessary for operation and the estimated future costs of closure and rehabilitation of the facility.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. Refer to note 22 'Leases' for further details. Right-of-use assets are presented within the category of property, plant and equipment according to the nature of the underlying asset leased.\n\n## Exploration and evaluation\n\nExploration costs are incurred to discover mineral resources. Evaluation costs are incurred to assess the technical feasibility and commercial viability of resources found.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure is charged to the income statement as incurred, except in the following circumstances in which case the expenditure may be capitalised:\n\n- -  the exploration and evaluation activity is within an area of interest that was previously acquired as an asset acquisition or in a business combination and measured at fair value on acquisition or\n- -  the existence of a commercially viable mineral deposit has been established\n\nA regular review of each area of interest is undertaken to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that area. Capitalised costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recovered through the successful exploitation of the area of interest or alternatively by its sale. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is no longer expected to be recovered, it is charged to the income statement.",

All subsequent development expenditure is capitalised and classified as assets under construction, provided commercial viability conditions continue to be satisfied.\n\nThe Group may use funds sourced from external parties to finance the acquisition and development of assets and operations. Finance costs are expensed as incurred, except where they relate to the financing of construction or development of qualifying assets. Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquiring or constructing a qualifying asset are capitalised during the development phase.\n\nIn the instance where saleable material is extracted prior to the commissioning of a project/site, sale proceeds are recognised as revenue, with associated costs also recognised in the income statement. On completion of development, all assets included in assets under construction are reclassified as either plant and equipment or other mineral assets and depreciation commences.\n\n## Other mineral assets\n\nOther mineral assets comprise:\n\n- -  capitalised exploration, evaluation and development expenditure for assets in production\n- -  mineral rights acquired\n- -  capitalised development and production stripping costs\n\n## Overburden removal costs\n\nThe process of removing overburden and other waste materials to access mineral deposits is referred to as stripping. Stripping is necessary to obtain access to mineral deposits and occurs throughout the life of an open-pit mine. Development and production stripping costs are classified as other mineral assets in property, plant and equipment.\n\nStripping costs are accounted for separately for individual components of an ore body. The determination of components is dependent on the mine plan and other factors, including the size, shape and geotechnical aspects of an ore body. The Group accounts for stripping activities as follows:\n\n## Development stripping costs\n\nThese are initial overburden removal costs incurred to obtain access to mineral deposits that will be commercially produced. These costs are capitalised when it is probable that future economic benefits (access to mineral ores) will flow to the Group and costs can be measured reliably.\n\nOnce the production phase begins, capitalised development stripping costs are depreciated using the units of production method based on the proven and probable reserves of the relevant identified component of the ore body which the initial stripping activity benefits.\n\n## Production stripping costs\n\nThese are post initial overburden removal costs incurred during the normal course of production activity, which commences after the first saleable minerals have been extracted from the component. Production stripping costs can give rise to two benefits, the accounting for which is outlined below:\n\n|                                           | Production stripping activity                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Production stripping activity                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Benefits of stripping activity            | Extraction of ore (inventory) in current period.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Improved access to future ore extraction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Period benefited                          | Current period                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Future period(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Recognition and  measurement criteria     | When the benefits of stripping activities are realised in  the form of inventory produced; the associated costs  are recorded in accordance with the Group's inventory  accounting policy.                                                                 | When the benefits of stripping activities are improved access  to future ore; production costs are capitalised when all the  following criteria are met: -  the production stripping activity improves access to a specific                                |\n| Allocation of costs                       | Production stripping costs are allocated between the inventory produced and the production stripping asset using a life-of- component waste-to-ore (or mineral contained) strip ratio.

Changes to estimates related to lifeof-component waste-to-ore (or mineral contained) strip ratios and the expected ore production from identified components are accounted for prospectively and may affect depreciation rates and asset carrying values.",

The depreciation method and rates applied to specific assets reflect the pattern in which the asset's benefits are expected to be used by the Group. The Group's proved and probable reserves for minerals assets are used to determine UoP depreciation unless doing so results in depreciation charges that do not reflect the asset's useful life. Where this occurs, alternative approaches to determining reserves are applied, to provide a phasing of periodic depreciation charges that better reflects the asset's expected useful life.\n\nWhere assets are dedicated to a mine lease, the useful lives below are subject to the lesser of the asset category's useful life and the life of the mine lease, unless those assets are readily transferable to another productive mine.\n\nAssets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell and therefore not depreciated.\n\n## Key estimates\n\nThe determination of useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods involves estimates and assumptions and is reviewed annually. Any changes to useful lives or any other estimates or assumptions, including the expected impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy, may affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values. The table below summarises the principal depreciation methods and rates applied to major asset categories by the Group.\n\n| Category                         | Buildings   | Plant and  equipment   | Mineral rights                               | Capitalised exploration, evaluation and  development expenditure   |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Typical depreciation methodology | SL          | SL                     | UoP                                          | UoP                                                                |\n| Depreciation rate                | 25-50 years | 3-30 years             | Based on the rate of   depletion of reserves | Based on the rate of   depletion of reserves                       |\n\n## Commitments\n\nThe Group's commitments for capital expenditure were US$3,975 million as at 30 June 2023 (2022: US$2,820 million).

Refer to note 28 'Discontinued operations' for more information.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWhere the fair value of the consideration paid for a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the difference is treated as goodwill. Where consideration is less than the fair value of acquired net assets, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is not amortised and is measured at cost less any impairment losses.\n\n## Other intangibles\n\nThe Group capitalises amounts paid for the acquisition of identifiable intangible assets, such as software, licences and initial payments for the acquisition of mineral lease assets, where it is considered that they will contribute to future periods through revenue generation or reductions in cost. These assets, classified as finite life intangible assets, are carried in the balance sheet at the fair value of consideration paid (cost) less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. The estimated useful lives are generally no greater than eight years.\n\nInitial payments for the acquisition of intangible mineral lease assets are capitalised and amortised over the term of the permit. A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that area. Capitalised costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recovered through the successful exploitation of the area of interest or alternatively by its sale. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is no longer expected to be recovered, it is charged to the income statement.\n\nAssets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell and therefore not amortised.",

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs, being the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. If the carrying amount of the asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset or CGU is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income statement so as to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount.\n\nPreviously impaired assets (excluding goodwill as impairment losses are not reversed in subsequent periods) are reviewed for possible reversal of previous impairment at each reporting date. Impairment reversal cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement. There were no reversals of impairment in the current or prior year.\n\n## How recoverable amount is calculated\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or CGU's fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) and its value in use (VIU).\n\n## Fair value less cost of disposal\n\nFVLCD is an estimate of the amount that a market participant would pay for an asset or CGU, less the cost of disposal. FVLCD for mineral assets is generally determined using independent market assumptions to calculate the present value of the estimated future post-tax cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset, including the anticipated cash flow effects of any capital expenditure to enhance production or reduce cost, and its eventual disposal where a market participant may take a consistent view. Cash flows are discounted using an appropriate post-tax market discount rate to arrive at a net present value of the asset, which is compared against the asset's carrying value. FVLCD may also take into consideration other marketbased indicators of fair value. FVLCD are based primarily on Level 3 inputs as defined in note 24 'Financial risk management' unless otherwise noted.\n\n## Value in use\n\nVIU is determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its present form and its eventual disposal or closure. VIU is determined by applying assumptions specific to the Group's continued use and cannot take into account future development. These assumptions are different to those used in calculating FVLCD and consequently the VIU calculation is likely to give a different result (usually lower) to a FVLCD calculation.\n\n## Impairment of non-current assets (excluding goodwill)\n\nNo material impairment of non-current assets for the year ended 30 June 2023.\n\nImpairment of non-current assets relating to the year ended 30 June 2022 are detailed below.\n\n## Impairment of Cerro Colorado\n\nThe Group recognised a pre-tax impairment charge of US$455 million. The impairment charge primarily related to an increase in closure and rehabilitation provision at Cerro Colorado due to additional work required to re-profile waste dumps for closure and an increase in scope for the closure activities.\n\n## Impairment test for goodwill\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, as follows:\n\n| Cash generating unit                     | 2023   US$M   | 2022   US$M   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Olympic Dam                              | 1,010         | 1,010         |\n| OZ Minerals Limited provisional goodwill | 192           | -             |\n| Other                                    | 187           | 187           |\n| Total goodwill                           | 1,389         | 1,197         |",

        "page_content": "## 13  Impairment of non-current assets continued\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of previous business combinations, which represent the level at which management will monitor and manage goodwill.\n\nThe Olympic Dam goodwill has been tested for impairment at 31 December 2022, as part of the Olympic Dam CGU. Details of the goodwill impairment test are provided below.\n\nOn 2 May 2023, the Group acquired OZ Minerals Limited (OZL) (refer to note 29 'Business combination' for details). The goodwill arising from the acquisition of US$192 million represents the provisional amount, which could not be reliably allocated to a CGU or group of CGUs at 30 June 2023. There were no indicators of impairment during the period from acquisition date to 30 June 2023 to suggest that the provisional goodwill had been impaired. Therefore, as at 30 June 2023, this goodwill has not yet been subject to any impairment testing.\n\nGoodwill held by other CGUs is US$187 million (2022: US$187 million). This represents less than one per cent of net assets at 30 June 2023 (2022: less than one per cent).

Further detail is provided in note 16 'Climate Change'.\n\nEstimates: The Group performs a recoverable amount determination for an asset or CGU when there is an indication of impairment or impairment reversal.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount is measured by reference to FVLCD, in the absence of quoted market prices or binding sale agreement, estimates are made regarding the present value of future post-tax cash flows. These estimates are made from the perspective of a market participant and include prices, future production volumes, operating costs, capital expenditure, closure and rehabilitation costs, taxes, risking factors applied to cash flows and discount rates. The cash flow forecasts may include net cash flows expected from the extraction, processing and sale of material that does not currently qualify for inclusion in ore reserves. Reserves and resources are included in the assessment of FVLCD to the extent that it is considered probable that a market participant would attribute value to them.\n\nWhen recoverable amount is measured using VIU, estimates are made regarding the present value of future cash flows based on internal budgets and forecasts and life of asset plans. Key estimates are similar to those identified for FVLCD, although some assumptions and values may differ as they reflect the perspective of management rather than a market participant.\n\nAll estimates require judgements and assumptions and are subject to risk and uncertainty that may be beyond the control of the Group; hence, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will materially alter projections, which may impact the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU at each reporting date. While no indicators of impairment, or\n\nimpairment reversal, were identified across the Group's CGUs at 30 June 2023, the carrying value of the Spence and Nickel West CGUs are the most susceptible to changes in the significant estimates outlined below in the next reporting period.\n\nThe significant estimates impacting the Group's recoverable amount determinations are:\n\n## Commodity prices\n\nCommodity prices were based on latest internal forecasts which assume short-term market prices will revert to the Group's assessment of long-term price. These price forecasts reflect management's long-term views of global supply and demand, built upon past experience of the commodity markets and are benchmarked with external sources of information such as analyst forecasts. Prices are adjusted based upon premiums or discounts applied to global price markers to reflect the location, nature and quality of the Group's production, or to take into account contracted prices.\n\n## Future production volumes\n\nEstimated production volumes were based on detailed data and took into account development plans established by management as part of the Group's long-term planning process. When estimating FVLCD, assumptions reflect all reserves and resources that a market participant would consider when valuing the respective CGU, which in some cases are broader in scope than the reserves that would be used in a VIU test. In determining FVLCD, risk factors may be applied to reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved.\n\n## Cash outflows (including operating costs, capital expenditure, closure and rehabilitation costs and taxes)\n\nCash outflows are based on internal budgets and forecasts and life of asset plans. Cost assumptions reflect management experience and expectations. Tax assumptions reflect existing and substantively enacted tax and royalty regimes and rates applicable in the jurisdiction of the CGU. In the case of FVLCD, cash flow projections include the anticipated cash flow effects of any capital expenditure to enhance production or reduce cost where a market participant may take a consistent view. VIU does not take into account future development.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nThe Group uses real post-tax discount rates applied to real post-tax cash flows. The discount rates are derived using the weighted average cost of capital methodology. Adjustments to the rates are made for any risks that are not reflected in the underlying cash flows, including country risk.\n\n## 14  Deferred tax balances\n\nThe movement for the year in the Group's net deferred tax position is as follows:\n\n|                                                          | 2023   US$M   | 2022   US$M   | 2021   US$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Net deferred tax (liability)/asset                       |               |               |               |\n| At the beginning of the financial year                   | (3,007)       | (1,402)       | (91)          |\n| Acquisition of subsidiaries and operations 1             | (867)         | -             | -             |\n| Income tax charge recorded in the income statement 2,3   | (387)         | (125)         | (1,325)       |\n| Income tax credit/(charge) recorded directly in equity   | 6             | (42)          | 42            |\n| Divestment and demerger of subsidiaries and operations 4 | -             | (1,439)       | -             |\n| Other movements                                          | 12            | 1             | (28)          |\n| At the end of the financial year                         | (4,243)       | (3,007)       | (1,402)       |\n\n- 1 Relates to the acquisition of OZL on 2 May 2023.

Where the Group has undistributed earnings held by associates and joint interests, the deferred tax liability will be recognised as there is no ability to control the timing of the potential distributions.\n- 3 The Group has deductible temporary differences relating to mineral rights for which deferred tax assets have not been recognised because it is not probable that future capital gains will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits. The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.\n- 4 The Group has other deductible temporary differences for which deferred tax assets have not been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.

For the purpose of this analysis, the cashflow period has been restricted to 100 years.\n\n|                                                           | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Proportion of the Group's undiscounted forecast cashflows | %      | %      |\n| In one year or less                                       | 3      | 3      |\n| In more than one year but not more than two years         | 4      | 3      |\n| In more than two years but not more than five years       | 8      | 9      |\n| In more than five years but not more than ten years       | 14     | 15     |\n| In more than ten years                                    | 71     | 70     |\n| Total                                                     | 100    | 100    |\n\nThe Group is required to close and rehabilitate sites and associated facilities at the end of or, in some cases, during the course of production to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities, as specified in licence requirements and the Group's closure performance requirements.\n\nThe key components of closure and rehabilitation activities are:\n\n- -  the removal of all unwanted infrastructure associated with an operation\n- -  the return of disturbed areas to a safe, stable and self-sustaining condition, consistent with the agreed post-closure land use\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nProvisions for closure and rehabilitation are recognised by the Group when:\n\n- -  it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events\n- -  it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation\n- -  the amount can be reliably estimated",

        "page_content": "## 15  Closure and rehabilitation provisions continued\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nClosure and rehabilitation provisions are initially recognised when an environmental disturbance first occurs. The individual site provisions are an estimate of the expected value of future cash flows required to close the relevant site using current standards and techniques and taking into account risks and uncertainties. Individual site provisions are discounted to their present value using currency specific discount rates aligned to the estimated timing of cash outflows.\n\nWhen provisions for closure and rehabilitation are initially recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset, representing part of the cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the operation.\n\nThe closure and rehabilitation asset, recognised within property, plant and equipment, is depreciated over the life of the operations. The value of the provision is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds, resulting in an expense recognised in net finance costs.\n\nThe closure and rehabilitation provision is reviewed at each reporting date to assess if the estimate continues to reflect the best estimate of the obligation. If necessary, the provision is remeasured to account for factors such as:\n\n- -  additional disturbance during the period\n- -  revisions to estimated reserves, resources and lives of operations including any changes to expected operating lives arising from the Group's latest assessment of the potential impacts of climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy\n- -  developments in technology\n- -  changes to regulatory requirements and environmental management strategies\n- -  changes in the estimated extent and costs of anticipated activities, including the effects of inflation and movements in foreign exchange rates\n- -  movements in interest rates affecting the discount rate applied\n\nChanges to the closure and rehabilitation estimate for operating sites are added to, or deducted from, the related asset and amortised on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the operation, generally applying the units of production method.\n\nCosts arising from unforeseen circumstances, such as the contamination caused by unplanned discharges, are recognised as an expense and liability when the event gives rise to an obligation that is probable and capable of reliable estimation.\n\n## Closed sites\n\nWhere future economic benefits are no longer expected to be derived through operation, changes to the associated closure and remediation costs are charged to the income statement in the period identified. This amounted to US$4 million in the year ended 30 June 2023 (2022: US$74 million; 2021: US$483 million).\n\n## Key estimates\n\nClosure cost estimates are generally based on conceptual level studies early in the operating life of an asset with more detailed studies and planning performed as closure risks (including those related to climate change) are identified and/or as an asset, or parts thereof, near closure. As such, the recognition and measurement of closure and rehabilitation provisions requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to:\n\n- -  the extent (due to legal or constructive obligations) of potential activities required for the removal of infrastructure, decharacterisation of tailings storage facilities and rehabilitation activities\n- -  costs associated with future closure activities\n- -  the extent and period of post-closure monitoring and maintenance, including water management\n- -  applicable discount rates\n- -  the timing of cash flows and ultimate closure of operations\n\nThe extent, cost and timing of future closure activities may also be impacted by the potential physical impacts of climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. Further detail is provided in note 16 'Climate Change'.\n\nEstimates for post-closure monitoring and maintenance reflect the Group's strategies for individual sites, which may include possible relinquishment. The period of monitoring and maintenance included in the provision requires judgement and considers regulatory and licencing requirements, the outcomes of studies and management's current assessment of stakeholder expectations.\n\nWhile progressive closure is performed across a number of operations, significant activities are generally undertaken at the end of the production life at the individual sites, the estimated timing of which is informed by the Group's current assumptions relating to demand for commodities and carbon pricing, and their impact on the Group's long-term price forecasts.\n\nApproximately 51 per cent (2022: 48 per cent) of the Group's total undiscounted forecast cashflows are expected to be incurred after more than 30 years, reflecting the long-lived nature of many of the Group's operations which have remaining production lives ranging from 1-103 years (2022: 2-104 years). The discount rates applied to the Group's\n\nclosure and rehabilitation provisions are determined by reference to the currency of the closure cash flows, the period over which the cash flows will be incurred and prevailing market interest rates (where available). The Group continues to monitor current market conditions with no change made to the Group's discount rates in the current year.\n\nWhile the closure and rehabilitation provisions reflect management's best estimates based on current knowledge and information, further studies, trials and detailed analysis of relevant knowledge and resultant closure activities for individual assets continue to be performed throughout the life of asset. Such studies and analysis can impact the estimated costs of closure activities. Estimates can also be impacted by the emergence of new closure and rehabilitation techniques, changes in regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations for closure (including costs associated with equitable transition), development of new technologies, risks relating to climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy, and experience at other operations. These uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided for in the balance sheet.\n\n## Sensitivity\n\nA 0.5 per cent increase in the discount rates applied at 30 June 2023 would result in a decrease to the closure and rehabilitation provision of approximately US$758 million, a decrease in property, plant and equipment of approximately US$568 million in relation to operating sites and an income statement credit of approximately US$190 million in respect of closed sites. In addition, the change would result in a decrease of approximately US$44 million to depreciation expense and a US$26 million increment in net finance costs for the year ending 30 June 2024.\n\nGiven the long-lived nature of the majority of the Group's assets, the majority of final closure activities are generally not expected to occur for a significant period of time.\n\nHowever, a one-year acceleration in forecast cash flows of the Group's closure and rehabilitation provisions, in isolation, would result in an increase to the provision of approximately US$209 million, an increase in property, plant and equipment of US$148 million in relation to operating sites and an income statement charge of US$61 million in respect of closed sites.",

Identifying, monitoring and assessing the actual and potential impacts of climate change is complex and the Group continues to develop its assessment of the actual and potential financial impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities, including the transition to a low-carbon economy and physical risk impacts.\n\nThe Group's current climate change strategy focuses on:\n\n- -  building a portfolio to support the megatrends shaping our world, including future-facing commodities (copper, nickel and potash) and steelmaking materials (iron ore and metallurgical coal)\n- -  reducing operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n- -  investing in low GHG emissions technologies\n- -  supporting GHG emissions reductions in our value chain and promoting product stewardship\n- -  managing climate-related risks (threats and opportunities)\n- -  working with others to enhance the global policy and market response\n\nAreas of the financial statements that may potentially be impacted in connection with this strategy throughout the value creation and delivery cycle of the Group's operations, include:\n\n| Phase                            | Areas of potential financial statement impact                                           |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Exploration and acquisition      | -  Financial impact of portfolio decisions                                              |\n| Development and mining /         | -  Impact of transition risks (threats and opportunities) on asset carrying values      |\n| Process and logistics            | -  Physical risk impacts on asset carrying values                                       |\n|                                  | -  Acquisition of carbon credits, and application of carbon pricing assumptions         |\n|                                  | -  Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment                               |\n|                                  | -  Expenditure on operational decarbonisation                                           |\n|                                  | -  Expenditure to support value chain decarbonisation                                   |\n| Sales, marketing and procurement | -  Key transition materials and future-facing commodities and the revenue they generate |\n|                                  | -  Expenditure to support value chain decarbonisation                                   |\n| Closure and rehabilitation       | -  Physical risk impacts on asset carrying values                                       |\n|                                  | -  Timing, scope and expected cost of closure and rehabilitation activities             |\n\nAt the date of issue of these Financial Statements, indicators show the appropriate measures are not in place globally to drive decarbonisation at the pace or scale required for the aims of the Paris Agreement to be achieved as the most likely future outcome. As such, the significant judgements and key estimates used in the preparation of these financial statements reflect the Group's current operational planning cases (described below) which are not currently aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C temperature outcome.\n\nHowever, while not the basis of preparation of these financial statements, the Group continues to assess the potential financial statement impacts of the 1.5\u00b0C temperature outcome goal of the Paris Agreement under the Group's 1.5\u00b0C scenario 1 .\n\nFuture changes to the Group's climate change strategy or global decarbonisation signposts may impact the Group's significant judgements and key estimates, and result in material changes to financial results and the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities in future reporting periods.\n\n## Financial impact of portfolio decisions\n\nDuring FY2023, the Group completed the acquisition of OZ Minerals Limited (OZL) and announced the proposed divestment of its interest in the Daunia and Blackwater lower-quality metallurgical coal mines, currently part of the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). Further information in respect of the acquisition of OZL is included in note 29 'Business combinations'. Given the timing of the acquisition, the OZL assets will be incorporated into the Group's climate-related assessments, and associated disclosures, in FY2024 as integration of the business continues.\n\nThese activities support the continued reshaping of the Group's portfolio to focus on future-facing commodities, iron ore and higher quality metallurgical coal. They follow the completion, in FY2022, of the merger of the Group's Petroleum business with Woodside and the divestment of the Group's interests in BHP Mitsui Coal Pty Ltd (BMC) and the Cerrej\u00f3n non-operated energy coal joint venture.\n\nAlso in FY2022, the Group announced that it would retain New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) in its portfolio, seek the relevant approvals to continue mining beyond the current consent that expires at the end of FY2026 and proceed with a managed process to cease mining at the asset by the end of FY2030.\n\nFollowing impairments recognised in previous periods, the net carrying value of NSWEC at 30 June 2023 is approximately negative US$220 million comprising property, plant and equipment (PP&E) of approximately US$530 million and closure provisions and other liabilities of approximately US$750 million. As at 30 June 2023, the potential exposure to further impairment for NSWEC is limited to the book value of PP&E of US$530 million, with the forecast cash flows over the proposed operating period supporting the current carrying value. Further, the useful lives of NSWEC PP&E do not exceed the remaining proposed operating period.\n\n## Impact of transition risks (threats and opportunities) on asset carrying values\n\nSignificant judgements and key estimates in relation to the preparation of the Financial Statements are impacted by the Group's current assessment of the range of economic and climate-related conditions that could exist in the world's transition to a low-carbon economy, considering the current trajectory of society and the global economy as a whole.\n\nFor example, demand for the Group's commodities may decrease due to policy, regulatory (including carbon pricing mechanisms), legal, technological, market or societal responses to climate change, resulting in a proportion of a cash generating unit's (CGU) reserves becoming incapable of extraction in an economically viable fashion.\n\n- 1 This scenario requires steep global annual emissions reduction, sustained for decades, to stay within a 1.5\u00b0C carbon budget. 1.5\u00b0C is above pre-industrial levels. For more information about the assumptions, outputs and limitations of our 1.5\u00b0C scenario refer to the BHP Climate Change Report 2020 available at bhp.com. The Group is preparing an updated 1.5\u00b0C scenario in FY2024.",

        "page_content": "## 16  Climate change continued\n\nTo support strategic decision making, the Group develops a number of divergent climate scenarios and pathways. In FY2023, the Group's One Energy View, being the Group's current estimates of the most likely future states for the global economy and associated sub-systems, was updated to reflect three different pathways under which most developed economies would reach net zero around 2050, with other large economies reaching net zero in 2060 and 2070. While the global gross domestic product assumptions and the pace and drivers of decarbonisation vary across the pathways, each pathway results in a global average temperature increase of around 2\u00b0C by 2100.\n\nThe Group uses the One Energy View pathways as inputs to the Group's operational planning cases as they reflect the Group's current best estimates of the most likely range of future states for the global economy and associated sub-systems. These pathways inform updates to the Group's commodity supply and demand outlooks and are used, in conjunction with other market sources of information, to determine the Group's short and long-term price outlooks. Other sources of information include commodity price forward curves, consensus price outlooks and commodity specific price outlooks sourced from industry analysts.\n\nGiven the complexity and inherent uncertainty of climate modelling, these pathways are reviewed periodically to reflect new information, with a process in place to assess the need to update internal long-term price outlooks for developments in the periods between pathway updates.\n\nThe Group reflects the operational planning cases and associated price outlooks in the internal valuations used as the basis for the Group's impairment assessments.\n\nThe discount rate used in the internal valuations reflects a real post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC), including country and state risk premia where appropriate, and ranges from 7.0 per cent to 9.5 per cent across the Group (FY2022: 6.0 per cent to 8.5 per cent). Cash flow forecasts used as the basis for impairment testing include asset specific risks, including climate-related risks such as operational interruptions as a result of physical climaterelated risks, and therefore the Group does not include a separate climate-related risk adjustment in the Group's WACC.\n\n## Physical risk impacts on asset carrying values\n\nThe Group's operations are exposed to physical climate-related risks. In FY2023, the Group progressed impact evaluations of physical climate-related risks to better understand the potential impacts to site operations, safety, productivity and cost, with these assessments to continue in FY2024.\n\nThe Group's consideration of potential physical climate-related risk impacts when developing the Group's operating plans, including factors such as operational interruptions caused by extreme weather events, therefore considers only the Group's current best estimates of the potential financial impacts of certain climate-related physical risks.\n\nGiven the complexity of physical risk modelling and the ongoing nature of the Group's physical risk assessment process, the identification of additional risks and/or the detailed development of the Group's response may result in material changes to financial results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities in future reporting periods.\n\n## Acquisition of carbon credits and application of carbon pricing assumptions\n\nThe Group's carbon credits and offsetting strategy is currently being managed at a consolidated Group level. However, individual investment decisions and asset valuations used for the purposes of impairment testing, consider carbon price assumptions for major Group operational, competitor and customer countries by applying a carbon price to estimated unmitigated Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions over the life of the respective operation.\n\nIn determining the Group's forecast, factors including a country's current and announced climate policies, targets and societal factors, such as public acceptance and demographics, are considered. As at the date of these Financial Statements, the carbon price used in asset valuations reflects the following ranges:\n\n| US$ real (January 2022) per tCO2   | FY2030  Low   |   FY2030  High |   FY2050  Low |   FY2050  High |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Australia                          | 25            |             75 |           150 |            225 |\n| Brazil                             | 5             |             50 |           125 |            200 |\n| Chile                              | 8             |             41 |           150 |            225 |\n| Canada                             | 65            |            102 |           200 |            225 |\n| Key customer countries             | -             |            175 |            25 |            250 |\n\nThe Group acquires carbon credits for the purposes of both compliance and possible voluntary surrender or retirement to achieve the Group's net zero operational GHG emissions long-term goal by CY2050. The Group may also sell to optimise carbon credits depending on internal use requirements or originate carbon credits through project development or direct investment.\n\nExpenditure on carbon credits during FY2023 amounted to approximately US$15 million. The Group did not voluntarily surrender or retire any carbon credits during FY2023.\n\nFrom FY2024, the Group will be subject to the reforms made to Australia's Safeguard Mechanism in FY2023 which, in effect, levy a carbon price for large facilities by requiring the surrender of eligible credits when their Scope 1 emissions exceed a progressively declining legislated limit (known as a baseline). As such, in future reporting periods, the Group may recognise liabilities where an obligation to purchase eligible carbon credits exists and/or intangible assets for carbon credits acquired or generated to meet those obligations.\n\n## Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment\n\nThe determination of useful lives of the Group's PP&E requires judgement, including consideration of the Group's climate change strategy, targets and goals, decarbonisation plans and the possible impact of transition risks on demand for the Group's commodities.\n\nUseful lives are reviewed each reporting period, including to ensure they do not exceed the remaining expected operating life of the operation in which they are utilised, and are updated as required. The remaining lives of the Group's operations reflect the Group's operational planning cases and their underlying climate-related assumptions.\n\nA key component of the Group's operational decarbonisation strategy is the displacement of diesel within the Group's operations, particularly the haul truck fleet. The Group is supporting the development of new equipment by original equipment manufacturers, including entering into partnerships focused on the development and trialling of electrical locomotives and haul trucks.\n\nWhile technical and commercial development of the technology needed is progressing, the Group's operating plans generally assume replacement of haul trucks, and other diesel powered equipment, at the end of their useful lives in line with the Group's regular fleet renewal programs. For example, a significant proportion of the Group's current WAIO mining fleet is due for replacement prior to the expected availability of battery electric vehicle solutions. As such, the Group's decarbonisation plans have not had a material impact on the estimated remaining useful lives of the Group's existing fleet of assets in FY2023.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 16  Climate change continued\n\n## Expenditure on operational decarbonisation\n\nThe Group has set a target to reduce its operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 from our operated assets) by at least 30 per cent from the Group's FY2020 baseline levels by FY2030 and a goal to achieve net zero operational GHG emissions by CY2050.\n\nGiven the timing of the OZ Minerals Limited acquisition, the Group plans to update the baseline for both the Group's medium-term target and longterm goal in FY2024.\n\nThe Group's operational decarbonisation activities during FY2023 largely focused on the transition of the Group's electricity supply to renewable sources. The Group also continued to progress projects in relation to displacement of diesel and managing fugitive methane, however expenditure in these areas is expected to increase towards the second half of the decade.\n\nA significant proportion of the Group's renewable electricity is currently sourced through power purchase agreements and judgement is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment of such arrangements. Depending on the specific terms and conditions, power purchase agreements may be recognised as:\n\n- -  an expense when incurred\n- -  a financial derivative; or\n- -  a lease liability, with an associated right of use asset\n\nAt 30 June 2023, the Group recognised derivatives associated with renewable power purchase agreements (including those signed arrangements in which supply will commence in future periods) with a fair value of approximately US$50 million. No significant leases have been recognised by the Group in relation to renewable power purchase agreements at 30 June 2023.\n\nCapital expenditure associated with renewable power purchase agreements is generally limited and, given the early stage of development of diesel displacement and management of fugitive methane, capital expenditure on decarbonisation in FY2023 was not material.\n\nCapital and operating expenditures associated with projects aimed at contributing to the achievement of the Group's operational GHG emissions medium-term target and long-term goal have been incorporated into the estimated future cash flows of the Group's assets. These cash flow estimates form the basis of the Group's impairment assessments as outlined in further detail in note 13 'Impairment of non-current assets'.\n\nOf the total future capital expenditure on operational decarbonisation, the Group expects to spend around US$4 billion (nominal terms) by FY2030, with the majority of decarbonisation capital over this period being spent on diesel-displacement projects 2 .\n\nMany of the projects planned to commence before FY2030 are likely to extend beyond the Group's medium-term target period, and are expected to make a substantial contribution towards the Group's long-term goal of net zero operational GHG emissions by CY2050. Significant expenditure on fleet renewal at certain assets, for example Olympic Dam, is expected to occur after FY2030.\n\nAs the Group's climate response is further integrated into businessas-usual planning, the spending on climate initiatives is expected to increasingly form part of ordinary course business expenditures. Any change to the Group's climate change strategy could impact the expected level of expenditure on operational decarbonisation and the associated financial statement significant judgements and key estimates.\n\n- 2 Based on latest business plans and excluding recently acquired OZL assets. In respect of diesel-displacement, amounts included in the US$4 billion reflect incremental estimated spend above internal combustion engine replacement costs and supporting site infrastructure.\n- 3 Battery-suitable nickel is defined as nickel briquettes, nickel powder and nickel sulphate. It does not include off-specification nickel metal. Calculated based on gross revenue from battery suitable nickel multiplied by percentage of BHP's sales of battery-suitable nickel, as applicable to battery material suppliers. Where a customer's planned end use is not known with certainty to be for battery supply, assumptions of usage have been made using historical nickel usage for those customers.\n\ncontinued\n\n| WAIO                        | 40%   |\n|-----------------------------|-------|\n| Escondida                   | 31%   |\n| BMA                         | 12%   |\n| Pampa Norte and Potash      | 11%   |\n| Olympic Dam and Nickel West | 6%    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Expenditure to support value chain decarbonisation\n\nThe Group continues to invest, including in partnership with others, in potential GHG emissions reduction opportunities in its value chain through technology innovation and development to support reductions to its total reported Scope 3 emissions inventory, with a particular focus on steelmaking and maritime emissions.\n\nHowever, while we seek to influence reduction opportunities, Scope 3 emissions occur outside of our direct control. Reduction pathways are dependent on the development, and upstream or downstream deployment of, solutions and/or supportive policy. Where possible, the financial impact of the Group's activities in support of the development of Scope 3 reduction pathways is reflected in the financial statements. For example, the Group recognised additional lease liabilities, and associated right of use assets, of US$90 million during FY2023 when chartering of the Group's new dual-fuelled LNG vessels. Further detail of the Group's leases is provided in note 22 'Leases'.\n\nIt is, however, currently not possible to reliably estimate or measure the full potential financial statement impacts of the Group's pursuit of its Scope 3 goals and targets.\n\n## Key transition materials and future-facing commodities, and the revenue they generate\n\nThere is no agreed or established approach to defining revenue from commodities that are key to the transition to a low-carbon economy. The investor-led initiative Climate Action 100+ is developing a Diversified Mining Net Zero Standard with the draft Standard defining key transition materials. The FTSE Green Revenues Classification System is a taxonomy designed by FTSE Russell to better identify products and services contributing to the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nApplying the Climate Action 100+ draft Standard definitions and the FTSE Russel taxonomy would result in the Group classifying copper, nickel and uranium as key transition materials. FY2023 revenue for these commodities was US$14.9 billion, US$1.9 billion (comprised of Batterysuitable 3 US$1.0 billion and Other US$0.9 billion) and US$0.4 billion respectively. (FY2022: US$16.0 billion, US$1.7 billion and US$0.2 billion, respectively).",

In estimating the potential cost of closure activities, the Group considers factors such as long-term weather outlooks, for example forecast changes in rainfall patterns. Closure cost estimates also consider the impact of the Group's climate change strategy on the costs and timing of performing closure activities and the impact of new technology where appropriately developed and tested. For example, closure cost estimates largely continue to reflect the use of existing fuel sources for the Group's equipment while the Group continues to invest in the development of alternative fuel sources and fleet electrification.\n\nThe estimated cost of closure activities includes management's current best estimate in relation to post-closure monitoring and maintenance, which may be required for significant periods beyond the completion of other closure activities and is therefore exposed to potential long-term climate-related impacts. While reflecting management's current best estimate, the cost of post-closure monitoring and maintenance may change in future reporting periods as the understanding of, and potential long-term impacts from, climate change continue to evolve.\n\nGiven the long-lived nature of the majority of the Group's assets, the majority of final closure activities are not expected to occur for a significant period of time. However, acknowledging the wide range of potential energy transition impacts for metallurgical coal demand, and for illustrative purposes only, a five-year acceleration in forecast cash flows relating to the Group's metallurgical coal closure and rehabilitation provisions, in isolation, would be estimated to result in an increase to the provision of approximately 15 per cent, which approximates to US$250 million.\n\nFurther, while the Group's NSWEC closure provision remains subject to estimation and assumptions, the timing of closure is no longer considered materially susceptible to potential long-term climate-related impacts.\n\nMore detail on the key judgements and estimates impacting the Group's closure and rehabilitation provisions is presented in note 15 'Closure and rehabilitation provisions'.\n\n## Paris Agreement and 1.5\u00b0C scenarios\n\nAs governments, institutions, companies, and society increasingly focus on addressing climate change, the potential for a non-linear and/or more rapid transition and the subsequent impact on climate-related threats and opportunities increases.\n\nAccordingly, in addition to the operational planning cases, the Group utilises a range of scenarios, including its 1.5\u00b0C scenario, when testing the resilience of its portfolio, forming strategy and making investment decisions.\n\nThe Group continues to monitor global decarbonisation signposts and updates its operational planning cases, price outlooks and cost of carbon assumptions and assessments relating to strategy and capital allocation accordingly. When such signposts indicate the appropriate measures are in place for achievement of a 1.5\u00baC scenario, this will be reflected in the Group's operational planning cases.\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nWhile a 1.5\u00b0C scenario does not currently represent one of the inputs to the Group's operational planning cases, the Group has systematically integrated its 1.5\u00b0C scenario into the Group's strategy and capital allocation process to test the extent to which its capital allocation is aligned with a rapidly decarbonising global economy.\n\nSpecifically, in addition to consideration of the Group's operational planning cases, the Group applies its 1.5\u00b0C scenario to assess whether future demand for the Group's products supports ongoing capital investment. The internal allocation of capital under the Group's Capital Allocation Framework and all major investment decisions continue to require an assessment of investment viability under the Group's 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\nIntegration of the Group's 1.5\u00b0C scenario into the capital allocation process is intended to mitigate the risk of stranded assets, and associated impairments, should the appropriate global measures to achieve a 1.5\u00b0C outcome be adopted.\n\n## Demand for the Group's commodities impacting price outlooks\n\nThe Group acknowledges that there are a range of possible energy transition scenarios, including those that are aligned with the aims of the Paris Agreement, that may indicate different outcomes for individual commodities. The Group examines the resilience of its portfolio to a 1.5\u00b0C scenario (the Group's 1.5\u00b0C scenario) on an ongoing basis by considering the impact of commodity price estimates under that scenario using the Group's latest operating plans.\n\nThere are inherent limitations with scenario analysis and it is difficult to predict which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate and none of the scenarios considered constitutes a definitive outcome for the Group.\n\nHowever, the long-term commodity price estimates under the Group's 1.5\u00b0C scenario reflect the world needing more steel, copper, potash and nickel in the next 30 years when compared to the last 30 years. In addition, the Group's portfolio is transitioning towards higher quality iron ore and metallurgical coal that enable steelmakers to be more efficient and operate with a lower GHG emissions intensity.\n\nThe Group considers that is it currently impracticable to fully assess all potential Financial Statement impacts under the Group's 1.5\u00b0C scenario. However, the Group has carried out analysis which indicates that the long-term commodity price outlooks under this scenario for iron ore, copper, metallurgical coal, nickel and potash are either largely consistent with or favourable to the price outlooks in the Group's current operational planning cases. Given these positive long-term price outlooks, price-only sensitivities to the Group's long-term 1.5\u00b0C price outlook indicate that there would not be any asset impairments for those commodities.\n\nFurther, acknowledging the wide range of potential energy transition impacts for metallurgical coal demand, the Group has also performed additional price-only sensitivities for the Group's metallurgical coal assets. These price-only sensitivities reflect different price outlooks while assuming that all other factors in the asset valuations, such as production and sales volumes, capital and operating expenditures, carbon pricing and the discount rate, remain unchanged from those used in the Group's FY2023 metallurgical coal impairment assessments. As such, the sensitivities do not attempt to assess all potential financial statement impacts, including impacts on asset valuations, that may arise under the Group's 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\nUnder the Group's operational planning case assumptions, headroom in excess of US$6.5 billion currently exists between the carrying value of the Group's metallurgical coal assets and their estimated valuation. As such, these sensitivities indicate that adverse movements in long-term price assumptions, in isolation, would reduce the current headroom on the Group's metallurgical coal assets but, given the current headroom, may not result in an impairment.\n\nPrice-only sensitivities reflect the following price outlooks published in August 2022 by Wood Mackenzie, a research and consultancy business for the global energy, power and renewables, subsurface, chemicals, and metals and mining industries:\n\n| Price source   |   CY2030 Price  (real, US$/ tonne) |   CY2050 Price  (real, US$/ tonne) |\n|----------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Base case      |                                159 |                                170 |\n| 1.5\u00b0C scenario |                                127 |                                135 |\n\nNo impairment is indicated by these price-only sensitivities.\n\nThe Group does not disclose the Group's internally generated long-term price outlooks for individual commodities, including those under the Group's 1.5\u00b0C scenario, given their commercial sensitivity.",

While these liabilities are included in the Group interest bearing liabilities, they are excluded from the net debt calculation as they do not align with how the Group assesses net debt for decision making in relation to the Capital Allocation Framework. In addition, the freight index has historically been volatile which creates significant short-term fluctuation in these liabilities.\n\n|                                                                      | 2023    | 2023        | 2022    | 2022        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|---------|-------------|\n| US$M                                                                 | Current | Non-current | Current | Non-current |\n| Interest bearing liabilities                                         |         |             |         |             |\n| Bank loans                                                           | 5,310   | 2,192       | 397     | 2,075       |\n| Notes and debentures                                                 | 1,337   | 10,482      | 1,690   | 9,673       |\n| Lease liabilities                                                    | 521     | 2,498       | 519     | 2,057       |\n| Bank overdraft and short-term borrowings                             | 5       | -           | -       | -           |\n| Other                                                                | -       | -           | 16      | 1           |\n| Total interest bearing liabilities                                   | 7,173   | 15,172      | 2,622   | 13,806      |\n| Less: Lease liability associated with index-linked freight contracts | 114     | 173         | 113     | 161         |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents                                      |         |             |         |             |\n| Cash                                                                 | 7,206   | -           | 5,728   | -           |\n| Short-term deposits                                                  | 5,222   | -           | 11,508  | -           |\n| Less: Total cash and cash equivalents                                | 12,428  | -           | 17,236  | -           |\n| Less: Derivatives included in net debt                               |         |             |         |             |\n| Net debt management related instruments 1                            | (113)   | (1,459)     | (358)   | (1,330)     |\n| Net cash management related instruments 2                            | 36      | -           | 273     | -           |\n| Less: Total derivatives included in net debt                         | (77)    | (1,459)     | (85)    | (1,330)     |\n| Net debt                                                             |         | 11,166      |         | 333         |\n| Net assets                                                           |         | 48,530      |         | 48,766      |\n| Gearing                                                              |         | 18.7%       |         | 0.7%        |\n\nCash and short-term deposits are disclosed in the cash flow statement net of bank overdrafts and interest bearing liabilities at call.\n\n|                                                    | 2023   US$M   | 2022   US$M   | 2021   US$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Total cash and cash equivalents                    | 12,428        | 17,236        | 15,246        |\n| Bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings          | (5)           | -             | -             |\n| Total cash and cash equivalents, net of overdrafts | 12,423        | 17,236        | 15,246        |\n\nCash and cash equivalents includes US$95 million (2022: US$127 million) restricted by legal or contractual arrangements.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nCash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and on hand and highly liquid cash deposits with short-term maturities that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

        "page_content": "## 1  Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 21  Net debt continued\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group's liquidity risk arises from the possibility that it may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due and is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy. Operational, capital and regulatory requirements are considered in the management of liquidity risk, in conjunction with short-term and long-term forecast information.\n\nRecognising the cyclical volatility of operating cash flows, the Group has defined minimum target cash and liquidity buffers to be maintained to mitigate liquidity risk and support operations through the cycle.\n\nThe Group's strong credit profile, diversified funding sources, its minimum cash buffer and its committed credit facilities ensure that sufficient liquid funds are maintained to meet its daily cash requirements.\n\nThe Group's Moody's credit rating changed from A2/P-1 to A1/P-1 outlook stable (long-term/short-term). The Group's Standard & Poor's rating has remained at A-/A-1 outlook stable (long-term/short-term).\n\nThere were no defaults on the Group's liabilities during the period.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to credit risk from its financing activities, including short-term cash investments such as deposits with banks and derivative contracts. This risk is managed by Group Treasury in line with the counterparty risk framework, which aims to minimise the exposure to a counterparty and mitigate the risk of financial loss through counterparty failure.\n\nExposure to counterparties is monitored at a Group level across all products and includes exposure with derivatives and cash investments.\n\nInvestments and derivatives are only transacted with approved counterparties who have been assigned specific limits based on a quantitative credit risk model. These limits are updated at least bi-annually. Additionally, derivatives are subject to tenor limits and investments are subject to concentration limits by rating.\n\nDerivative fair values are inclusive of valuation adjustments that take into account both the counterparty and the Group's risk of default.\n\n## Standby arrangements and unused credit facilities\n\nThe Group's committed revolving credit facility operates as a back-stop to the Group's uncommitted commercial paper program. The combined amount drawn under the facility or as commercial paper will not exceed US$5.5 billion. As at 30 June 2023, US$ nil commercial paper was drawn (2022: US$ nil). The facility is due to mature on 10 October 2026. A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn balance and interest is payable on any drawn balance comprising a reference rate plus a margin. The agreed margins are typical for a credit facility extended to a company with the Group's credit rating.\n\n## Maturity profile of financial liabilities\n\nThe maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual amounts, taking into account the derivatives related to debt, is as follows:\n\n| 2023   US$M                                         | Bank loans,  debentures and  other loans   | Expected  future interest  payments   | Derivatives  related to  debentures   | Other  derivatives   | Obligations  under lease  liabilities   | Trade   and other  payables 1   | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------|\n| Due for payment:                                    |                                            |                                       |                                       |                      |                                         |                                 |         |\n| In one year or less or on demand                    | 6,659                                      | 757                                   | 536                                   | 257                  | 658                                     | 6,175                           | 15,042  |\n| In more than one year but not more than two years   | 1,399                                      | 595                                   | 388                                   | 126                  | 538                                     | 4                               | 3,050   |\n| In more than two years but not more than five years | 4,058                                      | 1,410                                 | 399                                   | 267                  | 1,031                                   | -

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments from the lease commencement date and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the interest on lease liabilities, lease payments and any remeasurements due to, for example, lease modifications or a change to future lease payments linked to an index or rate. Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, where the rate is not readily determinable, the interest payments are discounted at the Group's weighted average incremental borrowing rate, adjusted to reflect factors specific to the lease, including where relevant the currency, tenor and location of the lease.\n\nIn addition to containing a lease, the Group's contractual arrangements may include non-lease components. For example, certain mining services arrangements involve the provision of additional services, including maintenance, drilling activities and the supply of personnel. The Group has elected to separate these non-lease components from the lease components in measuring lease liabilities. Non-lease components are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policies applied to each underlying good or service received.\n\nLow-value and short-term leases continue to be expensed to the income statement. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are excluded from lease liabilities, and expensed to the income statement.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost will initially correspond to the lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs, lease payments made prior to lease commencement, capitalised provisions for closure and rehabilitation and any lease incentives received.\n\nThe lease asset and liability associated with all index-linked freight contracts, including continuous voyage charters (CVCs), are measured at each reporting date based on the prevailing freight index (generally the Baltic C5 index).\n\nLease costs are recognised in the income statement over the lease term in the form of depreciation on the right-of-use asset and the unwinding of finance charges on the lease liability.\n\nWhere the Group is the operator of an unincorporated joint operation and all investors are parties to a lease, the Group recognises its proportionate share of the lease liability and associated right-of-use asset. In the event the Group is the sole signatory to a lease, and therefore has the sole legal obligation to make lease payments, the lease liability is recognised in full. Where the associated right-of-use asset is sub-leased (under a finance sub-lease) to a joint operation, for instance where it is dedicated to a single operation and the joint operation has the right to direct the use of the asset, the Group (as lessor) recognises its proportionate share of the right-of-use asset and a net investment in the lease, representing amounts to be recovered from the other parties to the joint operation. If the Group is not party to the head lease contract but sub-leases the associated right-of-use asset (as lessee), it recognises its proportionate share of the right-of-use asset and a lease liability which is payable to the operator.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nJudgements: Certain contractual arrangements not in the form of a lease require the Group to apply significant judgement in evaluating whether the Group controls the right to direct the use of assets and therefore whether the contract contains a lease. Management considers all facts and circumstances in determining whether the Group or the supplier has the rights to direct how, and for what purpose, the underlying assets are used in certain mining contracts and other arrangements, including outsourcing and shipping arrangements. Judgement is used to assess which decision-making rights mostly affect the benefits of use of the assets for each arrangement.\n\nWhere a contract includes the provision of non-lease services, judgement is required to identify the lease and non-lease components.\n\nEstimates: Where the Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, estimation is involved in the determination of the weighted average incremental borrowing rate to measure lease liabilities.\n\nThe incremental borrowing rate reflects the rates of interest a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, with similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. Under the Group's portfolio approach to debt management, the Group does not specifically borrow for asset purchases. Therefore, the incremental borrowing rate is estimated referencing the Group's corporate borrowing portfolio and other similar rated entities, adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease (including the impact of currency, credit rating of subsidiary entering into the lease and the term of the lease), at the inception of the lease arrangement or the time of lease modification.\n\nThe Group estimates stand-alone prices, where such prices are not readily observable, in order to allocate the contractual payments between lease and non-lease components.",

Finance costs are expensed as incurred, except where they relate to the financing of construction or development of qualifying assets.\n\n## 24  Financial risk management\n\n## 24.1  Financial risks\n\n## Financial and capital risk management strategy\n\nThe financial risks arising from the Group's operations comprise market, liquidity and credit risk. These risks arise in the normal course of business and the Group manages its exposure to them in accordance with the Group's portfolio risk management strategy. The objective of the strategy is to support the delivery of the Group's financial targets, while protecting its future financial security and flexibility by taking advantage of the natural diversification provided by the scale, diversity and flexibility of the Group's operations and activities.\n\nAs part of the risk management strategy, the Group monitors target gearing levels and credit rating metrics under a range of different stress test scenarios incorporating operational and macroeconomic factors.\n\n## Market risk management\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to market risks associated with movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. Under the strategy outlined above, the Group seeks to achieve financing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity prices on a floating or index basis.\n\nIn executing the strategy, financial instruments are potentially employed in three distinct but related activities. The following table summarises these activities and the key risk management processes:\n\n| Activity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Key risk management processes                                                                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 Risk mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                     |\n| On an exception basis, hedging for the purposes of mitigating risk related to specific and significant  expenditure on investments or capital projects will be executed if necessary to support the Group's  strategic objectives.                                                                         | Execution of transactions within  approved mandates.                                                |\n| 2 Economic hedging of commodity sales, operating costs, short-term cash deposits,  other monetary items and debt instruments                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                     |\n| Where Group commodity production is sold to customers on pricing terms that deviate from the  relevant index target and where a relevant derivatives market exists, financial instruments may  be executed as an economic hedge to align the revenue price exposure with the index target and  US dollars. | Measuring and reporting the exposure in  customer commodity contracts and issued  debt instruments. |\n| Where debt is issued in a currency other than the US dollar and/or at a fixed interest rate, fair value  and cash flow hedges may be executed to align the debt exposure with the Group's functional  currency of US dollars and/or to swap to a floating interest rate.                                   | Executing hedging derivatives to align the  total group exposure to the index target.               |\n| Where short-term cash deposits and other monetary items are denominated in a currency other than  US dollars, derivative financial instruments may be executed to align the foreign exchange exposure to  the Group's functional currency of US dollars.                                                   | Execution of transactions within  approved mandates.                                                |\n| 3 Strategic financial transactions  Opportunistic transactions may be executed with financial instruments to capture value from perceived  market over/under valuations.                                                                                                                                   | Execution of transactions within                                                                    |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | approved mandates.                                                                                  |\n\nPrimary responsibility for the identification and control of financial risks, including authorising and monitoring the use of financial instruments for the above activities and stipulating policy thereon, rests with the Financial Risk Management Committee under authority delegated by the Chief Executive Officer.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 24  Financial risk management continued\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and short-term cash deposits from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair value of fixed interest rate financial instruments. Interest rate risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.\n\nThe majority of the Group's debt is issued at fixed interest rates. The Group has also drawn on a facility of US$5.0 billion to fund the acquisition of OZL that was referenced to floating rates. The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to convert most of its fixed interest rate exposure to floating US dollar interest rate exposure. As at 30 June 2023, 98 per cent of the Group's borrowings were exposed to floating interest rates inclusive of the effect of swaps (2022: 80 per cent).\n\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in hedge relationships used to hedge both interest rate and foreign currency risks are shown in the valuation hierarchy in section 24.4 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\nBased on the net debt position as at 30 June 2023, taking into account interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, it is estimated that a one percentage point increase in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) interest rate will decrease the Group's equity and profit after taxation by US$58 million (2022: increase of US$29 million). This assumes the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the financial year and the fixed/floating mix and balances are constant over the year.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other benchmark interest rates are being replaced by alternative risk-free rates (ARR) as part of interbank offer rate (IBOR) reform. Sterling LIBOR ceased to be published on 1 January 2022 and USD LIBOR will no longer be published after 30 June 2023.\n\nAmendments to IFRS 9/AASB 9 'Financial Instruments', IFRS 7/AASB 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' and IFRS 16/AASB 16 'Leases' in relation to IBOR reform early adopted by the Group in previous periods impact the Group's cross currency and interest rate swaps, which prior to IBOR reform referenced the US LIBOR benchmark, and the associated hedge accounting.\n\nThese amendments provide relief from applying certain hedge accounting requirements to hedging arrangements directly impacted by IBOR reform. In particular, where changes to the Group's instruments arise solely as a result of IBOR reform and do not change the economic substance of the Group's arrangements, the Group is able to maintain its existing hedge relationships and accounting.\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2023, the Group actively transitioned all impacted cross currency and interest rate swaps from US LIBOR to the alternative, widely adopted SOFR benchmark. As the transition resulted solely from IBOR reform, the Group has applied the relief available in IFRS 9 and continues to apply hedge accounting to its hedging arrangements, including accounting for ineffectiveness. Refer to section 24.4 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' for further information.\n\nThe Group does not hold any material lease arrangements that contain reference to the existing benchmarks and as a result there is no material impact on lease liabilities or right-of-use assets at 30 June 2023.\n\nThe Group's revolving credit facility was restructured to reference to Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs) and remains undrawn. Furthermore, in the period, Escondida has executed new SOFR linked loans and has amended existing US LIBOR linked loans with lenders, so that the applicable floating interest rate reference 3M or 6M Term SOFR rates.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe US dollar is the predominant functional currency within the Group and as a result, currency exposures arise from transactions and balances in currencies other than the US dollar. The Group's potential currency exposures comprise:\n\n- -  translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items\n- -  transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues\n\nThe Group's foreign currency risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.\n\n## Translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items\n\nMonetary items, including financial assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are restated at the end of each reporting period to US dollar equivalents and the associated gain or loss is taken to the income statement. The exception is foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency denominated provisions for closure and rehabilitation at operating sites, which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe Group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards to convert its significant foreign currency exposures in respect of monetary items into US dollars. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates are therefore not expected to have a significant impact on equity and profit after tax.\n\nThe following table shows the carrying values of financial assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period denominated in currencies other than the US dollar that are exposed to foreign currency risk:\n\n| Net financial (liabilities)/assets - by currency of denomination   | 2023   US$M   | 2022   US$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| AUD                                                                | (4,168)       | (3,649)       |\n| CLP                                                                | (74)          | (602)         |\n| GBP                                                                | 353           | 388           |\n| EUR                                                                | 217           | 280           |\n| Other                                                              | 43            | 187           |\n| Total                                                              | (3,629)       | (3,396)       |\n\nThe principal non-functional currencies to which the Group is exposed are the Australian dollar, the Chilean peso, the Pound sterling and the Euro. Based on the Group's net financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2023, a weakening of the US dollar against these currencies (one cent strengthening in Australian dollar, 10 pesos strengthening in Chilean peso, one penny strengthening in Pound sterling and one cent strengthening in Euro), with all other variables held constant, would decrease the Group's equity and profit after taxation by US$15 million (2022: decrease of US$16 million).",

        "page_content": "## 24  Financial risk management continued\n\n## Transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues\n\nCertain operating and capital expenditure is incurred in currencies other than an operation's functional currency. To a lesser extent, certain sales revenue is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations and certain exchange control restrictions may require that funds be maintained in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation. These currency risks are managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy. The Group may enter into forward exchange contracts when required under this strategy.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe risk associated with commodity prices is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy. Substantially all of the Group's commodity production is sold on market-based index pricing terms, with derivatives used from time to time to achieve a specific outcome.\n\nFinancial instruments with commodity price risk comprise forward commodity and other derivative contracts with net liabilities at fair value of US$20 million (2022: net liabilities of US$56 million).\n\n## Provisionally priced commodity sales and purchases contracts\n\nProvisionally priced sales or purchases volumes are those for which price finalisation, referenced to the relevant index, is outstanding at the reporting date. Provisional pricing mechanisms within these sales and purchases arrangements have the character of a commodity derivative. Trade receivables or payables under these contracts are carried at fair value through profit or loss using Level 2 valuation inputs based on forecast selling prices in the quotation period. The Group's exposure at 30 June 2023 to the impact of movements in commodity prices upon provisionally invoiced sales and purchases volumes was predominately around copper.\n\nThe Group had 314 thousand tonnes of copper exposure as at 30 June 2023 (2022: 289 thousand tonnes) that was provisionally priced. The final price of these sales and purchases volumes will be determined during the first half of FY2024. A 10 per cent change in the price of copper realised on the provisionally priced sales, with all other factors held constant, would increase or decrease profit after taxation by US$184 million (2022: US$162 million).\n\nThe relationship between commodity prices and foreign currencies is complex and movements in foreign exchange rates can impact commodity prices.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nRefer to note 21 'Net debt' for details on the Group's liquidity risk.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily from customer receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, other short-term investments, interest rate and currency derivative contracts and other financial instruments.\n\nRefer to note 8 'Trade and other receivables' and note 21 'Net debt' for details on the Group credit risk.\n\n## 24.2 Recognition and measurement\n\nAll financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives and trade receivables, are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration paid or received, net of transaction costs as appropriate. Financial assets are initially recognised on their trade date.\n\nFinancial assets are subsequently carried at fair value or amortised cost based on:\n\n- -  the Group's purpose, or business model, for holding the financial asset\n- -  whether the financial asset's contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest\n\nThe resulting Financial Statements classifications of financial assets can be summarised as follows:\n\n| Contractual cash flows        | Business model                                           | Category                                      |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Solely principal and interest | Hold in order to collect contractual cash flows          | Amortised cost                                |\n| Solely principal and interest | Hold in order to collect contractual cash flows and sell | Fair value through other comprehensive income |\n| Solely principal and interest | Hold in order to sell                                    | Fair value through profit or loss             |\n| Other                         | Any of those mentioned above                             | Fair value through profit or loss             |\n\nSolely principal and interest refers to the Group receiving returns only for the time value of money and the credit risk of the counterparty for financial assets held. The main exceptions for the Group are provisionally priced receivables and derivatives which are measured at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9.\n\nThe Group has the intention of collecting payment directly from its customers in most cases, however the Group also participates in receivables financing programs in respect of selected customers. Receivables in these portfolios which are classified as 'hold in order to sell', are provisionally priced receivables and are therefore held at fair value through profit or loss prior to sale to the financial institution.\n\nWith the exception of derivative contracts and provisionally priced trade payables which are carried at fair value through profit or loss, the Group's financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe Group may in addition elect to designate certain financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or to apply hedge accounting where they are not mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nThe carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is principally calculated based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for these financial assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as unquoted prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Group's views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates.\n\nThe inputs used in fair value calculations are determined by the relevant segment or function. The functions support the assets and operate under a defined set of accountabilities authorised by the Executive Leadership Team. Movements in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities may be recognised through the income statement or in other comprehensive income according to the designation of the underlying instrument.",

In the case of US$534 million (2022: US$3,018 million) of fixed rate debt not swapped to floating rate, the fair value at 30 June 2023 was US$538 million (2022: US$3,126 million). The fair value is determined using a method that can be categorised as Level 2 and uses inputs based on benchmark interest rates, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions.\n\nFor financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the fair value hierarchy by reassessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers between categories during the period.",

        "page_content": "## 24  Financial risk management continued\n\n## Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group enters into money market deposits and derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master netting agreements that do not meet the offsetting criteria in IAS 32/AASB 132 'Financial Instruments: Presentation', but allow for the related amounts to be setoff in certain circumstances. The amounts set out as cross currency and interest rate swaps in the table above represent the derivative financial assets and liabilities of the Group that may be subject to the above arrangements and are presented on a gross basis.\n\n## 24.4  Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to certain market risks and may elect to apply hedge accounting.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nDerivatives are included within financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial instruments in this category are classified as current if they are due or expected to be settled within 12 months otherwise they are classified as non-current.\n\nWhere hedge accounting is applied, at the start of the transaction, the Group documents the type of hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged items and its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The documentation also demonstrates that the hedge is expected to be effective.\n\nThe Group applies the following types of hedge accounting to its derivatives hedging the interest rate and currency risks of its notes and debentures:\n\n- -  Fair value hedges - the fair value gain or loss on interest rate and cross currency swaps relating to interest rate risk, together with the change in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk are recognised immediately in the income statement. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment on the note or debenture is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity using a recalculated effective interest rate.\n- -  Cash flow hedges - changes in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swaps which hedge foreign currency cash flows on the notes and debentures are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. To the extent a hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n- When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is amortised to the income statement over the period to the hedged item's maturity.\n\nWhen hedged, the Group hedges the full notional value of notes or debentures. However, certain components of the fair value of derivatives are not permitted under IFRS 9 to be included in the hedge accounting above. Certain costs of hedging are permitted to be recognised in other comprehensive income. Any change in the fair value of a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting, or is ineffective in hedging the designated risk due to contractual differences between the hedged item and hedging instrument, is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nThe table below shows the carrying amounts of the Group's notes and debentures by currency and the derivatives which hedge them:\n\n- -  The carrying amount of the notes and debentures includes foreign exchange remeasurement to period-end rates and fair value adjustments when included in a fair value hedge.\n- -  The breakdown of the hedging derivatives includes remeasurement of foreign currency notional values at period-end rates, fair value movements due to interest rate risk, foreign currency cash flows designated into cash flow hedges, costs of hedging recognised in other comprehensive income, ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement and accruals or prepayments.\n- -  The hedged value of notes and debentures includes their carrying amounts adjusted for the offsetting derivative fair value movements due to foreign currency and interest rate risk remeasurement.\n\n|             |                                            | Fair value of derivatives                  | Fair value of derivatives   | Fair value of derivatives                  | Fair value of derivatives                 | Fair value of derivatives               | Fair value of derivatives   | Fair value of derivatives   |                                          |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 2023   US$M | Carrying  amount of  notes and  debentures | Foreign  exchange  notional at  spot rates | Interest   rate risk        | Recognised  in cash flow  hedging  reserve | Recognised   in cost of  hedging  reserve | Recognised in   the income  statement 1 | Accrued   cash flows        | Total                       | Hedged value  of notes and  debentures 2 |\n|             | A                                          | B                                          | C                           | D                                          | E                                         | F                                       | G                           | B to G                      | A + B + C                                |\n| USD         | 7,245                                      | -

The fair values of awards granted were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology and Black-Scholes option pricing technique and consider the following factors:\n\n- -  exercise price\n- -  expected life of the award\n- -  current market price of the underlying shares\n- -  expected volatility using an analysis of historic volatility over different rolling periods. For the LTIP, it is calculated for all sector comparators and the published MSCI World Index\n- -  expected dividends\n- -  risk-free interest rate, which is an applicable government bond rate\n- -  market-based performance hurdles\n- -  non-vesting conditions\n\nWhere awards are forfeited because non-market-based vesting conditions are not satisfied, the expense previously recognised is proportionately reversed.\n\nThe tax effect of awards granted is recognised in income tax expense, except to the extent that the total tax deductions are expected to exceed the cumulative remuneration expense. In this situation, the excess of the associated current or deferred tax is recognised in equity and forms part of the employee share awards reserve. The fair value of awards as presented in the tables above represents the fair value at grant date.\n\nIn respect of employee share awards, the Group utilises the BHP Group Limited Employee Equity Trust. The trustee of this trust is an independent company, resident in Jersey. The trust uses funds provided by the Group to acquire ordinary shares to enable awards to be made or satisfied. The ordinary shares may be acquired by purchase in the market or by subscription at not less than nominal value.",

Woodside acquired the entire share capital of BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd ('BHP Petroleum') in exchange for 914,768,948 newly issued Woodside ordinary shares.\n\nOn the Completion Date, the Group paid a fully franked in specie dividend in the form of Woodside shares to eligible BHP shareholders. Eligible BHP shareholders received one Woodside share for every 5.5340 BHP shares they held on the Group's register at the record date of 26 May 2022.\n\nAs part of completion and in order to reflect the economic effective date of 1 July 2021, the Group made a net cash payment of US$0.7 billion (net of completion adjustments) to Woodside in addition to US$0.4 billion in cash that was left in the BHP Petroleum bank accounts to fund ongoing operations. The total cash transfer of US$1.1 billion reflected the net cash flows generated by BHP Petroleum between 1 July 2021 and Completion Date adjusted for dividends Woodside would have paid on the newly issued Woodside ordinary shares, had the Merger completed on 1 July 2021.\n\nThere was no contribution of Discontinued operations to the Group's profit and cash flows for the year ended 30 June 2023.

This acquisition provides the Group with further exposure to copper, nickel and uranium.\n\nAcquisition related costs of US$107 million and integration costs of US$24 million have been expensed and included in other operating expenses in the income statement.\n\nThe provisional fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as of the date of acquisition were:\n\n|                                    | 2023   US$M   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Assets                             |               |\n| Cash and cash equivalents          | 104           |\n| Trade and other receivables 1      | 77            |\n| Other financial assets             | 7             |\n| Inventories                        | 329           |\n| Property, plant and equipment      | 7,676         |\n| Intangible assets - goodwill       | 192           |\n| Current tax receivable             | 36            |\n| Other assets                       | 25            |\n| Total assets                       | 8,446         |\n| Liabilities                        |               |\n| Trade and other payables           | 242           |\n| Interest bearing liabilities       | 1,111         |\n| Deferred tax liabilities 2         | 867           |\n| Provisions                         | 254           |\n| Total liabilities                  | 2,474         |\n| Identifiable net assets acquired   | 5,972         |\n| Total consideration paid 3,4       | 5,972         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents acquired | (104)         |\n| Net cash consideration paid        | 5,868         |\n\n- 1 This represents the gross contractual amount for trade and other receivables all of which is expected to be collected.\n- 2 This primarily represents the difference between the provisional fair value of the mineral rights acquired and the corresponding tax base.\n- 3 The Group executed a forward exchange contract to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on the consideration made in AUD. On maturity of the hedging instrument, a hedge loss of US$35 million was capitalised to the cost of the acquisition.\n- 4 The consideration paid by the Group was A$26.50 (at the average hedged exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.6681) per OZL share over 337,314,920 shares and excluded a special dividend of A$1.75 per OZL share which was paid by OZL to its shareholders immediately prior to acquisition.",

Due to the size, complexity and timing of the acquisition, the valuation process is ongoing and will be completed within 12 months of the acquisition.\n\nGoodwill of US$192 million has been provisionally recognised, representing the excess of consideration paid above the provisional fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities. The goodwill primarily arises from the deferred tax liability recognised at acquisition due to a difference between the provisional fair value of mineral rights acquired and the corresponding tax base. The goodwill represents the provisional amount, which could not be reliably allocated to a CGU or group of CGUs at 30 June 2023.\n\nNone of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n\nOZL contributed revenue of US$315 million and profit after taxation of US$17 million to the Group from acquisition date to 30 June 2023. The estimated OZL contribution to revenue and profit after taxation of the combined Group for the year ended 30 June 2023, had the acquisition occurred on 1 July 2022, would have been US$1,410 million and US$114 million, respectively.\n\nThere were no business combinations entered into by the Group in the previous financial year.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nJudgements: Judgement is required to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date in a business combination, which could have a material impact on goodwill.\n\nEstimates: The Group used the discounted cash-flow method to measure the fair value of mineral rights. Key assumptions used included commodity prices, production volumes, life of mine, cash outflows (including operating costs, capital expenditure, closure and rehabilitation costs and taxes), discount rates and risking factors.\n\n## 30 Subsidiaries\n\nSignificant subsidiaries of the Group are those with the most significant contribution to the Group's net profit or net assets.

As the Samarco entity has the rights to the assets and obligations to the liabilities relating to the joint arrangement and not its owners, this investment is accounted for as a joint venture.\n\nThe Group is restricted in its ability to make dividend payments from its investments in associates and joint ventures as any such payments require the approval of all investors in the associates and joint ventures.

A contingent liability may also be a present obligation arising from past events but is not recognised on the basis that an outflow of economic resources to settle the obligation is not viewed as probable, or the amount of the obligation cannot be reliably measured.\n\nWhen the Group has a present obligation, an outflow of economic resources is assessed as probable and the Group can reliably measure the obligation, a provision is recognised.\n\nThe Group has entered into various counter-indemnities of bank and performance guarantees related to its own future performance, which are in the normal course of business. The likelihood of these guarantees being called upon is considered remote.\n\nThe Group presently has tax matters, litigation and other claims, for which the timing of resolution and potential economic outflow are uncertain. Obligations assessed as having probable future economic outflows capable of reliable measurement are provided at reporting date and matters assessed as having possible future economic outflows capable of reliable measurement are included in the total amount of contingent liabilities above.

Details of contingent liabilities related to Samarco are disclosed in note 4  'Significant events - Samarco dam failure'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Divestments  and demergers           | Where the Group divests or demerges entities, it is generally agreed to provide certain indemnities to the acquiring or  demerged entity. Such indemnities include those provided as part of the demerger of South32 Ltd in May 2015, divestment  of Group's Onshore US assets in September 2018 and October 2018, divestment of BMC in May 2022 and the merger  of the Group's Petroleum business with Woodside in June 2022. No material claims have been made pursuant to these  indemnities as at 30 June 2023. |\n\n## 35  Subsequent events\n\nOn 14 August 2023, an application to commence a class action was filed in the High Court of South Africa on behalf of current and former mineworkers, and the dependants of certain mineworkers, who have contracted coal mine dust lung disease and who work or have worked on specified coal mines in South Africa between 1965 to date. 'BHP Billiton Plc Incorporated' was named as one of four respondents, alongside South32 SA Holdings Limited, South32 Coal SA (Pty) Limited, and Seriti Power (Proprietary) Limited. The amount of damages sought by the Applicants on behalf of the putative class is unspecified. Given the preliminary status of this matter, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures for the Group. However, the Group anticipates that claims for indemnification may be made under the terms of the Separation Deed agreed as part of the demerger of South32 Limited in 2015.\n\nOther than the matters outlined above or elsewhere in the Financial Statements, no matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of the financial year that have significantly affected, or may significantly affect, the operations, results of operations or state of affairs of the Group in subsequent accounting periods.\n\n## Other items\n\n## 36  Auditor's remuneration\n\n|                                                                                          | 2023   US$M   | 2022   US$M   | 2021   US$M   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Fees payable to the Group's auditors for assurance services                              |               |               |               |\n| Audit of the Group's Annual Report                                                       | 9.700         | 9.816         | 10.642        |\n| Audit of the accounts of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates                     | 0.551         | 0.605         | 1.234         |\n| Audit-related assurance services required by legislation to be provided by the auditor   | 1.808         | 1.933         | 1.770         |\n| Other assurance and agreed-upon procedures under legislation or contractual arrangements | 1.991         | 7.938         | 1.867         |\n| Total assurance services                                                                 | 14.050        | 20.292        | 15.513        |\n| Fees payable to the Group's auditors for non-assurance services                          |               |               |               |\n| Other services                                                                           | 0.180         | -             | -             |\n| Total other services                                                                     | 0.180         | -             | -             |\n| Total fees                                                                               | 14.230        | 20.292        | 15.513        |\n\nAll amounts were paid to EY or EY affiliated firms with fees determined, and predominantly billed, in US dollars.",

Giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2023 and of its consolidated financial performance for the year ended on that date; and\n- b.   Complying with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001 .\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Our consideration of climate change\n\nThe Group has assessed climate-related risks as threats and opportunities that have the potential to impact the financial statements as outlined in Note 16 of the financial report. These risks and opportunities include both transition risks and physical risks arising from climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy (climate change).\n\nOur audit, with the assistance of our climate change specialists, considered the climate-related risks and opportunities that have the potential to materially impact the basis of preparation, including the key judgements and estimates exercised by the Group in the preparation of the financial report.\n\nThe Group has incorporated its current climate change strategy, including Board approved commitments and actions in the basis of preparation of the financial report, reflecting the Group's best estimate of the potential impact to the financial statements as at 30 June 2023.\n\nThe impacts of climate change are most material to the judgements and estimates involved in the assessment of the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and the determination of closure and rehabilitation provisions.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report.\n\nLiability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation",

The Group focused on the CGUs that were the most susceptible to changes in key estimates.\n\nDuring the year, the Group determined that no indicators of impairment or impairment reversal existed for the Group's CGUs.\n\nThe assessment of indicators of impairment and impairment reversal for CGUs was considered to be a key audit matter as it involved significant judgement. Assessing the existence of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal for a CGU is complex and subjective due to the use of forward-looking estimates, which are inherently difficult to determine with precision. There is also a level of judgement applied by the Group in determining the key inputs into these forward-looking estimates.\n\nThe key estimates in the Group's determination of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal, which influence whether or not an estimate of the recoverable amount of a CGU is required were as follows:\n\n- -  Commodity prices: assumptions in relation to commodity price forecasts are inherently uncertain. There is a risk that the assumptions are not reasonable and may not appropriately reflect changes in supply and demand, including the impact of climate change.\n- -  Reserves: assessing the estimation of reserves is complex as there is significant estimation uncertainty in assessing the quantities of reserves, and the amount that will be economically recovered based on future production estimates over the asset life, including the impact of climate change.\n- -  Discount rates: given the long life of the Group's assets, CGU recoverable amounts are sensitive to the discount rate applied. Determining the appropriate discount rate to apply to a CGU is judgemental.\n\nThe Group's current climate change strategy continues to assess climate-related risks, including transition and physical risks.\n\nThe Group's current understanding of the potential financial impacts of climate change have been incorporated into the assessment of indicators of impairment and impairment reversal, the results of which are disclosed in Notes 13 and 16 of the financial report.\n\nThe primary audit procedures we performed, amongst others, included the following:\n\n- -  We evaluated the design of, and tested the operating effectiveness of, the Group's controls over the assessment for indicators of impairment and impairment reversal.\n- -  We performed an analysis for indicators of impairment and impairment reversal, which included considering the performance of the assets and external market conditions. Our procedures involved assessing the key inputs such as commodity price forecasts, discount rates, reserve estimation, operating and capital expenditure, comparable market data and asset performance.\n- -  We considered the impact of geo-political events and conflicts, regulatory and legislative changes and macro-economic disruptions as part of our evaluation of indicators of impairment and impairment reversal.\n- -  We involved our valuation specialists to assist in evaluating, amongst other matters, the discount rates applied and commodity price forecasts.\n- -  We assessed commodity price forecasts assumed by the Group against comparable market data.\n\nThe Group uses internal and external experts to provide geological, metallurgical, mine planning and commodity price forecast information to support key assumptions in the assessment of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal.\n\nWith assistance from our mining reserves specialists, we examined the information provided by the Group's experts, including assessment of the reserve estimation methodology against the relevant industry and regulatory guidance. We also assessed the qualifications, competence and objectivity of the internal and external experts.\n\nClimate change related procedures:\n\nWith the assistance of our climate change and valuation specialists we undertook the following procedures:\n\n- -  Evaluated how the Group's energy transition pathways, as outlined in Note 16 of the financial report, were reflected in commodity price forecasts and carbon price assumptions.\n- -  Assessed how strategies to mitigate transition and physical risks, such as the Group's committed expenditure on decarbonisation activities, were reflected into the forecast cashflows considered as part of the Group's assessment of indicators of impairment and impairment reversal.\n- -  Assessed the accuracy of the Group's disclosure regarding climaterelated risks that have the potential to adversely impact long term metallurgical coal pricing and the carrying value of the Group's metallurgical coal CGU's.\n- -  Considered the consistency of Other Information reported by the Group in relation to its climate change strategy, with the key estimates adopted in the Group's assessment of indicators of impairment and impairment reversal.\n- -  Assessed the adequacy of the Group's climate change disclosures in Note 16 of the financial report.\n\nWe assessed the adequacy of the disclosures included in Notes 11 and 13 of the financial report.",

        "page_content": "## Samarco dam failure provisions recognised and contingent liabilities disclosures\n\n## Why significant\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nRefer to Note 3 'Exceptional items', Note 4 'Significant events Samarco dam failure' and Note 34 'Contingent liabilities'.\n\nThere were a number of significant judgements and disclosures made by the Group in relation to the Samarco dam failure, including:\n\n- -  Determining the extent of the Group's and BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda's legal obligation to continue to fund the costs associated with the Samarco dam failure, and the quantification of the continued obligation required by the Governance Agreement and Framework Agreement;\n- -  Determining the status, accounting treatment and quantification (if applicable) of the legal claims against BHP Group Limited, BHP Group (UK) Ltd, BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda and Samarco;\n- -  Determining the status of any potential settlements; and\n- -  Disclosures relating to the contingent liabilities from the various legal claims and other circumstances that represent exposures to the Group.\n\nWe identified the Samarco dam failure provisions recognised, and contingent liabilities disclosures, as a key audit matter as auditing these estimates is complex. There is a high degree of estimation uncertainty, together with a wide range of reasonable outcomes. Significant judgement was required in relation to assessing the completeness and measurement of the estimated cash outflows related to the provisions and contingent liabilities, including the probability of the outflows. This is due to:\n\n- -  The significant size of the potential claims, combined with the multijurisdictional legal and regulatory environments;\n- -  High degree of judgement and estimation around certain key assumptions in the provision, including:\n- -  Cost estimates of remediation and compensation requirements for the Samarco dam failure;\n- -  The number and compensation category of impacted people entitled to compensation; and\n- -  Nature and extent of remediation activities.\n\nThe primary audit procedures we performed, amongst others, included the following:\n\n- -  We assessed the design of, and tested the operating effectiveness of, the Group's controls over the Samarco dam failure accounting and disclosure process. This included testing controls over:\n- -  The determination of the provision for the remediation of the Samarco dam failure, including significant assumptions such as the cost estimate to remediate, the nature and extent of remediation activities and compensation for the impacted peoples; and\n- -  The Group's assessment of the legal claims and determination of the associated provision and related contingent liability disclosures.\n- -  We assessed the key assumptions used to determine the provision recorded by the Group in relation to potential obligations by:\n- -  Understanding the impact of any court decisions on the number and compensation category of impacted peoples;\n- -  Understanding the impact of any Brazilian court decisions on the infrastructure remediation program relating to the resettling of communities impacted by the Samarco dam failure;\n- -  Inquiring with the Group's subject matter experts for the various remediation programs regarding the cost estimate to remediate the environment, residents' wellbeing and infrastructure damaged by the Samarco dam failure;\n- -  Evaluating the qualifications, competence and objectivity of the Group's subject matter experts, and the independent external party that contribute to the determination of the cash flow estimates by considering their qualifications, scope of work and remuneration structure;\n- -  Comparing the nature and extent of remediation activities described in the Framework Agreement to the activities included in the cash flow forecasts;\n- -  Selecting a sample of cost estimates included in the provision and considering the underlying supporting documentation, such as court decisions;\n- -  Assessing the period in which a provision change was recorded by understanding when the event that caused the change occurred;\n- -  Determining whether or not it is possible to provide a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of any potential settlement outcomes; and\n- -  Evaluating the historical accuracy of prior year's forecasted cash flows with respect to the Group's current year actual cash flows.\n- -  We read the claims and assessed their status and considered whether they now represented liabilities through:\n- -  Inquiries with the Group's internal legal advisors, senior management, Group finance, and members of the Executive Leadership Team, with respect to the ongoing proceedings;\n- -  Inspection of correspondence with external legal advisors; and\n- -  Independent confirmation letters received from external legal advisors.\n\nWe assessed the disclosures regarding the environmental and legal contingent liabilities as included in Note 34, and the relevant disclosures regarding the significant events relating to Samarco dam failure as included in Note 4 against the disclosure requirements of the relevant Australian Accounting Standards.",

The other information comprises the information included in the Company's 2023 annual report other than the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report, or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB, Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control.\n- -  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- -  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- -  Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- -  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- -  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated to the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on the audit of the Remuneration Report\n\n## Opinion on the Remuneration Report\n\nWe have audited the Remuneration Report included in the Directors' Report for the year ended 30 June 2023.\n\nIn our opinion, the Remuneration Report of BHP Group Limited for the year ended 30 June 2023, complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nErnst & Young\n\nRodney Piltz Partner Melbourne\n\n22 August 2023\n\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited\n\nLiability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation",

        "page_content": "## 5   Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves\n\nResources are the estimated quantities of material that can potentially be commercially recovered from BHP's properties. Reserves are a subset of resources that can be demonstrated to be able to be economically and legally extracted. In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required about a range of technical and economic factors, including quantities, qualities, production techniques, recovery efficiency, production and transport costs, commodity supply and demand, commodity prices and exchange rates.\n\nThe statement of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves presented in this Annual Report has been produced in accordance with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) Listing Rules Chapter 5 and the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, December 2012 (JORC Code).\n\nPredicted sales prices, based on supply and demand forecast and current and long-term historical average price trends, have been used. The Ore Reserves tabulated are held within existing, permitted mining tenements. Mineral leases are of sufficient duration (or convey a legal right to renew for sufficient duration) to enable all reserves on the leased properties to be mined in accordance with current production schedules. Ore Reserves may include areas where some additional approvals remain outstanding, however it is anticipated such approvals will be obtained within the timeframe required by the current life-of-mine schedule.\n\n## Declaration tables\n\n- -  All Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves presented are reported in 100 per cent terms (unless otherwise stated) and represent estimates as at 30 June 2023.\n- -  Tonnes are reported as dry metric tonnes (unless otherwise stated). All tonnes and grade/quality information have been rounded, so small differences may be present in the totals.\n- -  The Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserves.\n\n## Other reporting jurisdictions\n\nThe information contained in this document is expected to differ from that reported to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended 30 June 2023.\n\nMineral resources and mineral reserves reporting requirements for SEC filings in the United States are set forth in S-K 1300. S-K 1300 requires resources estimates to be reported exclusive of reserves estimates and both reported only for the portion attributable to our interest in such resources or reserves. In addition, specific disclosure requirements pertaining to economic assumptions and interpretation of reasonable prospects of economic extraction are expected to result in further differences between the resources and reserves estimates presented in this document and those to be reported in our Annual Report on Form 20-F.\n\nKey differences in the estimation of our resources and reserves pursuant to the ASX Listing Rules and S-K 1300 are the economic inputs, commodity prices and cost assumptions. Estimates we report in accordance with the ASX Listing Rules and JORC Code (2012) are based on cost forecasts and internally-generated projected long-term commodity prices, with the exception being recently acquired deposits from OZ Minerals Ltd this year, where estimates are based on their internally-generated prices and costs. S-K 1300 requires mineral resources and mineral reserves estimates to be based on a reasonable and justifiable commodity price selected by a qualified person. Since S-K 1300 requires the disclosure of the prices used in the estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves, due to commercial sensitivity regarding the disclosure of BHP's internally generated projected long-term commodity prices used in the estimation of our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves reported in accordance with the ASX Listing Rules and JORC Code (2012), the estimates reported in accordance with S-K 1300 are expected to be based on the historical commodity prices over a timeframe relevant for the commodity (generally three years). In addition, the estimates reported in accordance with S-K 1300 are expected to be based on the historical average costs over a timeframe of three years for production stage properties or, for development stage properties, costs determined from first principles.\n\nOur resources and reserves estimates to be reported in our Annual Report on Form 20-F are therefore not directly comparable to those presented in this document and should be considered in relation to the differing reporting and disclosure requirements of the jurisdiction under which they are presented.\n\n## Assurance and verification\n\nBHP has internal controls over our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimation efforts that are designed to produce reasonable and reliable estimates aligned with industry practice and our regulatory reporting requirements. The governance for our estimation efforts is located at both the asset and the BHP Group level within our Resource Centre of Excellence, an internal assurance team independent of our Competent Persons and BHP employees who are responsible for the estimations. The assets provide firstline assurance on estimates through peer review and validation processes. The Resource Centre of Excellence is responsible for assurance over the processes implemented by the assets as they relate to Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimations and the compiling of the estimates to be reported in accordance with the ASX Listing Rules and JORC Code (2012).\n\nOur internal controls utilise management systems, including, but not limited to, formal quality assurance and quality control processes, standardised procedures, workflow processes, data security covering record keeping, chain of custody and data storage, supervision and management approval, reconciliations, internal and external reviews and audits.\n\nOur internal requirements and standards provide the basis for the governance over the estimation and reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves and provide technical guidance to all reporting assets. These internal requirements and standards are periodically reviewed and updated for alignment with industry practice and reporting regulations.\n\nOur internal controls for exploration data, as they relate to Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimations, are managed by our operating assets with assurance provided by the Resource Centre of Excellence. These include procedures and standards defining minimum requirements of critical aspects to support exploration and resource development programs, spatial quality control checks on measurement points (e.g. collar, down-hole survey), quality control checks on samples, including laboratory data quality checks, geological database audits and back-up routines and technical peer review across the data gathering, integration and estimation processes.\n\nOur internal controls for Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimations include, but are not limited to:\n\n- -  source data review from database extracts, using exploratory data statistical analysis prior to use in the estimation of Mineral Resources. Identification of data to exclude outliers and visual checks against estimation domains\n- -  peer reviews of the estimation inputs based on statistical studies and estimation parameters as applied in industry standard estimation software\n- -  visual and statistical validation of the estimates against source data and where available reconciliation to previous models, operational models and production data\n- -  peer review of the classification applied, considering quantitative measures and qualitative considerations\n- -  peer review of assumptions applied that convert resources to reserves\n- -  independent audits or reviews for new or materially changed Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves",

These may include but are not limited to:\n\n- -  areas of uncertainty in the estimates impacting local interpretations\n- -  bulk density assumptions, based on sample testwork or operational results\n- -  metallurgical recovery assumptions, based on testwork or plant performance\n- -  changes in commodity prices, costs and exchange rate assumptions\n- -  geotechnical and hydrogeological considerations impacting on underground or open-cut mining assumptions\n- -  ore loss and dilution, mining selectivity and production rate assumptions\n- -  cut-off value changes to meet product specifications\n- -  changes in environmental, permitting and social licence to operate assumptions\n\nFurther to assurance activities by the assets specifically relating to the estimation of resources and reserves, the Resource Centre of Excellence with subject matter experts has developed standards and guidelines across BHP for reviewing and documenting the information supporting our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates, describing the methods used and verifying the reliability of such estimates. These activities are supported by the following controls:\n\n- -  The reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates are required to follow BHP's standard procedures for public reporting in accordance with current regulatory requirements.\n- -  Annual risk reviews are conducted with Competent Persons and BHP employees on all Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves to be reported, including a year-on-year change impact assessment, reconciliation performance metrics for the operating mines and a control assessment for the estimation inputs. The information and supporting documentation are prepared by the Competent Persons relating to the estimates and evaluated for compliance with BHP's internal controls. Based on these reviews, recommendations of endorsement are provided to our senior management for the use and reporting of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.\n- -  Periodic internal technical 'deep dive' assessments of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are conducted on a frequency that is informed by asset materiality and outcomes of the annual risk reviews.\n- -  Management and closure reviews of actions assigned to Competent Persons and BHP employees resulting from the annual risk reviews and technical 'deep dive' assessments are conducted.\n- -  Assurance is undertaken over the reporting documentation provided by Competent Persons for public release and management and verification of inputs into the BHP Resources and Reserves reporting database.\n\nThe BHP assets acquired through the acquisition of OZ Minerals Ltd did not participate in the Resource Centre of Excellence annual risk reviews. These assets have been part of assurance processes similar to those of the Resource Centre of Excellence and have undergone independent reviews within the last two years with no material issues identified.\n\nThe Resource Centre of Excellence also provides an annual update on assurance activities and changes relating to our resources and reserves estimation efforts to the Risk and Audit Committee (RAC) in connection with the RAC's responsibility over the effectiveness of systems of internal control and risk management of BHP.\n\n## Inherent risks in the estimation of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves\n\nEstimated annual cash flows from our future operations, estimated production schedules, estimated capital expenditure and operating costs, estimated site closure costs, estimated royalty and tax costs, valuation assumptions and interpretations of geological data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques may not necessarily be indicative of future results. The assumptions and interpretations used to estimate our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves may change from period to period, and because additional geological data generated during the course of our operations may not be consistent with the data on which we based our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, such estimates may change from period to period or may need to be revised. No assurance can be given that our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves presented in this Annual Report will be recovered at the grade, quality or quantities presented or at all.\n\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. Areas of uncertainty that may materially impact our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates may include, but are not limited to: (i) changes to long-term commodity prices, external market factors, foreign exchange rates and other economic assumptions; (ii) changes in geological interpretations of mineral deposits and geological modelling, including estimation input parameters and techniques; (iii) changes to metallurgical or process recovery assumptions which adversely affect the volume, grade or qualities of our commodities produced (for example, processing that results in higher deleterious elements that result in penalties) or other changes to mining method assumptions; (iv) changes to input assumptions used to derive the potentially mineable shapes applicable to the assumed underground or open-pit mining methods used to constrain the estimates; (v) changes to life of mine or production rate assumptions; (vi) changes to dilution and mining recovery assumptions; (vii) changes to cut-off grades applied to the estimates; (viii) changes to geotechnical data, structures, rock mass strength, stress regime, hydrogeological, hydrothermal or geothermal factors; (ix) changes to infrastructure supporting the operations of or access to the applicable mine site; (x) changes to mineral, surface, water or other natural resources rights; (xi) changes to royalty, taxes, environmental, permitting and social licence assumptions in the jurisdictions where we operate; and (xii) changes in capital or operating costs.\n\nEstimates of Mineral Resources are subject to further exploration and evaluation of development and operating costs, grades, recoveries and other material factors, and therefore, are subject to uncertainty. Mineral Resources do not meet the threshold for Ore Reserves modifying factors, such as engineering, legal or economic feasibility, that would allow for the conversion to Ore Reserves. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our Mineral Resources not included in Ore Reserves will become recoverable Proved and Probable Ore Reserves.",

Wet tonnes are reported for WAIO deposits and Samarco, including moisture contents for WAIO: BKM - Brockman 3%, CID - Channel Iron Deposits 8%, DID - Detrital Iron Deposits 4%, MM - Marra Mamba 4%, NIM - Nimingarra 3.5% and Samarco: ROM - 6.5%.\n- 2 A single cut-off grade was applied in WAIO per deposit ranging from 50-58%Fe with an additional threshold of <6%Al 2 0 3 applied to the DID ore type. For Samarco the cut-off grade was 22%Fe.\n- 3 WAIO - Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are reported on a Pilbara basis by ore type to align with our production of blended lump products which comprises BKM and MM ore types and blended fines products including CID. This also reflects our single logistics chain and associated management system.\n- 4 WAIO - BHP interest is reported as Pilbara Ore Reserves tonnes weighted average across all joint ventures which can vary from year to year. BHP ownership varies between 85% and 100%.\n- 5 WAIO - Mineral Resources are restricted to areas which have been identified for inclusion based on a risk assessment, including heritage sites.\n- 6 Samarco - The decrease in Mineral Resources is due to the exclusion of environmentally sensitive areas.\n\n## Metallurgical Coal\n\n## Coal Resources\n\n## As at 30 June 2023\n\n| Commodity   deposit

Ore delivered to process facility.\n- 11  WAIO - Ore Reserves are all located on State Agreement mining leases that guarantee the right to mine. Across WAIO, State Government approvals (including environmental and heritage clearances) are required before commencing mining operations in a particular area. Included in the Ore Reserves are select areas where one or more approvals remain outstanding, but where, based on the technical investigations carried out as part of the mine planning process and company knowledge and experience of the approvals process, it is expected that such approvals will be obtained as part of the normal course of business and within the time frame required by the current mine schedule.\n- 12  WAIO - The decrease in BKM ore type and reserve life was due to depletion and changes in modifying factors.\n\n|                    |                    |                    |                    |                    |                     |                     |                     |                     | As at 30 June 2022   | As at 30 June 2022   | As at 30 June 2022   | As at 30 June 2022   |\n|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Inferred Resources | Inferred Resources | Inferred Resources | Inferred Resources | Inferred Resources | Total Resources BHP | Total Resources BHP | Total Resources BHP | Total Resources BHP | Total Resources      | Total Resources      | Total Resources      | Total Resources      |\n| Mt                 | %Ash               | %VM                | %S                 | Mt                 | %Ash                | %VM                 | %S                  | interest   %        | Mt                   | %Ash                 | %VM                  | %S                   |\n| 50                 | 12.4               | 24.8               | 0.59               | 780                | 9.0                 | 22.1                | 0.52                | 50                  | 795                  | 9.0                  | 22.1                 | 0.52                 |\n| 662                | 9.3                | 18.9               | 0.51               | 2,501              | 9.7                 | 20.0                | 0.52                |                     | 2,508                | 9.7                  | 20.0                 | 0.52                 |\n| 366                | 11.9               | 20.3               | 0.74               | 1,975              | 10.9                | 19.4                | 0.65                | 50                  | 1,944                | 10.5                 | 19.4                 | 0.63                 |\n| 147                | 11.9               | 18.8               | 0.49               | 653                | 12.1                | 20.7                | 0.54                | 50                  | 666                  | 12.1                 | 20.7                 | 0.54                 |\n| 463                | 12.2               | 15.7               | 0.67               | 2,087              | 11.0                | 16.4                | 0.65                | 50                  | 2,100                | 11.0                 | 16.4                 | 0.65                 |\n| 200                | 13.1               | 16.3               | 0.60               | 445                | 11.7                | 16.2                | 0.59                |                     | 445                  | 11.7                 | 16.2                 | 0.59                 |\n| 84                 | 10.5               | 16.8               | 0.74               | 491                | 9.7                 | 17.1                | 0.69                | 50                  | 491                  | 9.7                  | 17.1                 | 0.69                 |\n| 779                | 6.6                | 29.8               | 0.43               | 1,615              | 6.0                 | 29.7                | 0.43                | 50                  | 1,628                | 6.0                  | 29.7                 | 0.43                 |\n| 222                | 7.2                | 29.1               | 0.36               | 222                | 7.2                 | 29.1                | 0.36                |                     | 222                  | 7.2                  | 29.1                 | 0.36                 |\n| 9                  | 30.2               | 17.1               | 0.35               | 115                | 15.1                | 19.8                | 0.42                | 50                  | 120                  | 15.1                 | 19.8                 | 0.42                 |",

Capital expenditure for FY2023 was US$647 million. We expect this to increase to approximately US$1.0 billion in FY2024, as we advance steel and equipment procurement and installation on the surface and underground.\n\nJansen Stage 2 is expected to deliver approximately 4 Mtpa of potash production at a lower capital intensity than Stage 1 (between approximately US$1,000 and US$1,200/t), through leveraging the substantial infrastructure investment already being constructed for Stage 1. In line with our favourable view on the long-term outlook for potash, we have accelerated the feasibility study for Jansen Stage 2, and this remains on track for completion during FY2024. The earliest potential final investment decision is within FY2024, and if a decision is taken, first production could be achieved as early as FY2029. Pre-commitment spend in FY2024 for Jansen Stage 2 is expected to be approximately US$125 million.\n\nTable 3 - Employees by category and diversity for FY2023\n\n| Commodity   | Project and   ownership          | Project scope/capacity                                                                                                    | Capital estimate US$M   | Initial   production   target date   | Progress                 |\n|-------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Potash      | Jansen Stage 1   (Canada)   100% | Design, engineering and construction of  an underground potash mine and surface  infrastructure, with capacity to produce | 5,723                   | End-CY26                             | Project is 26%  complete |\n\nBHP Group capital and exploration expenditure was US$7.1 billion in FY2023. This was made up of investment in organic development of US$4.1 billion which includes US$2.3 billion on improvement, US$1.2 billion on future-facing commodities and exploration of US$0.4 billion, and maintenance and decarbonisation expenditure 1 of US$3.0 billion.\n\nCapital and exploration expenditure of approximately US$10 billion per annum is expected for FY2024 and FY2025, including a US$0.4 billion of exploration program planned in FY2024. In the medium term, capital and exploration expenditure of approximately US$11 billion per annum on average 2 is expected. These amounts include around US$4 billion in aggregate until FY2030 for operational decarbonisation. Guidance is subject to exchange rate movements.\n\n- 1 Maintenance capital includes non-discretionary spend for the following purposes: deferred development and production stripping; risk reduction, compliance and asset integrity.\n- 2 Average for FY2026-FY2028; +/- 50 per cent in any given year.\n\n## 7  People -

Insurance or other indemnification protection may offset the financial impact on the Group of a successful claim.\n\nThis section summarises the significant legal proceedings, investigations and associated matters in which the Group is currently involved or has finalised since our last Annual Report.\n\n## Legal proceedings relating to the failure of the Fund\u00e3o tailings dam at the Samarco iron ore operations in Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo (Samarco dam failure)\n\nThe Group is engaged in numerous legal proceedings relating to the Samarco dam failure. While there has been progress in priority areas, such as individual compensation and indemnification for the damage caused by the dam failure, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes for all proceedings or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures. There are numerous additional lawsuits against Samarco relating to the dam failure to which the Group is not party. Currently, BHP Brasil is a party to approximately 41 ongoing public civil claims, of which 22 are suspended. The most significant of these proceedings are summarised in the next column.\n\n## R$20 billion public civil claim commenced by the Federal Government of Brazil, states of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais and other authorities (R$20 billion Public Civil claim)\n\nOn 30 November 2015, the Federal Government of Brazil, states of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais and other public authorities collectively filed a public civil claim before the 12th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte against Samarco and its shareholders, BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda. (BHP Brasil) and Vale S.A. (Vale), in the amount of R$20 billion (approximately US$4 billion) in aggregate for clean-up costs and damages.\n\nOn 2 March 2016, Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale (Companies), entered into a Framework Agreement with the Federal Government of Brazil, the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais and certain other public authorities to establish a foundation (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova) to develop and execute environmental and socioeconomic programs (Programs) to remediate and provide compensation for damages caused by the Samarco dam failure.\n\nThe term of the Framework Agreement is 15 years, renewable for periods of one year successively until all obligations under the Framework Agreement have been performed. Under the Framework Agreement, Samarco is responsible, as a primary obligor, for funding Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's annual calendar year budget for the duration of the Framework Agreement. The amount of funding for each calendar year will depend on the remediation and compensation projects to be undertaken in a particular year. To the extent that Samarco does not meet its funding obligations under the Framework Agreement, BHP Brasil and Vale have funding obligations under the Framework Agreement, as secondary obligors, each in proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco. Refer to Samarco's judicial reorganisation below.\n\n## R$155 billion public civil claim commenced by the Federal Public Prosecutors' Office (R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' Office claim)\n\nOn 3 May 2016, the Brazilian Federal Public Prosecutors' Office filed a public civil claim before the 12th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale, as well as 18 other public entities (which has since been reduced to five defendants 1 by the 12th Federal Court), seeking R$155 billion (approximately US$32 billion) for reparation, compensation and collective moral damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure.\n\nThis public civil claim and the R$20 billion Public Civil claim are broad claims that encompass most of the public civil claims filed against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale. For this reason, the 12th Federal Court has suspended some of the other public civil claims while negotiations continue in relation to the settlement of the R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' Office claim.\n\nThis public civil claim was suspended for a period of two years from the date of ratification of the Governance Agreement (described below) on 8 August 2018.\n\nOn 19 March 2021, the parties to the case agreed to extend the suspension of this case until 27 April 2021. Although the stay period has formally elapsed, no material development has occurred and the parties are engaged in negotiations to seek a definitive settlement (summarised below).\n\n## Governance Agreement\n\nOn 25 June 2018, Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale, the other parties to the Framework Agreement, the Public Prosecutors' Office 2 and the Public Defense Office 3 entered into a Governance Agreement, which settled the R$20 billion Public Civil claim and established a process to renegotiate the Programs over two years to progress settlement of the R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' Office claim.\n\nUnder the Governance Agreement, renegotiation of the Programs will be based on certain agreed principles, including full reparation consistent with Brazilian law, the requirement for a technical basis for any proposed changes, consideration of findings from experts appointed by Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale, consideration of findings from experts appointed by prosecutors and consideration of feedback from impacted communities.\n\n- 1 Currently, solely BHP Brasil, Vale and Samarco, the Federal Government and the state of Minas Gerais are defendants.\n- 2 The Public Prosecutors' Office includes the Federal, State of Minas Gerais and State of Esp\u00edrito Santo public prosecutors' offices.\n- 3 The Public Defense Office includes the Federal, State of Minas Gerais and State of Esp\u00edrito Santo public defense offices.",

        "page_content": "continued\n\n## 8  Legal proceedings\n\nSince early CY2021, the parties have been engaging in negotiations to seek a definitive and substantive settlement of claims relating to the Samarco dam failure. The negotiations are ongoing as at the date of this Report. The negotiations were initially overseen by the President of the National Council of Justice (CNJ), as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Brazil. Since May 2023, the negotiations have been led by the Federal Court of Appeals (TRF-6) with the participation of the CNJ counsellor. Outcomes of the negotiations are highly uncertain, therefore it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of potential outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may be materially higher than amounts currently reflected in the Samarco dam failure provision. Until revisions to the Programs are agreed, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova will continue to implement the Programs in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement and the Governance Agreement.\n\n## Enforcement Proceedings\n\nSince 7 January 2020, the 12th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte has issued several decisions creating 14 enforcement proceedings (Enforcement Proceedings) linked to the R$20 billion Public Civil claim and R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' Office claim described above.\n\nIssues covered by these Enforcement Proceedings include environmental recovery, human health risk and ecological risk, resettlement of affected communities, infrastructure and development, registration of certain impacted individuals under the Programs and indemnities for people impacted by the Samarco dam failure, resumption of economic activities, water supply for human consumption and hiring of technical advisers to impacted people, restructuring Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's management system, and new areas allegedly affected by the dam failure.\n\nIn the context of these Enforcement Proceedings, Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale are working to obtain favourable rulings, including, among other things, the repealing of fishing bans ordered by the courts or administration entities, set-off of compensation paid against potential damages that may need to be paid, and regarding the hiring and supervision of technical assistants to impacted people.\n\nIn August 2020, a Simplified Indemnification System (the Novel System) was created by the 12th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte with specific rules designed for those who could not easily demonstrate their status as an impacted person based on 'rough justice' principles. Led by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova, the Novel System has, as at 30 June 2023, settled with approximately 97,000 claimants who were able to prove their damages, with more than 90,000 claims already having been paid.\n\nOn 26 June 2022, the President of the Federal Court of Appeals issued a preliminary ruling applicable to impacted persons from the municipality of Naque, in the State of Minas Gerais, regarding the Novel System, determining that its terms do not provide a full release to Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. The amounts paid under the Novel System should therefore be considered as a minimum indemnification amount. For the same reasons, it was also determined that the Novel System settlement agreement does not prevent impacted persons from pursuing lawsuits in foreign jurisdictions. On 1 July 2022, the Federal Prosecutors filed a motion requesting the extension of the decision to all affected areas, as well as to any settlements which had already been paid. On 6 July 2022, BHP Brasil filed its appeal and, as at the date of this Report, no final decision has been made.\n\nOn 17 February 2023, the Federal Court of Belo Horizonte ordered Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova to pay the amounts allocated via the Mediated Indemnification Program (PIM) or Novel System duly restated for inflation, with late payment interest. The Federal Court also instated Priority Axis 14 to discuss the recognition of new locations as impacted areas.\n\nOn 30 March 2023, the 4th Federal Court ordered that BHP Brasil and Vale deposit R$10.3 billion (approximately US$2 billion) in connection with a dispute between the Companies and public authorities with respect to the inclusion of certain territories in the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo not contemplated in the Framework Agreement (a matter known as Deliberation n. 58/2017), which the Companies and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova oppose. On 17 April 2023, BHP Brasil filed its appeal of the decision. On 28 April 2023, the Appellate Court granted BHP Brasil's request for a preliminary injunction and suspended the decision that had ordered the deposit of R$10.3 billion. The Appellate Court Judge also suspended the inclusion of the New Areas in Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's programs, due to the ongoing negotiations before the TRF-6.\n\n## Samarco's judicial reorganisation\n\nOn 9 April 2021, Samarco filed for judicial reorganisation (JR) with the Second Business State Court for the Belo Horizonte District of Minas Gerais (JR Court). The JR proceeding seeks to enable Samarco to negotiate and implement an orderly restructuring of its financial indebtedness in order to establish a stable financial position for Samarco, among other things, to continue to rebuild its operations and meet its Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova obligations. Samarco filed for JR following multiple enforcement actions filed by some of Samarco's creditors that threatened its operations. The JR Court granted Samarco's JR motion on 12 April 2021 and granted a stay of the enforcement actions.\n\nNo BHP entity is a debtor in Samarco's JR case. BHP Brasil is participating in Samarco's JR proceeding in its capacities as a shareholder and creditor of Samarco.\n\nOn 31 May 2023, Samarco entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (Support Agreement) with its shareholders and certain of its financial creditors (the Supporting Creditors). The support of the Supporting Creditors and of the shareholders allows for the presentation of a consensual judicial reorganisation plan (Consensual Plan) that aims to implement the transactions contemplated by the Support Agreement. The Support Agreement was entered into following a two-month courtsupervised settlement process presided over by the Court of Appeals of the State of Minas Gerais.\n\nPursuant to the Support Agreement, on 28 July 2023, Samarco and one of the Supporting Creditors jointly filed a Consensual Plan with the JR Court. Concurrent with the filing of the Consensual Plan, the parties also filed terms of adhesion that demonstrate that the majority of Samarco's creditors as required under Brazilian Bankruptcy Law, support and have approved the Consensual Plan. The JR Court will review the Consensual Plan. If the JR Court confirms the Consensual Plan, Samarco will later seek an order from the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (US Bankruptcy Court) granting full force and effect to the Consensual Plan and the JR Court order confirming the Consensual Plan (FFE Order).\n\nAs part of the Consensual Plan, the Parties agreed that the agreements entered into between Samarco and Brazilian public authorities in connection with the Fund\u00e3o dam failure will pass through and not be impaired by the Consensual Plan and Samarco will continue to have a primary obligation to fund Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. Pursuant to the Consensual Plan, between 2024 and full payment of the debt owed by Samarco to the holders of the senior notes to be issued in connection with Samarco's restructuring, Samarco is permitted to fund Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova up to a US$1 billion cap. This means that BHP Brasil and Vale will pay directly or fund Samarco in the form of common equity in respect of remediation obligations, including payments to Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova, in excess of the US$1 billion cap.\n\nThe terms and conditions of the Consensual Plan allow for the continued investment in Samarco aligned with expected cash generation. This consensual solution, together with the schedule of settlement terms for each creditor class, reinforces Samarco's commitment to remediation actions.\n\nThe consummation of the Consensual Plan is subject to agreement on definitive documentation and the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in the Support Agreement including, among other things, the confirmation of the Consensual Plan by the JR Court and the entry of the FFE Order by the US Bankruptcy Court.",

        "page_content": "## United States Chapter 15 case\n\nOn 19 April 2021, Samarco filed a petition with the US Bankruptcy Court seeking recognition of the JR proceeding under Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code. On 13 May 2021, the US Bankruptcy Court granted recognition of the JR proceeding as a 'foreign main proceeding' and accordingly stayed enforcement actions against Samarco in US territory. No BHP entity is a debtor in Samarco's Chapter 15 case. BHP Brasil is participating in Samarco's Chapter 15 proceeding in its capacities as a shareholder and creditor of Samarco.\n\n## Civil public actions commenced by the State Prosecutors' Office in the state of Minas Gerais (Mariana CPA cases)\n\nThe State Prosecutors of Mariana have commenced several civil public actions (CPAs) against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale.\n\nOn 10 December 2015, the State Prosecutors' Office in the state of Minas Gerais filed a CPA against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale before the State Court in Mariana claiming indemnification (amount not specified) for moral and material damages to an unspecified group of individuals affected by the Samarco dam failure, including the payment of costs for housing and social and economic assistance (CPA Mariana I).\n\nOn 2 October 2018, the parties reached a settlement dismissing the claim, which was ratified by the Court. Under this settlement, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova has reached more than 100 individual agreements with impacted families in Mariana for the payment of damages.\n\nIn connection with CPA Mariana I, the State Prosecutors (Minas Gerais) started enforcement proceedings against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale. There are six enforcement proceedings under way, which among other things seek (i) to set a deadline for completion of resettlement of the residents of Mariana's districts and for fines to be imposed for delays to resettlement; (ii) to set the final term that will allow new households to join the resettlement; (iii) payment of compensation to affected individuals for delivery of houses below standard; (iv) to guarantee access to water sources for the families of the collective resettlements; (v) payment of fines for alleged delays in presenting proposals and making payments to affected individuals; and (vi) payment of compensation to impacted individuals who allege they have not yet received compensation and a penalty for the alleged delays in making such payments. On 14 July 2023 the 2nd Civil Court of Mariana remitted CPA Mariana I and the enforcement proceeding related to the deadline for completion of resettlement to the 4th Federal Court following a Superior Court of Justice decision.\n\nIn addition to CPA Mariana I, the State Prosecutors (Minas Gerais) commenced nine other CPAs in Mariana against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and, in some cases, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. The claims presented in those CPAs are related to damages that, according to the State Prosecutors, are not covered by CPA Mariana I.\n\nThere are also CPAs that (i) have been settled by the parties, including BHP Brasil, (ii) have been dismissed or (iii) are still pending. Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova is responsible for any pending obligations set forth in the settlement agreements relating to the CPAs and for complying with future awards eventually rendered in the remaining CPAs.\n\n## Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova dissolution lawsuit\n\nOn 24 February 2021, the Minas Gerais State Prosecutor filed a CPA against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova seeking the dissolution of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. The plaintiffs are seeking R$10 billion (approximately US$2 billion) for moral damages. An injunction for the immediate intervention in Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova was also made, alleging the need to preserve information and documents produced by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova to evaluate criminal and civil responsibilities. A ruling on the merits is still pending.\n\nOn 19 May 2023, the 4th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte ordered a judicial intervention in Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova, and during this period the Justice Institutions will monitor Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova and have access to its facilities and documents. On 29 June 2023, the Appellate Judge granted the Companies' request for a preliminary injunction to suspend the decision rendered by the 4th Federal Court that had ordered a judicial intervention in Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova.\n\n## Civil public action commenced by Associations concerning the use of tanfloc for water treatment (R$120 billion Associations claim)\n\nOn 28 October 2021, the Vila Lenira Residents Association, State of Esp\u00edrito Santo Rural Producers and Artisans Association, Colatina Velha Neighbourhood Residents Association, and United for the Progress of Palmeiras Neighbourhood Association filed a lawsuit against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale and others, including the State of Minas Gerais, the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo and the Federal Government. The plaintiffs allege the defendants carried out a clandestine study on the citizens of the locations affected by the Fund\u00e3o dam failure, using tanfloc, a tanninbased flocculant/coagulant that is currently used for wastewater treatment applications. The plaintiffs claim this product allegedly put the population at risk due to its alleged experimental qualities.\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking multiple kinds of relief (material damage, moral damages, loss of profits) and payments by the defendants for water supply in all locations where there is no water source other than the Doce River.\n\nOn 25 July 2022, Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale presented their defences individually, as well as the State of Minas Gerais, the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo and the Federal Government. The Court's decision on the merits of the claim is still pending.\n\n## Public civil claims currently suspended\n\nApproximately 16 of the proceedings to which BHP Brasil is a party are currently suspended due to their connection with the R$20 billion Public Civil claim and R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' Office claim. There has not yet been a ruling in these cases.\n\nThe suspended proceedings include proceedings commenced by the State Prosecutors (Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo), Public Defenders (Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo) and the states of Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. The claims relate to environmental remediation measures, compensation for the impacts of the dam failure, including moral damages, reconstruction of properties and populations, including historical, religious, cultural, social, environmental and intangible heritages affected by the dam failure, and suspension of public water supply, among others.\n\n## Other civil proceedings in Brazil\n\nAs noted above, BHP Brasil has been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits relating to the Samarco dam failure. In addition, government inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by numerous agencies of the Brazilian Government and are ongoing, including criminal investigations by the federal and state police, and by federal prosecutors.\n\nBHP Brasil's potential liabilities, if any, resulting from other pending and future claims, lawsuits and enforcement actions relating to the Samarco dam failure, together with the potential cost of implementing remedies sought in the various proceedings, cannot be reliably estimated at this time and therefore a provision has not been recognised nor has any contingent liability been quantified for these matters. Ultimately, these could have a material adverse impact on BHP's business, competitive position, cash flows, prospects, liquidity and shareholder returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the Samarco dam failure refer to OFR 7",

        "page_content": "continued\n\n## 8  Legal proceedings\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, Samarco had been named as a defendant in more than 43,000 small claims for moral damages in which people argue their public water service was interrupted for between five and 10 days. BHP Brasil is a co-defendant in more than 23,500 of these cases.\n\nThe Brazilian Code of Civil Procedure provides that repetitive claims can be settled through a proceeding known as the Resolution of Repetitive Demands Procedure (IRDR). Under the IRDR, a court will hear a 'pilot case' representative of such recurring legal matters and the judgment in that decision will set a precedent for the resolution of similar cases in that jurisdiction. An IRDR has been established in Minas Gerais and the court in the pilot case has ruled that the mandatory parameter for resolution of claims will be the payment of R$2,000 (approximately US$400) per individual claim for moral damages due to the suspension of public water supply. Appeals before higher courts are pending judgement. Meanwhile, Samarco has reached settlement in more than 9,900 individual cases.\n\n## Criminal charges\n\nOn 20 October 2016, the Federal Prosecutors' Office in Brazil filed criminal charges against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and certain of their employees and former employees in the Federal Court of Ponte Nova, Minas Gerais. On 3 March 2017, BHP Brasil and the charged employees and former employees of BHP Brasil (Affected Individuals) filed their preliminary defences. The Federal Court granted Habeas Corpus petitions in favour of all eight Affected Individuals terminating the charges against those individuals. The Federal Prosecutors' Office appealed seven of the decisions with hearings of the appeals still pending. BHP Brasil rejects outright the charges against BHP Brasil and the Affected Individuals and will keep defending the charges and fully supporting each of the Affected Individuals in their defences of the charges.\n\n## Australian class action claim\n\nBHP Group Limited is named as a defendant in a shareholder class action in the Federal Court of Australia on behalf of persons who acquired shares in BHP Group Limited on the Australian Securities Exchange or shares in BHP Group Plc (now BHP Group (UK) Ltd) on the London Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange in periods prior to the Samarco dam failure. The amount of damages sought in the class action is unspecified.\n\n## United Kingdom group action claim\n\nBHP Group (UK) Ltd (formerly BHP Group Plc) and BHP Group Limited are named as defendants in group action claims for damages filed in the courts of England. These claims were filed on behalf of certain individuals, governments, businesses and communities in Brazil allegedly impacted by the Samarco dam failure.\n\nIn August 2019, the BHP parties filed a preliminary application to strike out or stay this action on jurisdictional and other procedural grounds. That application was successful before the High Court and the action was dismissed. However, on 8 July 2022, the Court of Appeal reversed the dismissal decision and allowed the action to proceed in England. The BHP parties were not granted permission to appeal to the UK Supreme Court.\n\nA trial in relation to the BHP parties' liability for the dam failure is listed to commence in October 2024.\n\nIn December 2022, the BHP parties filed their defence and a contribution claim against Vale. The contribution claim contends that if the BHP parties' defence is not successful and they are ordered to pay damages to the claimants, Vale should contribute to any amount payable. In August 2023, the High Court dismissed an application by Vale challenging the jurisdiction of the English Courts to determine the contribution claim. Subject to the outcome of any appeals by Vale in relation to jurisdiction and directions from the Court, the contribution claim will proceed in the UK.\n\n## 9  Shareholder information\n\n## 9.1  History and development\n\nBHP Group Limited (formerly BHP Billiton Limited, then BHP Limited and, before that, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited) was incorporated in 1885 and is registered in Australia with ABN 49 004 028 077. Successive predecessor entities to BHP Group Plc have operated since 1860.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 9.2 Markets\n\nAs at the date of this Annual Report, BHP Group Limited has a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) (ticker BHP) in Australia, a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) (ticker BHP), a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (ticker BHG) and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the United States.\n\nTrading on the NYSE is in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) evidencing American Depositary Shares (ADSs), with each ADS representing two ordinary shares of BHP Group Limited. Citibank N.A. (Citibank) is the Depositary for the ADS program. BHP Group Limited's ADSs have been listed for trading on the NYSE (ticker BHP) since 28 May 1987.\n\n## 9.3  Organisational structure\n\nFrom June 2001 to January 2022, BHP operated under a Dual Listed Company (DLC) structure, with two separate parent companies (BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc (now BHP Group (UK) Limited)) and their respective subsidiaries operating as a single unified economic entity run by a unified Board and senior executive management team.\n\nOn 31 January 2022, BHP unified its DLC structure, following which BHP Group Plc (now BHP Group (UK) Limited) became a subsidiary of BHP Group Limited. BHP Group Limited is now the ultimate BHP parent company of all subsidiaries within the BHP Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 9.4 Constitution\n\nThis section sets out a summary of BHP Group Limited's Constitution, as well as other related arrangements under applicable laws and regulations.\n\nProvisions of the Constitution of BHP Group Limited can be amended only where such amendment is approved by special resolution. A 'special resolution' is a resolution that is passed by 75 per cent (i.e. at least three quarters) of the votes cast by BHP shareholders entitled to vote being in favour of the resolution.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe Board may exercise all powers of BHP, other than those that are reserved for BHP shareholders to exercise in a general meeting.\n\n## Power to issue securities\n\nUnder the Constitution, the Board of Directors has the power to issue any BHP shares or other securities (including redeemable shares) with preferred, deferred or other special rights, obligations or restrictions. The Board may issue shares on any terms it considers appropriate, provided that:\n\n- -  the issue does not affect any special rights of shareholders\n- -  if required, the issue is approved by shareholders\n- -  if the issue is of a class other than ordinary shares, the rights attaching to the class are expressed at the date of issue",

        "page_content": "## Restrictions on voting by Directors\n\nA Director may not vote in respect of any contract or arrangement or any other proposal in which they have a material personal interest except in certain prescribed circumstances, including (subject to applicable laws) where the material personal interest:\n\n- -  arises because the Director is a shareholder of BHP and is held in common with the other shareholders of BHP\n- -  arises in relation to the Director's remuneration as a Director of BHP\n- -  relates to a contract BHP is proposing to enter into that is subject to approval by the shareholders and will not impose any obligation on BHP if it is not approved by the shareholders\n- -  arises merely because the Director is a guarantor or has given an indemnity or security for all or part of a loan, or proposed loan, to BHP\n- -  arises merely because the Director has a right of subrogation in relation to a guarantee or indemnity referred to above\n- -  relates to a contract that insures, or would insure, the Director against liabilities the Director incurs as an officer of BHP, but only if the contract does not make BHP or a related body corporate the insurer\n- -  relates to any payment by BHP or a related body corporate in respect of an indemnity permitted by law, or any contract relating to or containing such an indemnity, or\n- -  is in a contract, or proposed contract with, or for the benefit of, or on behalf of, a related body corporate and arises merely because the Director is a director of a related body corporate\n\nIf a Director has a material personal interest and is not entitled to vote on a proposal, they will not be counted in the quorum for any vote on a resolution concerning the material personal interest.\n\n## Loans by Directors\n\nAny Director may lend money to BHP at interest with or without security or may, for a commission or profit, guarantee the repayment of any money borrowed by BHP and underwrite or guarantee the subscription of shares or securities of BHP or of any corporation in which BHP may be interested without being disqualified as a Director and without being liable to account to BHP for any commission or profit.\n\n## Appointment and retirement of Directors\n\n## Appointment of Directors\n\nThe Constitution provides that a person may be appointed as a Director of BHP by the existing Directors of BHP or may be elected by the shareholders in a general meeting.\n\nAny person appointed as a Director of BHP by the existing Directors will hold office only until the next general meeting that includes an election of Directors.\n\nA person may be nominated by shareholders as a Director of BHP if:\n\n- -  a shareholder provides a valid written notice of the nomination; and\n- -  the person nominated by the shareholder satisfies candidature for the office and consents in writing to his or her nomination as a Director,\n\nand the nomination is provided at least 40 business days before the date of the general meeting. The person nominated as a Director may be elected to the Board by ordinary resolution passed in a general meeting.\n\n## Retirement of Directors\n\nThe Board has a policy under which all Non-executive Directors must, if they wish to remain on the Board, seek re-election by shareholders annually. This policy took effect from the 2011 Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and replaced the previous system that required Non-executive Directors to submit themselves to shareholders for re-election at least every three years.\n\nA Director may be removed by BHP in accordance with applicable law and must vacate his or her office as a Director in certain circumstances set out in the Constitution. There is no requirement for a Director to retire on reaching a certain age.\n\n## Rights attaching to shares\n\n## Dividend rights\n\nUnder Australian law, dividends on shares may be paid only if the company's assets exceed its liabilities immediately before the dividend is determined and the excess is sufficient for payment of the dividend, the payment of the dividend is fair and reasonable to the company's shareholders as a whole and the payment of the dividend does not materially prejudice the company's ability to pay its creditors.\n\nThe Constitution provides that payment of any dividend may be made in any manner, by any means and in any currency determined by the Board.\n\nAll unclaimed dividends may be invested or otherwise used by the Board for the benefit of BHP Group Limited until claimed or otherwise disposed of according to law. BHP Group Limited is governed by the Victorian unclaimed monies legislation, which requires BHP Group Limited to pay to the State Revenue Office any unclaimed dividend payments of A$20 or more that have remained unclaimed for over 12 months.\n\n## Voting rights\n\nFor the purposes of determining which shareholders are entitled to attend or vote at a meeting of BHP Group Limited, and how many votes such shareholder may cast, the Notice of Meeting specifies when a shareholder must be entered on the Register of Shareholders in order to have the right to attend or vote at the meeting. The specified time must be not more than 48 hours before the time of the meeting.\n\nShareholders who wish to appoint a proxy to attend, vote or speak at a meeting of BHP Group Limited on their behalf must deposit the form appointing a proxy so that it is received not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting.\n\n## Rights to share in BHP Group Limited's profits\n\nThe rights attached to the ordinary shares of BHP Group Limited, as regards the participation in the profits available for distribution that the Board determines to distribute, are as follows:\n\n- -  The holders of any preference shares will be entitled, in priority to any payment of dividend to the holders of any other class of shares, to a preferred right to participate as regards dividends up to but not beyond a specified amount in distribution.\n- -  Any surplus remaining after payment of the distributions above will be payable to the holders of BHP Group Limited ordinary shares in equal amounts per share.\n\n## Rights on return of assets on liquidation\n\nOn a return of assets on liquidation of BHP Group Limited, the assets of BHP Group Limited remaining available for distribution among shareholders after the payment of all prior ranking amounts owed to all creditors and holders of preference shares, and to all prior ranking statutory entitlements, are to be applied on an equal priority with any amount paid to the holders of BHP Group Limited ordinary shares. Any surplus remaining is to be applied in making payments solely to the holders of BHP Group Limited ordinary shares in accordance with their entitlements.\n\n## Redemption of preference shares\n\nIf BHP Group Limited at any time proposes to create and issue any preference shares, the terms of the preference shares may give either or both of BHP Group Limited and the holder the right to redeem the preference shares.\n\nThe preference shares' terms may also give the holder the right to convert the preference shares into ordinary shares.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the preference shares must give the holders:\n\n- -  the right (on redemption and on a winding-up) to payment in cash in priority to any other class of shares of (i) the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid on each of the preference shares; and (ii) the amount, if any, equal to the aggregate of any dividends accrued but unpaid and of any arrears of dividends; and\n- -  the right, in priority to any payment of dividend on any other class of shares, to the preferential dividend.",

BHP has a lien on every partly paid share for all amounts payable in respect of that share. Each shareholder is liable to pay the amount of each call in the manner, at the time and at the place specified by the Board (subject to receiving at least 14 days' notice specifying the time and place for payment).

No shareholder may convene a general meeting of BHP except where entitled under law to do so. Any Director may convene a general meeting whenever the Director thinks fit. General meetings can also be adjourned or cancelled, or postponed where permitted by law or the Constitution. Notice of a general meeting must be given to each shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting and such notice of meeting must be given in the form and manner in which the Board thinks fit subject to any applicable law. Five shareholders of the company present in person or by proxy constitute a quorum for a general meeting. A shareholder who is entitled to attend and cast a vote at a general meeting of BHP may appoint a person as a proxy to attend and vote for the shareholder in accordance with applicable law. All provisions of the Constitution relating to general meetings apply with any necessary modifications to any special meeting of any class of shareholders that may be held.\n\nThere are no limitations under the Constitution restricting the right to own BHP shares or other securities.

        "page_content": "## 9  Shareholder information\n\n## 9.6 Dividends\n\n## Corporate actions depositary fees\n\n## Policy\n\nThe Group adopted a dividend policy in February 2016 that provides for a minimum 50 per cent payout of Underlying attributable profit (Continuing operations) at every reporting period. For information on Underlying attributable profit (Continuing operations) for FY2023 refer to OFR 4.2 and OFR 10.\n\nThe Board will assess, at each reporting period, the ability to pay amounts additional to the minimum payment, in accordance with the Capital Allocation Framework, as described in OFR 2.\n\nIn FY2023, we determined our dividends and other distributions in US dollars as it is our main functional currency.\n\n## Payments\n\nBHP Group Limited shareholders may have their cash dividends paid directly into their bank account in Australian dollars, UK pounds sterling, New Zealand dollars, South African rand or US dollars, provided they have submitted direct credit details and if required, a valid currency election nominating a financial institution to the BHP Share Registrar no later than close of business on the dividend reinvestment plan election date. BHP Group Limited shareholders who do not provide their direct credit details will receive dividend payments by way of a cheque in Australian dollars. BHP Group Limited shareholders who reside in New Zealand must provide valid direct credit details to receive their dividend payment.\n\n## Dividend reinvestment plan\n\nBHP offers a dividend reinvestment plan to registered shareholders, which provides shareholders the opportunity to reinvest dividends to purchase additional BHP shares in the market, rather than receiving dividends in cash. Participation in the plan is entirely optional and is subject to the terms and conditions of the plan, which can be found at bhp.com/DRP.\n\n## 9.7  American Depositary Receipts fees and charges\n\nWe have an American Depositary Receipts (ADR) program for BHP Group Limited which has a 2:1 ordinary shares to American Depositary Share (ADS) ratio.\n\n## Depositary fees\n\nCitibank serves as the depositary bank for our ADR program. ADR holders agree to the terms in the deposit agreement filed with the SEC for depositing ordinary shares or surrendering ADSs for cancellation and for certain services as provided by Citibank. Holders are required to pay certain fees for general depositary services provided by Citibank, as set out in the tables below.\n\n## Standard depositary fees\n\n| Depositary service                                          | Fee payable by the ADR holders                                |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Issuance of ADSs upon deposit of shares                     | Up to US$5.00 per 100 ADSs  (or fraction thereof) issued      |\n| Delivery of Deposited Securities against  surrender of ADSs | Up to US$5.00 per 100 ADSs  (or fraction thereof) surrendered |\n| Distribution of Cash Dividends                              | Up to US$1.50 per 100 ADSs  (or fraction thereof) held        |\n\n| Depositary service                                                                                          | Fee payable by the ADR holders                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash Distributions other than Cash  Dividends (i.e. sale of rights, other  entitlements, return of capital) | Up to US$2.00 per 100 ADSs  (or fraction thereof) held |\n| Distribution of ADSs pursuant to exercise  of rights to purchase additional ADSs.                           | Up to US$5.00 per 100 ADSs  (or fraction thereof) held |\n| Excludes stock dividends and stock splits Distribution of securities other than ADSs                        | Up to US$5.00 per 100 ADSs  (or fraction thereof) held |\n| or rights to purchase additional ADSs  (i.e. spin-off shares)                                               | No fee                                                 |\n| Distribution of ADSs pursuant to  an ADR ratio change in which shares  are distributed                      |                                                        |\n\n## Fees payable by the Depositary to the Issuer\n\nCitibank has provided BHP a net reimbursement of US$6,471,351.30 in FY2023 for ADR program-related expenses for BHP's ADR program. ADR program-related expenses include legal and accounting fees, listing fees, expenses related to investor relations in the United States, fees payable to service providers for the distribution of material to ADR holders, expenses of Citibank as administrator of the ADS Direct Plan and expenses to remain in compliance with applicable laws.\n\nCitibank has further agreed to waive other ADR program-related expenses for FY2023, amounting to US$31,194.37, which are associated with the administration of the ADR program.\n\nThe ADSs issued under our ADR program trade on the NYSE under the stock ticker BHP. As of 12 July 2023, there were 145,044,763 ADSs on issue and outstanding in the BHP Group Limited ADR program.\n\n## Charges\n\nHolders are also required to pay the following charges in connection with depositing of ordinary shares and surrendering ADSs for cancellation and for the purpose of withdrawing deposited securities: taxes and other governmental charges, registration fees, transmission and delivery expenses, expenses and charges incurred by the depositary in the conversion of foreign currency, fees and expenses of the depositary in connection with compliance with exchange control regulations and other regulatory requirements and fees and expenses incurred by the depositary or other nominee in connection with servicing or delivery of deposit securities.\n\n## 9.8  Government regulations\n\nOur business is subject to a broad range of laws and regulations imposed by governments and regulatory bodies. These regulations touch all aspects of our business, including how we extract, process and explore for minerals and how we conduct our operations, including regulations governing matters such as environmental protection, land rehabilitation, occupational health and safety, human rights, the rights and interests of Indigenous peoples, competition, foreign investment, export, marketing of minerals, and taxes.\n\nThe ability to extract and process minerals is fundamental to BHP. In most jurisdictions, the rights to extract mineral deposits are owned by the government. We obtain the right to access the land and extract the product by entering into licences or leases with the government that owns the mineral deposit. We also rely on governments to grant the rights necessary to transport and treat the extracted material to prepare it for sale. The terms of the lease or licence, including the time period of the lease or licence, vary depending on the laws of the relevant government or terms negotiated with the relevant government. Generally, we own the product we extract and we are required to pay royalties or other taxes to the government.\n\nFollowing the expiration of the 10-year freeze on coal royalties on 30 June 2022, from 1 July 2022 a progressive system of coal royalties in the State of Queensland with a tiered approach replaced the fixed royalty amount of 15 per cent on any amounts above A$150 per tonne.\n\nThe progressive royalty system applies higher royalty rates as the price of coal passes certain monetary thresholds. The royalty rates for amounts up to and including A$150 did not change despite the expiry of the royalty freeze.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "On 17 May 2023, the Chilean Congress approved a mining royalty bill to establish a new regulatory tax framework for copper mining activities. In general terms, the approved bill establishes that mining operators will be subject to an ad-valorem component of one per cent plus a margin component that ranges from eight per cent to 26 per cent with a maximum tax rate of 46.5 per cent. The new mining royalties take effect from 1 January 2024, subject to existing tax stability agreements. It is expected that Escondida and Spence will be affected by this new tax from CY2024 and CY2033, respectively.\n\nThe rights to explore for minerals are granted to us by the government that owns the natural resources we wish to explore. Usually, the right to explore carries with it the obligation to spend a defined amount of money on the exploration, or to undertake particular exploration activities.\n\nEnvironmental protection, mine closure, land rehabilitation and occupational health and safety are principally regulated by governments and to a lesser degree, if applicable, by leases. These obligations often require us to make substantial expenditures to minimise or remediate the environmental impact of our assets and to ensure the safety of our employees, contractors and the communities where we operate. Regulations setting emissions standards for fuels used to power vehicles and equipment at our assets and the modes of transport used in our supply chains can also have a substantial impact, both directly and indirectly, on the markets for these products, with flow-on impacts on our costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information on these types of obligations refer to OFR 6\n\nThe Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2021 (WA) (ACH Act), which had strengthened the Western Australian Government's Authority to regulate land use (including mining activities), was passed by the Parliament of Western Australia in December 2021 and took effect on 1 July 2023. However, the Western Australian Government has confirmed its intention to repeal it and revert back to the previous Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 1972 (WA) (with limited amendments).\n\nIn many of the jurisdictions where we operate, legislation and regulations are increasingly being enacted in response to climate change. For example, as a result of the Paris Agreement, a number of governments, including Australia, Chile, Canada and the United States, have submitted Nationally Determined Contributions to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Further, the governments in a number of regions where we operate have advanced targets and goals to reduce GHGs. In Australia, the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 imposes requirements for corporations meeting a certain threshold to register and report company information about greenhouse gas emissions and energy production and consumption as part of a single, national reporting scheme and establishes the Safeguard Mechanism to keep certain GHG emissions at or below legislated limits, known as baselines, for Australia's largest industrial facilities. On 30 March 2023, the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2023 was passed, which applies reforms to the Safeguard Mechanism from 1 July 2023 that are intended to reduce Scope 1 GHG emissions at Australia's largest industrial facilities on a trajectory consistent with achieving Australia's GHG emission reduction targets of 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero by 2050. Facilities that exceed their progressively declining legislated baselines may apply credits to meet the compliance obligations.\n\nFurther, a number of regulators in relevant jurisdictions for BHP have proposed or foreshadowed disclosure rules that would require enhanced climate-related and broader sustainability-related disclosures. While it is not yet possible to reasonably estimate the exact nature, extent, timing and cost or other impacts of any future climate change or broader sustainabilityrelated regulatory programs or future legislative action that may be enacted, we anticipate that we will be required to dedicate more resources to address legislative or regulatory changes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 6.12\n\nFrom time to time, certain trade sanctions are adopted by the United Nations (UN) Security Council and/or various governments, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union (EU), China and Australia against certain countries, entities or individuals, that may restrict our ability to sell extracted minerals, oil or natural gas to, and/or our ability to purchase goods or services from, these countries, entities or individuals.\n\n## Shareholding limits\n\nUnder current Australian legislation, the payment of any dividends, interest or other payments by BHP Group Limited to non-resident holders of BHP Group Limited's shares is not restricted by exchange controls or other limitations, except that, in certain circumstances, BHP Group Limited may be required to withhold Australian taxes.\n\nFrom time to time, certain sanctions are adopted by the UN Security Council and/or various governments, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, the EU and Australia. Those sanctions prohibit or, in some cases, impose certain approval and reporting requirements on transactions involving sanctioned countries, entities and individuals and/or assets controlled or owned by them. Certain transfers into or out of Australia of amounts greater than A$10,000 in any currency may also be subject to reporting requirements.\n\nThe Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the FATA) restricts certain acquisitions of interests in securities in Australian companies, including BHP Group Limited. Generally, under the FATA, the prior approval of the Australian Treasurer must be obtained for proposals by a foreign person (either alone or together with its associates) to acquire 20 per cent or more of the voting power or issued securities in an Australian company. Lower approval thresholds apply in certain circumstances, including for acquisitions of interests in entities that operate a 'national security business', and acquisitions of interests by foreign government investors of voting power or issued securities in an Australian company.\n\nThe FATA also empowers the Treasurer to make certain orders prohibiting acquisitions by foreign persons in Australian companies, including BHP Group Limited (and requiring divestiture if the acquisition has occurred) where the Treasurer considers the acquisition to be contrary to national security or the national interest.\n\nExcept for the restrictions under the FATA, there are no limitations, either under Australian law or under the Constitution of BHP Group Limited, on the right of non-residents to hold or vote BHP Group Limited ordinary shares.\n\n## Post-unification requirements under FATA\n\nThe Treasurer gave approval under the FATA for the actions taken as part of implementation of the unification of BHP's DLC structure on the conditions set out below:\n\n- -  BHP Group Limited remains an Australian resident company, incorporated under the Corporations Act, that is listed on the ASX under the name 'BHP Group Limited' and trades under that name.\n- -  BHP Group Limited remains the ultimate holding company of and continues to ultimately manage and control the companies conducting the businesses which are presently conducted by the subsidiaries of BHP Group Limited, including the Minerals and Services businesses, for so long as those businesses form part of the BHP Group.\n- -  The headquarters of BHP Group Limited (including the BHP Group's corporate head offices) are to be in Australia.\n- -  The Chief Executive Officer of BHP Group Limited has their principal office in Australia.\n- -  The centre of administrative and practical management of BHP Group Limited is in Australia and BHP Group Limited's corporate head office activities, of the kind presently carried on in Australia, continue to be managed in Australia.\n- -  The headquarters of BHP Group Limited is publicly acknowledged as being in Australia in significant public announcements and in all public documents.\n- -  The Chief Executive Officer of BHP Group Limited has their principal place of residence in Australia.\n- -  The majority of all regularly scheduled Board meetings of BHP Group Limited in any calendar year occurs in Australia.",

Copper in Hypogene Sulphide is mainly provident from the copper bearing mineral chalcopyrite and higher metal recoveries are achieved via grinding/flotation concentration processes.\n\nIndicated (Mineral) Resources  That part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit (JORC Code, 2012 Edition).\n\nInferred (Mineral) Resources  That part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade (or quality) are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade (or quality) continuity (JORC Code, 2012 Edition).\n\nIn situ  Situated in the original place.\n\nJORC (Joint Ore Reserves Committee) Code A set of minimum standards, recommendations and guidelines for public reporting in Australasia of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. The guidelines are defined by the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC), which is sponsored by the Australian mining industry and its professional organisations.\n\nLeaching  The process by which a soluble metal can be economically recovered from minerals in ore by dissolution.\n\nLOI (loss on ignition)  A measure of the percentage of volatile matter (liquid or gas) contained within a mineral or rock. LOI is determined to calculate loss in mass when subjected to high temperatures. MAIG  Member of the Australian Institute\n\nof Geoscientists.\n\nMarketable (Coal) Reserves Represents beneficiated or otherwise enhanced coal product where modifications due to mining, dilution and processing have been considered, must be publicly reported in conjunction with, but not instead of, reports of Coal Reserves. The basis of the predicted yield to achieve Marketable Coal Reserves must be stated (JORC Code, 2012).\n\nMAusIMM  Member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.\n\nMeasured (Mineral) Resources  That part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit (JORC Code, 2012 Edition).\n\nMetallurgical coal  A broader term than coking coal, which includes all coals used in steelmaking, such as coal used for the pulverised coal injection process.\n\nMineral Resources  A concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade (or quality) and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade (or quality), continuity and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling (JORC Code, 2012 Edition).\n\nMineralisation  Any single mineral or combination of minerals occurring in a mass, or deposit, of economic interest.\n\nMixed (ore type)  Refer to Transitional Sulphide.\n\nModifying Factors  Considerations used to convert Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves.

It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that include application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified (JORC Code, 2012 Edition).\n\nPCI  Pulverised coal injection.\n\nPEGBC Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of the Province of British Columbia.\n\nProbable (Ore) Reserves  The economically mineable part of an Indicated and, in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in the Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Ore Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proved Ore Reserve. Consideration of the confidence level of the Modifying Factors is important in conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves. A Probable Ore Reserve has a lower level of confidence than a Proved Ore Reserve but is of sufficient quality to serve as the basis for a decision on the development of the deposit (JORC Code, 2012 Edition).\n\nProved (Ore) Reserves  The economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource. A Proved Ore Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying Factors. A Proved Ore Reserve represents the highest confidence category of reserve estimate and implies a high degree of confidence in geological and grade continuity, and the consideration of the Modifying Factors. The style of mineralisation or other factors could mean that Proved Ore Reserves are not achievable in some deposits (JORC Code, 2012 Edition).\n\nReserve Life  Current stated Ore Reserves estimate divided by the current approved nominated production rate as at the end of the financial year.\n\nROM (run of mine)  Run of mine product mined in the course of regular mining activities.
