We report on the main achievements aligned with the strategy and the goals to be met.\n\nIn  the  final  segment,  we  present  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative  (GRI)  content index,  the economic,  environmental,  and  social  indicators  that  contribute  to  the  compilation  of  a sustainability report. We also present the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) indicator index to estimate structured reporting of these indicators in this first year.\n\nThis document has been prepared per the Core option of the GRI Standards. We will continue to use this methodology to deliver a management report increasingly tailored to different stakeholders and to continue learning in the process. This report was verified by a third party who  reviewed  its  content  adaptation  to  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative's  Sustainability Reporting Standard (GRI Standard).\n\nLikewise, we demonstrate our commitment to sustainability by showcasing our efforts in voluntarily managing the 10 Global Compact Principles, our contribution to the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the commitments of the Paris Agreement, and participation  in  frameworks  such  as  the  Dow  Jones  Sustainability  Index  (DJSI),  Equator Principles, United Nations Environmental Program - Financial Initiative (UNEP FI), Carbon Disclosure  Project  (CDP),  Principles  for  Responsible  Investment  (PRI),  Principles  for Responsible  Banking,  Partnership  for  Carbon  Accounting  Financials  (PCAF),  Net  Zero Banking Alliance  (NZBA),  Task  Force  on  Climate-Related  Financial  Disclosure  (TCFD),  the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance, and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for NetZero (GFANZ), among others.\n\n## Our Purpose\n\nWe promote sustainable development to achieve the well-being of ALL.\n\nWe have selected three strategic approaches that align with the United Nations SDGs. We believe they will help us achieve our purpose and measure our outcomes.",

MAINTAINING FINANCIAL STABILITY THROUGH RESPONSIBLE GROWTH\n\n## Economic Context and Outlook\n\n## Main Trends in the Region (LAC)\n\nIn  2023,  Latin  America's  major  economies  faced  a  combination  of  challenges  and opportunities that shaped their performance. Economic uncertainty, political changes, and external  factors  influenced  the  region's  growth,  estimated  at  2.3%  (compared  to  4.1%  in 2022) according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It occurred amidst a widespread backdrop of slowdown, persistent inflation, and restrictive financial conditions.\n\nThe global economic landscape was a key factor. The region relies heavily on international trade. Fluctuations in global demand and commodity prices hit export-driven economies. While  some  countries  benefited  from  increased  demand  for  commodities,  others  faced challenges due to market volatility.\n\nTrade agreements also played a key role. The region engaged in negotiations to strengthen existing  trade  partnerships  and  explore  new  opportunities.  This  action  was  aimed  at improving market access, reducing trade barriers, and fostering economic cooperation. In this regard, it is worth highlighting the favorable performance of economies such as Brazil (estimated GDP growth of 3.1% for 2023), Mexico (3.2%), and Panama (4%). These economies have capitalized on opportunities (near-shoring, friend-shoring) amidst global fragmentation to attract investment and energize various productive sectors.\n\nInflation captured the world's attention. Some countries experienced persistent inflationary pressures driven by high commodity prices and wages. This affected consumers' purchasing power and weakened demand. While in certain nations the deflationary process accelerated during the second half of 2023, even allowing their central banks to start cutting interest rates  (Brazil,  Chile,  Peru,  and  Colombia  towards  the  end  of  the  year),  the  inflationary challenge is still ahead. Likewise, its drag has impacted growth.\n\nFinally,  political  dynamics  played  a  crucial  role  in  shaping  economic  policies.  Several countries in the region experienced elections or political transitions in 2023. These led to adjustments in economic strategies. The level of political stability influenced investor trust, the ability to implement revitalization policies, and consequently, economic growth. This trend is observable in countries such as Argentina (-2.5% expected contraction in 2023), Chile (-0.5%), Peru (1.1%), and Ecuador (1.4%).\n\nWhile  some  countries  grappled  with  uncertainties,  others  demonstrated  resilience  and adaptability. This was achieved by leveraging innovation and sustainable practices to attain positive  economic  outcomes.  The  region's  performance  underscored  the  importance  of comprehensive policies addressing various economic, social, and environmental aspects to foster long-term growth and stability.\n\nColombia",

        "page_content": "A look at recent economic history reflects the progress made in the normalization of growth in the post-pandemic era. This is accompanied by a persistent behavior of inflation. Indeed, the  Colombian economy contracted as a result of the pandemic in 2020 (-7.3%). It  then rebounded  in  2021  with  a  historic  expansion  (11%).  The  slowdown  in  2023  leaves  the economy with low growth (0.6%). However, it is still amidst high inflation (9.6%) and high interest rates.\n\nGiven  the  restrictive  financial  conditions,  it  was  expected  that  2023  would  be  a  year  of slowdown  and  normalization  for  the  Colombian  economy.  Even  so,  the  slow  decline  in inflation,  driven  by  high prices of  regulated goods, will entail a cautious monetary policy stance amid the downturn in the economic cycle. Returning to inflation levels within the tolerance range of the Bank of the Republic (2%-4%) and the targeted potential growth (3%3.5%)  will  take  more  time  and  prudence.  Nevertheless,  the  economy  is  heading  in  that direction.",

        "page_content": "As  a  result,  the  most  affected  sectors  were  those  most  sensitive  to  the  challenging combination of high prices and rates, such as construction (-6%), manufacturing (-3.7%), and commerce  (-2.1%),  in  real  terms.  Construction  activity  represents  the  backbone  of investment  in  the  country.  However,  this  sector  faces  a  landscape  where  major  national infrastructure projects are not on the horizon, given the short-term focus of public spending on  social  programs.  Similarly,  the  sharp  decline  in  home  sales  would  continue  to  exert downward pressure on the sector's activity.\n\nThe lingering effects of the economic slowdown and persistent inflation have also begun to exert pressure on the labor market. National unemployment increased to 9.9% in October and could return to double digits in the coming months. This is despite the public sector's push, which has been instrumental in increasing the number of employed individuals in 2023.\n\nFinally, the economic slowdown will also put pressure on public finances, especially given the government's  stance  on  increasing  expenditure.  This  will  mainly  be  directed  towards strengthening social policies, particularly cash transfer programs and subsidies.\n\n## El Salvador\n\nIn the first half of 2023, El Salvador's economy was driven by public consumption, public and private investment, and the dynamism of the public administration and construction sectors. According to the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador, increased security in the country has benefited tourism and investment decisions. This has also driven tourism and commerce construction  alongside  public  projects  in  road  infrastructure,  sports  venues,  and  private investments  in  residential  sectors.  In  this  scenario,  El  Salvador's  GDP  recorded  a  solid progress in the second quarter of the year (3%). This came after the modest figure of 0.8% in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nRegarding prices, El Salvador reached its inflation peak in June 2022 with a record of 7.8% annually. Since then, it has decelerated to close 2023 at an annual rate of 1.2%. This result is attributed to the reduced dynamics of food prices but faces upward risks in the coming months due to the intensity of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon and rising fuel prices. We anticipate that El Salvador's inflation will reach 1.9% by the end of 2024.\n\nA  significant  driver  of  the  economy,  particularly  household  consumption,  is  remittances. They account for about 24% of GDP, making El Salvador the third most dependent country in Latin America on them. They even contribute more income than exports. In 2023, the total remittances received exceeded USD 8,181 million (+4.6% annually).\n\n## Guatemala\n\nDuring the first two quarters of 2023, the GDP expanded by 3.7% and 3.8%, respectively. Similar to El Salvador, the resilience of the labor market in the U.S. has allowed Guatemala to benefit from the strength in remittance inflows as they represent around 16% of GDP and drive household spending. In the latter half of the year, activity was impacted by political uncertainty and recent social unrest. As a result, it grew by 3.5% in the full year of 2023.",

        "page_content": "In  February,  inflation  peaked  at  9.9%  annually.  Since  reaching  that  peak,  it  has  rapidly declined. By June, it returned to the target range (3%-5%). However, upward pressure from fuel  prices  and  protests resulting  from  social  unrest  were  evident  during  September  and October. Consequently, the Bank of Guatemala has taken actions, resulting in nine increases that brought the interest rate to 5%. This level has remained stable since April 2023.\n\n## Panama\n\nPanama's economic activity expanded by 9.3% in the first quarter of the year and 8.2% in the second. These results highlight the strength of production driven by the good performance of  commerce  and  construction.  We  expect  growth  to  be  around  6.9%  in  2023  and  to decelerate to levels close to its potential in 2024 (around 4%). The construction sector will be the driving force due to public works projects such as the Panama City Metro, a bridge over the Panama Canal, and the construction of a gas power plant. However, the impact of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon is one of the main risks to the activity as it could restrict Canal operations.\n\nAt the same time, Panama's inflation situation has been somewhat less challenging as it peaked in June 2023 at a rate of 5.2% annually. Nevertheless, it underwent a rapid process of disinflation as a result of the government's freezing of fuel and food prices.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  various  spending  pressures  and  low  tax  collection  would  hinder  the consolidation of public finances. Under this context, different rating agencies have recently downgraded the country's sovereign rating and the outlook has been revised due to weak tax collection, high dependence on Canal revenues, increased public spending, and the then likely cessation of mine operations.\n\n## 2024 Economic Outlook\n\nThe outlook for 2024 is framed amidst anticipated risks, albeit with lagged effects, and a backdrop of high uncertainty. The global economy is expected to enter a soft landing phase in which inflation decreases without implying a significant slowdown in the economy. Indeed, in  its  latest  edition  of  the  World  Economic  Outlook  (WEO),  the  IMF  forecasts  that  Latin America will grow by 2.3% in 2024. This reflects its stagnation compared to the previous year.\n\nIn  2024,  the  spotlight  will  be  on  the  shift  in  the  monetary  policy  stance  of  developed economies. This process will unfold cautiously due to the resilience of economic activity and the labor market. Uncertainty about the effects of \"higher rates for longer\" is also expected to persist.\n\nFurthermore, the gradual process of disinflation would persist, leading to gradual cuts in the policy rate. However, managing the risks of upward price pressures will remain crucial. The prolonged conflicts (Ukraine-Russia, Israel-Hamas) could intermittently drive up international oil prices. Meanwhile, the effects of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon will be felt in international trade, agricultural production, and the rise in food and energy prices.",

        "page_content": "## Colombia\n\nThere are good reasons to believe that the economy may be nearing the end of the most challenging part of the cycle. It's also plausible to anticipate that in 2024, a slow recovery process may begin as inflation subsides and rate cuts persist. However, underlying factors such  as  investment  lag  and  credit  contraction  suggest  that  there  will  be  limitations  to returning to potential economic growth levels in the medium term. Consequently, our GDP growth estimate for 2024 is 0.9%.\n\nWe anticipate that the most significant macro environments will continue to set the tone. Secondary  activities  (manufacturing  and  construction)  and  trade  would  continue  to deteriorate  due  to  lower  private  consumption  and  weak  economic  growth.  Likewise,  the primary sector (agriculture and mining) would face challenges from El Ni\u00f1o and regulatory uncertainty (such as in the mining, health, and public services sectors). Meanwhile, servicerelated activities and those tied to public spending would remain dynamic.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  the  process  of  moderation  in  prices  will  continue.  We  anticipate  that inflation would close around 5.9% by the end of 2024. In the medium term, we believe it will reach the upper limit of the issuer's tolerance range (2%-4%) by mid-2026. This means that the path for the Colombian economy to reach the 3% inflation target will be challenging and prolonged.\n\nGiven this context, we expect the rate-cut cycle that commenced in December 2023 with an initial 25 basis points reduction to potentially pick up pace throughout 2024, as inflation continues its path towards the target. Having this in mind, we anticipate that 2024 could end with a monetary policy rate close to 9%.\n\n## El Salvador\n\nIt is expected that in the coming months, a period of slowdown will begin as the construction boom moderates, household consumption weakens due to tight global financial conditions, persistent  high  inflation,  declining  remittance  inflows,  slower  growth  among  trading partners, and the increasing impact of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon. Given this backdrop, we anticipate that the economy will experience moderate growth in 2024 (1.9%) as the delayed effects of the strong monetary tightening cycle become evident and the US economy slows down. Going forward, the economy would recover and grow in the medium term around potential (2.2%).\n\n## Guatemala\n\nRegarding  Guatemala,  we  anticipate  a  slight  slowdown  in  GDP  growth  in  2024  due  to weakening private consumption. This slowdown is because remittances, mostly from the U.S.,  would  decrease  as  a  result  of  tightening  labor  market  conditions  in  that  country. Therefore, Guatemala's economic growth is projected to be 3.3% in 2024, also supported by stability in the price trend (inflation expected within the range set by the Bank of Guatemala of 3-5%). The primary evident risk is political instability and governance due to the current political  and  social  situation.  Now,  we  expect  the  elected  government  to  implement measures to increase tax revenues and combat corruption.",

It  will  be  bolstered  by  economic diversification and increased public investment related to the implementation of different public infrastructure projects. While Panama's economy could be significantly impacted by a strong El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon and its implications, particularly on the operation of the Panama Canal, it is estimated to grow by 4% in 2024.\n\nThe economy faces a significant downside risk due to the suspension of operations at the Cobre Panama mine. Coupled with the deterioration of the fiscal deficit and debt, it would hinder the country's fiscal consolidation. This could jeopardize its investment grade status and further complicate the management of external and fiscal deficits. Specifically, the fiscal deficit,  economic  slowdown,  and  electoral  spending  pressures  would  prevent  the government  from  achieving  the  balance  goal  for  the  next  year.  Furthermore,  low  tax collection would also be a short-term challenge and another hurdle against achieving the fiscal target.\n\nGDP Growth in Latin America (Annual Variation %)\n\n| Country        | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Latin America* | 7.2%   | 3.8%   | 2.1%   | 1.6%   |\n| Peru*          | 13.4%  | 2.7%   | 0.3%   | 2.3%   |\n| Mexico*        | 5.7%   | 3.9%   | 3.2%   | 2.1%   |\n| Chile*         | 11.7%  | 2.4%   | -0.2%  | 1.8%   |\n| Brazil*        | 5.0%   | 2.9%   | 2.9%   | 1.5%   |\n| Colombia       | 11.0%  | 7.3%   | 1.2%   | 0.9%   |\n| Panama         | 15.8%  | 10.8%  | 5.4%   | 4.3%   |\n| Costa Rica*    | 7.9%   | 4.6%   | 4.3%   | 3.4%   |\n| Guatemala      | 8.0%   | 4.1%   | 3.1%   | 3.3%   |\n| Honduras*      | 12.5%  | 4.0%   | 3.0%   | 3.0%   |\n| Nicaragua*     | 10.3%  | 3.8%   | 3.3%   | 2.8%   |\n| El Salvador    | 11.2%  | 2.6%   | 2.3%   | 1.9%   |\n\nSource: Grupo Bancolombia, FocusEconomics. *Focus Economics Forecasts.\n\n## Impact of Economic and Monetary Policies on Bancolombia's Results\n\nBancolombia's  operational  results  are  affected  by  macroeconomic  factors,  primarily  in Colombia but also in the other countries where the Group operates.

        "page_content": "Colombia's real GDP growth in 2023 was 0.6% annually. Thus, 2023 was a period of marked weakening of Colombia's economic dynamics, following a period of high GDP growth in 2022 (of 7.3% per annum). This sharp drop in GDP growth has been part of a cycle in which Banco de  la  Rep\u00fablica  significantly  increased  the  policy  interest  rate  to  address  inflationary pressures.  Consequently,  high-interest  rates  began  to  strain  household  and  corporate budgets. It led to a decrease in both consumption and investment capacity. Similarly, public investment budget execution was also low.\n\nThe growth of the key components of GDP in 2023, at constant prices, was as follows: fixed investment decreased 8.9%, total consumption grew 1.1%, imports decreased 14.7%, and exports increased 3.1%.\n\nThe sectors that experienced the most dynamic growth in the first three quarters of 2023 (compared to the same period in 7.9) were arts, entertainment, and recreational activities along  with  other  service-related  activities  (demonstrated  an  annual  growth  of  7.0%), financial and insurance activities (3.9%), and the macro environment encompassing public administration, defense, health, and education (4.0%).\n\n## Monetary Policy Interest Rate\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the reference interest rate set by the Bank of the Republic stood at 13.00%. This followed a 125 basis points increase during the first half of the year and a 25 basis points reduction in December. Thus, the year concluded with a signal indicating the beginning of the phase of interest rate cuts in monetary policy.\n\nDespite the initial rate cut, the stance of monetary policy remains highly contractionary. The Central  Bank  has  considerable  leeway  to  continue  with  the  interest  rate-cutting  process while maintaining the contractionary stance of the policy. This will allow inflation to continue approaching its target throughout 2024.\n\n## Inflation\n\nThe annual consumer inflation (measured by CPI) stood at 9.28% at the end of 2023. It is significantly lower than the 13.12% recorded in 2022. In 2023, inflation was  driven up by transportation  (with  a  15.42%  annual  increase),  restaurant  and  hotel  services  (a  13.22% increase), and alcoholic beverages and tobacco (an 11.95% increase). Conversely, prices for information and communication services (with an annual increase of 0.12%), food and nonalcoholic  beverages  (a  5.00%  increase),  and  clothing  and  footwear  (a  5.23%  increase) experienced the least growth.\n\nIn the latter part of 2023, annual inflation consistently exhibited a slow downward trend. This pattern  is  anticipated  to  persist  throughout  2024  and  underscores  the  likelihood  of  the policy interest rate continuing to decrease, albeit at an equally slow pace.\n\n## Exchange Type",

Several indicators of institutional strength, along with positive economic outcomes such as a reduction in the checking account deficit and the beginning of the  inflation  normalization  process,  would  be  the  primary  factors  driving  the  currency's strengthening.\n\n## Outlooks\n\nThe  future  dynamics  of  the  Colombian  economy,  the  financial  sector  at  large,  and Bancolombia in particular are expected to be influenced by the following factors:\n\n| Positive Factors for the Colombian Economy  in the Medium Term                                                                                                                                                                              | Challenges  for  the  Colombian  Economy  in  the  Medium Term                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rapid economic recovery from the recession  caused by the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                         | Private  investment  remains  low,  which  will  limit  medium-term economic growth.                                                                                                                                                          |\n| The  country  is  expected  to  maintain  responsible  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  amidst a stable political environment.                                                                                                              | The potentially persistent low investor trust could  impact  private  investment  and  pose  risks  to  the  expectation  that  GDP  growth  will  return  to  its  potential  level,  which  is  slightly  above  3%  in  the  coming years. |\n| Colombia's  stable  democracy,  division  of  power,  and  checks  and  balances  underpin                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| the  predictability  of  policy  measures  and  economic pragmatism.                                                                                                                                                                        | A low medium-term potential growth could lead to  challenges for public finances or increased external  vulnerabilities.                                                                                                                      |\n| A  significant  decrease  in  the  checking  account  deficit  to  3%-4%  of  GDP  in  2023  from 6.3% in 2022 will help mitigate short- term external vulnerabilities.                                                                     | Colombia  is  exposed  to  the  adverse  effects  of  climate change, especially flooding.

Despite  these  challenges,  Grupo  Bancolombia  maintained  its  margin  due  to  its portfolio  composition  and  the  prudent  management  of  funding  resources,  focusing  on market liquidity.\n\nDuring the same period, high inflation affected the cost of credit by hampering Colombians' ability to meet their financial obligations. This situation led to an increase in provisioning expenses, ultimately impacting the Group's profitability. Similarly, high levels of inflation also impacted operating expenses and put downward pressure on profits.\n\nIn 2024, we expect a more restrictive monetary policy as long as inflation keeps decreasing. This might prompt higher lending across various channels, contingent upon a risk appetite that depends on people's borrowing capacity in a year where unemployment rates could face pressure.\n\nThe interest rate cuts are expected to lead to a decrease in the net interest margin. Combined with operating expenses largely influenced by inflation, which is still expected to remain outside the target range set by the Bank of the Republic, this could create additional pressure on the financial results.\n\n## Grupo Bancolombia Consolidated Results\n\n## GRUPO BANCOLOMBIA\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n| RESULTS AND BALANCE                  |            |            |               |               |               |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (Closing figures in millions of COP) | December   | December   | 2023 vs. 2022 | 2023 vs. 2022 | 2023 vs. 2022 |\n|                                      | 2023       | 2022       | 2021          | Var $         | Var %         |\n| Operating Income                     | 48,316,872 | 35,456,762 | 23,780,034    | 12,860,110    | 36.27%        |\n\n21",

Other sources of financing were also reduced by this effect, such as bonds by COP 2,731,686 million and financial obligations by COP 2,368,378 million.\n\nWithout the peso appreciation, the gross portfolio grew by COP 4,078,882 million (1.5%). The commercial portfolio increased by COP 2,281,521 million (1.3%), primarily driven by the corporate segment. Likewise, the housing portfolio had an increase of COP 2,653,214 million (7.1%).

This underscores the strength we have in dealing with potential future deteriorations.\n\nThroughout the year, other assets experienced an increase of COP 6,829,631 million (6.9%).

This result reflects the confidence of our customers in our organization's management of resources. Those with the greatest variation were time deposits, which increased by COP 21,770,974 million (25%). They accounted for 41% of total deposits, offset by a decrease in savings and checking  accounts,  by  COP  3,163,254  million  (2.7%)  and  COP  1,915,706  million  (4.7%), respectively.\n\nBonds ended 2023 with a balance of COP 14,663,576 million, showing a decrease unaffected by the depreciation of the dollar against the peso by COP 2,180,726 million (11.1%). This aligns  with  the  maturities  occurring  during  the  year,  which  were  covered  with  internal resources.  This  reflects  an  appropriate  management  of  the  organization's  liquidity. Furthermore, loans with institutions without this exchange rate effect had maturities that left a decrease of COP 1,675,875 million (8.5%).\n\nDespite generating profits during 2023, the equity attributable to shareholders decreased by  COP  999,391  million  (2.6%).  It  ended  the  year  at  COP  38,089,512  million  due  to  the restatement of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries in our consolidated financial statements by COP 3,787,835 million and dividends declared in March 2023 amounting to",

The equity's share of the balance sheet structure ended 2023 with a participation of 11.11% compared to 11.08% in 2022, allowing for a marginal reduction in asset leverage.\n\nSolvency levels remained above the regulatory requirements, ending with a basic solvency ratio of 11.42%. This figure increased by 105 bps compared to the 10.37% reported in 2022. The increase is mainly attributed to the impact of Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA), earnings for the fiscal year, and the appreciation of the peso against the dollar.\n\nWe closed 2023 with a net profit attributable to shareholders of COP 6,116,936 million. This figure recorded an annual decrease of COP 666,554 million (9.8%). It can be explained as follows.\n\nThe net interest income grew by COP 2,023,387 million (11.0%). This is mainly attributed to the portfolio income, which increased by COP 10,457,294 million. It is a result of the increase in  the  monetary  policy  rate  of  the  Bank  of  the  Republic  of  Colombia  and  the  Banking Benchmark (IBR). The financial expense increased by COP 8,225,825 million (97.4%). This rise aligns with the execution of the asset and liability management strategy. We observed an increase in the cost of funds associated with high deposit rates, product of the economic cycle.  Net  commissions grew  by  COP  203,238  million  (5.4%),  primarily  driven  by  the  net revenues generated from the customers' transactions when using our payment methods.\n\nThe portfolio provision and net leasing expense increased by COP 3,740,126 million (96.8%). This increase is attributed to higher allocations for impairment in the portfolio of natural persons.  The  situation  mainly  arose  in  BAM  and Bancolombia's  unsecured consumer products, housing at Banistmo, and the portfolio of SMEs and Independent Businesses at Bancolombia.\n\nOperating expenses increased by COP 2,054,542 million (18.9%). Within these, labor costs rose  by  COP  932,578  million  primarily  due  to  salary  increases  and  actuarial  calculations, which were significantly impacted by the behavior of TES discount rates. General expenses increased by COP 1,121,964 million. The most notable factors were local tax expenses (due to changes brought about by the tax reform in the industry and commerce tax), expenses associated with asset impairment, maintenance and repairs related to the Renting business, and fees for projects aimed at business evolution and transformation. In addition to a 16.9% increase in operating income before provisions, the above led to a deterioration in financial efficiency of 75 basis points, closing at 45.33%.\n\nThe  income  tax  provision  closed  the  year  at  COP  1,932,555  million.  This  represented  a contribution to the national revenue for the country's development.\n\nConsequently, we achieved a return on assets indicator of  1.78% and a return on equity attributable to shareholders of 16.14%. There was a deterioration compared to the figures recorded at the end of 2022 by 37 bps and 366 bps, respectively.\n\n## Bancolombia, a Commercial Bank\n\n## BANCOLOMBIA\n\nCommercial Bank\n\nUNCONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES FINANCIAL RESULTS",

        "page_content": "Earnings Per Share-Unit\n\n6,217\n\nAccounting accounts parameterization per the Board of Directors report and press release.\n\nAmidst  2023,  marked  by  high  inflation  in  the  Colombian  economy  and  a  contractionary monetary policy rate, Bancolombia experienced a 3.46% growth in assets. This represents COP 8,414,794 million more compared to the end of 2022.\n\nThis variation was mainly leveraged by the gross portfolio, which grew by 1.92% during the year (COP 3,448,890 million). Additionally, the balance of cash and cash equivalents stood at COP 24,348,860 million at year-end, given the Bank's liquidity conditions.\n\nThe performance of portfolio balances was largely represented by the commercial segment, which  grew  by  4.01%  (COP  3,685,879  million).  Consumer  loans  decreased  4.94%  (COP 2,021,414 million), due to a lower demand for credit. The housing portfolio grew 10.86% (COP 2,139,181 million). The financial services and natural resources sectors were the main drivers of this growth, especially in the commercial mode.\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures decreased by 16.56%, equivalent to COP 4,970,915 million. This outcome is attributed to investments in foreign subsidiaries and the currency revaluation effect caused by the exchange rate fluctuation, which shifted from COP 4,810 at the end of 2022 to COP 3,822 at the end of 2023.\n\nThe growth of COP 1,623,768 million in the portfolio provision balance indicates increased credit  risk.  This  reflects  a  deterioration  in  portfolio  quality  with  an  increase  in  the  nonperforming loan ratio, which reached 4.95%.\n\nThe company ended the year 2023 with a total liability balance of COP 214,508,670 million, which is COP 10,074,906 million higher than the 2022 year-end figure. This behavior was primarily driven by time deposits, which grew by COP 16,599,660 million, reflecting higher profitability  rates.  The  performance  of  virtual  investment  was  notable,  closing  at  COP 10,100,000 million in 2023. This represented an increase of COP 9,700,000 million compared to the previous year.\n\nOn  the  contrary,  demand  accounts  experienced  a  downward  trend:  savings  accounts decreased by COP -1,939,013 million and checking accounts by COP -2,132,066 million. This indicates a shift in funding structure. CDs gained 745 basis points of total deposit share, while  savings  and  checking  accounts  lost  share.  This  implies  an  increase  in  the  cost  of liabilities. The decrease in bonds is due to a restatement effect, along with bond maturities in pesos totaling around COP 612,522 million and a bond buyback operation of senior bonds maturing in 2025 for approximately USD 468 million conducted in August 2023.\n\nIn  equity,  Bancolombia  decreased  COP  1,660,112  million.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the exchange rate difference from investments in affiliates and subsidiaries due to the decrease in the Representative Market Exchange Rate (TRM) and lower net profit in the period.\n\nIn line with the increasing trend of the gross portfolio, the net interest income grew by 8.97%, equivalent  to  COP  1,273,799  million.  This  increase  was  primarily  due  to  the  revenue generation  from  the  commercial  portfolio.  This  favorable  trend  was  offset  by  the deterioration of the portfolio. It led to an increase in provisions expense of COP 3,759,401",

Consequently,  interest  income  and  valuation  of  financial  instruments  after provisions showed an annual decrease of COP 2,485,602 million.\n\nIncome from equity method amounted to COP 2,040,133 million. It represented an increase of COP 73,335 million compared to the balance in 2022. This was due to higher profits from subsidiary investments.\n\nNet income before provisions grew by 19.44% compared to a 19.64% increase in operational expenses. This represents a 6 basis points deterioration in the efficiency indicator, which stood  at  37.91%.  Thus,  pre-tax  profit  amounted  to  COP  7,662,543  million.  It  reflects  a decrease of COP -1,428,017 million compared to the previous year.\n\nAs a result, Bancolombia ultimately closed 2023 with a net profit of COP 5,979,730 million. This amount represents an annual decrease of 13.75%, equivalent to COP 953,235 million. This leads to a decrease in the profitability of equity, which decreased by -389 basis points, standing at 15.77%.\n\n## Material Changes related to the Issuer's Liquidity and Solvency Position\n\n## Liquid Assets\n\nOne of the Bank's main guidelines is to maintain a strong liquidity position. Therefore, the Asset and Liability Management (ALM) Committee has established a minimum level of liquid assets  based  on  the  financing  needs  of  the  parent  company  and  each  subsidiary.  The objective is to ensure, as far as possible, that there will always be sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they mature. This is both in normal conditions and stress scenarios without incurring significant losses or risking damage to the Bank's reputation.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Bank aims to maintain the optimal level of liquid assets to ensure not  only  smooth  operation  under  normal  conditions  but  also  to  operate  under  stress scenarios in the markets. In 2023, the Bank maintained a solid liquidity position with high levels of liquidity during the second half of the year.\n\nThe following table shows the distribution of liquid assets in the last two years:\n\n| Liquid assets (1)                         | December 31, 2023  December 31, 2022   |            |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------|\n| High-quality liquid assets*               |                                        |            |\n| Cash                                      | 25,273,317                             | 26,299,990 |\n| High-quality liquid marketable securities | 19,951,771                             | 17,739,501 |\n| Other liquid assets                       |                                        |            |\n| Other marketable securities**             | 5,455,735                              | 4,019,688  |",

Liquid assets are adjusted by a reduction. They include cash, repos held for trading, and investments held for trading in stocks listed on the Colombian Stock Exchange, units of investment funds, or other debt trading instruments.\n\n*High-quality liquid assets: Cash and shares that are eligible for reportable or repo operations, in addition to those liquid assets that the Central Bank receives for its monetary expansion and contraction operations described in Paragraph 3.1.1 of the Foreign Regulatory Circular DODM-142 of Bank of the Republic.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, liquid assets grew by COP 2,621,000 million primarily due to the increase  in  high-quality  liquid  securities.  This  change  stems  from  increased  deposits  and excess liquidity managed through the treasury portfolio with purchases of liquid securities.\n\nThe Bank measures liquid assets on a daily basis and compares the result with a target set by the Risk Committee. Under this rule, daily liquid assets must be equal to or greater than the target. In case the limit is not reached, there is a period of five days to increase liquidity levels.\n\nCash is important to ensure branch and ATM operations. The Bank's expansion throughout Colombia requires significant levels of cash, and cash levels are monitored on a daily basis to minimize opportunity costs. In addition, cash is considered in the mandatory bank reserve established by the Central Bank.\n\nMarketable  securities  comprising  liquid  assets  are  reviewed  by  the  ALM  Committee considering the Bank's liquidity objective. Although available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities cannot be sold, they can be pledged as collateral in repurchase agreements. Some of them are mandatory investments that can be sent to the Central Bank as collateral.\n\nThe  Financial  Superintendence  of  Colombia  (SFC)  requires  financial  institutions  to  have liquid  assets  greater  than  the  contractual  one-month  accumulated  liquidity  gap.  This contractual gap reflects the maturity of current asset and liability positions and does not reflect projections of future operations. The maturity of the loan portfolio for this purpose is affected  by  the  historical  default  indicator  and  the  maturity  of  deposits  is  modeled  in accordance with regulation.\n\nThe Bank's management believes that the current level of liquidity is adequate and seeks to maintain its strong deposit base and access to alternative sources of funding, such as loans from  domestic  and  international  development  and  commercial  banks,  repurchase agreements, bond issuances, overnight funds, and Central Bank funds, considering market conditions, interest rates and the desired maturity profile of liabilities.\n\n## Financing Structure\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Bank's liabilities reached COP 303,879,000 million, a 2.86% decrease  compared  to  December  31,  2022.  Liabilities  in  COP  increased  by  10.46%,  while liabilities  in  USD  decreased  by  20.64%. This change is mainly due to the  increase in time deposits in COP, offset by a decrease in savings and checking accounts in COP, financial obligations, and debt securities in USD. However, while USD liabilities decreased by 20.64%, this reduction was affected by the appreciation of the USD to COP exchange rate (20.54% in 2023).",

This represented an increase of 116 basis points compared to 2022.\n\n|                | As of December 31   | As of December 31   |\n|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                | 2023                | 2022                |\n|                | In millions of COP  | In millions of COP  |\n| Total deposits | 247,941,180         | 250,992,323         |\n\nThe  following  table  shows  checking  accounts,  savings  accounts,  and  time  deposits  as  a percentage of the Bank's total liabilities for 2023 and 2022:\n\n|                                 | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Check deposits                  | 11.6 % | 12.9 % |\n| Fixed-term deposits             | 32.5 % | 27.9 % |\n| Savings deposits                | 35.8 % | 37.8 % |\n| Other deposits                  | 1.7 %  | 1.5 %  |\n| Percentage of total liabilities | 81.6 % | 80.1 % |\n\n32",

        "page_content": "The Bank's main sources of funding are deposits. They are mainly composed of checking accounts, time deposits, and savings accounts. During 2023, term deposits played a key role in  the  balance  sheet  financial  structure.  High  inflation  led  the  Bank  of  the  Republic  to maintain  a  contractionary  monetary  policy.  Consequently,  there  was  lower  demand  for liquidity and credit, prompting investors to rebalance their portfolios towards higher-yield investments. As a result, the cost of funds was negatively affected due to high interest rates. Additionally, the increase in time deposits was offset by the reduction in demand deposits.\n\nDeposits as a percentage of the Bank's total liabilities in 2023 were 81.6%. This percentage increased compared to the 80.1% of total liabilities at the end of the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nThe ratio between net portfolio and deposits (including loans from other institutions) was 90.19% at the end of 2023. This figure decreased from 94.00% compared to 2022. This change is mainly explained by the decrease in net loans and advances to customers. These decreased from COP 254,444,000 million in 2022 to COP 237,728,000 in 2023. The reduction was less compared to the variation in deposits (the reduction was COP 7,095,000 million, reaching a total of COP 263,589,000 million in 2023).\n\n|                          |   As of December 31 | As of December 31   | As of December 31   | As of December 31   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                          |             2023    | 2022                | 2022                |                     |\n| Net Portfolio / Deposits |               90.19 | %   94.00  %        |                     |                     |\n\nThe Bank also finances its operations with loans from financial institutions. However, the primary source of funding during 2023 was time deposits as interest rates remained high and liquidity demand was lower. Moreover, time deposits and loans with financial institutions are indexed to different market rates and indices such as the IBR (an overnight reference interest rate of the Colombian money market liquidity reflecting the price at which banks are willing to lend or borrow funds in the financial market), DTF, IPC1, LIBOR, and SOFR.\n\nFurthermore, compliance with the CFEN in 2023, increased inflation, high-interest rates, and local and international political uncertainty generated additional pressures on the cost of short and long-term financing operations.\n\n## Outstanding Debt Instruments\n\nIn  2023,  Bancolombia  issued  USD  50.5  million  in  bonds,  while  Bancolombia  Panam\u00e1, Bancolombia Puerto Rico, and Banistmo issued bonds amounting to USD 41.9 million, USD 69.6 million, and USD 122.2 million, respectively. However, a prepayment of USD 468 million in senior bonds was executed during 2023. Consequently, the carrying amount of the issued obligations decreased by COP 4,912,000 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of bonds issued by the Bank was COP 14,663 million.\n\nThe following table shows the maturity profile of the Bank's debt securities in issue:",

The issuance of outstanding debt securities provided COP 1,781,000 million in 2023, COP 2,138 million in 2022, and COP 1,387,000 million in 2021.\n\nThe repayment of loans used COP 9,921,000 million in 2023, compared to COP 5,874,000 million  used  in  2022  and  COP  8,447,000  million  used  in  2021.

In 2022 and 2021, this amount was COP 2,310,000 million and COP 467,000 million, respectively.\n\nThe decrease in repurchase agreements and other similar secured loans provided cash of COP 304,000 million,  compared  to  the  COP  579,000 million  used  in  2022  and  COP  1,457,000 million in 2021.\n\n## Capital Solvency\n\nThe  Bank  and  its  subsidiaries  comply  with  the  capital  solvency  requirements  in  their respective operating countries.\n\nThe equity attributable to Bancolombia's owners amounted to COP 38,090,000 million as of December 31, 2023, which is 2.56% lower than the COP 39,089,000 million recorded as of December 31, 2022. This decrease is mainly explained by the appreciation of the Colombian peso against the US dollar and the lower net income generated during the period.\n\nThe Bank's consolidated capital solvency ratio was 13.40% as of December 31, 2023, higher than the 12.79% in 2022.\n\nThe Bank's capital solvency ratio exceeded the requirements of the Colombian government and the Superintendence of Finance by 440 basis points above the minimum 9% required by the Colombian regulator. The core capital ratio (Tier 1) was 11.42 % and the tangible capital ratio,  which  is  equal  to  the  ratio  of  the  difference  between  net  equity  and  goodwill  and intangible  assets  over  tangible  assets,  was  8.66  %  at  the  end  of  2023.  For  a  complete description of the Bank's capital adequacy requirements, see Item 4. \"Information about the Company - B.

It has had low levels of liquidity during the first months of the year and high levels of liquidity at the end of the year. This behavior is mainly explained by the increase in liquidity due to the monetary expansion operations carried out by the Bank of the Republic and the National Government injecting liquidity to the market in response to the greater dynamics in the economic activity and the high transaction rate.\n\nIn 2023, inflation remained above the target range, prompting the Central Bank to maintain high interest rates. This resulted in reduced liquidity preference, credit operations, and an increase in investments in time deposits. While demand deposits decreased over the year, the last quarter witnessed significant growth in savings and checking accounts.\n\nHowever, we believe that the seasonality in deposits does not have a significant impact on the operation of the business, as the excess/shortage of liquidity is managed through the treasury portfolio.\n\n## Equities Performance\n\nThroughout 2023, the performance of Bancolombia's common and preferred shares closely mirrored the movement of the COLCAP index.\n\nBancolombia's common stock concluded 2023 with a yearly variation of -22%. It experienced devaluation throughout the year, hitting a low of COP 27,200 on September 06, 2023, and reaching a peak of COP 44,000 on January 11, 2023. All of this aligns with the positive trend observed at the end of 2022.\n\nThe preferred stock had an annual variation of -11%, reflecting a trend similar to the market (COLCAP -7% annually). It reached its peak at COP 35,490 on January 31, 2023. Subsequently, the price declined to a minimum of COP 25,100 with some recovery in the last quarter to close 2023 at approximately COP 29,920.\n\nBancolombia Common and Preferred Price Evolution vs. COLCAP",

Investment  remains  relatively  stable.  This  is  partly  due  to  last  year's expectations when we anticipated a stabilization in fixed asset investment. Nevertheless, we continue with a high investment focus on technology and digital development, cybersecurity enhancement, and cloud migration. We also anticipate investing in channels and tools to diversify  the  digital  offering.  Additionally,  we  plan  to  invest  in  data  analytics,  reinforce machines to support processing in non-productive environments, and evolve the ERP system.\n\n## Profit Distribution Project\n\n## BANCOLOMBIA S.A.

We  interacted  with  several  institutional  funds  investing  in  Bancolombia. Thanks  to  virtual  platforms,  we  also  increased  the  number  of  meetings  with  investors, investment  analysts,  and  risk  rating  agencies.

Similarly,  we  extended assistance to over 48,000 individuals through instruments like order of payments.\n\nPortfolio  containment  and  recovery  was  also  a  challenge.  We  promote  initiatives  with customers  in  good  standing,  with  early  delinquencies  or  with  deteriorated  balances.  We improve reachability, payment incentives, and digital collections.\n\nIn terms of corporate business, 2023 was a challenging year, with several factors anticipating a  more complex and volatile market landscape. However, we continue to accompany our customers in their needs.\n\nRegarding the commercial portfolio (which represents 63.8% of the total), over 70% of the placements were new credits for over 2,000 companies. They now see us as their ally and reference  for  their  short  and  long-term  needs.  This  comes  alongside  effective  risk management, with a stable non-performing loan ratio throughout the second half.\n\nIn Guatemala, we have also strengthened our value proposition across various segments to continue  supporting  our  customers  in  their  needs  while  fostering  healthy  growth.  This includes an increase in placements and retention across various credit modalities, as well as a 53% rise in Bancaseguros placements.\n\n## Capital Management and Efficiency\n\nWe made progress in optimizing the Grupo Bancolombia's cap ital structure. To achieve this, we designed a capital utilization methodology that prioritizes equity. It has enabled us to increase dividend payouts and maintain a solvency ratio above 10.5%, thereby contributing to profitability and meeting regulatory and business requirements.\n\nAmidst the current environment, we achieved effective liquidity management. We optimized the Net Interest Margin performance and interest rate risk through our asset and liability management.\n\nFrom Treasury, we achieved outstanding revenue performance: in 2023, we reached 32.5% of the annual revenue budget and achieved net earnings excluding CD of COP 785,300 million. With customers across various segments, we highlight a 47% increase in hedging revenues (COP 155,000 million). Additionally, we have created avenues for market updates and risk management strategy discussions.\n\nIn the Capital Markets arena, we secured approval and negotiated the first working capital credit  with  Deutsche  Bank.  This  marks  the  first  of  its  kind  for  a  financial  institution worldwide. We also successfully completed a buyback operation for a portion of the senior bonds maturing in January 2025, with a face value of USD 950 million. The transaction was closed at USD 468 million (1.26 times the original offer amount). The transaction leveraged the subsidiaries' dividend availability and a favorable market window, resulting in savings of USD 17 million on the repurchase price and USD 14 million in interest expenses.\n\nRegarding efficiency initiatives, we highlight several efforts. One of them is the corporate EFIT\u00d3N. Its purpose is to drive the implementation of initiatives that improve efficiency and productivity, which in 2023 generated efficiency savings of COP 832,181 million.",

        "page_content": "At the same time, efficiencies, increased speed, precision, and future vision were achieved by leveraging analytics and digital evolution in financial practice. With the models developed using cross-analytical capabilities, annual efficiencies of COP 29,406 million were generated in contract optimization, cash storage management, analysis of customer financial behavior, and disclosure of information to shareholders and external parties.\n\nIn line with this, we evolved the service model of the finance function to better align with the business, anticipate solutions, and align strategy with financial objectives. This model has enhanced capacity to address challenges and support the business in its initiatives from inception, guiding strategic alternatives for the future.\n\nFurthermore, we optimized processes in financial closing and quarterly result generation. This enables us to analyze and disclose information promptly (within the first 9 days of the following month).\n\nMeanwhile, we continued to implement automation. With over 1,614 digital enablers and automation  services  in  426  processes  across  the  organization,  we  achieved  efficiencies totaling COP 9,826 million and reduced operational risk by over COP 38,817 million. Thanks to  this  evolution,  we  generated  economic benefits  equivalent  to  COP  128,472  million  by avoiding expenses through the effective use of technology.\n\nAll of these efforts have been accompanied by a redefinition of the financial role. This has been  facilitated  by  evolving  the  vision  of  success  within  the  function,  modernizing  the operating model, and implementing a knowledge management strategy and talent mindset in finance.\n\n## Venture Capital Investment\n\nSince 2018, Bancolombia Ventures, the Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) arm of the Grupo Bancolombia, has been in operation. It aims to invest in startups with high growth potential aligned with the bank's business strategy.\n\nSince then, it has completed 46 transactions involving 32 companies. Notable transactions include alternative loans with investments such as Agricapital and Blup (a smart inventory financing solution), venture capital funds like Veronorte and Anthemis, and Consumer/Wealthtech companies, including Trii, Quipu, and N1CO.\n\nBancolombia  Ventures  also  manages  the  impact  investment  fund  of  the  Fundaci\u00f3n Bancolombia.  Through  this  fund,  12  transactions  have  been  completed  involving  9 companies, such as SunColombia, P\u00e1ramo Snacks, and Urbania. It has made an impact on individuals in rural Colombia, reaching 32 out of the country's 33 departments.\n\nIn 2023, 20 investments totaling USD 17.8 million were made in startups. This brings the committed capital and impact portfolio to USD 49.2 million.\n\nWe also launched our Startup Management Office to strengthen the relationship between Bancolombia and key startups supporting the organization's focus strategies. This promotes experimentation to reduce uncertainty and enhance decision-making in structuring alliances and investments, maximizing outcomes for both parties.",

Through these partnerships, we have leveraged strategic capabilities including customer insights, customer experience,  financial  inclusion,  banking  aggregation,  risk  models,  and  access  to  noncustomers.  We  have  also  supported  13  startups  in  connecting  with  the  bank,  taking  a comprehensive  approach  to  strengthen  their  financial  capabilities  and  address  areas  of weakness.\n\n## Miami Operation\n\nBancolombia Capital Miami began its operations in the United States in August 2022 and has since consolidated its operation.   The entity currently manages USD 450 million across its two broker-dealer and investment adviser businesses.  Through them, customers can access products traded in public markets and funds with various investment strategies in stocks and bonds across many sectors and countries in both public and private markets.\n\nThis  year,  we  secured  the  first  Multilateral  Organization  (Professional  Investor)  to  invest funds in two of our Collective Investment Funds for Liquidity through a local custodian (Trust Entity).  This  opened  doors  to  foreign  professional  investors  interested  in  efficiently managing their liquidity and investment opportunities for medium and long-term goals.\n\n## Sustainable Funding\n\nAt Grupo Bancolombia, we have been consolidating a sustainable finance strategy to offer individuals and businesses solutions for harmonious relationships with the environment and the community.\n\nTherefore, we aim to promote company projects that enable a transition to a low-carbon economy and contribute to closing social gaps and/or access to health or drinking water through the issuance of green, social, sustainable, and sustainability-linked bonds. We have also  taken  the  message  to  the  stock  market  that  investments  can  generate  social  and environmental value.\n\nAdditionally, we continue to achieve milestones in accessing financing from international banks  with  a  sustainability-linked  loan  worth  USD  100  million  received  during  2023. Combined with two similar operations in 2022, this brings our total to USD 350 million in such  credits.  The  resources  are  used  for  working  capital  and  trade.  They  include commitments to financing goals for sustainable initiatives, women in leadership positions, and reducing carbon emissions.\n\nTo date, we have issued 6 bond issues for a total amount of COP 2,700,000 million and we have supported financed renewable energy, sustainable construction, women entrepreneur empowerment, social  infrastructure,  circular  economy,  and  access  to  affordable  housing initiatives.  We  are  also  committed  to  increase  access  to  financing  for  unbanked  and underserved low-income people and to achieve a reduction in financed CO2 emissions.\n\nThese bond issuances were conducted in Colombia and Panama. They had both domestic and international  buyers,  including  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  the  InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB), and investors from the primary market. In accordance with the established Green, Social, Sustainable & Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles by the ICMA, we hereby provide the status of the 6 issuances as of December 31, 2023.",

On this journey, and with the experience and knowledge acquired, we have deepened the integration of sustainability in  our  products and service offerings, our recommendations to the market, and our own position. In 2023, we reached the following milestones:\n\n- \u00b7 As part of our business ambition to mobilize at least COP 500,000,000 million through financial  services  in  purpose-associated  activities  by  2030,  our  Asset  Management division  reached  over  COP  8,980,000  million  in  assets  under  management  with  ESG criteria by the end of 2023.

For this purpose, we carry out permanent monitoring aligned with reduction goals.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, we surpassed our targets. To reinforce our commitment, we set higher goals by establishing a new baseline in 2019. In 2023, expenditures generally increased as the bank resumed normal operations.

Additionally, our La Palmas and Torre Oriente branches generated an additional 56.6 MWh. This allows for a total annual generation of 750.6 MWh.\n- \u00b7 El Salvador: Our data center generated 121.4 MWh.\n\n## GRI 305 Emissions\n\nClimate change is a growing challenge. Therefore, Bancolombia is committed to defining concrete  actions  to  actively  contribute  to  mitigation  and  compensation  from  our  direct operations and move towards a low-carbon economy.\n\nIn  2020, we redefined our science-based target for Scopes 1 and 2, aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C scenario. We also committed to reduce our direct emissions by 73% by 2024 compared to 2019 emissions, and to achieve carbon neutrality in the countries where we operate by 2030. The definition of this target was based on the science-based methodology (SBTi - Science Base Targets Initiative).\n\nCurrently, we implement energy efficiency strategies and utilize renewable energy in 100% of our facilities. This includes the installation of photovoltaic systems in Colombia and El Salvador, as well as the purchase of 100% renewable energy certificates (REC) in Colombia",

For Guatemala and El Salvador, it is re-extracted from the EPA Simplified GHG Emissions Calculator (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency).\n\n- \u00b7 The calculation is done using the operational control approach.\n\n## Business Travel\n\nTo offset the impact of the carbon footprint generated by our travel, we continued with the implementation of the internal carbon tax for business travel. In 2023, we generated internal revenue of COP 284,188,383, which we invested in energy efficiency initiatives to reduce energy consumption and the purchase of renewable energy certificates (REC).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GRI 306 Waste\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWaste for final disposal (tons)\n\nIn 2023, we managed a total of 2,532 tons of waste. This represents a 102% increase in the amount of waste disposed of compared to 2022, due to a mass disposal of stored items. Compared to 2019, there was a 26% increase. This poses a challenge for 2024.\n\nWe calculate ordinary waste using the PPC. For 2023, the data updated from 1.71 to 2.07, resulting in an increased value.\n\nGRI 306-2, GRI 306-3, GRI 306-4, GRI 306-5\n\n<!-- image -->",

We intervene in our waste management from the eco-design of our portfolio of physical products and the acquisition of our inputs through  the  implementation  of  sustainability  criteria  in  our  supply  chain  to  reduce  the amount of waste from the design stage. The wastes generated in our operation are classified by  type  for  use,  donation,  treatment,  and/or  final  disposal.

This sustainability integration begins with defining the required need, procuring and contracting products and services that are environmentally friendly and produced or generated under socially fair conditions, conducting annual sustainability assessments, and supporting the development of offers that incorporate sustainability  criteria.  It  creates value  for  us  and other customer companies and reinforces a sustainable supply ecosystem.\n\n- \u00b7 We  updated  our  Sustainable  Procurement  Policy  to  more  clearly  outline  the  bank's commitment  to  sustainable  purchases,  leveraging  circular  economy  principles,  risk management, and ESG criteria. We also included a commitment for suppliers to implement circular  economy  strategies.  This  policy  serves  as  a  key  tool  for  implementing  and developing sustainability in the supply chain.\n- \u00b7 We conducted a sustainability risk assessment using supply taxonomy to prioritize families based on risk levels. The assessment identified 16 families as high risk, 19 as medium risk, and 106 as low risk.\n- \u00b7 In  2023,  we  assessed  the  sustainability  commitments  made  by  50  suppliers  to  ensure compliance.\n\nTo learn more about our eco-efficiency initiatives, visit our website https://www.grupobancolombia.com/sostenibilidad/enfoque-\n\nsostenible/ecobanco/ecoeficiencia-operacional",

The UN has just joined this statement. It defines  2024  as  the  year  to  rebuild  the  trust  that  eroded  in  2023  due  to  economic uncertainty, polarization, and the truth crisis.\n\nBuilding trust among all our stakeholders has been central to Grupo Bancolombia's purpose implementation. We prioritize understanding our stakeholders' expectations and bridging gaps to strengthen trust in the countries where we operate. Trust forms the foundation for strong social relationships.\n\nTrust fosters empathetic and genuine decisions, connects people around shared interests, and  uncovers  new  relationship  opportunities,  leading  to  favorable  behaviors  for organizations and the company.\n\n## We Begin by Understanding our Stakeholders' Expectations\n\nAligned  with  this,  we  employ  a  comprehensive  strategy  to  oversee  Grupo  Bancolombia's reputation  by  taking  a  sensitive  approach  to  the  environment  and  understanding stakeholder expectations.\n\nIn addition to external indices and rankings, we conduct our own study in partnership with KPMG Spain  to  better  grasp  stakeholder  expectations  and  their  perceptions  of  us  from emotional, rational, and behavioral standpoints.\n\nThanks to our management efforts, stakeholders rated their trust levels in us highly in 2023. We achieved an 80% rating for our Individual and Company customers, 97.4% for suppliers, and 100% for employees (all on a scale of 0% to 100%). This success motivates us to further cultivate enduring relationships.\n\nWhen assessing our performance, the general public (individual and company customers) rates us at 5.15/7, emphasizing our leadership and financial strength. Suppliers rate us at 6/7, highlighting  our  commitment  to  good  governance,  ethics,  and  integrity.  Meanwhile, employees  rate  us  at  6.4/7,  emphasizing  integrity,  financial  stability,  and  sustainable development for overall well-being.\n\nThus, the average rating across stakeholder groups is 5.7 out of 7. Indeed, we attained ratings exceeding 5 in all operating countries. It solidifies Grupo Bancolombia's robust reputation.\n\nAccording  to  the  MERCO,  we  also  hold  the  top  position  as  the  company  with  the  best reputation in Colombia, leading in ESG focus, and ranking second in talent attraction and retention reputation.\n\n## We Employ a Reputation Impact Risk Management Model\n\nWe recognize that trust erosion arises from diverse factors (traditional or financial and nonfinancial), such as market, liquidity, and credit risks, misinformation, political risk, ethics, and transparency. Therefore, we assess and address these risks' impact on reputation through a",

That allows the construction of a future of well-being for all.\n\n## Tax Policy\n\nCountries and regions progress economically and socially through revenue generated from taxes, fees, and contributions. Hence, it is vital for Grupo Bancolombia to uphold transparent fiscal policies and committed corporate governance in every country of operation.

These  evaluations  alternate  between  internal  and  external.  In  this  way,  in January  2023,  a  self-evaluation  of  2022  management  was  carried  out.  And,  between December 2023 and February 2024, the external advisor, Governance Consultants, evaluated the Board management during 2023.\n\nThe  results  of  the  2022  Board  self-evaluation  were  assessed  by  the  Good  Governance Committee and the Board of Directors and were taken into account during 2023 for the improvement  of  the  governing  body.  The  openness  to  dialogue,  cohesion  and  integrity, diversity, experience, knowledge, and commitment of its members, the broad perspective of the Group, its alignment with the purpose and values of the Grupo, the annual strategic planning,  the  independence  of  the  administration,  good  coordination  and  logistics, programming of the annual agenda, and the contributions and reports of the committees were highlighted. The Directors recommended a greater social and political context, training in digital banking and cybersecurity, and an increase in how often or in length these Support Committee meetings occur.\n\nThe  annual  thematic  agenda  of  the  Board  of  Directors  for  2023  was  based  on  the recommendations of the Directors and the needs of the company. In nine meetings of the Board of Directors, the political, social, or economic outlook of the countries in which the Grupo has a presence was presented. Among other topics, the Directors were contextualized about the legislative  initiatives,  the  political,  social,  and  economic  environment,  and  the plans  of  the  elected  governments,  as  well  as  their  potential  impacts,  challenges,  and opportunities.    Besides,  political,  economic,  and  market  analysts,  who  are  recognized nationally  and  internationally,  participated  in  the  Board.  Likewise,  the  meetings  of  the Support Committees were increased, especially the Audit Committee ones.\n\nAs specified below, multiple talks and training were held during the year on megatrends, behavioral  sciences,  sustainability,  technology,  digital  banking,  cybersecurity,  and geopolitical risks. Moreover, as noted above, Jorge Noguera was appointed as an advisor to the Board of Directors on matters related to technology and cybersecurity.\n\nBy the above-mentioned, during December 2023 and February 2024, the external advisor, Governance Consultants, carried out an external evaluation of the Board of Directors. In this process, 50 factors were evaluated, related to six dimensions: (i) structure and conformation, (ii)  agenda  and  strategic  focuses,  (iii)  fulfillment  of  responsibilities,  (iv)  operability,  (v)",

A  methodology  that  included conducting interviews and completing a questionnaire by members of the Board and Senior Management was used.\n\nIn  general  terms,  according  to  the  Governance  Consultants  report,  the  results  of  the evaluation 'reflect an effective government body, with good performance that adds value to Bancolombia. The average rating of the different dimensions evaluated is 9.3/10, both from the perspective of the members of the Board of Directors (JD) and the Senior Management team (AG).' In the same way, the report highlights that the Board has an 'adequate diversity and complementarity of knowl edge,' and that it 'operates effectively (the information is sufficient  and  appropriate,  the  format  of  the  meetings  is  appropriate,  the  role  of  the President  is  positively  recognized,  and  the  role  of  the  Secretary  receives  outstanding ratings).' In addition to the above, 'a work dynamic based on trust and the ability to work as a  team'  and  'an  adequate  committee  structure  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  the  Bank'  is recognized.\n\nThe report also establishes that 'one of the greatest challenges for the governance system of an entity with the size, complexity and regulatory burden of Bancolombia is to be able to establish the appropriate level of monitoring of past results and the level of involvement regarding the strategic vision and the future.' In this way, the need to 'achieve a balance between monitoring results and the prospective vision of business' is highlighted.  Also, it is noted the 'expectation of better time management in meetings to comply with the entire agenda.'\n\nThe  Good  Governance  Committee  and  the  Board  of  Directors  were  informed  of  the evaluation results in February 2024. Hence, from the annual agendas of the Board and the Committees, measures have been taken to achieve the indicated balance and to guarantee better time management in meetings.\n\n## Board of Directors Training\n\nIn  the  development  of  our  administrators'  training  activities,  Directors  attended  the Directors' Meeting organized by Bancolombia in 2023.

These  firms  accompany  the  analysis  of  global compensation  trends  and  the  evaluation  of  salary  competitiveness  according  to  the responsibilities  of  the  executives  of  a  systemic  organization  like  Bancolombia.    This compensation  strategy  is  made  up  of  fixed  and  variable  compensation.  Variable compensation, with its short- and long-term components, seeks to stimulate the fulfillment of  the  company's  goals,  reward  with  the  generation  of  value,  align  the  interests  of  the management team with the interests of the shareholders, and recognize and encourage high performance of the management team in consistency with the organizational strategy.\n\nDuring  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors,  through  the  Appointment,  Compensation,  and Development Committee, and based on market references, comprehensively reviewed the compensation model of the management team, especially the variable component, including its indicators, challenges, and maximum limit.\n\nThe variable remuneration policy is based on the generation of added value. There is room for the payment of bonuses when organizational results in terms of profits exceed the value of the cost of capital.  Besides, the model measures compliance with strategic planning goals, which must be aligned with the strategic direction defined by the Board of Directors.  Longterm  results  are  promoted.  For  this  purpose,  short-  and  long-term  (triennial  [3  years]) management measurement indicators are considered. The long-term component considers the financial indicator (SVA Holding), the sustainability indicator (Dow Jones Sustainability Index),  and  the  loyalty  indicator  (competitive  NPS).  In  line  with  the  aforementioned,  a compensation  cap  has  been  established.  A  maximum  of  eight  salaries  per  year  for  the President  and  seven  for  Corporate  Vice  Presidents  per  bonus.  30%  of  the  remuneration translates into participation in the Fondo Institucional de Pensi\u00f3n Voluntaria SVA, which is represented in Bancolombia shares. According to the regulations of the fund, the employee can only withdraw their contributions after a minimum term of permanence of three years. The philosophy of this mechanism is that employees feel ownership of the organization and are committed to sustainable results.\n\nNote 28, 'transactions with related parties' of the consolidated financial statements (note 27 of the separate financial statements), contains details of labor payments made to Senior Management.\n\nThe withdrawal of resources from the Fondo SVA by the Bank's administrators must undergo an authorization procedure before the Board of Directors. The authorization granted to the members of Senior Management is revealed to the market through the relevant information mechanism. Taking the above into account, the Board of Directors authorized, during 2023,",

During 2023, efforts were made to consolidate the internal  control  function  so  that  the  company  is  increasingly  better  prepared  for  the challenges that may arise in the development of its processes, can achieve its objectives, and can adequately manage its internal control. The following developed actions stand out:\n\n- \u00b7 Construction of the good practices guide for the preparation of documents. This guide seeks to  homologate  and  standardize  the  different  types  of  documents  prepared  in  the organization.\n- \u00b7 Creation of Internal Control policies and Internal Control over Financial Reporting policies, and  updating  of  Controls,  Single  Account  Statement  (EUC),  and  Segregation  of  Duties Policies.\n- \u00b7 Redesign of the Internal Control Board.\n- \u00b7 Creation and structuring of the SOX and Internal Control Committee.\n- \u00b7 Design and deployment of the internal control awareness and communication strategy.\n- \u00b7 Diagnosis  and  support  for  the  implementation  of  External  Circular  008  issued  by  the Colombian Financial Superintendency.\n- \u00b7 Creation of the Internal Control Framework.\n\nOur ICS has policies and procedures consistent with the size and complexity of the business and has been structured to comply with the standards and best practices of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its 2013 version.\n\nIt is important to mention that, during 2023, there were no remarks by supervisory bodies or sanctions on the entity's ICS.",

Control Environment\n\nBancolombia's  Board  of  Directors  leads  the  strategic  planning  process  based  on  a competitive environment diagnosis, trends, and Grupo's capabilities to achi eve its objectives. The latter seeks to make our purpose, \"to promote sustainable development for the wellbeing of all\", reality and to respond to the growing challenges that the environment brings us.\n\nWe are committed to promoting responsible and sustainable business. Therefore, we operate under the law and aspire to the highest standards of ethics, integrity, and anti-corruption. We know that the existence of an adequate control environment comes not only from the application of regulations but also from the appropriation of our Movimiento B program as an expression of our culture, and of the six (6) traits that drive us: integrity, sustainable growth,  human  beings,  clients,  dynamism,  and  extraordinary  performance.  These  traits define our culture as a company and motivate and guide our actions.\n\nWe have made efforts to strengthen the culture of disclosure and ethical reasoning regarding conflicts  of  interest,  related  parties,  participation  in  Boards  of  Directors  and  third-party committees,  access  to  privileged  information,  external  activities,  gifts  and  invitations, sponsorships,  and  gratuitous  bailment.  We  have  also  promoted  trust  in  the  Ethics  Line through the promotion of the Whistleblower Protection Policy through awareness-raising activities throughout the organization and targeted at prioritized groups.\n\nDuring 2023, within the framework of the ICS, we worked on strengthening the company's control  environment  from  the  compliance,  talent  and  culture,  and  self-control  and certification (AYC) fronts, as detailed below.\n\nThe  Compliance  Vice-Presidency  continued  to  strengthen  the  compliance  programs  to supervise and control the risks of Ethics and Conduct, SARLAFT, Anticorruption, Personal Data  Protection,  Consumer  Protection,  penalties,  FATCA/CRS,  Behavioral  Risk  in  Money Markets, Unfair Competition, and Regulatory Compliance. Likewise, the Anti-Fraud Program Strategy and the prioritization of activities against the risk of misappropriation of assets were  established.  The  strengthening  of  the  Anti-Fraud  Program  framework  continued concerning  the  coordination/articulation  role  of  the  Compliance  Vice  Presidency.  The following activities were also conducted:\n\n- \u00b7 To promote the duty of disclosure and support for employees, we provided ongoing advice and guidance on ethical dilemmas and resolved general doubts about the guidelines of the Code of Ethics and Conduct.\n- \u00b7 Ethical Reasoning Tools were created for the receipt of gifts and invitations, participation in politics,  related  parties,  and  external  activities,  which  seek  to  provide  autonomy  and empowerment to individuals to make informed and ethical decisions and to assist in these decision-making  processes.  In  addition,  we  evolved  tools  for  the  inadvertent  use  of privileged information and participation in boards of directors and third-party committees to maintain the traceability of employees' actions in these tools.",

Moreover, we created and screened a communication piece to customers in branches to discourage the offering of tips to the sales teams.\n- \u00b7 Training and sensitization of different administrative and commercial teams of the company on  the  guidelines  of  the  Code  of  Ethics  and  Conduct  and  the  promotion  of  the  Ethical Reasoning  Tools  were  carried  out,  achieving  a  significant  increase  in  the  number  of consultations and disclosures of possible conflicts of interest by employees. We also held an awareness-raising session with suppliers and partners to share best practices in integrity and cybersecurity.\n- \u00b7 We developed a conversation methodology for leaders to foster and institutionalize spaces for open conversations about ethical dilemmas based on psychological safety, listening, and care.\n- \u00b7 As  a  macro  sensitization  strategy,  we  leverage  the  elements  and  tools  provided  by  the behavioral sciences to nurture diagnosis, measurement, and intervention mechanisms in the company.\n- \u00b7 From the anti-corruption front, we conducted an awareness-raising and dissemination of the new Anti-Corruption Policy. These spaces were carried out with the prioritized areas of the organization, and a dynamic methodology was used in which hypothetical cases related to the day-to-day issues of the teams were studied.\n\nAlso, from this perspective, we developed an Ethical Reasoning Tool for users to manage the risks associated with the provision of sponsorships. This tool presents the main risk factors that users must take into account and the main steps and validations that must be carried out  before  submitting  sponsorships.  Further,  we  developed  awareness-raising  and dissemination spaces for the tool and designed a mechanism to measure its effectiveness.\n\n- \u00b7 As for the Ethics Committee, the topics discussed provided guidelines on ethics, conduct, and integrity and positions on highly complex ethical dilemmas. We also participated in the Audit Committee, presenting progress and relevant information on the Anti-Fraud Program.\n- \u00b7 A  mandatory  training  plan  for  employees  on  internal  control  and  compliance  issues  is updated  annually.  Topics  related  to  Ethics,  Anti-Fraud,  Anti-Corruption,  SOX  Act,  AntiMoney  Laundering,  and  data  protection  are  included  in  this  plan.  In  2023,  the  results obtained were highly satisfactory, achieving 99,8% compliance.\n- \u00b7 Year after year, the Ethics Line has become the channel for reporting breaches of the Code of  Ethics  and  Conduct  or  the  policies  that  complement  it  by  employees,  suppliers,  and customers  of  Grupo  Bancolombia.  All  reports  and  complaints  received  followed  the corresponding process for their investigation. Additionally, investigations were conducted due to alerts detected by the areas responsible for ensuring compliance with the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the Anti-Fraud Program Policies, and the Zero-Tolerance standard for Fraud. When investigations determined that any of our employees failed to comply with the provisions, policies, or ethical standards required by Grupo Bancolombia, either actively or by omission, respective sanctions or disciplinary measures were imposed in accordance with provisions of the Internal Labor Regulations and applicable regulations.",

To achieve this,  we  have  renewed  our  value  proposition,  focusing  on  three essential  pillars:  development,  connection,  and  enjoyment,  which  form  the  basis  of  the work experience in our organization.\n- \u00b7 We focus on the evolution of talent and culture processes aligned with the sustainability of Banca en Movimiento. We accompanied the operation of the 59 Continuous Value Teams, achieving more than 85% compliance with its objectives and key results. In addition, we established a capacity management strategy that will guide our actions through 2024.\n- \u00b7 We make a significant investment in the development of our employees through multiple programs designed according to the strategic needs of the business and the best practices of  the  environment.  The  objective  is  to  contribute  to  the  evolution  of  the  employees, helping them to reach their best version and meet the proposed goals.\n- \u00b7 To enrich the employee experience, we use tools such as \"Y t\u00fa que dices\" to gather their opinions.  We  also  perform  detailed  demographic  analyses  of  their  trajectory  in  the organization, identifying areas to highlight and opportunities for improvement. This data allowed  us  to  create  a  three-year  strategic  plan  to  intervene  and  improve  the  talent experience comprehensively.\n- \u00b7 We develop actions to maintain a solid and constantly evolving culture, together with the strategy and dynamics of the organizational ecosystem, to promote good performance and well-being. Practices such as MovimientoB, L\u00edderB, and Tiempo de Enfoque, among others, summon employees through various collective actions to materialize the experience of our purpose.\n- \u00b7 We have a Social Dialogue model characterized by the promotion of respectful spaces for conversation, which reflects our firm determination to achieve a balance between the wellbeing of our employees and the sustainability of the company.\n- \u00b7 We made progress in strengthening the model of governance of employee information and data protection to ensure the proper management of internal information based on the policy and manual of data processing.\n\nFinally, the following activities were carried out by the areas in charge of coordinating SelfControl and Certification (AYC) actions:\n\n- \u00b7 A  total  of  754  processes  were  certified,  which  led  to  close  1,691  commitments  for continuous improvement. Furthermore, 150 controls at branches were certified. A total of 42 findings were managed and closed with the process holders. A 100% completion rate of self-evaluation was achieved by commercial advisors, service advisors, senior executives, managers, assistant managers, and supernumeraries.

Risk Assessment and Control Activities\n\nGrupo Bancolombia has a risk and control management framework that allows it to preserve the efficacy, efficiency, and effectiveness of its management and operational capacity; and prevent,  avoid,  or  minimize  the  probability  of  events  that  may  affect  the  operation  or compliance  with  the  objectives  and/or  the  costs  or  damages  caused  associated  with  the materialization of these events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis  framework  promotes  a  risk  management  culture  through  self-control,  selfmanagement, and self-regulation. It includes the identification of the different risks to which the organization is exposed and the definition of roles and responsibilities of the different lines and areas of the company concerning these risks. These roles and responsibilities are aligned with the provisions of the SOX Law and the Chapter of the Basic Legal Circular - C.E. 029 regarding the Internal Control System, ensuring its compliance.\n\nIn June and December 2023, External Circular (EC) 018 issued by the Colombian Financial Superintendency  in  September  2021  on  the  \"Comprehensive  Risk  Management  System (SIAR)\" came into force. This Circular allows the entity to have a global vision of the risks to which  it  is  exposed,  including  governance  guidelines,  the  definition  of  the  risk  appetite framework, and the aggregation of data and reporting.",

Similarly, it implemented a control board to monitor the main risks to which the entity is exposed, such as credit, market, liquidity, operational,  capital,  and  concentration  risk,  as  applicable,  and  also  introduced  an  action framework, which indicates the process when exceeding the defined limits.\n\nAdequate  structuring  in  the  three  lines  and  their  proper  functioning  avoids  gaps  and unnecessary duplication of efforts and provides greater possibilities for achieving adequate risk  management  through  interaction  between  the  business  and  support  units  and  the control and prevention units. It facilitates the achievement of organizational objectives and provides reasonable assurance to the various stakeholders on the control of risks and the entity's sustainability.\n\nIn a joint effort between the different lines (business units, the risk and control systems of the second line, and the assurance function of the third line), measures have been reviewed and  implemented  to  increase  the  company's  resilience  and  its  capacity  to  adapt  to supervening events that may affect the way it provides its services.\n\nBusiness  and  support  units  are  constantly  improving  and  implementing  new  controls  to maintain their effectiveness and efficiency to mitigate risks and ensure the achievement of operational, compliance, and information objectives.\n\nFor risks that significantly expose the company and for which management decides on their mitigation,  action  or  remediation  plans  are  undertaken  and  executed  within  reasonable timeframes according to their complexity and scope.\n\nIn addition, the following measures were undertaken by the different risk management or control systems to improve the management, treatment, prevention, and control of risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Controls and validations on the quality and recording of operational risk loss events were reinforced.\n- \u00b7 Operational risk losses were included in the calculation of regulatory solvency.\n- \u00b7 New functionalities were implemented in the GRC application (application for governance, risk,  and control management) associated with the analysis of segregation rules and IPE (information processed by the entity).\n- \u00b7 Improvements were made to the operational risk assessment methods.\n- \u00b7 Third-party  risk  management  processes  were  strengthened,  integrating  different  risk programs to have a comprehensive view of them.\n- \u00b7 A  structured  risk  analysis  process  was  implemented  for  product  modifications  or  new product  launches,  seeking  better  assurance  and  supervision  of  second-line  and  support functions.\n- \u00b7 The behavioral risk analysis associated with the products offered was implemented.\n- \u00b7 A  workflow  was  implemented  to  ensure  the  follow-up  and  observation  of  validation milestones against model risk.\n- \u00b7 A new tool was implemented to manage the EUC (End User Computing) inventory, and the risk-based criticality assessment was improved.",

Information and communication\n\nGrupo Bancolombia ensures that clear and timely information is available to its employees and other stakeholders. Therefore, information administration and management policies are part  of  the  training  programs  that  all  employees  must  complete.  These  guidelines  and definitions are aligned with the ICS and are constantly being improved.\n\nLikewise, Grupo Bancolombia relies on the Information Security Management System (ISMS), which  contains  cybersecurity  and  information  security  policies  based  on  international reference  frameworks.    In  turn,  Grupo  Bancolombia  has  a  cybersecurity  strategy  that  is implemented through programs that include, among others, the design, implementation, dissemination,  education,  awareness,  and  maintenance  of  controls  and  mechanisms  to manage cyber and information security risk.\n\nThe main purpose of the strategy and the ISMS is to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and  data  availability  of  customers,  employees,  shareholders,  other  stakeholders,  and strategic  or  business  information.  It  also  seeks  to  have  a  controlled  environment  in interactions with allies and related third parties.\n\nIn  addition,  the  company  has  an  appropriate  control  environment  for  its  processes  and applications to ensure that the information managed, stored, or processed complies with security,  integrity,  confidentiality,  availability,  quality,  and  backup  criteria.  Grupo Bancolombia  manages  its  platforms,  applications,  and  the  information  handled  therein according  to  Control  Objectives  for  Information  and  Related  Technologies  (COBIT) standards.\n\nGrupo Bancolombia continues to consolidate the methodology for identifying and classifying the  use  of  information  assets,  including  those  shared  with  suppliers,  to  implement protection mechanisms according to their level of criticality.\n\nAs  a  good  practice,  the  company  performs  an  internal  security  assessment  to  identify opportunities  for  improvement  and  strengthen  the  implementation  of  processes  and frameworks to prevent information leakage, adequate corporate strategy, process evolution, controls and technologies for the protection of information assets, as well as the incident and threat management with international standards.",

To meet the new challenges, in 2023, the Corporate Risk Vice Presidency developed initiatives and/or projects to leverage the organization's strategy, among which the following stand out:\n\n- \u00b7 Consolidation of teams that have a cross-functional role in managing the risks to which Grupo Bancolombia is exposed, including the Corporate Non-Financial Risks Management and  the  Integral  Risk  Management  Directorate.    The  Corporate  Non-Financial  Risks Management Directorate served as the team responsible for evolving the management of non-financial  risks,  with  a  priority  on  ESG  risks  and  establishing  their  policies,  models, frameworks,  and  measurement  indicators.    Additionally,  the  Integral  Risk  Management Directorate advanced in implementing maturity models for different risks, structuring a new methodology for risk mapping, updating appetite limits, and managing capital and analytics as fundamental pillars for the consolidation and advancement of risk management.\n- \u00b7 The update of the Risk Manual in accordance with the External Circular 018 of 2021 issued by  the  Colombian  Financial  Superintendency  regarding  the  Comprehensive  Risk Management System (SIAR), which entered into force on June 01, 2023.\n- \u00b7 Compliance with the instructions contained in numeral 10 of Part II of Chapter XXXI of the SIAR, related to the aggregation of risk data and reporting, and the implementation plan for the management of Interest Rate Risk in the Bank Book (IRRBB), considering the testing period and the effective date of the applicable instructions.\n- \u00b7 During 2023, they worked on hardening the internal control function from the Directorate of Non-Financial Risk so that Grupo Bancolombia can adequately face the challenges that arise in the development of the different operations.  To achieve this, the Corporate Risk Vice Presidency developed an Internal Control Policy, aligned with the COSO model, defined measurement indicators, and deployed a sensitization and communication strategy, leading the Company to a higher level of maturity in the culture of internal control management.\n- \u00b7 For the end of 2023, a working framework was developed for the management of ESG risks; first  evaluations  on  climate  change,  physical,  and  transition  risks  were  made;  and  the objective physical risk model was constructed to advance towards the implementation of mass evaluations.",

Additionally, emphasis was placed on the importance of the control environment and how each employee, within their role, can contribute to its compliance.\n\nFollowing the Movimiento B program, we implemented strategies to strengthen our leaders' and  employees'  soft  skills,  prioritizing  empowerment  as  a  feature  of  the  culture  to  be developed in the Vice Presidency and strengthening the knowledge and analytical skills of the teams, among others. The above is aligned with the strategy's fundamental pillars and the objectives of developing human talent with skills for today and the future.\n\nIn the Corporate Risk Vice Presidency, we have highly qualified human talent to manage, integrally and adequately, the different risks to which the organization is exposed. Following the human talent development objectives, we met the training plan defined in accordance with  the  knowledge  maps.  In  2023,  the  compliance  percentage  of  the  Vice  Presidency mandatory plan was 99.45%.\n\nRegarding the corporate governance model, it is worth mentioning that this model grants the  Corporate  Vice  President  of  Risks  direct  authority  over  risk  management,  ensuring through  the  risk  framework  the  independence  among  the  areas  involved  in  their management, the existence of committees, and the hierarchical structure.\n\nOn  the  other  side,  the  Board  of  Directors  knew  and  approved  the  resources  quoted  in External  Circular  018  of  2021  of  the  Colombian  Financial  Superintendency  and  the government  structure  associated  with  risk  management.  To  comply  with  its  monitoring functions,  the  Board  had  the  support  of  the  Risk  Committee,  as  the  entity  in  charge  of accompanying it in the approval, tracking,  and control  of  policies,  methodologies,  tools, guidelines, and strategies for the identification, measurement, control, and risk mitigation, with the periodicity established in the standard.",

As  a  consequence, important deteriorations in portfolios were observed, especially in natural person portfolios, consumption,  and  mortgage  ones.    This  triggered  early  interventions  in  the  origination, follow-up, and collection policies of the most impaired portfolios, intending to improve the risk profiles of new businesses, resulting in a decrease in disbursements.\n\nIn this sense, we maintained proactive credit risk management during 2023 by monitoring and accompanying customers and portfolios, evaluating conditions and particular requests of each one of them, as well as developing methodologies, tools, and models that optimize debt collection.\n\nAmong the activities developed to continue optimizing the risk management of the entire credit cycle, we highlight the following:\n\n## Origination\n\nTaking into account the performance of the economy and in line with a more controlled risk appetite,  conservative  lending  policies  were  implemented,  primarily  in  natural  person portfolios. These policies are supported by enhanced predictive models with a tighter risk profile  of  customers  and  responsiveness,  reducing  reaction  times  to  changes  in  the environment.  In  addition,  improvements  in  the  physical  and  automatic  processes,  the implementation  of  new  controls,  and  the  generation  of  early  alerts  allowed  a  portfolio placement focused on more favorable profiles.\n\nAbout sectoral risk management, we unified the risk vision in the different economic sectors, managing to participate in the market with better strategies and using methodologies and tools to carry out more comprehensive management.\n\nWith  the  sectoral  components  of  credit  risk  management,  we  understood  cycles  and anticipated better decisions, managed and prevented current and potential portfolio risk, modeled future scenarios, and optimized risk models, including sectorial impact. For this purpose, we have ratings, policies, and sector diagnostic templates, which helped us to focus origination according to appetite.\n\n## Follow-up\n\nFor 2023, the monitoring stage was the central focus of the cycle. We concentrated on credit cycle strategies with early and integrated decisions at all stages, supported by predictive analytical models.",

Along with the countries, we successfully designed and planned the construction of data models for information from different stages of the credit cycle, aiming to  provide  the  required  information  to  models  and  tools  and  support  decision-making regarding the portfolio.\n\nBesides, we made progress in behavioral models, alerts, and early estimation of variables, which include not only traditional information but also alternative and sector information. Likewise, we have evolved the monitoring processes, making them more agile and timely for the portfolio, guarantees, covenants, and advances.\n\nPredictive  analytical  models  with  traditional  and  alternative  information  enable  us  to improve the quality of customer qualification and have a broader coverage of customers qualified  automatically,  avoiding  subjective  judgments  and  achieving  greater  agility  and timeliness in the process. This makes it possible to take early action, aligned with strategic decisions at all stages of the credit cycle.\n\nModels are monitored and updated periodically and are under permanent study for their continuous evolution and open to new relevant variables that improve their prediction and disaggregation into increasingly specialized segments.\n\nIn this sense, we have early warning models that allow us to identify possible deviations from the projection of portfolio composition and sectoral analyses to manage portfolios affected by macroeconomic variables and other situations. The aforementioned enables us to generate reports that alert us about the most affected economic sectors and allows us to evaluate the most representative companies in each of them.\n\nWe also  monitor  the  concentration  risk  in  the  loan  portfolio,  as  events  involving  one  or several of the largest economic groups could adversely and significantly affect the operating results and financial position of Grupo Bancolombia. The monitoring and management of this concentration is highly relevant and is carried out not only to comply with applicable regulations but also to achieve strategic management.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total outstanding amount of Grupo Bancolombia's 20 largest economic  groups,  on  a  consolidated  basis,  represented  13.4%  of  its  loan  portfolio.  No individual exposure represented more than 1.5% of said portfolio.\n\n## Recovery\n\nTo recognize the changes in the customer's risk situation in all segments and sections, we maintain  proactive  management  and  an  early  collection  for  the  portfolio  in  line  with macroeconomic changes.",

In  addition,  through experimentation,  we  have  developed  new  recovery  schemes  that  focus  on  customer rebanking, initially in Colombia.\n\nWe evolved our collection model through an online channel, generating easy contact and adjusting announcements and guidelines for offering payment options. The purpose of this is to generate greater closeness with our customers through simplicity, active listening, and accompaniment. As a consequence of those strategies, through online collection channels, we have reached around 960,000 potential customers and achieved an updating of contact data for 380,000 customers in Colombia.  Similarly, we offered pre-approved alternatives in Panama for close to 30,000 customers.\n\nIn addition, within the estimates of the portfolio provisions, the value of the collateral is considered as backing for the operations and its mitigation, considering that its physical and market characteristics  are  reflected  in  a  fair  value.

This decrease is mainly attributed to the appreciation of the Colombian peso against  the  American  dollar  during  the  analysis period, which impacted the re-expression in COP of Grupo's foreign currency portfolio and the contraction in consumer and microcredit modalities primarily for Bancolombia. Additionally, the reduction  in  the  commercial  portfolio  of  Banco Agr\u00edcola, Banistmo, and Bam was added to the above, mainly derived from the global economic slowdown.\n\nThe consolidated 30-day ICV defaulting index showed an  increase,  reaching  5.39%  for  December  2023, compared to 3.55% recorded in the same month of the  year  2022.

This change was due to currency effects, given the  revaluation  of  the  Colombian  peso  against  the  American  dollar,  accompanied  by  a decrease in the portfolio in its original currency (USD) in the commercial category and a slight growth in the consumer and housing categories.\n\nThe 30-day overdue portfolio indicator stood at 8.5% at year-end 2023, compared to 3.9% in 2022. Total overdue portfolio coverage ended at 60.4% compared to the 137.8% reported in the previous year. The impact on these indicators was primarily due to the deterioration of a significant customer in the real estate sector, which has the backing of real estate collateral that reduces the provision value. Additionally, it was due to the deterioration of the housing portfolio caused by the termination of reduced payment agreements and the normalization of mortgage  payments,  particularly  among  long-standing  customers  affected  by macroeconomic impacts such as unemployment and inflation.\n\nThe strategies used for proactive management that fulfill the customers' needs were the following: implementation of origination strategies focused on better risk profiles for natural persons,  customer  knowledge  using  both  internal  and  external  information,  and  the activation of new recovery processes.\n\nIn Bancoagricola ,  the  balance  of  the  portfolio  in  Colombian  pesos  ended  2023  with  a decrease of 18.97%, mainly explained by the effect of  COP revaluation against the American dollar  and the  decrease  in  the  commercial  and  housing  portfolios, which,  compared  to a moderate growth in the consumer portfolio in its original currency (USD), was not sufficient to counteract this effect. The positive dynamic on the consumption portfolio was due to an expansion strategy on natural person customers with better risk profiles.\n\nThe 30-day overdue portfolio indicator for the end of the year was placed at 2.5% against 2.2% for 2022. For companies, the explanation is  the deterioration of specific customers belonging  to  the  textile  sector.  For  natural  persons  and  SMEs,  origination  strategies implemented were highlighted. Regarding coverage, it closed at 146.6% in December 2023, compared to 178.7% in the same period of the previous year.\n\nFor its part, Bam experienced a decrease of 18.73% in the portfolio in Colombian pesos at the end of 2023 compared to the quantity of 2022. This decrease was due to the previously mentioned Colombian peso revaluation against the American dollar and a moderate growth in the consumer and housing portfolios.  The better dynamism observed in natural person banking is highlighted as a response to growth strategies in this segment.\n\nThe 30-day overdue portfolio indicator was 3.6% against 2.8% of the year-end 2022, driven by  the  growth  of  past-due  balances  in  the  natural  person  portfolio,  specifically  in consumption products.

Coverage of the 30-day overdue portfolio ended at 145.6% in December 2023, compared to 160.7% in December 2022.\n\nIn Bancolombia Panam\u00e1 ,  the  portfolio balance in Colombian pesos showed a decrease of 25.17% compared to the previous year due to partial and total payments from corporate clients and the impact of the Colombian peso's appreciation against the American dollar during the period under review. The 30-day overdue portfolio indicator stood at 0.22% at the end of 2023, compared to 0.02% in 2022, explained by the deterioration of customers in Colombia, who were affected by the country's macroeconomic effects.\n\nRegarding Bancolombia Puerto Rico , the portfolio balance in Colombian pesos experienced a  decrease  of  8.22%  compared  to  the  previous  year,  explained  by  the  revaluation  of  the Colombian  peso  against  the  American  dollar,  contrasting  with  a  15.5%  growth  in  the portfolio in its original currency (USD). This is due to the expansion strategy implemented during the year. The overdue portfolio closed at 0.15% in December 2023, compared to 3.91% in December 2022, an improvement mainly explained by the sale of a significant customer portfolio in the agricultural sector and the write-off of a customer in the commercial sector.\n\n## COUNTRY RISK\n\nDuring 2023, the Country Risk management framework was implemented for the financial companies of Grupo Bancolombia, subject to the application of the SIAR. This risk refers to the possibility that an entity may incur losses due to financial operations abroad as a result of a deterioration in the economic and/or socio-political conditions of the country receiving these operations, either due to limitations on currency transfers or factors not attributable to the commercial and financial condition of the receiving country. This definition includes the sovereign risk (SR) and transfer risk (TR), among others.\n\nAt Grupo Bancolombia, we have guidelines, processes, and methodologies that allow us to periodically  assess  the  country  risk  to  which  the  Company  is  exposed  in  its  capital investments. Capital investments are understood as those made in jurisdictions other than Colombia, which have a high individual or aggregate economic materiality by country and are intended to be permanent.\n\nThe country risk management includes the risk identification, measurement, control, and monitoring stages to which the entity is exposed.  For such management, the business plan, the type of operations carried out, their materiality, their current and future vocation, and the characteristics of the country receiving the investment are also considered. Equally, the management is supported by methodologies and processes that are used in country risk management and are developed by the Vice Presidency of Risks and approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  definition  of  capital  investment  appetite  considers  the  country  risk  assessment  as defined in the SIAR, and aims to ensure compliance with solvency and liquidity indicators, in line with the strength and financial health of the Bank.\n\nFor  2023,  there  were  no  alerts  in  any  investment,  nor  were  adjustments  made  for deteriorating investments that could affect or impair the Bank's financial strength.",

It also refers to the probability of unexpected changes in net interest income and economic equity value as a result of a change in market interest rates.\n\nIn  Grupo  Bancolombia,  market  risks  are  identified,  measured,  monitored,  controlled  and communicated with the purpose of adopting timely decisions for the adequate mitigation of these, and to generate greater added value for shareholders. The guidelines, policies and methodologies for market risk management are approved by the Board of Directors, thus ensuring consistency and unity in the risk appetite among the different entities of Grupo Bancolombia.\n\n## Grupo Bancolombia\n\n## a. Instruments for trading purposes\n\nInstruments  for  trading  purposes  in  Grupo  Bancolombia  include  fixed  income,  variable  income, foreign currency and derivative products, whose management is aimed to maintain an investment portfolio to support liquidity and meet the needs of our customers, while maintaining a controlled risk profile.\n\nThe relevant risk factors for instruments held for trading purposes are interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and share price risk.\n\n- \u00b7 Interest rate risk arises from unexpected changes in interest rates that may adversely affect the value of a financial instrument. It mainly affects debt securities and derivatives.\n- \u00b7 Exchange rate risk refers to changes in the exchange rate of one currency against another and affects foreign currency positions. A long position in a foreign currency other than the local currency may result in losses if that currency depreciates against the local currency.\n- \u00b7 Finally, equity price risk arises from adverse movements in market prices or expectations of future  dividends  that  affect  positions  in  shares,  equity  indices  or  derivatives  with  equity underlyings.\n\nAll these market risks can be partially or fully mitigated with derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps, relative value strategies and by taking non-directional positions.\n\nFor the management and control of market risks of trading activities in the Grupo Bancolombia, two Value at Risk methodologies are used: the standard methodology established by the SFC and the internal  methodology  by  weighted  historical  simulation.  These  methodologies  measure  the maximum  probable  loss  that  a  portfolio  could  have  over  a  time  horizon  and  with  a  level  of confidence.\n\nThe  internal  methodology  by  weighted  historical  simulation  uses  a  confidence  level  of  99%,  a holding period of 10 days and a time window of one year or 250 daily data, obtained historically from the VaR calculation reference date. The standard methodology established by Chapter XXXI of the  Basic  Accounting  and  Financial  Circular  (CBCF,  by  its  Spanish  acronym)  of  the  Financial Superintendence of Colombia (SFC, by its Spanish acronym) is based on the model recommended",

This methodology is used to report market risk exposure to the SFC and to measure the capital requirements of Grupo Bancolombia.\n\nIn addition, extreme scenario measurements or stress tests are performed to estimate potential losses that do not occur with a high frequency but are possible, replicating past crises or simulating hypothetical events. Likewise, Expected Shortfall estimates are also made to measure the expected value of potential loss greater than the level set by the VaR. Unlike VaR, Expected Shortfall has the advantage of capturing the risk of large losses with low probability (tail risk). Likewise, adjustment tests or back testing are carried out to determine how accurate the loss forecasts are in relation to reality. The results of these tests lead to adjustments to the VaR models, if necessary.\n\nTo manage and control the market risk of trading activities, Grupo Bancolombia has a hierarchical structure  of  VaR  limits  that  ensures  that  risk  is  not  concentrated  in  certain  asset  classes  and maximizes the diversification effect of portfolios. These limits are defined by company, product or risk-taking responsibilities. Loss alerts, stop losses and sensitivity limits are also managed, especially in derivative portfolios. The limits are approved by the Board of Directors, taking into account the size of the assets, the complexity and volatility of the markets, and the risk appetite. These are monitored daily, and their excesses or non-compliance are reported to the Board of Directors and the Risk Committee.\n\nIn 2023, market risk exposure measured with the SFC's standard methodology ranged between COP 815,373 million and COP 1,204,500 million, with an average exposure of COP 959,832 million. The total exposure, at the end of the year, registered an increase driven by the exchange rate factor that registered a greater exposure to the US dollar, followed by an increase in exposure to share prices and a decrease in exposure in collective portfolios. This effect was generated by the redistribution of  exposure  by  risk  factor  of  the  Colombia  Real  Estate  Fund,  after  a  detailed  analysis  of  the composition of its portfolio. It is important to highlight that this redistribution did not generate an impact on the total risk since the volatility of both factors is the same.\n\nMeanwhile, the interest rate risk factor presented an increase in its exposure, generated by a higher exposure in Colombian public debt securities in Bancolombia's book, partially offset by a lower exposure in foreign debt securities in all the Entities.\n\nThe total variation of market risk and its risk factors, under the standard methodology of the SFC, is shown below:\n\n| December 2023  In millions of Colombian pesos   | December 2023  In millions of Colombian pesos   | December 2023  In millions of Colombian pesos   | December 2023  In millions of Colombian pesos   | December 2023  In millions of Colombian pesos   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Factor                                          | End of the year                                 | Average                                         | Maximum                                         | Minimum                                         |\n| Interest Rate                                   | 405,467                                         | 418,472                                         | 542,464                                         | 383,914                                         |\n| Exchange Rate                                   | 332,662                                         | 185,624                                         | 374,407                                         | 51,410                                          |\n| Share Price                                     | 342,024                                         | 332,443                                         | 347,539                                         | 312,136                                         |",

Instruments for purposes other than trading\n\nGrupo Bancolombia maintains non-trading instruments such as loans, time deposits, checking and savings accounts, which are recorded in the Banking Book. The market risk management of the Banking Book is focused on increasing the economic value of equity, contributing to the generation of recurring profits with a controlled risk profile.\n\nThe  relevant  risk  factor  of  the  Banking  Book  positions  is  interest  rate  risk,  understood  as  the probability of unexpected changes in net interest income as a result of a change in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect the Bank's income due to differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities.\n\nAnother risk factor affecting the banking book positions is the equity price risk of the investments held  by  Investment  Banking,  as  a  Financial  Corporation,  directly  and  through  its  affiliated companies, in structural equity investments. Exchange rate exposures that arise in the Banking Book are transferred to the Treasury Book.\n\nFor the management and control of market risks of activities other than trading activities, Grupo Bancolombia  has  a  comprehensive  approach,  consisting  of  a  short-term  view,  measuring  the sensitivity of the net interest margin over a one-year horizon, and a long-term vision, estimating the impact on the economic value of equity through different scenarios. Levels of alerts are also defined to  monitor  and  control  the  interest  rate  risk  of  the  positions  in  the  Banking  Book,  which  are periodically reported to Senior Management.\n\nMarket risk management of positions in the Banking Book is carried out in a decentralized and independent manner in each of the Grupo Bancolombia's banking entities. This management is carried out by the Asset and Liability Management areas, of the Financial Vice-Presidency, through derivative instruments such as exchange rate and interest rate swaps, mainly.\n\nIn general, Grupo Bancolombia has a positive sensitivity to increases in interest rates for the total financial margin.  In relation to the sensitivity of the economic value (Market Value of Equity, MVE), the general positioning of the balance sheet was such that the average duration of the assets was slightly lower than that of the liabilities.\n\nDuring 2023, a decrease in the sensitivity of the net interest margin of - COP 7,287 was observed due to the reduction in the sensitivity in dollars as a result of the decrease in the fixed-rate portfolio and the increase in fixed-term certificates of deposit (CD). Likewise, the duration mismatch in the Grupo Bancolombia's balance sheet did not present significant changes.",

A negative sensitivity  denotes  a  greater  sensitivity  of  liabilities  than  assets  and  implies  that  an  increase  in interest rates will negatively affect the net interest margin. In case of a decrease in interest rates, the behavior of the net interest margin would be the opposite of that described above.\n\nTo calculate the sensitivity of the net interest margin based on the term at repricing, the following assumptions were taken into account: (a) only the contractual conditions of the current transactions were considered, (b) the sensitivity of the balance sheet at a fixed rate was based on amounts that mature in a period of less than one year under the assumption that these will be placed again at market rates; and (c) changes in the interest rate were presented immediately and in parallel in the asset and liability yield curves.\n\nThe price risk sensitivity of the structural shares is presented below:\n\nThe market value of these positions presented a negative variation of 27.4%, going from COP 56,607 at the end of 2022, to COP 41,096 at the end of 2023, mainly as a consequence of the devaluation of the shares of the company ENKA.\n\nWhen considering a negative impact of 14.70% on the value of structural actions as of December 2023, a devaluation of COP 6,041 occurred.\n\n|             | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Amount      | 41,096              | 56,607              |\n| Delta       | 14.70%              | 14.70%              |\n| Sensitivity | 6,041               | 8,321               |",

A  negative  sensitivity denotes a greater sensitivity of the liability and therefore a negative impact on the net interest margin. In the case of an interest rate fall, the behavior of the net interest margin would be opposite to that mentioned.\n\nThe sensitivity of the  net  interest margin on  legal  currency  positions  given  positive  and  parallel variations in interest rates of 100 basis points was COP 564,719. The variation in the sensitivity of the net interest margin between December 2022 and December 2023 occurred due to the increase in the balance of the variable rate portfolio, compensated by the increase in the balance of the CDs.\n\nLikewise, the sensitivity of the net interest margin for positions in foreign currency was USD -7,124 at 100 basis points. The change in this sensitivity compared to December 2022 corresponded to the decrease  in  the  active  portfolio  and  the  increase  in  the  balance  of  the  rate-sensitive  liability portfolio.\n\n## Assumptions and limitations\n\nTo calculate the sensitivity of the net interest margin, from the term to the reprice, the following assumptions were taken into account: (a) only the contractual conditions of the current operations are considered, (b) the sensitivity of the balance at a fixed rate considers amounts that mature in a period of less than one year under the assumption that these will be placed again at market rates; and (c)  changes  in  the  interest  rate  are  presented  immediately  and  in  parallel  in  the  asset  and liability yield curves.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk  is  understood as the inability to fully and timely meet payment obligations on the corresponding  dates  due  to  insufficient  liquid  resources  and/or  the  need  to  assume  excessive funding costs. Situations such as a downgrade in the credit ratings of the Bank and its subsidiaries would increase the cost of funds and hinder its ability to attract deposits or roll over maturing debt.\n\nFor  Grupo  Bancolombia,  liquidity  prevails  over  any  growth  and  profitability  objective.  Liquidity management, along with capital management, have always been a fundamental pillar of its business strategy to support the strength of the balance sheet. Grupo Bancolombia's liquidity management model  promotes  the  autonomy  of  subsidiaries,  which  must  be  self-sufficient  in  their  financing structure. Each subsidiary is responsible for meeting the liquidity needs of its current and future activities, within a management coordination framework at the Grupo level. The metrics used to control liquidity risk are developed around common and homogeneous concepts, but the analysis and adaptation is performed by each subsidiary.\n\nMeasures to control liquidity risk include the maintenance of an investment portfolio to ensure a liquidity reserve and the definition of early warnings and liquidity limits to proactively assess the Grupo's exposure level.\n\nThe methodologies used to control liquidity risk include liquidity gaps and stress scenarios. Liquidity gaps measure cash flow mismatches of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions, separately",

Regulators' models are applied, in which contractual maturities and internal models are used, in which cash flows are adjusted through the implementation of different indicators, in order to reflect a more realistic behavior of cash flows.\n\nStructural liquidity is also measured by monitoring the available stable funding and its coverage against  the  required  stable  funding.  For  this  purpose,  we  use  the  regulatory  models  and  the standards established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision regarding the NSFR, adjusting it according to the stability characteristics of our deposits.\n\nThe policies, limits, processes, methodologies and tools for the evaluation of liquidity risk exposure are  periodically  validated  to  establish  their  relevance  and  functionality,  and  to  adjust  them  as necessary. The market and liquidity risk areas prepare daily, weekly and monthly reports for Senior Management, with the purpose of monitoring the evolution of the levels of exposure to liquidity risk, the established limits and alerts, and support the decision-making process.\n\n## Liquidity risk exposure\n\nIn 2023, a comfortable liquidity position was maintained in Grupo Bancolombia with 30-day liquidity coverage at the end of December of 259.07% in legal currency, and 866.37% in foreign currency. By the end of the year, the liquid assets in legal currency of Grupo Bancolombia amounted to COP 26.8 billion, and in foreign currency to USD 6,226 million.\n\nTo estimate liquidity risk, a liquidity coverage ratio is calculated to ensure that liquid assets held are sufficient  to  cover  potential  net  cash  outflows  within  30  days.

The regulatory indicators, such as the Liquidity Risk Index (LRI), the Individual and Consolidated Short-Term Exposure Index (IECPI-IECPC, by its Spanish acronym) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), presented results  that  showed comfortable liquidity levels for compliance with internal and regulatory limits.\n\nLiquidity simulations were performed under different scenarios to guarantee comfortable liquidity levels, consistent with the dynamic growth of the portfolio and 100% compliance with the NSFR. Liquidity levels remained stable due to the lower dynamism in portfolio disbursements.\n\n## Short-term liquidity risk exposure\n\nTo estimate short-term liquidity risk, a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is calculated, corresponding to the ratio between liquid assets and its net liquidity requirements for a 30-calendar day period. This indicator shows the liquidity coverage for the next month.\n\nThe net liquidity requirement is calculated based on the flow of contractual maturities of assets and the  flow  of  contractual  and  non-contractual  maturities  of  liabilities,  as  defined  in  current regulations.\n\nThe liquidity coverage result for the Bank is presented below:\n\n| Liquidity coverage ratio     | December 31, 2023  In millions of Colombian pesos   | December 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| 30-day liquidity requirement | 10,179,043                                          | 13,950,866          |\n| Liquid assets                | 28,612,973                                          | 25,508,367          |\n| Liquidity ratio              | 281.10%                                             | 182.80%             |\n\nThe liquidity indicator stood at 281.10% at the end of December 2023, which represents an increase of 98%, due to the increase in the level of Liquid Assets, the growth in deposit accounts and the reduction in the 30-day liquidity requirement due to the higher projection of income flows from liquidity operations.\n\nThe following table shows the Bank's liquid assets:\n\n| Liquid assets (1)       | December 31, 2023              | December 31, 2022              |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                         | In millions of Colombian pesos | In millions of Colombian pesos |\n| Highly liquid assets    |                                |                                |\n| Available               | 12,314,552                     | 12,688,194                     |\n| High-quality securities | 14,197,252                     | 12,388,168                     |\n| Other liquid assets     |                                |                                |\n| Other securities        | 2,101,169                      | 432,005                        |\n| Total liquid assets     | 28,612,973                     | 25,508,367                     |",

This is mainly due  to  technological  failures  in  production  outputs  in  different  products  and  channels,  which generated losses due to erroneous balances in favor of customers that could not be recovered. In addition, it was caused by the provision of a first instance court order issued by the Departmental Comptroller's Office of Cundinamarca against Bancolombia, derived from an alleged fiscal detriment in disbursements under the financial leasing modality in the construction of a water treatment plant in the Municipality of Ch\u00eda, which if confirmed would materialize an operating loss for the entity. It was also due to the increase in external fraud events, as a result of the intensive use of social engineering techniques by criminals.\n\nIt should be noted that exposure to cybersecurity risk has remained at adequate levels, thanks to the measures we have adopted in terms of controls, monitoring and mitigation, to address the threats in the environment.\n\nConsolidated Operating Risk Status",

        "page_content": "## a. Economic and industry environment and supply chain disruption\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, one of the main risks is related to the higher-than-usual volatility in the prices of the main financial assets. During the last quarter of 2023, there was a strong reversal in the dynamics of capital flows to emerging economies.\n\nThe year 2023 ended in the midst of a trend of appreciation of riskier financial assets, given the incorporation  of  the  expectation  of  the  beginning  of  the  process  of  interest  rate  cuts  by  the monetary authority in the United States during the first half of 2024. This dynamic, completely opposite  to  the  one  that  prevailed  during  most  of  the  third  quarter  of  last  year,  highlights  the reactivity and volatility that continues to be present in the markets and that may continue to be a characteristic of international macro-financial behavior in 2024.\n\nThe  weakening  phase  of  the  global  cycle  is  usually  accompanied  by  exacerbated  volatility, compounded by the pressures produced by geopolitical tensions and military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. These situations can affect investor confidence and the prices of the main raw materials, particularly oil.\n\nHowever, during the latter part of 2023, the evolution of the global economy and markets was not significantly affected by these geopolitical elements, insofar as events did not differ substantially from what was foreseeable. However, the persistence of conflicts implies an inherent potential risk, since the escalation of the confrontation in the Middle East could lead to the involvement of other countries and affect the functioning of logistics chains or raw material markets.\n\nAt the level of the countries where Bancolombia has a significant presence, during the last quarter of 2023, there were events that could soon result in the materialization of some adverse risks.\n\nIn Colombia, 2024's outlook for public finances deteriorated in light of the court order that struck down the non-deductibility of bonuses from the mining sector in corporate income tax. This fact, together with the highly uncertain revenues expected by the Government (due to judicial litigation and the efficiency of the Directorate of National Taxes and Customs - DIAN tax administration), has led to the consideration of the need for a new tax reform, and the Autonomous Committee of the Fiscal Rule has issued publications highlighting the risk of non-compliance with the fiscal rule in 2024.\n\nThus, the potential tax reform would add to a busy first half of the year, in terms of the passage of major reforms through Congress. On this front, during the last part of 2023, the health system reform was approved in the second debate. Meanwhile, the labor and pension reforms did not make significant progress and the context has become challenging for the government to achieve their passage without making significant concessions on the proposed elements. Thus, the likelihood of a profound economic impact from the approval of these reforms in their original versions has been reduced.\n\nLikewise, in Guatemala, the main macroeconomic risk arises from the uncertainty as to whether the President will be able to remain in power for the entire period of government, due to errors in the constitution of the political party of which he is a member. Decisions contrary to the President could trigger large-scale social mobilizations that could have a profound impact on the functioning of the country's economy during the first part of 2024, implying a greater risk.",

        "page_content": "Meanwhile, Panama is mainly facing the risk of a sudden stoppage of the operation of the Cobre Panama mine, due to disputes over the contract between the government and the management company. This will have a strong impact on the country's external balance, as copper is the main export commodity, and on fiscal revenues, in a context of a cut in Panama's risk rating by some agencies, due to doubts about the expected fiscal management for the coming years. In addition, the effects of the \"El Ni\u00f1o\" climate phenomenon will continue to be relevant for the operation of the  Panama  Canal  during  the  first  half  of  2024,  after  a  second  half  of  2023  in  which  it  began operating with some restrictions.\n\nFinally, no new events of relevance to the macroeconomic situation have materialized in El Salvador. The country continues to face the challenge of not being able to access the international financial market as a source of resources. Likewise, the relationship with the International Monetary Fund continues to be not very fluid. The great challenge for the short and medium term will continue to be fiscal management, while the outlook for 2024 will be determined by the presidential elections in which Nayib Bukele was reelected.\n\nThus, considering the different macroeconomic scenarios in the models for calculating provisions, Grupo Bancolombia maintains its active management of credit risk and performs a constant analysis and sectorial  monitoring  of  the  identification  of  potentially  affected  customers.  This  is  done  by periodically  reviewing,  in  the  different  forums,  the  evolution  of  the  individual  situation  of  the customers, and granting alternatives that allow accompanying them in the development of their businesses and the management of the aforementioned context.\n\n## b. Cyber and Information Security\n\nGrupo Bancolombia is based on the pillars of information security, confidentiality, integrity and availability,  seeking  to  ensure  their  applicability  through  the  three-line  model,  which  includes  a synchronized process for managing operational, technological and cybersecurity risks.\n\nThe management of these risks includes, among others, the analysis of those situations potentially related  to  the  technological  infrastructure,  the  access  or  use  of  technology  that  affects  the development of business processes or the entity's risk management, and the assessment of the impact generated for the Organization by adverse events on the security attributes of information assets in cyberspace.\n\nIn 2023, we made progress in securing and improving the control environment for all elements of the  business  that  support technology,  cybersecurity,  business operations,  and supplier,  risk  and audit management.\n\n## c. Model Risk\n\nAnalytical models are tools that help Grupo Bancolombia manage financial risks and other processes in an objective, automated and efficient manner. However, these models may also fail or not reflect reality, which is known as model risk.\n\nModel risk arises when the analytical models used to measure, value or manage financial risks are not appropriate, accurate or reliable. This risk may adversely affect the Bank, causing economic losses, reputational damage or non-compliance with internal or external limits.",

In order to control the risk of using analytical models, it has a model risk management framework that covers the identification, classification, development, independent validation, approval, performance monitoring and auditing of models. This framework is aligned with regulatory and supervisory requirements.\n\nIn addition, Grupo Bancolombia has an independent risk management model validation area, which is  responsible  for  verifying  the  design,  implementation,  operation  and  updating  of  the  models, following minimum development standards and best practices. This team applies consistent and rigorous  criteria  and  methodologies  to  verify  the  models.  The  results  and  conclusions  of  these activities are reported periodically to the Technical Risk Committee.\n\nFinally, we recognize that models have limitations, uncertainties and assumptions, and may have errors or biases. Therefore, we evaluate the impacts of using them in different processes, and action plans are established to mitigate this risk.\n\n## d. ESG Risk\n\nDuring 2023, Grupo Bancolombia strengthened its commitment to ESG risks and climate change, making  progress  in  their  management.  Through  the  issuance  of  the  ESG  Risk  Circular,  the management of these risks was standardized at the corporate level and guidelines and criteria were established  for  the  identification,  evaluation  and  management  of  environmental,  social  and governance risks associated with Grupo Bancolombia's operations and activities.\n\nThe ESG Risk Circular consists of three main chapters:\n\n- 1. Environmental and Social Risk Analysis - ESRA.\n- 2. Controversial Issues in Business.\n- 3. Industries susceptible to Climate Change.\n\nIn  a  complementary  manner  and  within  this  management,  Grupo  Bancolombia  designed  a management framework for environmental risks, including climate risks  (A),  social  risks (S)  and governance risks (G). Each of these frameworks establishes a governance scheme leveraged on a structure that accompanies the organization's strategy and sustainability purpose.\n\nThis  strategy  frames  risk  management  in  financing,  through  the  Environmental  and  Social  Risk Analysis  (ESRA)  and  studies  for  the  identification,  prioritization  and  attention  to  Physical  and Transition Risks associated with Climate Change, both in financing and fixed assets. We also take into account the risks associated with the supply chain and third-party risks, as well as those related to guarantees and dations in payment.\n\nIn  line  with  the  Grupo  Bancolombia's  commitment  to  climate  change,  we  manage  physical  and transition risks through the identification and prioritization of economic sectors that generate high levels of greenhouse gases, seeking to accompany clients in their transition to renewable energies.",

This  model  facilitates  large-scale assessments for our clients, thus enabling the definition of mitigation and adaptation strategies for a larger number of clients and increasing the coverage of the analyses performed.\n\nRegarding transition risk management, we initiated a process to improve the existing methodology in  Grupo  Bancolombia.  The  objective  is  to  obtain  results  comparable  to  those  obtained  in  the physical risk assessment model.\n\nIn order to manage the physical risk of the Grupo Bancolombia's facilities, we analyzed the different climatic vulnerabilities according to their geographic location and, in this way, we implemented strategies that preserve the operational continuity of processes, products and channels.\n\nIn addition to the declared management, we periodically monitored the following risk categories present in the aforementioned management frameworks. This follow-up allows us to measure the impact at the business level and develop prevention mechanisms to minimize it, through training, process improvement, monitoring and verification of procedures with clients and operations that guarantee the adequate execution and application of our internal policies.\n\nThese risk categories are:\n\nBusiness Conduct Codes: relationship or linkage of employees or third parties with any corruption scandal, bribery or anti-competitive practices.\n\nSustainable  Finance :  income  foregone  as  a  result  of  a  decrease  in  loan  placement  due  to  the migration of potential clients  to  other  financial  institutions  that  have  a more attractive offer or strategy in ESG terms.\n\nDecarbonization and Climate Strategy: impacts on the operation, portfolio and portfolio due to events that favor climate change.\n\nIndustries  critical  to  climate  change :  during  2023,  we  developed  a  dashboard  to  monitor  the portfolio of GHG-intensive industries declared in the ESG Risk Circular.\n\nHuman  capital  development  and  talent  retention  and  attraction: inefficiencies  in  human management practices and policies related to hiring, performance evaluation, incentives, etc. of employees.\n\nFinancial Inclusion: income foregone due to the non-placement of products for citizens who are not yet banked.",

Internal and External Fraud\n\nThe financial sector is particularly susceptible to different types of fraud, since its activity involves the  execution  of  multiple  processes  aimed  at  ensuring  that  customers  and  users  can  carry  out monetary transactions.\n\nIn order to identify fraud risks, Grupo Bancolombia uses methodologies for the analysis of operating risk, which allow it to monitor the processes, products and channels through which services are provided to customers and users of each of the entities that make up the Organization.\n\nBy 2023, we evidenced an increase in external fraud cases associated with social engineering, which impacted  the  banking  ecosystem.  In  order  to  mitigate  the  occurrence  of  these  events,  we implemented controls and culture campaigns on the safe use of products and channels.\n\nThe Grupo Bancolombia's management of these risks involved establishing controls, closing gaps, monitoring  internal  processes  and  employee  behavior.  All  this  is  done  in  order  to  mitigate  the materialization of internal fraud. With regard to customers and users, we developed strategies for authentication, identity validation, transactional monitoring, culture and education on the secure use of the different products and channels, with which Grupo Bancolombia seeks to mitigate fraud in its different modalities.\n\n## f. AML/ATF and Corruption\n\nThe risks of money laundering, financing of terrorism and corruption refer to the possibility of loss or damage that the Organization may suffer due to its propensity to be used directly, or through its operations, as an instrument for criminal purposes or for the concealment of assets derived from illicit activities.\n\nGrupo Bancolombia, acting consistently with its purpose of promoting sustainable development for the well-being of all, is committed to the prevention and mitigation of AML/ATF risk and corruption. In this sense, the Organization is constantly working on the evolution of methodologies, models and tools for the identification, measurement, control and monitoring of these risks, in line with the Grupo Bancolombia's internal and external context.\n\nThe following are the main initiatives that we carried out in 2023, with the aim of ensuring an adequate management and control environment against AML/ATF risks and corruption:\n\n- \u00b7 Implementation of AML/ATF risk matrices for Bancolombia, Valores Bancolombia, Fiduciaria Bancolombia and Bancolombia Investment Banking.\n- \u00b7 Execution, maintenance or evolution of regulatory scores, including high-risk customers, suppliers, charges and SCOVIC; and adoption of other important scores, such as those of international jurisdictions, national jurisdictions, remittance companies and correspondent banks.",

This is done considering that cash continues to be a frequently used payment instrument by customers and users.\n\nIn addition, Grupo Bancolombia has been working on the process of identifying and updating the threats  and vulnerabilities  associated with  the  materialization  of  AML/ATF  and  corruption  risks. With this, we seek to implement controls that mitigate these risks from different fronts (customers, channels, products, employees and jurisdictions) and to carry out constant monitoring that allows us to recognize emerging risks.\n\n## Regulatory and legal uncertainty and political instability\n\nBoth in Colombia and in the jurisdictions in which the Bank operates, banking regulations, and/or their  interpretation  by  official  authorities,  have  a  material  effect  on  the  Bank's  business  and operations. Banking regulations can change frequently, which may have an adverse effect on the Bank's business.\n\nIn August 2022, Colombia transitioned to a new government with a political agenda that could affect the  financial  sector  and  impact  capital-intensive  industries.  In  addition,  the  increasing  trend  of raising  financial  consumer  protection  standards  by  regulatory  authorities  and  high  courts  could result in additional operating costs and reduced bank revenues.\n\nAlthough the Colombian government's flagship projects (health care, pension and labor reforms) continue to go through Congress, the main risks for the financial sector could derive from provisions adopted by other entities, as would be the case of a possible intervention in interest rates or fees. The foregoing could limit the ability of the Organization's activities to manage credit risks.\n\nIn  this  line,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  SFC  has  submitted  to  public consultation  the  regulation related to the implementation of the regime for the internal assessment process of capital adequacy and liquidity and regulations regarding stress tests.  The Bank could face a potential financial impact in the event of a misalignment between the regulations issued by the SFC and the Basel Committee on  Banking  Supervision  standards,  as  this  could  result  in  higher  capital  adequacy  and  liquidity requirements at the system level.\n\n## g. Operational resilience, business continuity and technology failures\n\nGiven the constant evolution of the Grupo Bancolombia's businesses, services and processes, and the objective of being aligned with the evolution of the market, the Organization is exposed to situations that may affect the provision of services to customers or users, whether due to failures in processes, technology or situations generated by suppliers.",

Based on these analyses, we design strategies to prevent or minimize the negative impact. As part of this approach, we identify the organization's critical processes to implement  contingency  measures,  business  continuity  and  disaster  recovery  plans  that  allow operations to continue and ensure that customers are not affected.\n\nDuring 2023, we designed new crisis protocols that guarantee business continuity in the face of adverse situations, for which more than 90% of the cases designed for this purpose were tested.\n\n## h. Third Party Risk\n\nDuring  2023,  Grupo  Bancolombia  guaranteed  third-party  risk  management,  based  on  the identification  of  those  critical  suppliers  for  the  Organization  that,  according  to  the  service  they provide, may generate a situation that may negatively impact the provision of services and/or the offering of products to its customers or users. We did this with the objective of generating mitigation plans.\n\nFor  the  analysis  of  these  third  parties,  we  have  integrated  multidisciplinary  teams,  made  up  of members from different areas of the organization such as sustainability, personal data protection, cybersecurity, talent and culture, business continuity, operating risk, among others. The objective is to understand the third party's management life cycle in its entirety and to guarantee that during the time of a contractual relationship with the third party, all events that may affect the Grupo Bancolombia entities are monitored and managed appropriately.\n\n## i. Human Resources Risk\n\nCreativity and innovation, change flexibility and adaptability are required attributes for business performance. Technological advances and digital positioning create challenges related to strategies and  business  models  for  product  development  and  service  delivery.  Specialized  knowledge  is required in areas related to data analytics, quantification and information security.\n\nTo evaluate the degree of exposure or possibilities of risk materialization, the Vice-Presidency of Human  Resources  has  defined  strategic  and  predictive  indicators  to  periodically  measure  and monitor key aspects in the strategic management of talent in the organization. Among these key aspects are: (i) Talent loyalty: employee turnover, attraction and development; (ii) Movimiento B and L\u00edder B: evolution and adoption of cultural traits and leaders' responsibilities; and (iii) Employee well-being: employees' perception of their harmony between personal, social and work life.\n\nAdditionally, indicators that reflect the management and identification of possible gaps in terms of talent risk are periodically considered, detailing employee turnover (discriminated by talent pool), performance appraisal, average salary per position level, learning curve, and seniority (reflecting job stability).\n\nIn order to respond to the challenges and trends of the current scenario, the Bank manages talent risk through the design of strategies that enable the culture and welfare that attracts, develops and retains  talent  to  achieve  the  expected  results,  seeking  to  ensure  a  profitable  and  sustainable operation over time.",

We  are convinced  that  an  adequate  management  of  talent  has  an  impact  on  the  development  of  new products and services and allows the organization to achieve competitive advantages. For more information on these strategies, please refer to the Chapter  \"Developing Culture and Talent for Competitiveness\".\n\n## j. Inadequate response to market changes\n\nGrupo  Bancolombia  operates  in  a  highly  competitive  environment  and  senior  management anticipates increased competition in the jurisdictions in which it operates.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this has been the intensification of mergers and acquisitions in the financial services sector, which has generated larger, better capitalized and more geographically diversified companies, which in turn are able to offer a wider range of financial products and services at more competitive prices.\n\nLikewise, the expansion of fintech and other digital native players may represent a competitive risk as some of them have outstanding technological capabilities that give them flexibility and speed for the  development  of  new  financial  and  non-financial  solutions.  Similarly,  unregulated  financial intermediaries (known as \"shadow banking system\"), which serve an unbanked or underbanked population group, should also be permanently monitored.\n\nThe ability of the different entities that make up Grupo Bancolombia to maintain their competitive position  depends  mainly  on  (i)  their  ability  to  meet  the  needs  of  new  customers  through  the development of new products and services, (ii) the ability to deepen their current customer base through cross-selling and offering more tailored services (iii) the ability to continue with the digital and technological transformation to support growth and (iv) the ability to attract and retain human talent with the skills and knowledge that enable the development of its strategy.  Failure to properly implement these focuses could negatively affect the business.\n\nFinally,  the  Organization's  efforts  to  offer  new  products  and  services  may  not  be  successful  if product  or  market  opportunities  develop  more  slowly  than  expected  or  if  the  profitability  of opportunities is affected by competitive pressures.\n\nIn order to respond to the challenges posed by a dynamic and challenging competitive environment, and to the imperative need to continue evolving its business model and technological capabilities, Grupo Bancolombia has set the following priorities within its strategy:\n\n- \u00b7 To evolve the Personas App into a Super App.\n- \u00b7 To evolve the Sucursal Virtual Personas and Sucursal Virtual Negocios.\n- \u00b7 To  increase  the  portfolio  of  functionalities  of  the  business  channels  in  the  Business Connections.\n- \u00b7 To evolve the content site and digital sales.\n- \u00b7 To evolve the Bancolombia A La Mano App.\n- \u00b7 To develop \"Hyperpersonalization\" as a way to deepen customer loyalty.\n- \u00b7 To  develop  the  Banking  as  a  Service  (BaaS)  business  model,  transforming  the  required transversal capabilities at the business, technology, experience, process and commercial levels.",

For this reason, we have developed policies, procedures and methodologies to make decisions based on the risk-return relationship of each of the operations carried out in our business development. Thus, our risk assessment is present from the definition of prices, through profitability measurements, to our employees' variable remuneration.\n\nOur management of allocated capital seeks to guarantee coverage of unexpected losses from the different types of risks to which the balance sheet is exposed, constantly monitoring and managing allocated capital in contrast with regulatory methodologies, for each Grupo Bancolombia entity.\n\nFrom a regulatory standpoint, Grupo Bancolombia calculates its capital requirements in accordance with Decree 2555 of 2010 and Chapter 13-16 of the Basic Accounting and Financial Circular, which is  aligned  with  the  Basel  III  standard  model.  During  2023,  Grupo  Bancolombia  maintained  basic solvency levels above 9.5%, higher than the regulatory minimum including buffers, which stands at 6%.\n\nThe capital  requirements  include  the  local  systemic  importance  buffer  that  Grupo  Bancolombia must comply with, corresponding to 1% of the risk-weighted assets, covered with the best quality capital (Basic Ordinary Equity or Tier 1). At the local level, Bancolombia is the most important entity in the financial system, according to the calculations made by the SFC; however, at the international level, we are not part of the list of entities with global systemic importance (G-SIB).\n\n## Environmental and Social Risk Analysis\n\nIn  Grupo Bancolombia we are committed to sustainability in our processes and products, so we adhere to the following agreements: the Equator Principles of the World Bank, the United Nations Environment  Programme  Finance  Initiative  (UNEP-FI),  the  Dow  Jones  Sustainability  Index,  the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), who integrates the standards defined by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and others that may be applicable. With the above, we seek to promote sustainable economic development and contribute, as a financial stakeholder, in the mitigation of the effects of climate change, promoting mitigation actions with support decisions in the financing of industries that are intensive in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nRegarding Environmental and Social Risk Analysis, Bancolombia manages its internal processes and policies  aligned  with  the  fourth  version  of  the  Equator  Principles  and  its  entire  application framework. These policies include the description of those activities that require Environmental and Social Risk Analysis, environmental risk studies for the receipt of guarantees, dations in payment",

This includes, among other aspects, the management and corporate governance model of the Environmental and Social Risk Analysis process, which applies the criteria of the fourth version of the Equator Principles. This Circular determines the criteria and standards that must be validated in each of the countries through local socio-environmental risk analysis circulars, adjusted to the dynamics and regulations of each region.\n\nLikewise, and in accordance with the provisions of the Circular, the controls required at each step of  the  process  are  currently  defined  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  teams  involved  carry  out  their corresponding activities in an orderly and timely manner.\n\nAs  part  of  the  analysis  process,  we  consolidated  the  tool  that  integrates  the  evaluation  of environmental and social risks transversally to the four banks that make up Grupo Bancolombia, which allows us to follow up and monitor each credit transaction, its result, risk level, economic sector, segment, among others. This tool is managed by corporate governance and applied by each subsidiary. With the application of the tool, we also seek to improve the efficiency of the process, reducing the time of risk analysis, with the objective of increasing the client base to be evaluated.\n\nTherefore,  we  maintain  risk  analyses  associated  with  climate  change  in  projects  that  have  the potential to generate significant greenhouse gas emissions and we inquire about the result of the calculation  of  their  annual  carbon  footprint.  Likewise,  we  consult  on  climate  mitigation  and adaptation measures and the compensation measures defined for their control.\n\n## ESRA to Project Finance\n\nStatistics on Project Finance and corporate loans linked to projects",

WELL-BEING FOR ALL\n\nThe well-being of all is the main objective we seek at Bancolombia when we work to promote sustainable development through three main fronts: strengthening the productive fabric of the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  building  sustainable  cities  and  communities,  and deepening financial inclusion.\n\nOur actions are not isolated: we are aligned with a global agenda that seeks to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals aim to promote well-being, protect the planet and improve the quality of life for all people.\n\nTo achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is critical for the financial sector to make a strong commitment. Recognizing the interconnectedness between these goals and how impacting one can affect the others; we have identified seven areas where we can have greater influence through our strategy:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| NO  POVERTY                        | Through our inclusion initiatives, we bring  financial services to  underprivileged sectors in order to generate financial well-being  and improve their quality of life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| QUALITY  EDUCATION                 | employees  and  the  community  in  general  to  make  better  financial decisions.

We have made progress in the formalization and structure of this  strategy,  integrating  the  Bancolombia  Diversa  project  (gender  identity  and  sexual  orientation)  under  the  same  focus,  and  updating the governance model. |\n| DECENT  WORK AND  ECONOMIC  GROWTH | We finance  SMEs  and  entrepreneurs  and  accompany  them  in  their  growth  so  that  their  productivity  and  employment  generation increase and have a positive impact on the economy.  We are committed to agriculture and rural areas with a value  proposition that boosts the growth of this economic sector.   We generate quality employment directly and indirectly through  our value chain.                             |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We allocated USD 1,227.9 million to strengthening the production network, USD 276.4 million to sustainable cities and communities, and USD 159.9 million to financial inclusion.\n\nIn Guatemala , through Bam, our ambition amounts to USD 8,176.6 million and in 2023 we surpassed the goal set for the year, with an accumulated USD 1,632.42 million in disbursements. We granted USD 1.160 million to strengthen the production network, USD 371 million to sustainable cities and communities, and USD 102 million to financial inclusion.\n\nIn El Salvador , Bancoagr\u00edcola's ambition is USD 18,126.6 million, and between 2021 and 2023 we have  mobilized  at  least  USD  5,033.1  million,  which  represents  an  advance  of  28%.  In  2023  we disbursed USD 1,344.15 million on the three fronts of the purpose, of which USD 806.35 million were aimed at strengthening the production network, USD 102.18 million for sustainable cities and communities, and USD 435.61 million for financial inclusion.\n\nDetails of our business ambitions aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals can be found here:",

An example of this is Colombia, where these companies account for around 80% of employment and 40% of GDP.\n\nUnderstanding this reality, at Grupo Bancolombia we have focused on approaching these companies so  that  they  can  access  solutions  that  allow  them  to  leverage  their  businesses,  with  a  value proposition that facilitates the management of their activities from the beginning to the end.\n\nWe evolved our customer service models by leveraging our physical and digital solutions. From our network of offices, they will be able to find solutions that allow them to increase their sales, such as QR and Wompi, the possibility of accessing the services they need in just one call, and an offer of banking solutions as a service, so that they can offer the financial services they require to their customers, such as the digital wallet and Compra y Paga despu\u00e9s (Buy and Pay Later).\n\nIn 2023 we granted more than COP 16,208,000 million to SMEs operating in Colombia through the loans they need for working capital and investment. Meanwhile, in Central America we provided credit support to more than 4,504 SMEs with disbursements of USD 477 million.\n\nWe also supported SMEs and companies in the financing of assets through Financial Leasing and Operating  Leasing  for  more  than  COP  2,048,000  million,  which  also  include  energy  renovation solutions and assets with energy efficiencies that contribute to the environment.\n\nIn a complex economic environment, we actively accompany SME clients and companies in good standing or with low levels of delinquency, with strategies to alleviate their cash flows to avoid a possible deterioration, with solutions for operations for more than COP 202,000 million.\n\nIn addition, we want to recognize SMEs that implement good practices in ESG issues, so we are bringing the benefits of sustainable financing closer to this segment through increased training to our commercial force, and by strengthening relationships with trades and chambers of commerce in the country.\n\nIn Guatemala, SMEs are also a priority. In the last year we disbursed more than USD 94 million in credit to this segment and, as part of these operations, we supported SMEs with female leadership with more than 220 credits representing USD 12.7 million disbursed.",

        "page_content": "As part of this, we created two new specialized and exclusive financing products to meet the needs of micro, small and medium-size companies in the commercial sector. With this initiative we have not only been able to deepen our current clients and attract new ones, but we have also achieved USD 1.12 million in placements and reduced the credit process by 33 days.\n\nMeanwhile, through Bancoagr\u00edcola in El Salvador, we supported SMEs, agroindustrial companies and  exporters  with  disbursements  of  more  than  USD  704.5  million,  which  have  been  key  to strengthening the country's production network.\n\nIn  addition,  we  exceeded  2  million independent customers  in  Colombia,  with  whom  we  have worked to understand their needs in a comprehensive manner in order to strengthen our offerings for them. In 2023, we supported them with more than COP 4,320,057 million in credits. Likewise, more  than  44,000  customers  have  savings  and  investment  products  such  as  CDs  and  virtual investments: 61% more than a year ago.\n\nAs an organization we worked with 24,793 suppliers, to whom we paid COP 7,300,000 million in 2023 with an average payment period of 15 days. With this we build society and contribute to the production  network  of  the  country.    In  addition,  we  have  supported  217  suppliers  with  the Integrated Supplier Risk Management Model, articulating Cybersecurity, Operational Risk, Personal Data Protection and SOX capabilities.\n\n## The Allies of Agriculture\n\nIn  order  to  continue  supporting  the  countryside  so  that  it  becomes  a  scenario  of  greater development opportunities for the country and its inhabitants, at Bancolombia we are expanding our offer to this sector, where we have more than 243,500 clients.\n\nIn 2023 we disbursed COP 10,500,000 million in loans for a wide range of sectors such as livestock, coffee,  poultry,  avocado,  rice,  flowers,  among many others.  This  represents  an  increase of 20% compared to 2022, where loans to small producers grew 54%. In this line, we remain Finagro's main underwriter, with a 30% share.\n\nThis has been possible thanks to a range of credit options that can be adapted in terms of amount, terms  and  frequency  of  payment,  including  its  own  credit  lines,  credits  with  Finagro  benefits, revolving quotas for short-term needs such as the purchase of inputs, payment of labor, among others, and even a specific credit card for this sector.  More recently, we implemented a pilot to provide free parametric agricultural insurance to 1,000 clients with credits already disbursed.\n\nLast year we launched the integrator credit, which allows businesses that are part of the value chain of large companies to have faster access to the resources of their accounts receivable, while large agribusiness companies obtain better financing conditions (on average 200 basis points less than in a traditional credit) in a very important item of their liabilities. At year-end, COP 130,000 million was disbursed to support more than 2,300 small and medium-sized producers.\n\nWith our Productive Linkages strategy, we are able to use the information provided by medium and large companies (pivots) to approach small businesses that are part of their production chains so that  they  can  access  savings  and  credit  products.  In  agriculture,  today  we  have  83  pivots  with disbursements of COP 93,000 million.",

This portfolio is designed to accompany companies in their transition to sustainability, reducing their emissions, adapting to the impacts of climate change and increasing productivity through more efficient land use and the conservation of non-agricultural areas.\n\nThe Agro-Sustainable line  applies  to  independent  clients  and  companies  in  all  links  of  the agricultural value chain (producers, processors, marketers, support services and rural activities), which  today  meet  the  profile  to  access  financing  on  Finagro  terms  and  seek  to  implement investments with a positive environmental impact, framed within the policies established by the bank.  This  financing  has  lines  for  working  capital  for  companies  with  environmental  and  agrosustainability seals endorsed by the bank. In 2023 we disbursed COP 331,211 million.\n\nThe Sustainable Livestock line leverages livestock systems that implement environmentally friendly practices,  respecting  forest  areas,  water  bodies,  among  other  investments  that  generate productivity efficiencies such as: increase in the animal load per hectare, optimization of pasture rotation times, increase in the number of trees per hectare, among other indicators. In 2023 we financed projects for COP 7,714.3 million for the development of sustainable livestock investments that generated positive environmental impacts such as: 6,850 hectares for sustainable livestock, establishment of 410 dispersed trees and live fences, establishment of 30 hectares in silvopastoral systems, 17 kilometers in livestock aqueducts, 125 hectares in forage banks and the release of 20 hectares for conservation.\n\nWith  support  from  the  Partnerships  For  Forests  (P4F)  program,  we  designed  the  Technical Assistance Manual for sustainable livestock. We continue to maintain the agreements with Fedeg\u00e1n and GANSO as allies for the provision of the technical assistance services required. We also began integrating the criteria for monitoring deforestation and respect for the agricultural frontier into the monitoring process for sustainable livestock credits.\n\n## More mechanisms to access assets\n\nWe consolidated our Rental and Use portfolio with real estate valued at COP 1,630,000 million, of which COP 387,000 million are sustainable assets.\n\nIn addition, in technology leasing contracts, we mobilized business for COP 220,000 million, 37% more than a year ago, which maintains us as the most relevant player in the market for leasing this type of assets.\n\nIn addition, we made Bancolombia the first bank in the country to finance real estate assets through trust rights under financial leasing, with the closing of three deals worth COP 89,000 million.\n\n## Sustainable Financing (GRI FS8)\n\nWith  sustainable  financing  we  confirmed  our  commitment  to  encourage  and  promote  the implementation of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria in our clients and to generate a greater impact on our portfolio with differentiated products.\n\nThe objectives of sustainable financing are: i) that the projects generate efficiencies for our clients, allowing them to use fewer resources and improving their operating model, and ii) to generate a quantifiable environmental benefit.",

It is not only a showcase to support marketing (where today there are more than 900 projects on display), but also facilitates the study for the financing of builders and homebuyers, allows to manage and consult the payments received for down payments, and provides market information on areas of interest, demographic characteristics and the profile of the potential buyer.\n\nIn addition, and understanding the interest of buying housing for other uses such as investment, mixed use or tourist housing, we developed a financing solution in Colombian pesos for 20 years.\n\nIn El Salvador, as part of the sustainable development loan portfolio, we placed USD 17.7 million for the construction of housing projects and USD 38.3 million in mortgage loans.\n\n## Sustainable Construction (Sustainable Business Management GRI FS8)\n\nFinancing and promoting sustainable construction is essential for the development of sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). For this reason, we continue to support our clients to guide them in the selection of the appropriate certification for their projects and to have them accredited as Sustainable Construction: EDGE, LEED, CASA Colombia or HQE.\n\nThrough  the  focus  on  sustainable  construction  in  2023,  we  disbursed  COP  1,200,000  million  in certified projects. In turn, with the housing leasing business line, we were able to obtain business from 44 properties certified in sustainable construction for a total area of 4,000 m2, with savings in the construction phase in energy of 15.1 MWH/year, and 530 m 3 /year in water resources, avoiding the emission of 378 tons of CO2.\n\nIn the meantime, we closed an alliance with SUMAC, a multinational company with more than 20 years of experience in the market and a member of the US Green Building Council.  With this alliance we offer our professional construction client's advice to certify their projects and a discount on SUMAC's fees for the implementation of the certification.\n\nIn Guatemala, Bam also provides credit for sustainable construction that also includes expert advice on the subject, positioning of the client as a precursor of sustainability, preferential rates, among others. In 2023 we disbursed USD 53.44 million under this line, bringing Bam's total to 12 projects aligned with sustainable construction.",

We are a reference for our participation in the structuring and administration of sophisticated financial closings that include the management of international issues and structured financial products such as derivatives. In 2023 we participated in 3 new concessions with a value of COP 6,970,000 million and 6 financial closings for a value of COP 11,210,000 million, ensuring the transparency and efficiency of resources to contribute to the economic and social development of the country.\n\nRegarding fifth generation (5G) contracts, during 2023 we achieved the financial closure of Malla Vial del Valle del Cauca - Accesos Cali Palmira, in which Bancolombia has a 45% participation, which will represent a financing of COP 677,000 million, to be disbursed over the next 5 years. With this project we expect to generate 40,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs, and we estimate that it will benefit 3.3 million inhabitants of 12 municipalities in Valle del Cauca and 5 municipalities in Cauca, through the 315 kilometers of roads that will be intervened.\n\nWe also accompanied the structuring and financial closing of Ruta al Sur, a project extending 480 km between Huila, Cauca and Putumayo to connect cargo and passenger transportation to and from Ecuador and reduce the travel time between Bogot\u00e1 and Quito from 26 to 20 hours. We will finance this project with COP 800,000 million, 28.5% of the total.\n\n## La Cuenta del Mar (Sea Account)\n\nThe oceans are fundamental for what they represent for the environment, people's quality of life and global productive activity. For this reason, at Bancolombia we reaffirmed our commitment to sustainable development by creating the Cuenta del Mar.\n\nThis  initiative  involves  the  creation  of  a  new  category  in  our  sustainable  financing  line  called Econom\u00eda Azul Sostenible (Sustainable Blue Economy), where we seek to promote projects, for COP 1,000,000  million  by  2030,  that  contribute  to  social  and  economic  growth  in  coastal  areas, protecting marine ecosystems.\n\nIt also seeks the protection and restoration of mangrove forests in Colombia and El Salvador, as well as the conservation of the Panama Canal watershed and the protection of sea turtles in Guatemala.\n\n## Energy\n\nThrough our financial activity, we support companies that are part of the country's entire energy chain to guarantee energy supply and transition. Some examples are:\n\nIn 2023, we supported renewable energy projects with the sustainable line for COP 400,000 million, and COP 419,000 million for energy efficiency projects, with which 5,720,921 tons of CO2 emissions were avoided.\n\nWe disbursed more than COP 280,000 million in solar energy projects, distributed in five projects that are in the construction stage and have an installed capacity of 300 megawatts. This installed capacity is equivalent to 45% of the total solar projects currently in operation in the country. With this energy financed in 2023, approximately 410,000 Colombian homes will be supplied.",

Through the green line, this project has a loan of COP 126,000 million, of which we have already disbursed COP 73,000 million.\n\nThrough Leasing, we supported the financing of the largest rice husk-based energy generation plant in Colombia for the client Diana Corporaci\u00f3n, for a value of COP 90,000 million.\n\nFrom Investment Banking we provided advice on the sale of renewable energy assets. An example of this was advising Celsia on the sale of 100% of its stake in the portfolio of renewable energy generation assets in Central America, with a total installed capacity of 188 MW. The transaction for USD 194 million in equity value was the most important of its kind in recent years in Central America, and will provide Celsia with resources for its strategy, while the buyer (Enfragen) will be able to position itself among the main players in the sector in Panama.\n\nFrom  the  fiduciary,  we  continue  to  enable  business  in  the  non-conventional  renewable  energy sector through fiduciary guarantee and payment source schemes with financing from national and international sources. In 2023, we enabled an energy structure that provides sustainable energy for 35 MW in new businesses, reaching 364 MW in the managed businesses.\n\nIn order to diversify the portfolio of products available to customers who wish to access assets that generate renewable energy, we developed the leasing of solar solutions. We achieved an operation with Laurel, a vehicle whose investors are Inversiones CFNS and Celsia, whose purpose is to lease solar solutions to industrial and commercial users in different areas of Colombia.\n\nWith this same product we accompanied the Guamo (9.0 MW) and Numbana (9.9 MW) solar farms, located in the department of Tolima. With the entry into operation of these projects we contributed to the reduction of 7,000 tons of CO2 per year and with the supply of energy to nearly 15,000 homes.\n\n## Government and Education\n\nWe are strategic allies of the government and the education sector to materialize the development plans of the territorial entities. The portfolio balance of these clients grew almost 67% with respect to the previous year, amounting to COP 4,210,000 million.\n\nAt a time of transition of new governors of territorial entities, we accompany the candidates with knowledge transfer under the concept of 'Conscious Governments'. We also generated points of contact  with  the  incoming  administrations  in  order  to  build  bridges  to  jointly  build  their development plan for the next 4 years, focused on building sustainable and digital territories for the well-being of all.\n\nWe participated with COP 1,000,000 million in the financing of the development plan of the District of Bogot\u00e1, positioning ourselves as one of the client's leading banks to support the objectives of the four-year term, including projects such as the San Crist\u00f3bal cable and works related to the Bogot\u00e1 Metro.  Of  this  amount,  we  disbursed  COP  200,000  million  under  the  sustainable  line  and  COP 800,000 million in the ordinary portfolio.",

In  2023  we supported more than 20 clients who bet on sustainable investment in their fleets, with financing for more than COP 70,000 million in electric, hybrid and NGV vehicles.\n\nContributing to our decarbonization goals, we supported the people segment with the sustainable line through our subsidiary SUFI . During the year we mobilized more than COP 350,469 million in financing for sustainable vehicles.\n\nWith Muverang ,  our  challenge  to  transform  the  way  the  world  moves,  by  the  end  of  2023  we managed to put 1,272 electric vehicles on the road in 6 cities in the country (Bogot\u00e1, Bucaramanga, Cali, Medell\u00edn, Pereira and Barranquilla). In business contracts, we assisted 29 companies that put nearly 220 vehicles on the road, with the greatest participation in 2-wheeled vehicles. Furthermore, under  the  monthly  subscription  scheme  aimed  at  individuals,  we  reached  1,834  subscriptions, serving 1,400 new customers and getting closer to our ambition to democratize electric mobility in the country. Revenues were COP 8,221 million, an increase of 49% compared to 2022.\n\nIn  our Tu360Movilidad platform,  we  integrated  our  partners'  vehicle  offerings,  means  of transportation  and  Grupo  Bancolombia's  financial  products  to  accompany  people  in  all  their mobility-related needs. This included more than 77 partner showcases, solutions such as Renting, Localiza,  Muverang,  Flypass,  license  renewal  assistance  and  all-risk  insurance.  Thus,  in  2023  we helped  more  than  3,000  people  to  access  the  vehicle  they  need,  with  disbursements  of approximately COP 120,000 million.\n\nWe are also there to meet the needs of public mobility. For this reason, we made the fare collection of  the  Medell\u00edn  Metro  more  efficient,  with  more  than  13  million  recharges  for  more  than  COP 212,600 million; we worked with 45 cab fleets that incorporated digital tools so that Bancolombia customers can pay for services through the QR Code, through which more than COP 18,000 million have been mobilized, which in turn helps us to bring financial inclusion to a community of more than 55,000 cab drivers.\n\nIn addition, we made available to dealers a credit line that allows them to access an inventory of electric, hybrid and gas-powered vehicles at a more competitive rate. This line, through which we have  disbursed  more  than  COP  177,000  million,  complements  Bancolombia  Factoring's  offer  of solutions to help companies manage their working capital.\n\n## Circular Economy\n\nOur  strategy  on  this  front  continues  its  path  of  consolidation,  with  the  ambition  to  promote, articulate and mobilize economic actors in the transition to the Circular Economy, seeking to build economic and environmental resilience, thus contributing to the well-being of businesses, society and the environment.\n\nThe  strategy  is  based  on  5  pillars:  Financing  and  Investment,  Measurement  and  Data, Communication and Influence, Circular Economy within Bancolombia and Strategic Collaboration.\n\nIn May 2023, Bancolombia joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation network to mobilize and promote the transition to the circular economy in Colombia and the region. With this, we become the first company in Latin America to partner with the Foundation and have a presence in North America, Europe, and Asia.",

A total of 282 applications were received, of which 33 teams advanced to the second phase and 3 winners were finally selected.\n\nIn  2023  we  financed  COP  542,693  million  in  circular  economy  projects  for  clients  in  different segments:  corporate,  business,  SMEs,  independent  and  government.  The  projects  financed generated impacts in areas such as reduction of water consumption and management, increase in the  useful  life  of  production  parts  and  technology,  reduction of  waste  in  production  processes, among others.\n\nThrough our Leasing, Rental and Use business line, we have technology leasing financing that works under a circular economy scheme where the useful life of technology equipment is extended in order  to  reincorporate  them  into  the  market  and  ensure  proper  final  disposal  as  Waste  from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) when necessary. As owners of the equipment, we are responsible for the final disposal, in this case we seek a second use through repowering processes and put it at the service of the customer. In case this process is not possible, we take care of its adequate treatment as electronic waste.\n\nIn  this  way, we have achieved placements for a value of COP 97,098 million and promoted 181 clients in the incorporation of a circular economy model in their organization, for a total of 2,441 recycled and 22,987 used equipment sold, achieving energy savings of 54,494 MW/hour.\n\n## Financial Implications and Other Risks and Opportunities of Climate Change GRI 201-2\n\nWe define and implement sustainability policies as part of our corporate strategy, which are linked to our climate strategy.\n\nThese  are  the  Climate  Change  Policy,  Responsible  Investment  Policy,  Sustainable  Procurement Policy and the Corporate ESG Risk Circular which incorporates the Environmental and Social Risk Analysis Policy, the Climate Change Sensitive Industries Policy and the Controversial Issues Policy.\n\nAs part of our external strategy actions, we developed an engagement process with 25 customers relevant to our financed emissions reduction strategy.\n\nDetails of climate policies, strategy, metrics and targets can be found in the TCFD chapter of our Regulatory Report.\n\nOur internal actions include the management of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (except for financed emissions) and the resources collected through the internal carbon tax. Details of these actions can be found in the Ecoefficiency chapter, which includes information on renewable energy generation and energy efficiency indicators, among others.\n\n## Climate Change Financing and Actions in 2023\n\nWe recognize that climate change poses new risks and opportunities, with strategic and financial implications for our businesses and those of our customers and other stakeholders. Therefore, we ratify our commitment to implement actions to mitigate and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change through our Climate Change Management Strategy.\n\nIn terms of climate change, 2023 was a very active year for financial institutions, given the relevance in  the  run-up  to  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  (COP  28)  and  the  objective  of reviewing progress in complying with the Paris Agreement.",

In  this  regard,  some  of  the  actions  we  have  taken  are  the Environmental and Social Risk Assessment for projects and credits in activities with an impact on biodiversity established in  our  ESRA  Policy.  Likewise,  our  Controversial  Issues Policy  defines  the activities that will not be financed due to their high impact on marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and the conditions for financing and investment in economic sectors with high environmental and social impact.\n\nTo learn more about our ESG risk policy please visit:\n\nhttps://www.grupobancolombia.com/wcm/connect/www.grupobancolombia.com15880/b9141ff 1-1710-4c05-80e0-\n\n65fd0c6351e6/Circular\\_de\\_Corporativa\\_de\\_Riesgos\\_ESG.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=oyyjjTI\n\nSince 2021 we are strengthening our biodiversity strategy, where the first step is aimed at measuring and  managing  our  impact  on  forests.  For  this  reason,  we  participated  in  the  CDP  Forest  pilot, reporting on how we are managing these impacts from the risks and opportunities for our financing strategy in the sectors prioritized by the initiative: oil palm, timber, soybeans, livestock and rubber. Likewise, with CDP's support we will have the first analysis of our portfolio to identify impacts on forests.\n\nWe also recognize that deforestation is a risk that contributes to climate change and biodiversity loss.  As  a  signatory  to  the  Financial  Sector  Commitment  on  Eliminating  Commodity  Driven Deforestation (FSDA), we are committed to assessing our exposure to deforestation, deepening our",

In  the  group  of  25  clients  with  whom  we  carry  out  climate  engagement  in  2023,  we  reviewed biodiversity and deforestation issues with 1 client from the livestock sector, 1 from the timber sector and 1 from the palm oil sector.\n\n## Financial Inclusion\n\nWe want more people to access not only financial products, but also to the benefits that the use of different services provides them in their daily activities. In that sense, while we develop a more contextual offer according to the needs and expectations of different types of population, we also work for the financial well-being of everyone.\n\n## A Decade of Bancolombia A La Mano\n\nFrom being a tool to include Colombians from the most remote areas who mainly dealt in cash, it has expanded to become a digital wallet for the entire country.\n\nToday it not only offers transfers, cardless withdrawals, balance inquiries and bill payments, but it is  a  low-amount deposit with its own App that is present in people's daily lives, and that allows people to top up the cell phone balance and mass transportation cards, to buying online, receiving money orders from abroad, paying public services and using the QR Code to buy in more than 1 million stores in 1,100 municipalities in Colombia.\n\nIn 2023, the 6.36 million users of Bancolombia A La Mano made more than 417 million monetary transactions, which represent more than COP 74,000,000 million mobilized, 17% more compared to 2022.",

There  are  already  18.6  million  people  who  see  Nequi  as  an alternative for using money in their daily lives, with an ever-increasing range of services.\n\nWe continue to revolutionize  digital  payments.  In  2023  we  introduced  the  new  functionality  of contactless payment in terminals through our Nequi-Visa Card, with which we want people to carry everything on their cell phones and to make the use of digital means of payment, without the need for cash, a daily occurrence. With this, we also expanded the possibilities of use of the Nequi Card, thus reaching more businesses and increasing its adoption.\n\nThanks to the extension of digital payment methods, we have also fostered the development of the informal economy, the one that happens in the streets, in the neighborhoods, in the marketplaces, and in rural areas, which boosts the local economy. At Nequi, we have made significant efforts to provide  merchants  and  entrepreneurs  with  access  to  their  products  and  services.  Of  the  total number of Nequi users, 15% belong to this segment of the economy where, of the total amount of money that enters Nequi in a month, 47% comes from this category.",

This year we disbursed more than COP 127,000 million in credit, through 71,889 Propulsor loans for COP 118,000 million  and  68,446  Salvavidas  loans  for  COP  9,040  million.  55%  of  the  loans  were  granted  to individuals with no credit experience.\n\nSome of the  novelties  in  2023  were  that  we  increased  the  term  and  maximum  amount  of  the Propulsor loan from 24 months and up to COP 5 million to 36 months and up to COP 10 million; and we lowered the interest rate of the Salvavidas loan from 43.7% to 28.07% effective annual interest rate (equivalent to 25% nominal annual interest rate).\n\nWe also introduced new non-financial services  and  ventured  into  the  world  of  insurance.  With Segur\u00edsimo we offer a personal accident insurance policy that can be customized with additional coverages that users can choose, according to their needs.\n\nIn Panama we migrated the core to provide our more than 152,000 customers with a much more stable and available app.\n\nLikewise, in order to get closer to more people and strengthen our offer, we were at the Comic Con, where we were able to interact with an important niche of clients with the Nequi Visa Digital card, and we closed an alliance with the Pedidos Ya platform, which contributes to Nequi's promise to its clients to live in their day-to-day lives.\n\n## Inclusion with a Gender Perspective\n\nWe continue to strengthen the value proposition for women clients and in this way promote gender equality  in  the  country.  In  Colombia  we  have  more  than  9  million  women  clients,  whom  we accompany in their personal and professional needs. In 2023 we granted them more than COP 3,500,000 million in disbursements through different lines of credit. We also offer them solutions for managing liquidity and growing their assets: There are already more than 267,000 women with products such as CD and virtual investment, which represents an increase of 58% compared to 2022.\n\nIn El Salvador we disbursed USD 359 million in loans that mostly seek to contribute to the economic empowerment of women in the country. Additionally, with the ES L\u00edder platform, 40 Bancoagr\u00edcola clients who are business owners have received non-financial training that creates and reinforces leadership skills and strengthens their businesses.\n\n## We Promote Access to Credit\n\nIn line with regulations, we adjusted the productive credit line with a special rate of 31.89% effective annual percentage rate for the country's micro-entrepreneurs. In addition, we offered them the possibility of accessing a personalized financial education program at no cost, which could generate an additional rate discount.\n\nIn this line of productive credit, we have disbursed COP 370,000 million to more than 23,000 people, of  which  44.6%  was  disbursed  to  women  microentrepreneurs  and,  of  the  total  number  of beneficiaries, 30.41% took the El\u00e9vate program.\n\nWith this line of credit, we participated in the Popular Economy line promoted by the Government, in which we accompanied more than 320 people with disbursements of more than COP 600 million in 2023.",

To the extent that a person has a better relationship with their money, they will be able to live with more security, freedom and a greater sense of well-being, which leads us to work from the financial well-being of people and businesses.\n\nFinancial  education  is  the  vehicle  we  have  chosen  to  promote  the  financial  wellbeing  of  our employees, customers, clients, users and the community in general, with the objective of guiding and raising awareness about the responsible use of money, contributing to the development of skills that allow people and businesses to achieve their own goals and make informed decisions at every stage of their economic life cycle.\n\nWe present the results of the Grupo Bancolombia's Financial Education and Wellness strategy for 2023 with its employees, customers and the community in general, with the objective of developing financial  competencies so that they can better manage their money, make better decisions and progress.\n\n## Financial Well-Being Indicator\n\nIn 2023, we evolved the indicator to a more sophisticated one that would allow us to have a more comprehensive view of customers and incorporate new variables in the measurement. In this sense, the new version of the indicator is fed by 30 transactional variables, which are grouped into seven dimensions:\n\n- 1.  Savings  and/or  investment: We  identify  the  individual's  level  of  savings  over  income,  its frequency and how long the savings could cover monthly expenses in the absence of income.\n- 2. Planning: We observe how much the person uses the services (automatic debits, programmed transfers) and tools (D\u00eda a D\u00eda) offered by the bank for money management, in addition to observing how volatile spending is between periods.\n- 3. Protection : We relate it to the insurability that the person has in order to generate tranquility by foreseeing situations that may affect his economic stability.\n- 4.  Expense: We  observe  the  relationship  between  expenses  vs.  income,  if  the  person  has  the capacity to cover all his expenses for the month and still has money available.\n- 5. Debt Ratio: We identify the debt-to-income ratio and its adequacy, credit card management and payment behavior.\n- 6. Equity: We evaluate financial solvency by identifying debt over equity.\n- 7. Financial sophistication: we relate how much use is made of digital channels and possession of financial products that help manage money.",

Although the customer is doing  very  well,  he/she  must  continue  to  behave  well  in  order  to maintain  his/her  well-being  and  be  able  to  cope  with  unexpected\n\nnegative shocks.\n\nThis customer has opportunities to improve his/her financial well- being.  Positive  events  and  good  decisions  will  take  him/her  to  a better level.\n\nAlthough  this  client's  financial  situation  is  not  critical,  facing  an adverse event or making the wrong decisions can lead this person to a state of financial stress.\n\nThis  customer  is  severely  financially  stressed,  in  an  unhealthy position. This customer is likely to delay payments on obligations or resort to high-cost credit.\n\nWe defined as a goal for 2023 to improve the financial well-being of clients by 5.9%, which meant moving from a baseline of 32.4 points to 34.3 points (according to the previous scale). At the end of December,  the  consolidated  result  obtained  was  32.7  points  for  the  personal,  plus,  preferred, independent, social and employee segments that are part of the indicator, which independently obtained the following results:\n\n- \u00b7 Personal: 32.0 points\n- \u00b7 Plus: 40.2 points\n- \u00b7 Preferential: 51.1 points\n- \u00b7 Independent: 37.3 points\n- \u00b7 Social: 26.9 points\n- \u00b7 Employees: 67.0 points\n\nAccordingly, the result obtained places compliance below the projected (34.3 points), reflecting the situation  of  the  economy and  customers, especially in  the  Social  and Personal  segments, which showed  a  decrease  in  the  variables  of  savings,  expenses,  debt  and  planning.  Since  these  two segments account for the largest number of customers (11 million of the 14 million for which the indicator is measured), the effect is seen to a greater extent in the overall results.\n\nAlthough during July there was a slight improvement for all segments, mainly associated with the bonus issue, it  stabilized  in  the  following  months  despite  the  implementation  of  some  financial education actions. Therefore, in 2024 we will continue to work for the well-being of customers and strengthen the strategy based on analytics and dimensions of greater opportunity for improvement for the segments.",

Applications are made through its Platform in one of the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Capacity  management :  It  establishes  the  institutional  capacities  that  entities  must develop to demonstrate their ability to implement information, content and materials for economic and financial education to financial consumers and other stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Initiatives  in  the  territory :  It  incorporates  evaluation  criteria  related  to  institutional capacities in the territory.\n- \u00b7 MSMEs Initiative: It  identifies  institutional  strategies  to  facilitate  access  to  financial education services for MSMEs.\n\nEach of these categories contains certification levels that refer to the degree of maturity in the implementation of the initiatives. For the \"Capacity Management\" category there is Level 1, 2 and 3,  for the \"MSMEs Initiative\" category there is Level 1 and 2, and for the \"Territorial Initiatives\" category there is a single level. Once the Seal is obtained at one of these levels, it is valid for two years (2) for programs and activities and one year (1) for campaigns.\n\nSince its creation, the Sustainability and Wellness Center of Excellence, as leader of the Financial Education and Wellness strategy, has accompanied various teams of the Grupo Bancolombia and its subsidiaries in the definition of programs, initiatives or campaigns to apply for, verifying that the evidence meets the criteria and ensuring that the information is complete and of high quality, which has allowed us to position the organization as a leader before the Financial Superintendence 3 :",

These programs achieved coverage in the 32 departments of the country with a focus on making rural areas a prosperous, equitable, profitable and innovative territory, which becomes an engine of sustainable development in Colombia.\n\nOne of our focuses for the year was to deepen our understanding of the gaps and patterns that generate  inequality  and  hinder  access  to  education,  which  is  why  we  structured  a  Financial Education  strategy  aimed  at  helping  to  transform  rural  areas.  Through  the  Cuentas  sin  Cuento program, we strengthened the financial knowledge and skills of more than 14,500 beneficiaries, twice as many as in 2022. Of these, 70% are from rural areas and we focused on two populations: young people, because of their role and potential for social mobility in the countryside (40% of the total), and women, who traditionally have larger gaps than men in rural areas (60% of the total).\n\nWe implemented two pilots to generate a financial education offer that meets the needs of rural youth. Through technological mechanisms proven in Latin America, we reached more than 1,900 young people from rural educational institutions who learned the basics of financial management, savings, entrepreneurship and investment opportunities.\n\n## Corporate Volunteer Work\n\nIts purpose is to channel the social and voluntary actions of the Grupo Bancolombia's employees, strengthening our greatest asset: human talent. In 2023, more than 500 volunteers worked with communities throughout the country in projects such as mentoring for En-Campo entrepreneurship, young scholarship holders of the Foundation, Emprende Mujer, EAFIT's \"Tejedur\u00eda\" project, financial education  workshops,  and  the  mentoring  marathon  for  rural  grassroots  organizations,  among others.\n\n## Education for productive insertion\n\nThrough the articulation with 26 partner universities of our Scholarship Program, we supported 456 rural  youth  from  28  departments,  facilitating  their  access  and  permanence  in  post-secondary education (mainly university) and accompanying them with mentoring and complementary training in financial education and employability, so that they can strengthen their skills in a comprehensive manner.\n\nWe also strengthened our participation in different alliances aimed at the development of quality, access and permanence of education in Colombia through:\n\n- -The  Escuela  Nueva  (New  School)  and  Universidad  en  el  Campo  (University  in  the Countryside) model that guarantees access and permanence for children, young people and teachers in dispersed rural areas in the departments of Antioquia, Risaralda and Caldas from elementary school to post-secondary education.\n- -We began our alliance with Fundaci\u00f3n Corona and Ense\u00f1a por Colombia to strengthen the Socio-Occupational Guidance Model focused on Urab\u00e1 and Atl\u00e1ntico, accompanying 3,704 young people in grades 10 and 11, and 32 teachers from 29 educational institutions with tools for better decision making and to facilitate permanence throughout their educational trajectory.\n- -We  strengthened  our  support  to  the  Fundaci\u00f3n  Empresarios  por  la  Educaci\u00f3n  and facilitated, together with the polling firm Cifras y Conceptos, the expansion of the scope of",

Of these, 71 continued their process through mentoring with experts from Grupo Bancolombia and allies to solve specific challenges in their businesses. Finally, COP 1,705 million will be invested with impact financing mechanisms for 8 businesses to promote their  models,  increasing  the  well-being,  competitiveness  and  sustainability  of  the  Colombian countryside.\n\nWe also supported the business development of 44 associative companies through the Potencia program in alliance with IC Fundaci\u00f3n, Fundaci\u00f3n Aurelio Llano and Rabobank Foundation. During this process, companies were able to identify and strengthen their areas of improvement, as well as establish plans to access financing.\n\nIn  alliance  with  FOLU  and  Fundaci\u00f3n  Nutresa,  we  accompanied  10  organizations  to  promote regeneration in Antioquia, Valle, Cauca and Quind\u00edo. During this accompaniment, the organizations strengthened their organizational capacities and were able to access an incentive fund with a total of COP 170 million to apply for projects that strengthened their territories and empowered young people and women through regeneration.\n\nThrough \"Alianza Soluciones\" together with Comfama, Fundaci\u00f3n Nutresa, Sodexo and Fundaci\u00f3n Sura,  we  accompanied  the  strengthening  and  connections  of  45  enterprises  nationwide  led  by people in the peace process as a commitment to build social network.\n\nIn  alliance  with  Fundaci\u00f3n  Nutresa  and  Corporaci\u00f3n  Biosuroeste,  led  by  Comfama  in  the \"Conectores  de  Progreso\"  program,  we  were  able  to  accompany  41  families  from  T\u00e1mesis  and Valpara\u00edso in the training and certification of agroecological practices so that they can be applied to their productive projects, contributing to the regeneration of southwestern Antioquia.\n\nFrom  the  strengthening  of  the  production  network,  we  accompanied  25  coffee  growers  from Dabeiba, Antioquia through the Specialty Coffee Program led by the Coffee Cluster and the Medell\u00edn Chamber  of  Commerce  for  Antioquia.  In  these  spaces,  coffee  growers  learned  about  technical processes allowing them to access the specialty coffee market.\n\nWe also supported five (5) associations (coffee, milk, panela) in the village of San Jos\u00e9 de Urama in Dabeiba, Antioquia through Alianza para el Desarrollo (Alliance for Development), which is made up of 20 business and family foundations. With this advisory service, the organizations gained access to leadership training, training in production processes and networking spaces. In addition, together with Proantioquia, we made progress in strengthening the Agroprogreso Cooperative, located in the Llanogrande district of Dabeiba, made up of 110 peace signatories, through technical support to their productive and social projects as a commitment to collective reincorporation in the Taparales property.",

We currently have an impact investment fund whose committed investments in businesses with an impact on rural areas exceed COP 22,000 million, made up of businesses  from  different  sectors  (Fintech,  rural  tourism,  agribusiness,  technology,  renewable energies, among others).\n\nWe have also ventured into other innovative instruments for impact financing, such as the CREO Payment for Results Bond, in which we acted as investors, generating more than 1,000 jobs with a retention rate of more than 70%, with an audience made up of 80% women. Mechanisms such as this will allow us to scale the impact with revolving resources, achieving greater precision in the execution of resources aimed at addressing the country's challenges.\n\nOn the financing front, during the year we placed more than 3,100 loans in rural areas through our allies, thereby helping agricultural producers' associations, rural women and youth, and businesses in different sectors throughout the country to access capital.\n\n## Our Responsibility Transcends Borders\n\nTranscending in people's lives and working for the transformation of the communities in which we operate were the pillars on which we worked at Banco Agr\u00edcola in El Salvador, Banistmo in Panama, and Bam in Guatemala.\n\n## El Salvador\n\nDonations and disbursements of Bancoagr\u00edcola's main social programs (January to December 2023)\n\n| LINE                                                                                            | PROGRAM  BENEFICIARIES                                                                                                 | TOTAL  INVESTMENT  (USD)   |    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----|\n| FESA  \"Lindo  F\u00fatbol\" 2023                                                                      | del  2,900                                                                                                             | USD 241,484.06             |    |\n| QUALITY OF LIFE   Educaci\u00f3n  Financiera  (Financial Education)                                  | 1,877,142  average  reaches  in  Radio  and  TV;  for  social  networks the average reach  for the year was 3,760,533. | USD 197,830.96             |    |\n| Banco  de  la  TELET\u00d3N  support  for  Asociaci\u00f3n  Telet\u00f3n  Pro-  Rehabilitaci\u00f3n  -  FUNTER 2023 | the  8,000                                                                                                             | USD 80,250.00              |    |\n| CONSOLIDATED  TOTAL  3 programs                                                                 | CONSOLIDATED  TOTAL  3 programs                                                                                        | USD 519,565.02             |    |",

The program currently has 10 environmental authorities involved.\n\n## IV. ACHIEVING CUSTOMER LOYALTY AND PREFERENCE\n\nThose  of  us  who  work  at  Bancolombia  are  committed  to  providing  the  countries  in  which  we operate, businesses and people with solutions for their financial needs. Our products and services are designed in a personalized way to offer each client a solution that allows them to make use of their money, as well as their savings, credit and investment needs according to their stage of life. The same happens with businesses of all sizes, which have seen us as their ally for the transactions they require in their activity, investing, managing their treasury and selling more.\n\nHence the importance of continuing to work to provide reliable, close, timely and easy experiences that have a direct impact on their well-being.\n\n## We Work to Accompany People in all their Day-to-day Needs\n\nBy channeling an important part of the system's resources, we have the opportunity to build links between all  the  parties  involved:  people,  businesses,  companies  and  governments,  covering  all segments and sectors of the country.\n\n## Colombia\n\nIn the case of Colombia, we processed around 68% of all payment, transfer and money transfer transactions in the country, and more than 39% of all funds moved through the system, according to  the  Superintendence of Finance. In fact,  in 2023 we were present in 2,852 million monetary transactions  (19%  more  than  in  2022),  representing  more  than  COP  3,034,000,000,000  million mobilized.\n\nThis  means that every minute we process  nearly 12,000 monetary transactions associated with payments, collection, transfers, deposits, Bancolombia Button (Bot\u00f3n Bancolombia), QR, checks and cash transportation. We achieve this by making available to everyone a wide variety of alternatives for moving their money.\n\nThe Bancolombia QR Code continues to gain ground, as it offers a means of payment other than cash and makes it easier for businesses to sell both physically and digitally. It is already used by more than 3.8 million people and has mobilized more than 137 million transactions, which have digitized more than COP 9,200,000 million of operations that were previously done in cash.\n\nIn 2023 Colombia took a significant step forward with the launch of the Interoperable QR, which allows merchants that have the Bancolombia QR to accept payments from other banks and digital wallets in real time, and also allows users of the Personas App and Bancolombia A La Mano to make payments at the QR points of other banks. More than 252,000 merchants nationwide have this new interoperable  QR  and  more  than  1.3  million  transactions  have  been  made,  for  more  than  COP 104,000  million.  We  hope  that  the  more  than  1.3  million  businesses  that  have  the  traditional Bancolombia QR will request this new alternative to continue facilitating cashless transfers in an easy and secure way, giving people more control to manage their money.",

This payment option was used by 3.5 million people in 2023, who made more than 29 million transactions and mobilized more than COP 4,600,000 million in transactions and is now also available for A La Mano users and pensioners.\n\nWe are the partner of some 356,000 merchants to accept their payments on a daily basis. We have been in more than 500 million operations that represent sales for these businesses for more than COP 72,100,000 million, resources that are one of the levers of the economy. In the last year we grew 20% in amounts and our share of the acquisition business reached 38%.\n\nWompi, which was created 4 years ago to simplify money management and boost the digital growth of businesses, is used as the payment gateway for more than 12,500 merchants, who made more than 59 million transactions for COP 11,500,000 million, an invoicing that almost doubles that of 2022.\n\nSince January 2022, Wompi has been operating independently from Bancolombia and today has more than 15% market share, making it a relevant and recognized player in the industry, which is continuously evolving to accompany businesses in their different moments and types of sales.\n\nWe recently launched a sales App in Wompi to make it easier for our merchants to receive face-toface  payments  with  different  payment  methods  such  as  Nequi  and  QR,  thus  consolidating Bancolombia's payment ecosystem. We hope that with this solution it will be possible to receive payments with contactless cards and that through the app merchants will be able to send money based on the payments they receive.\n\nMoreover, our nearly 15 million debit cards are present in people's daily lives as a secure and easyto-use solution. With these cards, users made purchases for more than COP 55,300,000 million, 12.4% more than in 2022.\n\nLikewise,  more  than  2.1  million  people  have  Bancolombia  credit  cards,  with  which  they  make payments, finance their purchases and access benefits according to their needs. Invoicing with the 2.8 million cards in the market reached COP 34,500,000 million in 2023 (14% more than in 2022) through  more  than  120  million  transactions,  and  the  portfolio  balance  reached  COP  9,000,000 million.\n\nOur digital wallets (Apple, Google, Garmin, Fitbit) continue to consolidate in the market. In 2023, more than 450,000 of our customers used this means to make their payments easily and securely, with an invoicing of COP 2,600,000 million (160% more than in 2022) in 45 million transactions, with which they already have a 5% share in the invoicing of Bancolombia payment methods.\n\nAs  part  of  being  present  at  different  moments  of  life,  we  launched  the  Comprehensive  Cancer Insurance with a 100% digital proposal to accompany our clients with an economic indemnity in case of detection of any type of cancer. Its value proposition is modularity, since the value of the insurance depends on the age of the client and the insured value they choose (COP 10 million to COP 100 million). In addition, thinking about the integral well-being of our clients, we included additional free benefits, focused on nutrition, health and education.",

With our digital value proposition, we achieved that 59% of our sales are digital, which meant that more than 5.3 million financial products were managed through this channel.\n\n| Digital  adoption  and  use   |                       | Dec-20    | Dec-21    | Dec-22   | Dec-23                     |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------------------------|\n| % of Digital Adoption         | % of Digital Adoption | 62.97%    | 68.16%    | 70.97%   | 72.08%                     |\n| Active  customers             | digital               | 7,511,937 | 8,901,420 |          | 10,106,292      10,658,615 |\n| % digital use                 |                       | 83.57%    | 85.10%    | 88.79%   | 86.64%                     |\n\nAmong individuals  and  self-employed  workers  alone,  we  already  have  8.3  million  active  digital customers,  who  made  more  than  104  million  transactions  in  the  App  and  the  Sucursal  Virtual Personas, for an amount of COP 35,600,000 million (84% of the total amount transacted in digital channels).\n\nThese solutions are also a tool to facilitate the operational processes and business management of SMEs and enterprises. 64.9% of SME customers and 84.5% of companies have adopted our digital channels, more than 35,000 SMEs joined the use of the App (half of them did their operations in physical channels) and in 2023 more than 207 million transactions were made through the App and the Virtual Branch for these two segments.\n\nLikewise, our digital channels make it easier for corporations to manage their production cycles, bringing  them  closer  to  their  customers,  employees,  suppliers  and  other  relationship  groups through  specialized  solutions  for  this  segment.  These  companies  make  more  than  390  million transactions  each  month  on  average  and  are  increasingly  using  payment  methods  such  as Bancolombia Button, QR and Wompi.\n\n## El Salvador\n\nAt  Bancoagr\u00edcola  we  also  strengthened  our  digital  strategy  to  achieve  greater  adoption  among Salvadorans. More than 500,000 people already use digital channels  in  their  daily  transactions, which represents 34.39% of the bank's active customers.\n\nThis, in turn, has facilitated the process of accessing consumer credit. In fact, more than USD 123.7 million have been disbursed through digital channels, representing about 30% of the amount placed in consumer products.\n\n## Guatemala\n\nIn Guatemala we partnered with Paggo, a Fintech provider of a much more versatile, innovative and accessible Points of Sale (POS) for micro and small businesses since it does not require a contract or monthly fees, offers a competitive commission per transaction, affiliation in 10 minutes, delivery in 24  hours,  and  access  to  payment  link  generation  and  free  QR.  With  this,  we  provide  a  value alternative for our customers and have achieved invoicing of USD 1.2 million.",

Therefore, this year we continue to evolve our value proposition based on Ecosystems to provide solutions that consider the lifetime of customers and their contexts to the financial and non-financial needs of the market. In this evolution we rely on three models:\n\n- 1. Banking as a Platform (BaaP) where we orchestrate financial and non-financial services, with our own and third-party solutions, in our own channels, and we achieve this through different solutions:\n\nTu360Compras , the Marketplace in which more than 24,725 people (Bancolombia customers and non-customers)  purchased  products  in  categories  such  as  technology,  electrical  appliances  and home appliances, at a competitive price and with different financing alternatives from Bancolombia. In total, we generated an invoicing of more than COP 57,602 million.\n\nTu360Inmobiliario , where we have provided 16,000 people with real estate financing approvals for a  value  of  COP  1,600,000  million,  which  have  materialized  in  disbursements  of  more  than  COP 420,000 million in mortgage loans and housing leasing, thus allowing 3,080 families to have access to a home of their own. Customers and non-customers have the possibility of obtaining credit or leasing approval in a matter of minutes, generating an easy, digital and timely experience. It is also the showcase for more than 900 housing projects, accompanying builders throughout the country, for which we have leveraged disbursements of close to COP 1,000,000 million. In addition, through alliances with PropTech, we have given our clients the possibility of acquiring real estate with real estate and financial advice from a single front, making the purchase of housing a more agile and simple process.\n\nTu360Movilidad , which has received visits from 3.5 million users reflected in 5.7 million sessions, to whom we connect with more than 77 showcases of our partners and more than 7 solutions of use, including Renting Persona Natural, Localiza, Muverang, Flypass, assistance in license renewal and all-risk insurance, disbursing approximately COP 120,000 million in credits for their vehicles with the help of Sufi.\n\nIn Mis Aliados we have more than 700 active independents and have provided more than 32,000 services for more than COP 1,400 million in categories such as home, pets, people, group classes, among others.\n\nPlink continues to improve the information it provides to its more than 8,200 users in terms of transactional  behavior,  general  market  knowledge,  average  transactions,  knowledge  of  its customers, among others, so that retailers can develop strategies to attract more customers and improve their sales.\n\n- 2. Banking as a Service , where third parties and strategic allies can leverage our channels to increase their sales and achieve market objectives:\n\nThe digital wallet, which is exposed to third parties as a service to be incorporated into their own platforms and experiences, has managed to mobilize more than COP 5,000 million with consumers such as Monet - a fintech focused on income advancement - and Puntos Colombia - the country's largest loyalty program.",

This product allows making online purchases and deferring them to 4  installments  with  no  monthly  interest  charge,  with  a  commission  for  the  buyer  and another for the merchant. At the end of the year, approximately 1,000 loans had been placed, with average  amounts of  COP 270,000,  starting  from a  base of  close  to  3  million  clients  with  a  precalculated limit. The objective is for it to be a mechanism for financial inclusion and sustainable growth, as it is a financing option for people who are not subject to credit under traditional policies and who can start their credit life with low amounts and easy experiences.\n\nWith QR Bancolombia we are fulfilling our purpose of digitizing cash, becoming the largest nonacquiring network in the country and a means of acceptance that contributes to the banking and formalization of businesses.\n\n- 3. Open  Banking ,  where  we  are  generating  value  exchange  through  the  exposure  or consumption of APIs that facilitate access to information, algorithms, technology and infrastructure:\n\nWe developed an Open Data strategy to better understand the reality of users in credit risk models and their personalization, as well as in the promotion of their financial well-being. D\u00eda a D\u00eda, the Bancolombia App functionality is already used by more than 2,467,000 people, with more than 222,000 active users per month, whom we help to better understand how they manage their money (including cash), starting with automatically categorizing their income and expenses, managing their budget  by  setting  savings  goals  and  defining  ceilings  for  each  item,  in  order  to  achieve  their objectives.\n\nAs part of this, we periodically send more than two million customers a closing report on their personal finances in order to support them in their financial well-being. In fact, we have evolved the organization's Financial Well-Being measurement model, which this year became an ESG indicator (see more details in the Well-Being chapter).\n\nWith the launch of Tus Bancos, we are the first bank in the country to develop an Open Banking functionality in Colombia, in which 2,681 customers have already linked their accounts from any of the  6  banks  we  have  available  so  far  (representing  47%  of  the  market)  to  consolidate  in  their Bancolombia App the management of their personal finances.\n\n## Promoting sustainability as a business strategy\n\nWe support our clients in the SME, business and corporate segments in the incorporation of ESG best practices through a digital platform and the advice of an expert team.\n\nIn this way, our customers can access to contents and methodological tools that allow them:\n\n- \u00b7 To understand sustainability as a business strategy, fundamental for the sustainability and competitiveness of its economic activity.\n- \u00b7 To  define  its  sustainability  strategy  according  to  the  material  issues  identified  in  the Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance dimensions.\n- \u00b7 To understand the circular economy, measure the company's level of circularity and access methodological tools to define its circular economy strategy.\n- \u00b7 To create synchronous consulting spaces with experts in the area of sustainability.\n\nWe have accompanied more than 50 clients in their business transformation.",

We do this with the intention of encouraging the new generations in the importance of information protection and to harvest, in the short term, a research seedbed of talents with specialized knowledge.\n\nFrom  the  culture  front,  we  developed  six  cybersecurity  drills,  security  training  and  continuous Phishing and Ransomware exercises, reaching, on several occasions, 30,000 employees, delivering preventive  recommendations  against  possible  attacks  and  the  importance  of  reporting  cases through the official channel of suspicious mail.",

We reached more than 15 million people, with multimedia content generating more than 140,000 clicks and inviting our customers to ask themselves what the safest decision is when faced with the different situations that arise when using the bank's channels and products.\n\nWith  the  Bus  Escuela  we  reached  more  than  3,000  users  nationwide  and  impacted  3  million customers with safety videos on branch screens.\n\nWe complemented this strategy with a campaign to share how fraud occurs and what should be done to prevent it. The actions of this campaign impacted more than 4.5 million people on average per month, and the content such as videos, images and posts published on different digital platforms reached 45,000 impressions.\n\n## Technology Infrastructure\n\n- \u00b7 Thanks to the migration of more applications to the cloud, we have achieved efficiencies of COP  95,500  million,  and  on  average  we  are  generating  an  average  savings  of  45%  per application supported in the cloud. We have also managed to reduce by 79 hours on average the first release to production of solutions implemented in the cloud and the decrease from 48 to 2 hours in the time to enable workspaces in the cloud.\n- \u00b7 Furthermore, by implementing operational excellence strategies in the AWS cloud, such as consumption adjustments, automation and reengineering, we achieved savings of more than COP 800 million. We ensured the resilience of our critical processes by executing 237 IT Continuity Exercises and achieved a reduction in response times between branches and services on AWS.\n- \u00b7 Our software development process allowed us to automate more than 7,200 end-to-end testing  scenarios  to  ensure  the  quality  of  our  systems,  find  vulnerabilities  and  address findings to make our systems more resilient to failures.\n- \u00b7 We increased the computing capacity by 30% of the physical infrastructure of the Core Banking ecosystem to guarantee future transactional demand and its sustainability.\n- \u00b7 We link and train talents in advance. In 2023 we hired 120 Software Engineers to reduce the knowledge curve and contribute to gender diversity; we implemented \"team profiles\", a methodology that defines the distribution of expertise of the Technology teams according to the responsibility and complexity of each Center of Excellence, increasing productivity and technical quality.",

This relationship is built by being present when they need us, which is achieved by acting with impeccability, ensuring high levels of availability in channels and services,  constantly  evolving  our  processes  and  products,  strengthening  our  technological capabilities and connecting from agile models to deliver experiences that are more valued.\n\nWe develop and strengthen the Customer Experience as an organizational capacity that allows us to connect collaborators and allies so that each contact with the customer is a superior experience, based on listening to them empathetically to know their needs, what they expect to be different and what they value in their  experience,  in  order  to  generate  more  people-centered  solutions, manage their requirements with greater timeliness and satisfy their needs in an impeccable manner.\n\nIn order to be people-centered, we have a defined target experience, and in 2023 we ratified the continuity of the attributes that allow us to deliver a superior experience (being Close, Reliable, Timely and Easy), accompanied by an organizational mobilization that generated close to 114,000 interactions with our employees and allies, allowing us to achieve the following advances:\n\nWe  launched  the  Promotorex  Service  Model,  a  new  content  program  to  train  some  10,500 employees in the People and SME business in tangible behaviors that materialize the attributes of our superior target experience, through the development of content inspired by the Disney service culture.\n\nThe customer experience is the result of the sum of the interactions of all the teams and partners of the organization; therefore, we have a strategy to ensure the vision and management of the experience through training, consulting, personalized support, immersions and design in action. We mobilized more than 13,000 people and 100 allied companies.\n\nWe multiplied our capacity to listen to customers, which allowed us to ensure data-driven decision making  and  experience  management.  In  addition,  to  more  easily  drill  down  into  our  voice-ofcustomer findings, we developed sophisticated, predictive analytical models that make it easier to understand customer feedback across all metrics and improve the experience.\n\nWe also enhanced the experience design skills by deepening our understanding of accessibility and inclusion guidelines and definitions, which have allowed us to take a more holistic view of the needs of  all  our  users  with  permanent  or  temporary  disabilities.

BUILDING CULTURE AND TALENT TO FOSTER COMPETITIVENESS\n\nAt Grupo Bancolombia we understand that people are our most valuable asset: our employees, their dreams and their growth is what drives us.\n\nSo, in 2023, we went a step further to create an enriching work environment that contributes to their well-being and development, with the goal of being the place where talent chooses to grow and thrive. Together we seek to achieve our higher purpose of promoting sustainable development for the well-being of all.\n\nOn this path, and to respond to the challenges of the current labor reality, we renew the value proposition to employees so that each one can say with pride and commitment: 'Bancolombia is the best place to work!' This is how we defined three pillars that make up the work experience in the  organization:  development,  connection  and  enjoyment,  through  which  we  strengthen  our employer brand to attract, empower and retain the best talent, in an environment that enhances their development in a framework of respect, equity and inclusion, where all people feel free to be who they want to be.\n\n## Development for the Personal and Professional Growth of Our Employees\n\nKnowledge  is  a  valuable  resource  that  is  created  from  preparation,  collaborative  construction, experimentation, continuous improvement and interaction with others. In our work environment, we make organizational purpose the inspiration that motivates us to take on challenges, to try new ways  of  doing  things,  to  learn  from  mistakes  and  empower  ourselves  to  conceive  high-impact projects  that  generate  exceptional  results.  Following  this  premise,  we  implemented  different strategies to mobilize the comprehensive development of skills that encompass being, knowing and doing to evolve and become the best version.\n\nIn  line  with  our  vision,  during  2023  we  invested  in  the  development  of  our  employees  through multiple programs designed according to the strategic needs of the business and best practices. The objective is to contribute to the evolution of our employees, helping them to achieve their best version and meet the proposed goals.\n\nOne of the key pillars of this initiative is the Plan Carrera (Career Plan), an organizational growth model  that  has  evolved  away  from  the  prioritization  of  positions  and  hierarchies  in  order  to empower employees to project their career to grow in the short, medium and long term through their contribution to organizational objectives, the reflection of expected behaviors, expertise in their  role  and  the  generation  of  value  in  the  organization.  Currently, 3,197  talents, whose  roles apply, participate in this program. As part of the benefits, they have received significant investment of more than COP 10,400 million.\n\nSimilarly,  this  year  we  invested  COP  1,167  million  in  the  development  of  our  talent  pool  in  all countries to contribute to their personal and professional development, and thus anticipate the needs and challenges of the future through the comprehensive preparation of the talents that will take on the leadership of the organization. In each talent pool, we achieve outstanding results in terms of their loyalty:\n\nHigh Potential Talents: 96.9% of loyalty rate\n\nKey Talents: 98.5% of loyalty rate",

We highlight that 85% of our leaders acquired new knowledge and strengthened their skills through our Leadership Institute, and nearly 9,000 employees were part of our schools. Likewise, 99% of our employees successfully completed their annual virtual training plan, dedicating an average of 43 hours to their professional development.\n\nThese academic programs are built together with high-level national and foreign institutions and the  participation of our  employees,  to  take  advantage  of  internal  knowledge and  experience  in specific topics, thus facilitating coverage and efficiency.\n\nLikewise, we encourage reflections so that our employees find the connection that exists between their daily actions and decisions and the materialization of a purpose that positively impacts the environment, the organization and society.\n\nThere  are  other  initiatives  that  contributed  to  the  training,  development,  growth  and  personal, professional, social and economic well-being of employees, which have allowed us to strengthen our employer brand and consolidate our position as one of the leading companies to work for in the country  and  attract  and  retain  employees  with  key  skills,  as  well  as  emerging  professionals  in strategic areas such as technology, cybersecurity, design, analytics and artificial intelligence. Among these, in Colombia, the following stand out:\n\nIT  Generation: This  program aims to attract people with knowledge and interest in technology, anticipating the demands for talent in this area. Additionally, we seek to close the gaps in female participation in masculinized areas, promoting the inclusion of women in the technological field, with a goal of hiring 25% of women in said program, which closed at 35%, exceeding expectations.\n\nOpen House Bancolombia: with the purpose of consolidating ourselves as the main option in the minds and hearts of young Colombians in terms of employment, we inaugurated the third edition of Open House Bancolombia. This event, held in a hybrid manner, included talks designed for senior managers and expert leaders to share their knowledge with the future of talent in our country. In total there were 15 conferences, which impacted 9,550 people.\n\nTalento B is a program that brings together young people who are passionate about strategic topics such as: data science, cybersecurity, experience design and technology, through participation in real projects and challenges of the organization, in order to prepare future Bancolombia experts. This year, 62 young people entered the program in the junior stage, 37 advanced to the senior stage and 67% of the Talento B who completed the program in 2023 were promoted to specialized positions in the organization.\n\nBank Design: We want to maintain our position as an organization desired by specialized design talent. With this in mind, we convened professionals from all over the country in experience design, interfaces  and  research,  who  demonstrated  their  skills  in  tackling  a  challenge  focused  on accessibility for senior citizens.\n\nMujeres tech (Tech Women) :  is  a  strategy  aimed  at  promoting  job  opportunities  for  women  in technology. This initiative involves a network of female ambassadors from the vice-presidency of Technology  Services,  who  are  responsible  for  disseminating  the  organization's  purpose  and mobilizing knowledge to inspire and collaborate with new generations. These female ambassadors will receive training, including workshops and courses to improve their communication skills, and",

To date, 9 Tech Women have participated in various activities such as webinars, talks and events, among others.\n\nExperiencia Bancolombia (Bancolombia Experience): Under this program we received 503 students from schools and universities in Medell\u00edn, to connect them with our culture, and challenge their knowledge in solving a business challenge, on trending topics.\n\nDataFest: our first analytics fair, which became an enriching learning and knowledge experience in which  more  than  244  people,  members  of  DataBank  (our  analytics  community)  and  university students participated, obtaining a satisfaction indicator of 9.5 out of 10 and a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 85.\n\nIn addition, the team of the Vice-Presidency of Talent and Culture evolved their ways of working and participated in a development program to become agile, contextual and daring professionals at the  service  of  organizational  purpose  and  strategy,  an  evolution  that  also  seeks  to  incorporate analytical knowledge and cutting-edge practices for decision making centered on knowledge and talent experience.\n\n## Making Things Happen Through Connection\n\nConnection  is  essential  to  maintain  an  inspiring  work  environment  that  encourages  the creation of enriching relationships within a framework of respect.\n\nDuring 2023, we focused our efforts on fostering collaboration, diversity and trust in our work environment. To enhance our employees' experience, we actively listen to their opinions through tools such as 'Y t\u00fa qu\u00e9 dices' (What you think). This provides us with the opportunity to  identify  the  areas  in  which  we  excel  positively  and  those  in  which  we  can  make improvements within our work environment.\n\nIn  addition,  we  conducted  a  demographic  analysis  of  our  workforce  using  data  that  our employees voluntarily provide. We also undertook an analysis of their journey within the organization, from their onboarding process to the end of their career,  and developed a three-year strategic plan to intervene and improve their experience.\n\nAs  part  of  the  strengthening  of  the  Contigo  (With  You)  System,  aimed  at  addressing complaints related to workplace violence, sexual misconduct and discrimination, the bank has  implemented  a  Human  Rights  remediation  protocol.  Through  this  protocol,  various mechanisms  are  provided  for  stakeholders  to  report  any  infringement  of  human  rights, discriminatory  behavior  or  other  improper  acts.  The  ethics  hotline  and  the  coexistence committee are key channels for receiving complaints, in accordance with Colombian and Panamanian regulations.\n\nAlthough there were no direct cases of human rights violations resulting from the bank's operations  in  2023,  the  Contigo  System  managed  cases  in  which  related  third  parties violated  human  rights  through  inappropriate  sexual  behavior  towards  employees, implementing immediate action and reparation plans.  The  reparation  measures  included hours of psychological first aid, legal  advice,  reporting  to  authorities,  administrative  and disciplinary actions, application of the Methodological Route for employee care in real time, additional clauses in contracts with allies, and advice to allies on the preparation of their protocols. We investigate all cases under strict parameters of neutrality and confidentiality.",

Facing the new environments of the working world, facilitating people's development is one of the most challenging responsibilities and will occupy L\u00edderB's work agenda in the coming years.\n\n## Enjoyment and Harmony as a Fundamental Part of Life\n\nWe firmly believe that each employee is a valuable human being with dreams, aspirations, and individual needs that, when part of a healthy work environment where collaboration, trust and cohesion among teams are promoted, they become more productive, creative and committed  to  their  goals.  Their  happiness  and  satisfaction  are  reflected  in  their  job performance and the positive impact they can have on society.\n\nTo achieve this, we strive to create an environment where each employee feels listened to, respected, and valued, and where outstanding performance and well-being go hand in hand, seeking  harmony  among  the  different  dimensions  of  wellness.  This  is  how  the #ElegimosElBienestar (#WeChooseWellness) strategy was born, where we understand that well-being is an individual decision with a collective impact that we make on a daily basis, a conscious choice that transcends the limits of the company to converge in the individual conscience of each employee.",

        "page_content": "Based on the opportunities offered by new ways of working, we have launched the \"A Tiempo\" (On Time) strategy, an initiative that provides experiences, recommendations and spaces aimed at optimizing time management in the work environment. Our main goal is to make well-being a reality  by  promoting self-care  and  a  harmonious balance between work and personal life, providing inclusive and segmented options for administrative and commercial areas.\n\nIn 2023, we succeeded in developing a diversified offer that provides over 19,000 employees, both administrative and commercial, with various options and practices to enhance their time  management  experience.  We  also  coordinated,  without  affecting  the  customer experience, the possibility for over 6,300 employees from 400 branches nationwide to enjoy Friday afternoons off, have a smoother return after their vacations, or have time off on their birthdays.\n\nThus, \"A Tiempo\" empowers our employees to make consistent decisions, fostering shared responsibility  and  allowing  greater  flexibility  in  time  management,  which,  in  turn, contributes to well-being, exceptional performance, and increased productivity.\n\nSimilarly, as a contribution to the care economy and the well-being of new employee families, the  'Creando  V\u00ednculos'  (Creating  Bonds)  program  was  born,  combining different flexible work schemes to facilitate parents spending the majority of their time with their children during their first year of life.  To date, close to 70 employees are enjoying this benefit.\n\nIn addition to this, other achievements of the year were:\n\n- \u00b7 11,204  employees  are  part  of  flexible  work  schemes,  representing  80%  of administrative employees, in a context where flexibility, trust, and well-being are our premises  to  attract  and  develop  the  talent  our  organization  needs  to  achieve  its purpose.\n- \u00b7 Recognizing the efforts of 550 outstanding employees in Being an Example 2023, as well as promoting spaces for people and their families to enjoy, such as the five-year anniversary  celebrations,  national  family  parties,  Employee  Week,  and  Adventure Challenge 2023.\n- \u00b7 In the countries where we operate, we provide benefits to our employees and their families,  including  credits,  savings  programs,  insurance,  psychological  support, financial  advice,  among  many  more  personal  development  activities,  with  an investment of over USD 346 million, covering all employees.\n\n## BMovers Community to Boost Well-being\n\nWe  stay  at  the  forefront,  driven  by  behavioral  sciences  and  in  collaboration  with  our community of 209 employees, we continue to promote culture and well-being. This year, through the 'Hackea tu cerebro y elige el bienestar' (Hack Your Brain and Choose Well -being) initiative, we have shared knowledge with over 8,000 employees about how our brain works to develop habits and make decisions that promote the relationship between well-being and exceptional performance.\n\nAmong our achievements are:",

These values allowed us to ensure a solid balance between our employees' well-being and the Bank's sustainability.\n\nThe most outstanding milestones of this agreement are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Validity of 3 years, covering the period 2023-2026.\n- \u00b7 Salary  increase:  A  14.5%  increase  during  the  first  year,  followed  by  an  increase equivalent to the variation of the CPI+2.3 percentage points in the second year and an increase of CPI+2.5% in the third year.\n- \u00b7 Health: We have improved the health policy, increasing coverage by 12.5%.\n- \u00b7 Education: Increase in the value of the aid so that employees, their spouses, and their children  can  access  education  programs  to  continue  developing  their  skills  and knowledge for the new demands of the current world.\n- \u00b7 Housing: We have increased the second credit fund by a percentage equivalent to the salary increase for each conventional year and have allocated additional resources for the approval of pending second housing loans that meet the conditions.\n\nIn the regulatory field, several initiatives stand out, such as reducing the workweek to 42 hours starting January 1, 2025, surpassing the current Colombian regulation of 47 hours per week.  An  explicit  commitment  is  established  regarding  work  disconnection  during  rest periods, recognizing the importance of maintaining a healthy balance between work and personal life. Likewise, a specific approach is adopted for the assignment of work forms, with a formal commitment to shared responsibility of men and women in care responsibilities. We reaffirm  our  commitment  to  employee  well-being  and  our  zero-tolerance  stance  on  any conduct that violates dignity.\n\nThese agreements apply to about 12,000 employees with operational positions and business lines.",

Therefore,  in 2023, we consolidated a diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy that we have been working on for over 5 years to contribute to building a world with fewer labels, where each person can freely identify and promote their life project, without limits imposed by stereotypes.\n\nThis strategy, led by a DEI directorate created in 2022 which reports to the Presidency to mobilize  all  necessary  resources  and  capacities  within  and  outside  the  organization,  has three prioritized approaches so far: gender equity and empowerment of women, inclusion of sexual diversity, and accessibility for people with disabilities. However, there are still many challenges for other populations, such as ethnic groups, migrants, youth, and the elderly, that we also want to recognize and work on in the future, in line with our corporate policy of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\n\nIn 2023, our DEI strategy received the Aequales certification, a recognition that only 9 other Colombian  companies  have.  They,  like  Bancolombia,  are  transforming  their  policies  and processes with gender equity and diversity criteria. Among the initiatives highlighted by the certification is the DEI Community that we created with our suppliers and allies to exchange knowledge and best practices on these topics.\n\nThe  Aequales  certification  also  recognizes  the  efforts  we  made  during  the  last  year  to consolidate  a  gender-focused  value  proposition  for  our  more  than  9  million  female customers in Colombia. At Bancolombia, we not only have differential credit products for women,  such  as  'Agro  para  Todas'  (Agro  for  All  Women)  and  the  ordinary  loan  line  for women-led companies, through which we disbursed over COP 400,000 million in 2023, but also  training  strategies  and  other  non-financial  solutions  that  allow  us  to  continue strengthening our relationship with them.\n\nFor example, more than 3,200 women benefited from 'El\u00e9vate' (Reach New Heights), our financial training platform for entrepreneurs and micro-business owners, and more than 340 were  part  of  'Emprender  Mujer'  (Entr epreneur  Woman),  a  business  training  program  on business, impact, and leadership: 150 in cities such as Medell\u00edn, Cali, and Barranquilla, and 190 in 22 municipalities in Antioquia.\n\nOur  goal  is  to  continue  building  capacities  in  women,  especially  those  with  their  own businesses, and facilitating their access to credit. To achieve this, we need to strengthen alliances  that  allow  us  to  better  understand  their  needs  and  reach  new  market  sectors. Therefore,  in  2023,  we  participated  in  Project  Germina,  along  with  Comfama,  USAID, Agricapital,  ImpactHub,  and  MET  Community,  to  provide  loans  to  over  400  rural  women entrepreneurs and micro-businesswomen in Antioquia.\n\nWe know that the resources we put into women's hands multiply as well-being opportunities for their surroundings. With this premise, we not only focus on entrepreneurship but also on formal employment, to contribute to the autonomy and economic empowerment of more women in Colombia. This year, we also renewed our alliance with the Juanfe Foundation, an organization that works to break the cycles of poverty of vulnerable teenage mothers, under which  over  600  women  in  Medell\u00edn  accessed  technical  and  professional  training  for employment.",

This year we disbursed COP 4,200,000 million to certified companies.\n\nIn the same line, with the aim of strengthening an increasingly inclusive supply chain, we joined Sourcing2Equal, an initiative of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) that seeks to generate business between small and medium-sized enterprises led by women and large companies in Colombia.\n\nWith the She Is Foundation, we continue to work to connect women, from a young age, with science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics,  areas  of  knowledge  where  future professional development opportunities are concentrated. 100 girls from different regions of the country were part of She Is Astronaut, participating for 4 months in a virtual STEM training  program, and another 35 experienced a scientific immersion at the NASA Space Center in Houston, Texas.\n\nIn  2023,  we  joined  the  Chamber  to  continue  working  for  the  financial  inclusion  of  the LGBTIQ+ population and other historically discriminated social groups. In partnership with this organization and with ImpactHub, we conducted the first entrepreneurship boot camp in the country aimed at sexually diverse people who have their own businesses, in which 30 entrepreneurs from different cities participated.\n\n## Human Rights \"Promote, Respect, and Remedy\"\n\n(Operations subject to human rights impact assessments or reviews)\n\nAt Bancolombia Group, we consider it essential to promote, respect, and effectively address issues  related  to  human  rights.  Since  2013,  we  have  established  a  public  declaration committed to Human Rights, which is based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights supported  by  the  UN,  as  well  as  the  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights, endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council. This declaration is complemented by voluntary commitments, such as the Equator Principles, Principles for Responsible Investment, and the Carbon Disclosure Project. These commitments encompass climate protection, combating corruption, managing water resources, and promoting peace, among other relevant aspects.\n\nOver the years, we have strengthened our responsible and sustainable business conduct by implementing new strategies and policies that positively impact our employees, customers, suppliers, and society as a whole. This action has been fundamental to prevent and mitigate adverse  effects  on  human  rights  directly  related  to  our  operations.  Among  our  most prominent policies are the Mitigation and Remediation Protocol, the Responsible Corporate Investment Policy, the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Policy, as well as the Policy to promote healthy coexistence and gender equity. Additionally, we have aligned our labor practices with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and implemented human rights due diligence processes, among other significant initiatives.\n\nAt the center of our approach is the preservation of the intrinsic value of human dignity. Therefore, we strongly reject all forms of discrimination, human trafficking, forced labor, or",

GRI 405-2 SALARY REMUNERATION BY GENDER AND AGE RANGES\n\nWith the aim of aligning with UN Women's international standards, and based on internal decisions stemming from the confidentiality of figures in public reports, salary equity data is adjusted  at  the  Senior  Management  level  by  eliminating  President  positions  or  those reporting directly to them with high strategic impact. The calculation is also adjusted by job valuation level with Korn Ferry methodology in line with the ILO principle that equal work deserves equal pay. For this same reason, and additionally due to distortions in the wage gap because  of  the  exchange  rate,  a  single  average  and  median  salary  for  women  and  men respectively that averages all banks and Offshore offices is not published.\n\n## Bancolombia -Colombia 2023 (Figures in COP)\n\n| Hierarchical Level   | Gender       | Population  Percentage   | Average  Monthly Salary   | % Below Men   |\n|----------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Senior Management    | Female       | 40%                      | 19,187,110                | 2.18%         |\n| Senior Management    | Male         | 60%                      | 20,820,116                | 2.18%         |\n|                      | Female       | 55%                      | 9,116,748                 | 3.99%         |\n| Mid-Level Strategic  | Male         | 45%                      | 9,583,151                 | 0.29%         |\n| Professional         | Female  Male | 54% 46%                  | 5,011,414   5,140,476     | 0.29%         |\n|                      | Female       | 69%                      | 3,457,890                 | 0.98%         |\n| Operational          | Male         | 31%                      | 3,529,151                 | 0.98%         |\n\n## Banistmo 2023 (Figures in USD)\n\n| Hierarchical Level   | Gender   | Population  Percentage   | Average Monthly  Salary   | % Below  Men   |\n|----------------------|----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|\n| Senior Management    | Female   | 50%                      | 9,875                     | 4.34%          |\n| Senior Management    | Male     | 50%                      | 10,455                    |                |\n| Mid-Level Strategic  | Female   | 62%                      | 4,138                     | 5.77%          |\n| Mid-Level Strategic  | Male     | 38%                      | 4,452                     | 5.77%          |\n| Professional         | Female   | 57%                      | 1,870                     | 9.07%          |",

It verifies compliance with the Equator Principles, IFC Performance Standards, as well as compliance with current national environmental regulations.\n- \u00b7 Controversial Business Topics: It stablishes activities that will not be financed and financing or investment conditions for sectors with a high environmental and social impact.  It  applies  to  financing  and  investment  operations  in  all  segments  of Bancolombia's business lines.\n- \u00b7 Critical Climate Change Industries: It provides credit risk management guidelines for industries with a high climate impact, especially supporting the transition to a lowcarbon  economy  for  sectors  such  as  cement,  energy,  steel,  transportation,  and livestock, aiming to minimize exposure by 2030 in coal production and marketing sectors and the complete elimination of coal-based energy generation by no later than 2040.\n\n## Climate Change Policy in Financing and Investment\n\nIts objective is to identify and manage risks and opportunities related to climate change, allowing us to develop the necessary actions to align the business strategy with the goals established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), particularly  the  Paris  Agreement.  This  policy  covers  our  entire  operation  in  the  countries where we are present, focusing on economic sectors most vulnerable to climate change and those with the highest impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).\n\n## Sustainable Procurement Policy\n\nThis is a key tool for implementing and developing sustainability in Bancolombia's supply chain. Particularly, our sustainable procurement policy defines the following objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Mitigate  Climate  Change  through  responsible  consumption,  with  products  and services that generate a lower carbon footprint.\n- \u00b7 Promote climate change and circular economy strategies in our Supply Chain.\n- \u00b7 Responsible Investment Policy\n\nThis includes the integration of ESG criteria into investment decision-making. As part of the environmental  analysis  of  issuers  and  their  respective  engagement,  segmented  analyses involving the guidelines of our sensitive industries policy are incorporated. Likewise, proxy voting policy includes voting criteria focused on environmental management and climate change.",

In  2023,  we  remained  among  the  27  banks  worldwide  included  in  the  Dow  Jones Sustainability Index.\n\nIn the assessment of our decarbonization strategy by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, our rating improved compared to the previous year, maintaining our position in the top quartile globally.  We  continue  to  advance  our  interest  in  having  a  management  model  that encompasses  international  best  practices:  better  disclosure  of  our  goals  (short-term, medium-term,  Net-zero),  disclosing  the  sectoral  composition  in  our  assets  under management, deadlines, and other aspects related to our policies for excluding coal and unconventional oil and gas resources.\n\nWe base our sustainability  strategy  on  the  best national  and  international  standards.  To achieve this, we have an international agenda of protocols and voluntary commitments that allow us to align with global best practices, make commitments, and disclose results to our stakeholders and the international community.",

Climate Risk Management\n\nAt Bancolombia, we remain committed to managing ESG risks, including those related to climate.  True  to  our  strategy,  we  continue  working  to  strengthen  our  risk  management system in environmental and social aspects that support our sustainability purpose.\n\nWe have designed various tools to assist us in ESG analyses of our customer operations, investment portfolios, and the bank's own physical facilities. This includes implementing the ESG Risk Policy and evaluating the physical risks associated with our facilities and those that may affect our customers.\n\nMoreover,  in  asset  and  wealth  management  areas,  we  have  developed  specific  tools  to enhance our practices. These initiatives encompass policies aligned with the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), identification and measurement of sectors highly sensitive to climate  risk,  continuous  research  on  best  practices,  and  the  promotion  of  impact investments.",

In this map, we consolidate relevant information that complements the management of traditional risks with information on emerging risks.  This  map  is  nourished  by  a  compilation  of  trends  and  the  knowledge  of various experts analyzing future challenges for the organization regarding risks.\n\nThis process is carried out annually to keep the evaluation updated and adjust our strategy with the most significant risks. The results consistently highlight the relevance of climate change as a key risk since 2021.\n\nThe results of the Risk Map drive strategic planning, proactively integrating climate change with traditional risks. This approach strengthens our climate resilience and prepares us for opportunities in a changing business environment.\n\nClimate change risks are classified into two categories: physical risks and transition risks. Physical risk is the possibility of our organization incurring losses due to the materialization of  climate threats. On the other hand, transition risks are related to losses derived from transitioning to a low-carbon economy, which may involve changes in regulation, technology, and the market, necessitating adaptation and mitigation measures.\n\n## Measurement",

Tolerable\n\nRegarding physical risks, climate hazards are projected using representative pathways of greenhouse  gas  concentrations  proposed  by  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate Change (IPCC). These scenarios are used to project different climate threats and evaluate the loss of asset value and/or production losses due to the materialization of any of these hazards.\n\nWe have progressed in defining an automatic model that allows us to evaluate the financial impacts of physical risks on customers more efficiently. During 2023, we analyzed the threats of cyclones, floods, forest fires and increased precipitation in which we were able to evaluate 28.42%  of  customers  and  63.74%  of  the  exposure  of  the  SME,  Business,  Corporate  and Construction segments 8 .\n\nTo evaluate transition risks, we use scenarios suggested by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS 9 )  embraced by the Bank, which describe the projection of carbon prices under different scenarios of measures adoption necessary to mitigate climate change.",

Additionally, environmental risk studies are conducted for properties offered as collateral or as payment in kind.\n\nIn 2023, an intervention was carried out in the environmental and social risk analysis process, aiming for efficiency, control, and quality. The results of the portfolio evaluated through the ESRA process in Colombia total COP 11,000,000 million distributed across 99 operations. The infrastructure  and  energy  sectors  concentrated  the  highest  number  of  operations  and assessed exposure.\n\n## ESG Portfolio Metrics\n\nIn ESG Risk Management for the Asset Management business, we have established various metrics, such as the Internal ESG Issuer Rating Model, Quota Granting Model, Identification and  Measurement  of  Sensitive  Industries,  applied  to  portfolios  that  have  adopted  ESG criteria.\n\nFor  granting  quotas  in  portfolios,  we  use  the  ESG  Rating  of  the  issuer  under  internal methodology  or  MSCI,  or  MSCI  Industrial  Intensity  Methodology,  to  filter  and  segment against the issuer.\n\nLast year, a marking was developed that will allow us to identify, starting its implementation in 2024, that ESG portfolios are not intensive in Climate Change Sensitive Industries. These industries  are  differentiated  from  others  by  allocating  Economic  Activities  (ISIC)  and/or Global  Industry  Classification  Standards  (GICS)  of  the  issuers  defined  in  the  \"ESG  Risk Notice\".\n\n## Physical Risks in Own Facilities",

This advice extends to the teamwork we do with our customers to effectively address challenges and opportunities related to climate change, facilitating a transition to a low-carbon economy and resilience to climate hazards.\n\nFor  issuers,  the  engagement  process  has  created  an  enabling  space  for  the  exchange  of knowledge and discussion of best practices in the implementation of ESG criteria, achieving significant improvement in public information disclosure, greater access to relevant data, and improved risk management. Additionally, this allows us to constantly monitor issuers that are increasing or decreasing their ESG Rating, directly affecting compliance with ESG portfolio  limits  policies  and  Bancolombia's  ESG  Asset  Under  Management  (AUM)  global target and the metrics of the position presented to Senior Management.\n\nLikewise, the business continuity area in collaboration with the fixed assets area, monitor physical facilities, improving their environment and generating reports of possible events, in such a way that risks they may face are identified, assessed, and mitigated promptly.\n\nThroughout 2024, we will persist in incorporating the impacts of climate change into the various business units of the Bank. Specifically, in the area of the commercial portfolio, we will  advance  in  consolidating  the  objective  model  for  physical  risk  assessment,  whose approach has allowed us to transition from personalized customer analysis to mass scope. Additionally,  we  will  initiate  the  development  of  the  objective  assessment  model  for transition risks, with the aim of achieving results comparable to those achieved for physical risks presented in the measurement section of this document.\n\n## 4.

INFORMATION REPORTED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS\n\n## Competitive Report\n\n## Description of the Colombian Financial System\n\nIn  recent  years,  the  Colombian  banking  system  has  expanded  due  to  mergers  and acquisitions in the sector. In 2013, Bancolombia continued its internationalization process by  acquiring  HSBC's  banking  and  insurance  operations  in  Panama  for  USD  2,234  billion. Additionally, Bancolombia Panama acquired 40% of Agromercantil Group's common shares for USD 217 million. In the same year, Grupo Aval acquired 100% of the Guatemalan financial group  Reformador  (the  transaction  was  valued  at  USD  411  million)  and  acquired  BBVA Panam\u00e1 for USD 490 million. Moreover, some competitors began operations in Colombia: Ita\u00fa  BBA  entered  the  market  with  an  investment  bank,  as  did  BNP  Paribas,  CrediCorp acquired Correval (a local securities firm); BTG Pactual, a Brazilian securities firm, acquired Bolsa  y  Renta;  Banco  Santander  re-entered  the  Colombian  market  with  a  bank,  and  the Chilean company Larrain Vial started operations with a securities agency.\n\nIn  2014,  new  entities  entered  the  banking  system,  such  as  the  financing  company Hipotecaria,  specialized  in  mortgage  loans,  which  began  operations  in  March  2014. Additionally, in June, CorpBanca completed the acquisition of Helm Bank, maintaining the CorpBanca brand. That same year, GNB Sudameris Bank acquired 99.9% of HSBC Colombia's capital and began operating under the GBN Colombia brand, while an agreement was signed to operate in Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. In 2015, the Chilean CorpBanca merged with Brazil's Ita\u00fa, and Bancolombia sold 50% of its shares in Tuya S.A. to Colombia's \u00c9xito group. At the end of 2015, Bancolombia also acquired an additional 20% stake in the Agromercantil group, increasing its total stake to 60%.\n\nSome banks underwent transformations over time. One example is Serfinanza, which, until January 2019, was a financing company and in February of that year began operating as the 26th bank in the financial system. Additionally, in 2020, four financing companies underwent changes  in  their  share  structures:  in  January,  Credifinanciera  acquired  Procredit  Bank, renaming  it  Banco  Credifinanciera;  in  April,  Coltefinanciera  acquired  the  rights  and",

Finally,  in  2022,  Banco  Uni\u00f3n,  formerly  known  as  \"Giros  y  Finanzas,\" transitioned from being a commercial financing company to operating as the 29th bank in the financial system.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, according to the SFC, the main participants in the financial system are 29 commercial banks (18 private local banks, 10 foreign banks, 1 local state-owned bank), 5  financial  corporations,  and  17  financing  companies.  Additionally,  trust  companies, cooperatives, insurance companies, insurance brokers and securities intermediaries, special state-owned institutions, and compensation payments and pension funds also participate in the Colombian financial system.\n\n## Market Evolution and Credit Institutions in 2023\n\nIn 2015, Colombian financial institutions began reporting their consolidated financial results under  the  IFRS  framework;  however,  in  the  case  of  credit  institutions  (banks,  financial corporations, financing companies, and 38 financial cooperatives), the SFC has allowed the presentation of independent financial statements under the Colombian banking GAAP basis, according to decree 1851 of August 2013, which regulates law 1314 of 2009. The following information  includes  figures  under  Colombian  banking  GAAP  regulation,  as  reported  by Colombian credit institutions to the SFC.\n\nThe  growth  of  Colombian  credit  institutions'  placements  was  2.4%  in  2023  compared  to 16.9% in 2022. Commercial loan portfolio grew by 3.0% in 2023, compared to 16.7% the previous  year;  consumer  loans  decreased  by  -1.6%  in  2023,  compared  to  18.3%  in  2022; mortgage loans increased by 7.3% in 2023, less than in 2022 (14.6%), and microloans grew by 11.6% in 2023, compared to 14.6% in 2022.\n\nThe level of past-due loans of credit institutions as a percentage of the total loan portfolio increased from 3.67% in December 2022 to 5.20% in November 2023. Additionally, coverage measured by the preventive estimation index for credit risk (overdue 30 days) ended 2023 at 119.41%, compared to 159.94% at the end of 2022.\n\nAs of November 2023, loan portfolios represented 62.82% of assets, a lower proportion than the 63.97% of the previous year. Investments and derivative transactions as a percentage of total assets decreased from 21.15% at the end of 2022 to 20.93% at the end of 2023. Deposits increased their share of liabilities from 70.61% in 2022 to 73.46% in 2023.\n\nAt the same cut-off, credit institutions recorded COP 1,010,000,000 million in total assets, representing a 3.9% increase compared to the previous year. Based on the total assets of Colombian credit institutions, banks have a market share of 94.84%, followed by financial corporations with 3.0%, financing companies with 1.67%, and financial cooperatives with 0.49%.\n\nThe  solvency  ratio  (Tier  1  +  Tier  2)  of  credit  institutions  was  17.40%  in  November  2023 (including banks, financial corporations, financing companies, and financial cooperatives),",

Consolidated-level  revenues  were adversely impacted over the past year mainly due to the deterioration in the credit cycle. Net interest  and  investment income  decreased  by  11.31% in  2023.  Although the  net interest margin  increased  due  to  higher  average  interest  rates,  adverse  asset  quality  conditions implied higher provision expenses and were the primary factor explaining lower net profit for shareholders. The evolution of the portfolio and recovery in the credit cycle will be key factors for the bank's future performance. Below is a brief discussion of recent trends in business and economics.\n\n## Portfolio Performance\n\nThe gross portfolio of loans and financial leases (i.e., before provisions for credit risks and financial leases) reached 253,952,000 million Colombian pesos, decreasing by 5.92% year-onyear. The appreciation of the Colombian peso against the US dollar was 20.54%, explaining the  contraction  in  the  balance  when  considering  that  30.54%  of  the  total  portfolio  is denominated in foreign currency. Excluding the exchange rate effect, the balance would have increased by 0.99%.\n\nUnlike  2022,  all  geographies  where  Bancolombia  is  present  reported  a  very  low  annual increase in their portfolio or even a contraction in the case of Banistmo, following a lower risk  appetite  by  the  bank  and  weak  demand  from  customers.  When  expressed  in  local currency, the consumer portfolio decreased by 8.38%, the commercial portfolio by 5.63%, mortgages by 3.00%, and microloans by 13.80%.\n\nThe portfolio at Bancolombia S.A. expanded by 1.11% during 2023, contracting in real terms. The deceleration compared to 2022 is the result of a more restrictive origination policy due to  growing  concerns  about  asset  quality  and  the  deterioration  of  customers'  repayment capabilities. The consumer loan book showed the most pronounced variation, decreasing by",

        "page_content": "1.55%, consistent with a shift in the policy for disbursing pre-approved loans. The Colombian economy experienced significant deceleration during the year, as high inflation rates, caused by  the  resurgence  of  pent-up  consumption  during  the  pandemic,  were  followed  by contractionary monetary and fiscal policies.\n\nThe  portfolio  at  Banco  Agr\u00edcola  grew  by  1.98%  in  dollars  during  2023.  Consumer  and commercial  placements  performed  similarly,  growing  at  a  slower  pace  compared  to  the previous  year,  although  maintaining  their  market  share  in  the  country.  The  Salvadoran economy has  moderated  its  growth  pace  over  the  last  year  despite  its  resilience  to  the current  global  slowdown  context.  It  is  expected  that  in  the  coming  months,  growth  will further  slow  down  due  to  still-high  inflation,  decreasing  remittance  volumes,  and  lesser expansion from trading partners.\n\nBanistmo's portfolio decreased by 2.02% annually in dollars. Panama was the most affected nation by the pandemic in Central America, and the recovery is still visible with high growth rates over the last 3 years. In 2023, trade and construction were key drivers of the economy. The  performance  of  Banistmo's  loan  portfolio  has  been  impacted  by  an  increasingly competitive  environment  in  the  banking  industry  with  narrowing  yields.  The  bank  has prioritized  improving  its  margins,  considering  segments  with  better  risk  profiles.  The expansion of commercial loans should pick up pace in 2024 as companies anticipate interest rate reductions to increase their debt levels.\n\nBanco Agromercantil grew its portfolio by 2.29% with a mixed dynamic segment by segment. Similar to 2022, the consumer and housing portfolio showed the highest growth while the commercial portfolio decreased. The bank has continued with a strategy of rearranging its portfolio  mix  where  consumer  lending  has  gained  share  within  the  total  balance.  The Guatemalan economy recorded dynamic activity in the first half of 2023, with remittances being a significant driver of household spending. In the second half of the year, there has been a slowdown, largely attributed to political uncertainty and recent social unrest.\n\nThe  portfolio  denominated  in  foreign  currency  decreased  by  3.03%  during  2023.  The performance  of  the  book  in  Bancolombia's  international  banking  operation  in  Panama, Puerto  Rico,  the  dollar-denominated  portfolio  in  Colombia,  and  Banistmo's  operation essentially drove the contraction of the dollar-denominated portfolio at the consolidated level. A better backdrop in the global economy, lower interest rates and stronger domestic demand should drive credit growth at a faster pace in 2024 across the board in both local and foreign currencies for the bank.\n\n## Net Interest Margin and Valuation\n\nMost of the bank's loan book is tied to variable rates, and the pace of repricing of our assets tends to be faster than that of the bank's liabilities.\n\nThe annualized net interest margin at the consolidated level was 6.99% for 2023, increasing compared to the 6.80% reported in 2022.\n\nInterest income increased due to better performance in the credit business. As a year ago, the financial margin with customers progressively increased as reference rates continued their  upward  trend  and  remained  high  throughout  the  year,  while  the  Central  Bank  of",

        "page_content": "Colombia implemented its contractionary monetary policy since 2021, which concluded at the end of 2023.\n\nBancolombia has experienced steady expansion in interest income during this cycle despite the  slow  loan  origination  dynamics  over  the  past  twelve  months.  While  the  bank  has redistributed its share in the loan portfolio in recent years with a heavier weight of consumer loans within the total balance, in 2023 this segment contracted as a conservative approach to reduce its risk appetite amid a deteriorating credit cycle.\n\nIn  the  same  direction  as  rate  hikes,  the  interest  paid  on  interest-bearing  liabilities  grew during the year ending December 31, 2023. It is worth noting that the magnitude of the increase in interest expenses was much lower than the increase in reference rates due to the low sensitivity of a large part of the bank's liabilities.\n\nDuring the past year, there was a continuous shift in the funding mix, as was the case in 2022, as customers demanded higher yields in an environment of high interest rates. Time deposits accounted for 32.5% of total liabilities in 2023, up from 27.9% the previous year. Considering a better liquidity position and low portfolio growth in 2024, stabilization is expected in the capture  of  more  expensive  deposits.  Customer  deposits  represent  81.6%  of  the  bank's liabilities, offering a stable and cost-competitive source of funding.\n\n## Cost of Credit\n\nFor 2023, the cost of credit was 2.84% of the average portfolio, increasing from the 1.56% recorded in 2022. This increase was largely explained by the deterioration of the credit cycle, driving the formation of overdue portfolio in all segments, albeit to a greater extent in the consumer portfolio. The operation in Colombia represented the largest provision expense at the  consolidated  level.  2024  should  be  a  year  of  transition  towards  better  asset  quality metrics, as financial conditions are expected to improve with a positive impact on the bank's risk cost. Bancolombia maintains a strong balance sheet backed by an adequate level of onbalance  sheet  reserves  for  credit  risks,  reporting  a  coverage  ratio  of  overdue  portfolio (overdue by 30 days) of 120% as of December 2023.\n\n## General Discussion of Changes in Results for 2023 versus 2022\n\nDuring  the  past  year,  Bancolombia  maintained  its  strong  competitive  position  and  wide range of financial services amid a challenging global economic environment in the various regions where the group operates. 2023 was marked by a global economic slowdown, high levels  of  inflation,  weak  domestic  demand,  and  credit  contraction.  High  interest  rates significantly affected customers' borrowing capacity in the financial system, deteriorating asset  quality  indicators  and  discouraging  new  originations  across  different  portfolio segments.\n\nFurthermore, after a sharp depreciation in 2022, the Colombian peso experienced a strong rebound during 2023, closing at COP 3,822.05 per dollar, an appreciation of 20.54%.\n\nNet income attributable to Bancolombia shareholders amounted to COP 6,117,000 million (COP 6,420 per share, both ordinary and preferred, and USD 6.72 per ADR), representing a 9.83%  reduction  from  COP  6,783,000  million  in  net  income  attributable  to  Bancolombia shareholders for the 2022 fiscal year.",

This occurs because most of the loan portfolio is at variable rates and, therefore, assets tend to reprice quickly when interest rates rise.\n\nHowever, the slower pace of interest income growth compared to the previous year is due to the 5.92% contraction in the loan portfolio, which, in turn, has a triple explanation; first, weaker credit demand across all segments caused by high interest rates; second, reduced risk appetite given the increased loan delinquency, and third, the strong appreciation of the COP during the period, which reduced the volume of the loan portfolio and the contribution of interest income from dollar-denominated loans to the consolidated book.\n\nIn fact, the consumer portfolio, which provides higher risk-adjusted returns, saw the largest decline with a year-on-year contraction of 8.38% due to the bank's reduced risk appetite, impacting income generation overall.\n\nAs a result, the average nominal interest rate for loans and leasing operations was 13.4%, compared to 10.2% in 2022.\n\nInterest expenses amounted to COP 16.668 trillion, a year-on-year increase of 97.43%, mainly driven by the growth of time deposits that outpaced the growth of all other deposit sources, as customers prioritized products with higher returns. Accordingly, interest paid on costbearing liabilities rose to 5.9% from 3.2% recorded in 2022.\n\nInterest on debt instruments measured by the total effective interest method amounted to COP 1,029,000 million in 2023, 74.83% higher than in 2022, mainly due to higher market rates. In contrast, the total valuation of financial instruments was COP 579,000 million, a 57.53% decrease from 2022, attributable to higher market rates at which the portfolio was discounted.\n\nAs  a  result,  net  interest  and  valuation  income  for  2023  was  COP  20,378,000  million,  an 11.02% increase from COP 18,354,000 million in 2022. This represents a net margin and valuation of 6.99%, increasing by almost 20 basis points compared to the 6.80% recorded in 2022. Despite the loan portfolio contraction and increased interest expenses on deposits due to higher market rates, income generation grew, albeit at a slower pace compared to 2022, mainly  due  to  changes  in  loan  and  financial  leasing  pricing,  interbank  funds  sold,  and investment instrument interest in the portfolio.\n\n## Commissions\n\nFor 2023, gross commission income was COP 7,081,000 million, 11.15% higher than COP 6,371,000 million in 2022. The main source of commission income during the period was associated with the debit and credit card line, including the acquiring business, and card acceptance fees from different issuers. Revenue from this division grew by 10.46% year on year, mainly due to high transaction volume that increased revenue from interbank exchange fees generated by higher domestic and international manual and electronic purchases.\n\nBanking services made a significant contribution to the increase in commissions, largely due to Bancolombia S.A.'s operations, associated, among other factors, with higher revenue from",

        "page_content": "digital  banking.  Bancaseguros  reported  an  increase  during  the  last  year  due  to  good performance in policy renewals, as well as higher revenue from voluntary and mandatory insurance.  Lastly,  the  payments  and  collections  line  reported  a  significant  annual contribution due to increased demand for services such as individual customer bill collection.\n\nFee and commission expense was COP 3,097,000 million in 2023, 19.58% higher than the COP 2,590,000 million in 2022. This increase is mainly due to higher payments in data processing in banking services and higher royalties to credit and debit card franchises due to increased transaction volume. At the same time, sales through outsourced channels and collection services also contributed to the growth in fee expenses. Finally, during the year, there was higher  spending  on  banking  correspondents  due  to  the  higher  number  of  transactions received and the opening of new service points.\n\n## Other Operating Income\n\nFor 2023, total other operating income was COP 3,980,000 million, 93.80% higher than COP 2,053,000  million  in  2022.  Currency  exchange  hedging  operations  reported  in  other operating income resulted in a net positive effect due to exchange rate volatility.\n\nOperating lease income totaled COP 1,771,000 million in 2023, a 29.97% increase over 2022. The  improved  performance  is  the  result  of  incremental  demand  in  vehicle  leasing  and subleasing operations at Bancolombia S.A. and Renting Colombia, and higher rental income from real estate leases.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nFor  2023,  operating  expenses  totaled  COP  12,942,000  million,  18.87%  higher  than  COP 10,888,000 million in 2022.\n\nSalaries and benefits to employees totaled COP 4,410,000 million in 2023, 22.70% higher than in 2022. The result is mainly derived from annual salary increases, as well as updates to actuarial valuations of certain employee benefits resulting in higher expenses for the period. On the other hand, bonuses increased by 14.18% annually based on a performance-based model for generated profitability.\n\nOther administrative and general expenses totaled COP 5,034,000 million in 2023, 10.40% higher  than  in  2022.  This  is  due  to:  (i)  higher  expenses  for  local  taxes  due  to  changes introduced by the 2022 tax reform regarding the industry and commerce tax, (ii) an increase in the vehicle rental division resulting in higher expenses associated with asset impairment and maintenance, and (iii) the continued expansion of projects for business evolution and transformation.\n\nDepreciation and amortization totaled COP 1,125,000 million in 2023, 14.71% higher than in 2022.  This  increase  is  largely  related  to  the  increase  in  operating  leases  and  the  higher depreciation of recognized assets.\n\nAs  a  result  of  changes  in  expenses  and  income,  Bancolombia's  financial  efficiency  costincome ratio for 2023 was 45.33%, an increase compared to 44.58% in 2022.\n\n## Provisions and Portfolio Quality Expenses",

        "page_content": "For 2023, net provisions for portfolio deterioration totaled COP 7,462,000 million (or 2.8% of the average portfolio), representing an increase of 96.79% over COP 3,792,000 million (or 1.6% of the average portfolio) in 2022.\n\nMacroeconomic factors such as high interest rates and economic slowdown have influenced portfolio  deterioration  in  the  various  regions  where  the  bank  operates.  The  significant increase in credit costs for 2023 was mainly explained by the rollover of customers in the consumer segment and most notably in unsecured loans.\n\nNet  portfolio  write-offs  totaled  COP  6,720,000  million  in  2023,  9.01%  more  than  COP 6,165,000 million in 2022.\n\nThe acceleration in the volume of write-offs is due to the increase in harvests of portfolios that reached the required delinquency deadlines and whose recovery probabilities were very low. In 2023, significant progress has been made in collection processes and restructuring alternatives that have prevented further deterioration in the payment of overdue obligations in customers  with  high  delinquency  indices.  Net  write-offs  have  two  important characteristics: first, they reduce the portfolio balance and, second, they help reduce overdue portfolio ratios.\n\nPast due loans amounted to COP 13,700,000 million as of December 31, 2023, 43.04% higher than COP 9,578,000 million as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe past due loan ratio (loans overdue more than 30 days divided by total loans) was 5.39% as  of  December  31,  2023,  up  from  3.55%  as  of  December  31,  2022.  Despite  the implementation of effective measures for the recovery of past due loans and the high writeoffs made during the period, the increase in delinquency rates reflects the high deterioration experienced during 2023, mainly in Colombia, associated with the factors described above.\n\n## Income Tax Expenses\n\nIncome tax expense for the fiscal year 2023 amounted to COP 1,933,000 million, 29.68% less than COP 2,748,000 million in 2022. The effective tax rate for 2023 was 23.72%.\n\nThe explanation for the lower effective tax rate derives from two factors; first, tax benefits in  Colombia  related  to  the  mortgage  portfolio  for  social  housing  and  investments  in productive fixed assets, and second, the higher contribution to consolidated results from foreign subsidiaries with lower statutory rates, which also resulted in a lower tax balance. Additionally, tax benefits from overseas operations are associated with tax-exempt income from  returns  on  securities  issued  by  the  Governments  of  Guatemala,  El  Salvador,  and Panama.\n\nFor additional details, please refer to Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## RESULTS BY OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nThe  Bank  manages  its  business  through  9  main  operating  segments:  Banking  Colombia, Banking El Salvador, Banking Panama, Banking Guatemala, Fiduciary, Investment Banking, Brokerage, International Banking and All Others.",

This increase was mainly reflected in interest income from commercial, consumer and mortgage loans.\n\nTotal interest expenses increased by 112.59% to COP 13,465,000 million from COP 6,334,000 million,  explained by an increase in time deposits in line with the increase in the Central Bank's reference rate in 2023. The net interest margin and valuation of financial instruments reflected a 9.53% increase to COP 15,765,000 million.\n\nThe total charge for credit impairment, net, increased by 118.08% to COP 6,480,000 million from  COP  2,972,000  million.  This  variation  is  mainly  due  to  the  increase  in  credit deterioration in the consumer portfolio and additional charges for macroeconomic variables estimated in risk models.\n\nTotal net commissions increased by 5.58% to COP 2,729,000 million, mainly driven by the performance  in  acceptances  and  bank  guarantees,  which  increased  by  24.09%,  banking services by 23.41%, bancassurance by 13.46%, credit and debit cards by 9.71%, and paymentscollections by 11.52% (digital channels). These increases were offset by fees and commission expenses, which increased by 20.16% compared to the previous year.\n\nOther operational incomes increased significantly to COP 1,576,000 million, mainly due to the exchange difference result and higher income generated by exchange rate derivatives explained  by  higher  levels  of  volatility  in  the  foreign  exchange  market  in  line  with  the uncertainty related to political risk and macroeconomic variables worldwide.\n\nDividends and net income from equity investments increased to COP 18,000 million from COP 8,000 million loss in 2022, mainly explained by income from advantageous purchases in the acquisition of autonomous equity, offset by lower dividend income and by equity method of associates and joint ventures, as a result of macroeconomic conditions that generated lower profits.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 21.51% to COP 8,766,000 million, mainly due to an increase in administrative and general expenses, highlighting the increase in taxes other than income tax, as well as an increase in salaries and benefits to employees.\n\nAssets attributable to Colombian Banking grew by 2.94% during the year, mainly driven by the increase in cash and balances at the central bank and the growth of the loan portfolio, highlighting the performance of the commercial and mortgage portfolio.\n\nFinally, liabilities attributable to Banking Colombia grew 4.30% in 2023, driven by an increase in deposits, leveraged by time deposits.\n\nBanking El Salvador",

investments in debt securities. The loan book in dollars decreased by 2.02%, mainly due to the decrease in the commercial loan balance.\n\nThe total net charge for credit impairment decreased by 50.37% to COP 270,000 million, compared  to  COP  545,000  million  in  2022.  This  variation  is  mainly  explained  by  lower provision charges and higher recoveries from written-off loans.\n\nTotal net commissions increased by 15.83% to COP 274,000 million, driven mainly by higher revenues  generated  by  acquisition  services,  ATM  commissions,  and  insurance  banking; despite an increase in banking services expenses.",

The  loan  portfolio  expressed  in  USD  grew  by  2.29%,  primarily propelled by a 7.77% increase in consumer loans and a 14.57% increase in mortgages.\n\nThe total net credit impairment charge increased by 195.77% to COP 499,000 million, from COP 169,000 million in 2022, due to higher provisions in the consumer portfolio and lower provision reversals compared to 2022.\n\nTotal net commissions increased by 5.24% to COP 134,000 million mainly due to the growth of  electronic  service  commissions  and  ATM  commissions  leveraged  by  the  reduction  in commission expenses for sales and services.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 6.91% to COP 676,000 million, mainly due to increases in salaries and administrative expenses for maintenance.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking Guatemala in COP decreased by 18.23% (increased by 2.91% expressed in USD) during the year, mainly explained by the appreciation of the exchange rate that impacted loans expressed in US dollars.\n\n## Fiduciary:\n\n|
