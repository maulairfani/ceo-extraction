Around the world, day after day, consumers engage with Pernod Ricard's premium brands, creating and maintaining rituals that carry cultural or social weight beyond the mere act of consumption.\n\nAn ap\u00e9ritif shared with friends and relatives on a terrace in France to mark the end of the working day; a shared party to celebrate a birthday, a graduation or Diwali in an Indian home; a family gathering in an outdoor Mexican park. In the three countries that we have chosen to highlight throughout this annual report, as well as in all the markets around the world where our products are sold, the drinks we craft, the brands we build, and the following they generate are essential ingredients to celebrate the art of togetherness.\n\n## We nurture brands that embody a sense of community\n\nAs the global drinks business returns to a steadier pace following three years of post-pandemic revenge conviviality, and in a context of economic, social and political instability, our ability to nurture brands that embody a sense of community makes a real difference. In this less buoyant environment, the global reach of our distribution network and the diversified nature of our portfolio across all key drinks categories enable us to mitigate the impact of weaker trends in some of our highest-contributing markets.\n\nPernod Ricard's business model demonstrated firm resilience last year, as we built on our strengths and intensified our focus on the most dynamic segments of a historically growth-driving industry. We continued to leverage the power of tech and data to uncover new trends and deepen our understanding of what matters most to consumers the world over. This enables us to make more informed and agile decisions, boosting innovation, time to market, and cooperation across regions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Pernod Ricard, we are fundamentally brand builders-our top priority is to increase the power of our brands and continually strengthen their equity.",

        "page_content": "## Our top priority is to increase the power of our brands\n\nAt Pernod Ricard, we are fundamentally brand builders our top priority is to increase the power of our brands and continually strengthen their equity. It's the lesson we learned from Paul Ricard and the many founders behind the brands that are now part of our family.  Their unique stories, traditions, heritage, and terroirs create connections, and bring an inimitable spirit to our brands.\n\nSome of our brands are centuries old, others only a few years or decades, yet they all command devoted followings because they tell stories that speak to today's audiences. Last December, for example, we launched The Chuan, the first prestige malt whisky made in China. Blending the natural and cultural beauty of the Emei Mountain region with our renowned whisky-making craftsmanship, The Chuan comes to life, creating a new legacy for tomorrow. It's this savoir-faire and passion that help us tell the stories that resonate with consumers, enabling our brands to reach the audience they merit.\n\nWe're also constantly innovating our diverse portfolio of international premium spirits brands, regularly introducing innovative offerings to meet emerging trends and consumer demands. In 2024, Absolut and Ocean Spray teamed up to launch a new Vodka Cranberry RTD range, supporting the continuing growth of the ready-todrink category with one of America's favourite cocktails. While in Spain, Beefeater launched a 0.0% alcohol alternative to their legendary dry gin, capturing the brand's timeless energy and taste for those who choose not to drink but still want to be part of the occasion.\n\n## We are a business with a soul\n\nSustainability and responsibility are embedded in everything we do. We firmly believe in making sure our brands are consumed in a responsible way, while fostering an environment where everyone feels safe, heard, and looked after.\n\nWe are grounded in the real-the natural ingredients used to make our products come from the earth and often require years of ageing. Their specific characteristics guide our long-term approach to sustainable growth and are at the root of our culture.\n\nIn the past two years, we have significantly stepped up our investments in our spirits inventories in need of maturation; these are key to our growth and continued premiumisation for decades to come. We have also strengthened our production capacity, while upholding traditional crafts, even as we take new steps to reduce our carbon footprint in line with our 2030 sustainability and responsibility roadmap.\n\nSustainability and responsibility are embedded in everything we do. We firmly believe in making sure our brands are consumed in a responsible way, while fostering an environment where everyone feels safe, heard, and looked after.\n\nOur passion is shared by all our people. We are a business with a soul. Our diversity of talents, perspectives and personalities is central to the growth of our Group. Our unique culture, which is founded on optimism and the pursuit of the extraordinary, is brought to life through human interactions and authentic moments of togetherness. These are the traits that make us Pernod Ricard.  They bring us together and make us stand out. They are the clear competitive advantages that will enable us to continue to succeed.\n\n## Make Pernod Ricard the preferred house of premium brands and experiences\n\nNow more than ever, in a world rife with political and economic challenges, in a world where what drives us apart seems to take precedence over what brings us together, there is a real need for shared rituals, shared pleasures, shared experiences. As Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9 , we bring people together around our brands and provide the spark that ignites unforgettable encounters. We are committed to cultivating these authentic moments where sharing uplifts our spirits.\n\nI am convinced that we are well positioned to face upcoming economic, environmental, and societal challenges thanks to our agility, innovative ways of thinking and, above all, the enthusiasm and determination of all our people across the globe. I am utterly confident that, together, we have the ability to make Pernod Ricard the preferred house of premium brands and experiences.",

These  niche  beverages  offer  an  authentic experience,  in  tune  with  the  tastes  and  expectations  of demanding consumers. They are fast-growing favourites with the potential to become strategic international brands over time.\n\n## 1.3.1.5 Strategic Local Brands\n\nStrategic Local Brands are deeply rooted in a limited number of specific  markets.  They  benefit  from  very  strong  local  consumer loyalty. While not necessarily intended for international distribution,  these  brands  form  a  key  part  of  our  portfolio  and bolster our presence in many strategic markets.",

Combining  Absolut's  highest quality premium vodka with Ocean Spray \u00ae 's real cranberry juice, this  iconic  collaboration  offers  one  of  America's  best  loved drinks  from  two  trusted  brands  that  have  long  been  enjoyed together.\n- \u00b7 our brands' campaigns to promote responsible drinking among their consumers;\n- \u00b7 measures  to  prevent  the  online  sale  and  delivery  of  our products to underaged individuals;\n- \u00b7 annual participation by all Group affiliates in at least one local initiative  and  one  global  initiative  on  responsible  drinking, rolled out by our various marketing departments;\n- \u00b7 the  'Responsible  Host'  label  to  guarantee  best  practices  in responsible drinking for visitors to our Brand Homes.\n- \u00b7 Martell  Grands  Crus.  Martell,  one  of  the  Group's  emblematic strategic  international  brands,  has  explored  a  new  way  of expressing the authentic essence of the terroir of the Cognac region with its new Single Cru range launched in August 2023. For the first time, each cognac in this collection is made from eaux-de-vie from  a  single  type  of  soil (cru) ,  representing  a milestone in the brand's 300-year history.\n- \u00b7 Midleton pays tribute to the For\u00eat de Tron\u00e7ais: with a limited number  of  bottles  available,  Midleton  Very  Rare  For\u00eat  de Tron\u00e7ais  is  a  luxurious  and  special  edition  resulting  from  the intertwinement of Irish delicacy and French craftsmanship. The exceptional  casks,  produced  in  limited  series  from  Tron\u00e7ais wood, are filled with a batch of Midleton single grain and single pot still whiskies distilled in the 1980s and 2000s. The whiskey is then bottled in a teal-coloured bottle, inspired by the orchid in the  Midleton  Very  Rare  logo,  and  placed  in  a  box  also  made from Tron\u00e7ais oak, alongside laser-cut illustrations inspired by the forest.",

In  1966,  the Group's founder, Paul Ricard, set up his eponymous Oceanographic Institute to help protect the oceans. Today, this commitment drives our performance and transformation.\n\nOur  2030  Good  Times  from  a  Good  Place  S&R  strategy  is embedded in all our activities, from grain to glass. Built on four pillars  (Nurturing  Terroir,  Valuing  People,  Circular  Making,  and Responsible  Hosting)  and  around  40  indicators,  this  roadmap addresses  both  the  needs  and  expectations  of  our  consumers, and  the  material  S&R  risks  facing  the  Group.  Each  pillar  sets ambitious commitments for 2030 in line with the United Nations Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  with  key  milestones for 2025. This commitment is essential to securing our long-term success, business resilience and legacy, while limiting our impact on natural resources.\n\nFive years after its launch, we have already achieved - and even exceeded - some of our objectives, and we are doing everything we can to meet the remaining targets. We listen carefully to our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstakeholders and closely monitor changes in the world around us so that we can adjust and strengthen our S&R commitments in line  with  our  strategy.  In  November  2020,  for  example,  a  CSR Committee  was  created  to  support  the  Board  of  Directors  on these  issues,  and  executive  compensation  and  annual  bonuses are now indexed to S&R performance. These commitments have also led to the inclusion of S&R within the Integrated Operations function,  enabling  the  Group  to  act  as  closely  as  possible  to  its value chain.\n\nThis  strengthened  governance  structure  illustrates  the  Group's ambition  to  continue  to  invest  in  transitioning  to  regenerative agriculture  and  innovation  to  drive  circularity,  and  harnessing new  technologies  for  a  net-zero  future  -  while  always  putting people first.\n\nDuring FY 2024, we made further progress in all areas of our S&R roadmap.",

This strategy is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 an  efficient  growth  model,  combining  the  industry's  most comprehensive  brand  portfolio,  the  most  extensive  route  to market and a strong corporate culture;\n- \u00b7 sustainable and responsible growth;\n- \u00b7 consumer-centricity, as our consumers inspire the continuous improvement of our products; and\n- \u00b7 the  Conviviality  Platform,  which  leverages  the  power  of  data and  new  technologies  to  get  more  from  our  core  business, while pioneering new avenues of growth.\n- \u00b7 active  management of our brand portfolio.

This fundamental move helped to instil in all employees a collective, inclusive and purposeful culture of conviviality. We do more than producing  and  selling  wine  and  spirits;  we  transform  every moment, every occasion, into a unique convivial experience.\n\n## 1.5.1.2 Transform & Accelerate\n\nIn  2019,  we  launched  our  second  three-year  strategic  plan, Transform & Accelerate. It was aimed at accelerating our profitable growth with an emphasis on efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nThis  step  focuses  on  four  growth  accelerators:  active  portfolio management, brand premiumisation, innovation, and accelerated digital transformation.\n\nOur more than 19,577 employees are proud ambassadors of our culture  of  conviviality.

The aim is to achieve precision at scale, meaning being able to better understand our consumers' and customers' preferences and fulfil their needs with precision. This will ensure we can deliver the right brand or experience to the right person, in the right place at the right time, and at the right price.' Alexandre Ricard, Chairman & CEO of Pernod Ricard.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.5.2.1 Our strategic priorities: pursue Transform & Accelerate\n\nPernod  Ricard  defines  strategic  priorities  in  order  to  adapt  to structural  changes  in  demand,  consumption  patterns  and technology chains, across the globe.\n\n## Data and AI: a new competitive advantage for accelerated, data-driven growth\n\nFaced with increasingly fragmented consumer demand, the use of  data  (collected  in  compliance  with  legal  and  regulatory requirements)  and  ethically  developed  artificial  intelligence  (AI) are  the  keys  to  analysing  the  needs  of  our  consumers  and optimising our business performance.\n\nThe augmented precision provided by these tools means we can offer the right product to each consumer at the right time, in the right place and at the right price in every market. This means that we can better anticipate trends and increase speed and agility in decision-making.\n\nFor  example,  we  have  developed  tools  based  on  AI  and  data analytics  for  our  sales  and  marketing  teams  to  improve  their efficiency  and  better  understand  consumer  preferences.  Our Maestria brand portfolio management tool, based on consumer demand segmentation, allows us to activate the right brands at the  right  time  and  in  the  right  place,  thanks  to  an  in-depth understanding  of  consumer  aspirations.  And  the  Matrix,  Vista Rev-Up and D-Star tools are used to optimise the effectiveness of our marketing investments, our promotional campaigns and our sales force on the ground. To successfully execute this new phase of  digital  acceleration  and  acquire  key  skills  for  the  future,  we have  recruited  150  in-house  experts  and  launched  a  major training programme to up-skill our staff.",

The  tool identified an opportunity to market Scotch whisky in 300 major stores in the West Bengal region. Our sales teams then used this  information  to  promote  Ballantine's  whiskey  to  these accounts,  resulting  in  successful  conversion  and  additional billing in the majority of stores identified.\n- \u00b7 Another example is Matrix, which enabled the Group to amplify the  impact  of  its  marketing  investments  in  Japan.  The marketing  effectiveness  of  our  brands  increased  by  7%  in FY 2024, enabling us to invest in more brands and reach more consumers, helping drive net sales growth of 20%.\n\n## Continuing to get more value out of our existing portfolio\n\nOur existing portfolio still harbours significant growth potential, which can be tapped via three accelerators:\n\n## Activating more brands with the right level of investment\n\nWe  use  our  in-house  tool,  the  House  of  Brands,  to  ensure optimum resource allocation across all our markets. Along with our in-depth knowledge of local trends, the Maestria tool helps us  define  an  appropriate  investment  strategy  and  allocate  the right  amount  of  marketing  and  communication  resources according to  each  brand's  profile.

To achieve this, the Group plans to develop even more premium brands  at  scale.  We  will  also  continue  to  grow  the  rest  of  our portfolio,  by  innovating  and  seizing  external  opportunities  to cover all consumer needs.\n\nThe Group's medium-term ambitions (7) are:\n\n- 1. net sales growth in the upper end of a range of between 4% and 7%, and an organic operating margin expansion of 50 to 60 bps;\n- 2. a priority focus on revenue growth management, dynamically optimised using new digital tools;\n- 3. continuous improvement in operational efficiencies, building on the Group's culture of excellence;\n\nOur strategy and associated targets\n\nright  balance  between  our  short-,  medium-  and  long-term objectives, while building brands capable of standing out in our key regions.\n\n## Maximising our pricing power\n\nAmid the current inflationary pressures, optimising our brands' pricing  power  has  become  a  priority  in  our  premiumisation strategy. Digital tools enable us to fine-tune our pricing strategy and ramp up the efficiency of promotions.\n\n## Growing our positions in the Prestige market\n\nWe  are  a  leading  Ultra  Premium  Plus  company,  thanks  to  an unrivalled  portfolio  of  brands  spanning  cognac,  champagne, whisky  and  tequila.  In  this  highly  dynamic  category,  which  is protected by high barriers to entry (e.g., geographical origin and the need for long-term strategic inventories), we are seeking to improve our positioning in all geographies.\n\n## Pioneering new avenues of growth to prepare the future\n\nThe  second  aspect  of  our  growth  model  is  structured  around three areas designed to pioneer new avenues of growth:\n\n- \u00b7 scaling up innovation;\n- \u00b7 broadening our coverage of the route to market;\n- \u00b7 expanding our offering to include experiences and services.\n- 4. advertising  and  promotion  (A&P)  expenses  consistent  at around 16% of net sales, with the ratio dynamically optimised through new digital tools for improved return on investment;\n- 5. disciplined investments in structure costs, allowing the Group to  pursue  priority  investments  while  maintaining  an  agile organisation, with the aim of keeping any increase in these costs lower than that of net sales.\n\nOur  financial  policy  sets  out  four  priorities  (assuming  an investment grade credit rating is maintained), namely: (i) investing  in  future  organic  growth,  particularly  through strategic inventories and capital expenditure, (ii) pursuing active portfolio  management  and  value-creating  M&A  transactions, (iii)  maintaining  a  dividend  payout  ratio  of  around  50%  of  net profit from recurring operations, with the aim of increasing the dividend each year, and (iv) carrying out share buybacks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It was approved by the Board of Directors on 28 August 2024, following the examination  by  the  Board's  Committees  of  the  sections  relating  to  their  respective  areas  of  competence  and  was  provided  to  the Statutory Auditors.\n\n## 2.1 Our governance\n\n## 2.1.1 Governance framework and structure as of 30 June 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Further to the entry into force of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the Audit Committee and the CSR Committee will hold a joint meeting once a year to review and validate the Group's compliance and, in particular, to review sustainability reporting.\n\n## 2.1.1.1 Reference Corporate Governance Code: the AFEP-MEDEF Code\n\nOn  12  February  2009,  Pernod  Ricard's  Board  of  Directors  confirmed  that  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Corporate  Governance  Code  for  listed companies published in December 2008 and last revised in December 2022 (the 'AFEP-MEDEF Code'), available on the AFEP and MEDEF websites,  is  the  Code  to  which  Pernod  Ricard  refers  for  corporate  governance  issues,  notably  for  preparing  the  report  required  by Article L. 225-37 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  'comply  or  explain'  rule  set  forth  in  Article  L.  22-10-10  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  and  referred  to  in Article 28.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Company considers that its practices comply with all the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.1.2 Governance structure\n\n## A combined-role structure adapted to the Group's organisation\n\nAs  French  regulations  do  not  favour  any  specific  general management structure for listed companies, it is the responsibility of  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  to  choose  between  a combined-role structure where one person holds the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or a structure where those positions are separated and held by different people.\n\nFollowing the expiry of Pierre Pringuet's term of office as Chief Executive  Officer  and  Dani\u00e8le  Ricard's  expressed  wish  to  step down from her position as Chairwoman of the Board of Directors, at its meeting on 11 February 2015, the Board decided to combine the  positions  of  Chairman  and  CEO  in  order  to  simplify  the decision-making  process  and  enhance  the  effectiveness  and reactivity  of  the  Company's  governance.  At  the  same  meeting, the  Board  appointed  Alexandre  Ricard  as  Chairman  &  CEO.  In order to ensure good governance of the Company, the Board of Directors  set  limits  on  the  powers  of  the  Chairman  &  CEO,  by requiring that the Board's prior authorisation be obtained for a certain number of transactions, notably external growth transactions and divestments representing amounts greater than \u20ac100 million, and  loans  exceeding  \u20ac200  million  (see  subsection  below 'Limitation on the powers of the Chairman & CEO'). At its meeting on 23 January 2019, the Board of Directors then appointed Patricia Barbizet  as  Lead  Independent  Director,  again  to  ensure  good governance of the Company.\n\nThe Company has also put in place a number of guarantees to help the Chairman & CEO perform his duties as Chief Executive Officer.  In  FY  2024,  he  was  supported  by  the  Executive Committee.  The  Executive  Committee,  which  is  the  permanent body responsible for coordinating and managing the Group, sets the Group's strategic objectives in line with the priorities decided by the Board of Directors, coordinates their implementation and steers the Group's overall performance. Its members are global heads of  the  Group's  corporate  functions,  operational  divisions and geographic regions.\n\n## A balance of powers ensured by a balanced governance structure\n\n## Powers of the Chairman & CEO\n\nIn  his  capacity  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the Chairman & CEO organises and leads the Board's work, on which he reports to the Shareholders' Meeting. He oversees the proper operation  of  the  Company's  managing  bodies  and  ensures,  in particular, that the Directors are in a position to fulfil their duties. He can also request any document or information which can be used to help the Board prepare its meetings.\n\nIn his capacity as Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman & CEO has full powers to act in the name of the Company in all circumstances. He  exercises  these  powers  within  the  limits  of  the  corporate purpose and subject to (i) the powers expressly granted by law to the  Shareholders'  Meetings  and  to  the  Board,  and  (ii)  internal limits  as  defined  by  the  Board  of  Directors  in  its  Internal  Rules and Regulations (1) .\n\n## Limitation on the powers of the Chairman & CEO\n\nFor internal purposes, following the decision made by the Board of Directors on 11 February 2015 and in accordance with Article 2 of the Board's Internal Rules and Regulations (1) , prior to making a commitment  on  behalf  of  the  Company,  the  Chairman  &  CEO must obtain the authorisation from the Board of Directors for any significant transactions that fall outside the strategy announced by the Company, as well as the following transactions:\n\n- \u00b7 carrying  out  any  acquisitions  or  disposals  of  investments  or assets for an amount exceeding \u20ac100 million per transaction;\n- \u00b7 entering into any partnerships or resource-pooling transactions when  the  Company's  contribution  (other  than  through  an acquisition  or  investment  covered  by  the  previous  point) represents a financial commitment exceeding \u20ac100 million per transaction;\n- \u00b7 granting loans, credits or advances exceeding \u20ac100 million per borrower, except when the borrower is an affiliate of Pernod Ricard (as defined in Article L. 233-1 of the French Commercial Code)  and  with  the  exception  of  loans  granted  for  less  than one year;\n- \u00b7 putting  in  place  borrowings,  with  or  without  using  corporate assets  as  collateral,  exceeding  \u20ac200  million  in  the  same financial  year,  except  borrowings  from  affiliates  of  Pernod Ricard (as defined in Article L. 233-1 of the French Commercial Code), for which there is no limit; and\n- \u00b7 granting  pledges,  sureties  or  guarantees,  except  with  an express  delegation  of  authority  from  the  Board  of  Directors within the limits provided for by Articles L. 225-35 and R. 225-28 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nOn  10  November  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  authorised  the Chairman & CEO, for a period of one year, to grant pledges, sureties or guarantees in the name of the Company up to an overall limit of \u20ac100 million, and for an unlimited amount to tax and customs authorities.\n\n## Role, responsibilities and activity report of the Lead Independent Director\n\nAt  its  meeting  on  23  January  2019,  based  on  a  proposal  of    the Nominations  and  Governance  Committee,  the  Board  created the  position  of  Lead  Independent  Director  and  entrusted  it  to Patricia Barbizet.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Internal  Rules  and  Regulations (1) of  the Board of Directors, the Lead Independent Director performs the following tasks:\n\n- \u00b7 calls Board of Directors' meetings at her own initiative or in the absence of the Chairman & CEO;\n- \u00b7 is  consulted  on  the  agenda  of  Board  meetings  and  may propose any additional items on said agenda;\n- \u00b7 chairs meetings of the Board of Directors in the absence of the Chairman & CEO;\n- \u00b7 leads the process of assessing the operating procedures of the Board of Directors and reports on this assessment to the Board;",

She  has  also  conducted the annual assessments of the operating procedures of the Board of Directors on the basis of  individual  interviews  with  each  Director  as  set  out  in subsection 2.1.3.5 'Assessment of the Board of Directors'.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director reports to the Board of Directors once a year on the performance of her duties. At Shareholders' Meetings, she may be invited by the Chairman & CEO to report on her activities. If the Lead Independent Director were no longer classified  as  an  independent  Director,  her  duties  as  Lead Independent Director would be terminated immediately.\n\n## Employee representation on the Board\n\nThe appointment of a Director or Directors representing employees on the Board of Directors was introduced at the end of 2013. As a result, Pernod Ricard SA employees are now represented on the Board of Directors by a single person, currently, Paula Reisen.\n\n## Group management structure\n\n## General Management\n\nAt 30 June 2024, the Group's general management function was carried  out  by  the  Chairman  &  CEO,  assisted  by  the  Executive Committee.\n\n## Executive Committee\n\nThe  Executive  Committee  is  the  permanent  body  responsible for  coordinating  and  managing  the  Group  and  assists  the Chairman & CEO with his duties and responsibilities.

It  also  appointed  Max  Koeune  for  a  term  of four years, expiring at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2027 to approve the financial statements for FY 2027.\n\n## During FY 2024\n\nAs the terms of office as Directors of Virginie Fauvel, Alexandre Ricard and C\u00e9sar Giron are due to expire at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting of 8 November 2024, this Shareholders' Meeting will be asked (in the 4 th ,  5 th and 6 th resolutions), in accordance with the recommendations of the Nominations and Governance Committee, to renew their terms of office as Directors for a term of four years expiring at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2028 to approve the financial statements for FY 2028.\n\nVirginie  Fauvel  brings  to  the  Board  her  extensive  expertise  in technology  and  digital  transformation  and  is  a  well-known member  of  the  fintech  community.  C\u00e9sar  Giron  brings  to  the Board his in-depth knowledge of the Group's industry and one of its key markets.\n\nFollowing a review, the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors confirmed that Virginie Fauvel meets the AFEP-MEDEF independence criteria adopted by the Company.\n\nIf the shareholders approve the above recommendations, at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting of 8 November 2024, the Board of Directors would comprise 14 members (including two Directors representing employees), of which seven independent Directors (58.33%) (2) and  six  women  (50%) (2) , in  accordance  with  the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the French law on  balanced  representation  of  women  and  men  on  Boards  of Directors and gender equality in the workplace. Additionally, six Directors  would  be  of  non-French  nationality  (including  the Directors representing employees).\n\n## 2.1.2.3 General rules concerning the composition of the Board of Directors and the appointment of Directors\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are listed in subsection 2.1.2.1 'Composition of the Board of Directors and its Committees' above.\n\nThe rules applicable to appointing members of the Board of Directors and removing them from office are the legal rules applicable in France and those set out in Articles 16 et seq .  of  the Company's Bylaws (3) . They are described below. The Board comprises no fewer than  three  and  no  more  than  18  members,  unless  otherwise authorised  by  law.  In  accordance  with  the  Company's  Bylaws, each Director must own at least 50 Company shares in registered form.  However,  the  Board's  Internal  Rules  and  Regulations (4) recommend that,  during  their  term  of  office  and  no  later  than two years following their appointment, Directors acquire a number of  Company  shares  at  least  equivalent  to  one  year's  worth  of compensation (fixed and variable portions) payable to a Director who has attended all meetings of the Board of Directors (excluding compensation related to participation in Committees) (5) .\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are appointed by shareholders in  an  Ordinary  Shareholders' Meeting and are proposed by the Board  of  Directors  following  the  recommendations  of  the Nominations and Governance Committee. They can be removed from office at any time by decision of a Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nIn  accordance with the French law of 22 May 2019 on business growth  and  transformation  (PACTE  law)  and  the  Company's Bylaws (3) , the number of Directors representing employees depends\n\non  the  total  number  of  Directors  on  the  Board.  Given  the composition  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  there  have  been  two Directors  representing  employees  since  2018.  One  is  appointed by the Group Committee (France) and the other by the European Works Council.\n\nA representative of the Company's Economic and Social Committee attends the meetings of the Board of Directors in an advisory role.\n\nThe Board of Directors may, upon proposal of its Chairman, appoint one  or  more  non-voting  Board  members,  who  may  be  either individuals or legal entities and who may or may not be shareholders.\n\nThe  term  of  office  of  Directors  is  four  years.  However,  on  an exceptional  basis,  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  may,  based  on  a proposal by the Board of Directors, appoint certain Directors or renew  their  terms  of  office  for  a  period  of  two  years  so  as  to enable a staggered renewal of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Nominations  and  Governance Committee regularly assess the composition of the Board and its Committees as well as the different skills and experience of each Director. They also identify the guidelines to be issued in order to ensure  the  best  balance  possible  by  seeking  complementary profiles  from  both  international  and  diversity  perspectives  in terms of nationality, gender, and experience.",

        "page_content": "## Selection process for members of the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code's  recommendations, the Nominations and Governance Committee has put in place a procedure for selecting future members of the Board of Directors in the event of a vacancy of any kind or for new appointments.\n\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee sets formal selection criteria for new directorship candidates with the aim of achieving balanced representation and complementarity between the different profiles on the Board. Regarding the determination of the selection criteria, the Nominations and Governance Committee takes into account the Board of Directors' diversity policy, not only in terms of expertise and experience, but also in terms of independence, gender  representation,  nationality  and  seniority,  as  well  as  any specific expectations of the Board expressed during the assessment of its operating procedures.\n\nOnce the  needs  of  the  Board  of  Directors  have  been  identified and the selection criteria formalised, the Nominations and Governance Committee, with the support of a firm specialised in the recruitment of Directors, draws up a list of potential candidates. The Committee then organises interviews with the shortlisted candidates to ascertain their  independence,  availability,  motivation  and  commitment  to the Group's values.\n\nFollowing these interviews and after having reviewed the different profiles,  the  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee  makes its  recommendations  to  the  Board  of  Directors  regarding  the appointment of one or more candidates. The Board then analyses the  various  profiles  that  have  been  submitted  and  proposes the  appointment  of  the  final  candidates  to  the  Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Continuous training for Directors\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Internal  Rules  and  Regulations (6) of  the Board of Directors, each Director may, if they consider it necessary, receive  training  on  the  specific  features  of  the  Company,  its businesses and its business sector at the time of their appointment and throughout their term of office.\n\nThey may also, if they wish, meet with the Heads of the Company's operational  teams,  after  having  informed  the  Chairman  of  the Board of Directors.\n\nIn  FY  2024,  Brice  Thommen  attended  a  training  course  at  the Institut  Fran\u00e7ais  des  Administrateurs (IFA)  entitled  'Governance and Strategy'. In addition, all of the Directors took part in training on the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which was split into two parts - one on the directive itself and the other on the role of the Board and its Committees.\n\n## Succession plan\n\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee, at the initiative of its Chair, who is the Lead Independent Director, periodically reviews the  Group's  succession  plan.  This  allows  her  to  establish  and update a succession plan covering several time horizons:\n\n- \u00b7 short term: unexpected succession (resignation, incapacity, death);\n- \u00b7 medium  term:  accelerated  succession  (poor  performance, misconduct); and\n- \u00b7 long term: planned succession (retirement, end of term of office).\n\nThe  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee  works  in  close collaboration  with  General  Management  in  order  to  ensure overall  consistency of the succession plan and continuity in key positions. In order to make sure that the succession plan for the Group's management bodies is prepared in the best way possible and  is  in  line  with  the  Company's  strategic  goals,  a  regular assessment  of  potential  candidates  and  their  career  paths  is carried out with the assistance of an independent firm.\n\nIn addition, the Nominations and Governance Committee works closely  with  the  Board  of  Directors  on  this  subject,  and  is particularly  vigilant  in  maintaining  the  confidentiality  of  the information concerned.",

Virginie Fauvel, Alexandre Ricard and C\u00e9sar Giron as Directors are subject to the approval of the Shareholders' Meeting of 8 November 2024.\n- (2) Given  the  passive  crossing  of  the  10%  voting  rights  threshold  by  GBL  in  February  2017  by  virtue  of  automatic  acquisition  of  double  voting  rights,  the  Nominations  and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors examined this specific independence criterion and, in order to qualify Ian Gallienne as an independent Director, they established that GBL does not participate in the control of Pernod Ricard and does not intend to do so, that GBL has no relation with any other shareholder or the Ricard family,  the  Group's  reference  shareholder,  and  that  there  are  no  potential  conflicts  of  interest  that  could  compromise  his  freedom  of  judgement.  At  the  close  of  the Shareholders' Meeting to be held on 8 November 2024, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, Ian Gallienne will no longer qualify as an independent Director as he will have been a member of the Board of Directors for 12 years.\n- (3) Patricia Ricard Giron has been the permanent representative of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard, a Director, since 21 December 2021.\n- (4) In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Directors representing employees are not taken into account when calculating the percentage of independent Directors on the Board of Directors.\n\nDuring the annual Directors' independence review, and as in the previous financial year, the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors raised the question of the independence of Ian Gallienne, a Director with ties to GBL, given the passive crossing of  the  10%  voting  rights  threshold  by  GBL  in  February  2017  by virtue  of  the  automatic  acquisition  of  double  voting  rights.  Ian Gallienne's experience in finance as well as his in -depth knowledge of the Group are an asset to Pernod Ricard's Board of Directors.\n\nAccording to the AFEP-MEDEF Code, Directors representing major shareholders  of  the  Company  may  be  considered  as  being independent, provided that these shareholders do not take part in the control of the Company (criterion 8). Whenever a threshold of 10% of the Company's share capital or voting rights is crossed, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nominations and Governance Committee, is required to systematically review a  Director's  independence  in  light  of  the  composition  of  the Company's share capital and the existence of a potential conflict of interest.\n\nAccordingly, it has been established that GBL does not participate in the control of Pernod Ricard and does not intend to do so as stated in the notification of threshold crossing and declaration of intent published by the AMF on 23 February 2017:\n\n- \u00b7 GBL has no relation with any other shareholder or the Ricard family, the Group's reference shareholder;\n- \u00b7 Ian  Gallienne  does  not  chair  any  of  the  Board  Committees and  is  not  a  member  of  the  Nominations  and  Governance Committee; and\n\n- \u00b7 GBL does not intend to ask for the appointment of other Directors to sit on the Board.\n\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors also noted the absence of conflicts of interest, as:\n\n- \u00b7 crossing the threshold of 10% of voting rights is not likely to create a conflict of interest;\n- \u00b7 there is no significant business relationship between GBL and Pernod Ricard or its Group that could create a conflict of interest that could compromise Ian Gallienne's freedom of judgement;\n- \u00b7 GBL's entry into the Company's capital was made independently of any agreement with Pernod Ricard or the Ricard family;\n- \u00b7 GBL has the reputation of being a diligent and demanding investor whose interests are aligned with those of all shareholders;\n- \u00b7 there is no agreement between GBL and Pernod Ricard or the Ricard family relating to the presence of Ian Gallienne or one or  more  GBL  representatives  on  the  Board  of  Directors.  The presence of Ian Gallienne is justified by his experience and his judgement, which are beneficial to the Board of Directors; and\n- \u00b7 Ian  Gallienne  is  not  in  a  position  to  impose  his  views  on  the Board  of  Directors,  which  has  15  members  (including  the Directors representing employees).",

        "page_content": "Thus, these elements demonstrate freedom of judgement and an absence of an actual or potential conflict of interest. In addition, there  are  no  new  facts  or  circumstances  likely  to  call  into question the qualification of independence applied in the past.\n\nGiven these facts, the Nominations and Governance Committee and  the  Board  of  Directors  considered  that  Ian  Gallienne  fully meets the 'specific' independence criteria related to the crossing of the threshold of 10% of share capital or voting rights.\n\nAfter consideration and review of the AFEP-MEDEF Code criteria set out above, at its meeting on 17 July 2024, in accordance with the  recommendation  of  the  Nominations  and  Governance Committee, the Board confirmed that eight out of the 13 Directors (excluding the Directors representing employees) are deemed to be  independent:  Patricia  Barbizet,  Virginie  Fauvel,  Anne  Lange, Kory  Sorenson,  Namita  Shah,  Ian  Gallienne,  Max  Koeune  and Philippe Petitcolin, representing more than half of the Board of Directors (61.54%), as required by the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n## A wide range of complementary skills fully in line with Pernod Ricard's strategy\n\nThe Board of Directors pays particular attention to the selection of its members. In addition to their ability to take into account the interests of all stakeholders, Directors are selected for their skills, experience and understanding of the Group's strategic challenges, and to reflect the diversity of the Group as a whole.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A diversified and balanced Board of Directors\n\nAs  indicated  in  the  Board  of  Directors'  diversity  policy,  this balanced  representation  has  been  achieved  gradually.  At  the close  of  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  8  November  2024,  if the  proposed  resolutions  are  approved,  the  Board  of  Directors will  comprise  14  members,  including  six  women  (50%),  which complies  with  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code and the law on balanced representation of women and men on Boards of Directors and gender equality in the workplace.\n\n## Nationality of Directors\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Board  of  Directors  must  be  diverse, reflecting, as far as possible, the different geographical areas in which  the  Group  operates.  At  the  close  of  the  Shareholders' Meeting  of  8  November  2024,  if  the  proposed  resolutions  are approved  six  Directors  will  be  of  non-French  nationality (including the Directors representing employees).\n\n## Age of Directors\n\nIn accordance with the Company's Bylaws, the average age of the Directors at 30 June 2024 was 56.40.",

Each Director acknowledges that they have read and understood their obligations under these provisions prior to accepting their position. The Internal Rules and Regulations also outline the various rules in force with regard to the conditions for trading  in  the  Company's  shares  on  the  stock  market  and  the notification and disclosure requirements relating thereto.\n\nMoreover,  at  its  meeting  on  16  February  2011,  the  Board  of Directors adopted a Code of Ethics to prevent insider trading and misconduct  in  line  with  the  applicable  legal  obligations  and  in particular  to  comply  with  European  market  abuse  regulations. This Code was last updated on 14 February 2024.\n\nDirectors, as well as any person attending meetings of the Board and  its  Committees,  have  access  to  sensitive  information concerning the Company. As such, they are bound by a strict duty of  confidentiality.  Consequently,  they  must  take  all  necessary measures to preserve the confidentiality of this information.\n\nAs the Directors have access to sensitive information on a regular basis, they must refrain from using this information to buy or sell shares of the Company and from carrying out transactions involving Pernod Ricard's shares or any related financial instruments in the 45  days  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  full-year  results,  the 30  days  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  interim  results  and  the 15  days  prior  to  the  publication  of  quarterly  net  sales.  These periods  are  extended  to  include  the  day  after  the  publication when it takes place after the close of market trading (5.30 p.m., Paris time) and to the day of the publication when it takes place before  the  opening  of  the  markets  (9.00  a.m.,  Paris  time).  In addition, the Code of Ethics states that Directors must seek the opinion  of  the  Trading  Committee,  formerly  called  the  Ethics Committee,  before  carrying  out  any  transactions  involving  the Company's shares or any related financial instrument.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nTo the Company's knowledge and at the date hereof, there are no potential conflicts of interest between the duties of any of the members  of  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  or  General Management  with  regard  to  the  Company  in  their  capacity  as Corporate Officer and their private interests or other duties.\n\nTo the Company's knowledge and at the date hereof, there are no  arrangements  or  agreements  established  with  the  main shareholders, customers, suppliers, bankers or consultants, relating to  the  appointment  of  any  of  the  members  of  the  Board  of Directors or General Management.\n\nTo the Company's knowledge and at the date hereof, except as described in the 'Shareholders' agreements' subsection below, the members of the Board of Directors and General Management have  not  agreed  to  any  restrictions  concerning  the  disposal  of their stake in the share capital of the Company, other than those included  in  the  Internal  Rules  and  Regulations (9) and  the  Code of Ethics.\n\nIn accordance with the Board's Internal Rules and Regulations (9) and  in  order  to  prevent  any  risk  of  conflict  of  interest,  each member of the Board of Directors is required to declare to the Board of Directors, as soon as they become aware of such fact, any situation in which a conflict of interest arises or could arise between the  Company's  corporate  interests  and  their  direct  or indirect  personal  interests,  or  the  interests  of  a  shareholder  or group of shareholders that they represent.\n\n## Absence of any conviction for fraud, involvement in bankruptcy or any offence and/or official public sanction\n\nTo Pernod Ricard's knowledge and at the date hereof:\n\n- \u00b7 no conviction for fraud has been issued against any members of the Company's Board of Directors or General Management in the last five years;\n- \u00b7 none  of  the  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  or  General Management has been associated, in the last five years, with any bankruptcy, compulsory administration or liquidation as a member  of  a  Board  of  Directors,  Management  Board  or Supervisory Board or as a Chief Executive Officer;\n- \u00b7 no conviction and/or official public sanction has been issued in the  last  five  years  against  any  members  of  the  Company's Board of Directors or General Management by statutory or regulatory authorities (including designated professional organisations); and\n- \u00b7 no Director or member of the General Management has, in the last five years, been prohibited by a court of law from serving as a member of a Board of Directors, a Management Board or Supervisory Board or from being involved in the management or the conduct of an issuer's business affairs.\n\n## Procedure to identify regulated related-party agreements\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 22-10-12 of the French Commercial Code, at its meeting on 28 August 2019, the Board of Directors approved  an  Internal  Charter  relating  to  the  identification  of regulated  related-party  agreements  (the  'Charter') (10) . This Charter  formalises  the  procedure  for  identifying  regulated related-party  agreements,  which  applies  prior  to  signing  any agreements  that  could  potentially  be  qualified  as  regulated,  as well in the event of amendment, renewal or termination of such agreements,  including  for  agreements  that  were  considered  as 'unregulated' at the time they were signed.\n\n## Shareholders' agreements\n\nOn 8 February 2006, Pernod Ricard was notified that a shareholders' agreement  had  been  signed  between  Rafa\u00ebl  Gonzalez-Gallarza and  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  Paul  Ricard.  Pursuant  to  this  agreement,  Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza has undertaken to consult Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard prior  to  any  Pernod  Ricard  Shareholders'  Meeting  in  order  to vote in the same way.

In order  to  enable  the  Board  to  review  and  discuss  the  matters falling within its area of responsibility in detail, the Internal Rules and  Regulations  provide  that  Board  meetings  must  be  held  at least six times a year. In particular, the Chairman of the Board of Directors ensures that Board meetings are held to approve the interim  and  annual  financial  statements  and  to  convene  the Shareholders' Meeting called for the shareholders to approve them.\n\nBoard  meetings  are  called  by  the  Chairman.  The  notice  of  the Board meeting, sent to the Directors at least eight days before the date of the meeting, except in the event of a duly substantiated emergency, must include the agenda and state where the meeting\n\nwill take place, which will be, in principle, the Company's registered office. Board meetings may also be held by video conference or other means of telecommunication, under the conditions provided for  in  the  applicable  regulations  and  the  Internal  Rules  and Regulations.\n\nSince FY 2017, the Directors hold a session at least once a year, in the  absence  of  the  Directors  from  Group  Top  Management (Executive Sessions). The purpose of these Executive Sessions is to assess the operating procedures of the Board of Directors and the  performance  of  the  Executive  Corporate  Officer,  and  to review  his  succession  plan.  One  Executive  Session  was  held  in FY 2024.\n\n## 2.1.3.3 Directors' attendance at Board and Committee meetings during FY 2024\n\nDuring FY 2024, the Board of Directors met ten times with an attendance rate of 97.95%. The average duration of the meetings was approximately two hours and forty-five minutes.\n\n|                                                            | Board of  Directors   | Audit  Committee   | Nominations and  Governance  Committee   | Compensation  Committee   | Strategic  Committee   | CSR  Committee   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------|\n| Alexandre Ricard                                           | 10/10                 |                    |                                          |                           | 3/3                    |                  |\n| Patricia Barbizet                                          | 10/10                 |                    | 4/4                                      | 6/6                       | 1/1                    | 3/3              |\n| Wolfgang Colberg                                           | 10/10                 | 4/4                |                                          |                           | 1/1                    |                  |\n| Virginie Fauvel                                            | 10/10                 |                    |                                          |                           | 3/3                    |                  |\n| Ian Gallienne                                              | 9/10                  |                    |                                          | 6/6                       | 3/3                    |                  |\n| C\u00e9sar Giron                                                | 10/10                 |                    | 4/4                                      |                           | 1/1                    |                  |\n| Max Koeune (1)                                             | 6/6                   | 1/1                |                                          |                           | N/A                    |                  |\n| Anne Lange                                                 | 10/10                 |                    | 4/4                                      |                           | 3/3                    |                  |\n| Philippe Petitcolin                                        | 10/10                 | 4/4                |                                          |                           | 3/3                    |                  |\n| Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard (represented by Patricia Ricard Giron) | 10/10                 |                    |                                          |                           | 3/3                    |                  |\n| Namita Shah                                                | 8/10                  |                    |                                          |                           | 0/1                    | 3/3              |\n| Kory Sorenson                                              | 10/10                 | 4/4                |                                          | 6/6                       | 1/1                    |                  |\n| Veronica Vargas                                            | 10/10                 |                    |                                          |                           | 1/1                    | 3/3              |\n| DIRECTORS REPRESENTING EMPLOYEES                           |                       |                    |                                          |                           |                        |                  |\n| Carla Machado Leite                                        | 10/10                 |                    |                                          |                           | 1/1                    |                  |\n| Brice Thommen                                              | 10/10                 |                    |                                          | 6/6                       | 1/1                    |                  |\n| AVERAGE ATTENDANCE RATE                                    | 97.95%                | 100%               | 100%                                     | 100%                      | 96.15%                 | 100%             |\n\n- N/A: Not applicable.\n- (1) Six Board Meetings took place in FY 2024 following Max Koeune's appointment as a Director on 10 November 2023, and one Audit Committee meeting took place following his appointment as a member of that Committee on 14 February 2024.",

In accordance with the Internal Rules and Regulations (11) , the supporting documents pertaining to matters on the agenda are provided far enough in advance, generally eight days before meetings, to enable them to prepare effectively for each meeting.\n\nA Director may ask for explanations or for additional information and,  more  generally,  submit  to  the  Chairman  or  the  Lead Independent  Director  any  request  for  information  or  access  to information which they deem appropriate.\n\n## 2.1.3.5 Assessment of the Board of Directors\n\nFrom  time  to  time,  and  at  least  once  a  year,  the  Board  of Directors includes on its agenda a discussion about its operating procedures, focusing on the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 a review  of  its  composition,  operating  procedures  and organisation; and\n- \u00b7 a  check  that  significant  issues  are  adequately  prepared  and discussed.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  and  with  its  Internal Rules  and  Regulations,  the  Nominations  and  Governance Committee and the Board carry out an annual assessment of the operating  procedures  of  the  Board  and  its  Committees.  In addition,  every  three  years  a  formal  external  assessment  is carried out with the support of a specialised consulting firm.\n\nIn FY 2023, the annual assessment was conducted by Patricia Barbizet in her capacity as Lead Independent Director. She presented the results  of  this  assessment  to  the  Nominations  and  Governance Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\nIn FY 2024, as is the case every three years, a formal assessment was carried out with the support of an external firm. The purpose of the assessment is to review the Board's operating procedures and  check  that  important  agenda  items  are  suitably  prepared and debated.\n\nThe findings of the assessment showed that Pernod Ricard's Board of Directors operates very well, particularly for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Board's  members  have  diverse  profiles,  with  strong business  backgrounds,  and  there  is  a  good  proportion  of independent Directors.\n- \u00b7 The Directors are highly engaged and diligent in their duties as Board  members,  which  is  led  by  a  Chairman  &  CEO  whose leadership is recognised and valued by all.\n- \u00b7 The  Board  meetings  are  run  effectively,  with  high-quality discussions, including between the Directors and members of executive management.\n\nThe  assessment  also  highlighted  some  areas  for  improvement and  several recommendations  were  made.  In  particular, recommendations  included  continuing  to  devote  more  time  to long-term strategic matters and to reviewing the Group's talent pool, with the suggestion that the roles of the Strategic Committee and Nominations and Governance Committee respectively could be reinforced in relation to the work on these issues.",

In particular, it examined the conclusions of the Statutory Auditors and the draft financial reporting presentation to the markets;\n- \u00b7 monitoring of the Group's cash flows and debt;\n- \u00b7 risk management: review of the update to the Group's risk map. The Group's main risks were regularly presented in detail to the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 review of internal control: the Group sent its affiliates a self-assessment questionnaire to evaluate whether their internal control system is adequate and effective. Based on the Group's internal control principles and in compliance with the French Financial Markets Authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF) reference framework for risk management and internal control  and  its  application  guide,  this  questionnaire  covers  corporate  governance  practices,  operational  matters  and IT  support.  Responses  to  the  questionnaire  were  documented  and  reviewed  by  the  Group's  Internal  Audit  Department. An analysis of the responses was presented to the Audit Committee at its meeting held on 27 August 2024;\n- \u00b7 examination of the internal audit reports: in addition to the audits and controls carried out by the various affiliates on their own behalf, 35 affiliates were audited in FY 2024 by the internal audit teams (including IT audits). A full report was drawn up for each audit covering the types of risks identified - operational, financial, legal and strategic - and how they are managed. Recommendations  are  issued  when  deemed  necessary.  These  are  summarised  for  the  Audit  Committee,  which  is  also regularly advised on the progress made in implementing the recommendations from previous audits; and\n- \u00b7 approval of the Group internal audit plan for FY 2025 at the meeting held on 11 June 2024. The audit plan was prepared and approved, taking into account the Group's main risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nmembers\n\n75% independent Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## At 31 August 2024, the Audit Committee comprised: Chair:\n\n- \u00b7 Philippe Petitcolin (Independent Director)\n\n## Members:\n\n- \u00b7 Wolfgang Colberg (Director)\n- \u00b7 Kory Sorenson (independent Director)\n- \u00b7 Max Koeune (independent Director)\n\nThree of the four Directors who are members of the Audit Committee are independent Directors (75%), in line with the 67% independence rate recommended in the AFEP-MEDEF Code.

The maximum purchase price was set at \u20ac320 per share and the Company was not authorised to purchase any more than 10% of the shares making up its share capital; additionally, the number of shares held by the Company could not, at any time, exceed 10% of the shares comprising its share capital.\n\nAt the Ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting of 10 November 2023, the shareholders granted the Board of Directors a further 18 month authorisation to trade in the Company's shares under the same conditions with a maximum purchase price set at \u20ac330 per share. This authorisation superseded, with effect from 10 November 2023, the unused portion of the authorisation granted at the Shareholders' Meeting of 10 November 2022.\n\nPursuant to these authorisations, the liquidity agreement compliant with  the  AMAFI  Code  of  Ethics,  which  was  entered  into  with Rothschild  Martin  Maurel  with  effect  from  1  June  2012  and replaced  by  the  agreement  signed  on  23  September  2019,  was tacitly renewed on 1 June 2024 for a period of one year. The funds initially allocated to the management of the liquidity agreement amounted to \u20ac5,000,000.\n\nThe  authorisation  granted  by  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of 10  November  2023,  which  was  still  in  force  at  the  date  this document was filed, will expire on 9 May 2025.

These shares were cancelled.\n\nPursuant to the authorisations granted at the Shareholders' Meeting of 10 November 2023, at its meeting on the same date the Board of Directors set up a performance share plan. In connection with this  plan,  an  option-based  hedging  arrangement  was  entered into for 118,000 shares by acquiring the same number of three-year American call options. The Company also purchased 78,600 shares at  the  price  of  \u20ac157.61,  as  well  as  125,000  shares  through  the exercise of American call options. The 125,000 Pernod Ricard SA shares resulting from the exercise of the American call options, which  serve  to  cover  the  various  plans  making  up  the  overall share  plan,  were  sold  off-market  to  an  investment  services provider at an average price of \u20ac154.11.\n\nTreasury  shares  constitute  reserves  covering  the  various  stock option  and  performance  share  plans  still  in  force.  During  the period, the following transfers were made within these reserves of treasury shares: 144,746 shares were granted to beneficiaries of the 8 November 2019 performance share plan (at the end of the four-year vesting period), 40,343 shares were transferred to cover the rights of beneficiaries who had exercised stock options, and 532 shares were transferred to cover early release events as provided for by law.\n\nUnder the liquidity agreement signed with Rothschild & Cie Banque, during the period, the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 purchased 344,083 shares for a total amount of \u20ac56,092,410.66; and\n- \u00b7 sold 333,883 shares for a total amount of \u20ac54,409,573.68.\n\nA  number  of  shares  acquired  on  the  stock  market  in  previous financial years were reallocated to cover various stock option or performance share plans and the 118,000 American calls exercisable for the same number of Pernod Ricard shares were earmarked to cover a portion of these stock option and performance share plans.\n\n## Distribution of treasury shares by purpose at 30 June 2024\n\nAll of the Company's treasury shares are allocated as reserves for its various stock option and performance share plans.",

Thus, in accordance with the law, the Company may not at any time hold a number of shares representing more than 10% of its share capital.\n\nAs the Company may not hold more than 10% of its share capital, and given that it  held  2,027,013  shares  (i.e.,  0.80%  of  the  share capital) at the time of the last declaration relating to the number of  shares  and  voting  rights  held  (i.e.,  at  30  June  2024),  the maximum number of shares that could be bought back would be 23,305,862  (i.e.,  9.20%  of  the  share  capital),  unless  it  sells  or cancels shares it already holds.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  share  buybacks  and  the  uses  that  may  be made of the shares repurchased in this manner are described in detail  in  the  14 th resolution  to  be  put  to  the  vote  of  the shareholders on 8 November 2024. The share buyback programme would  enable  the  Company  to  purchase  its  own  shares,  either directly or indirectly, for the purpose of:\n\n- (i) granting or selling the shares to employees and/or Executive Corporate  Officers  of  the  Company  and/or  its  current  or future affiliates under the terms and conditions provided for by law, in particular by granting stock options or as part of employee profit-sharing plans; or\n- (ii) fulfilling the Company's commitments under financial contracts or  options  with  cash  payments  relating  to  changes  in  the stock market price of Company shares, granted to employees and/or Executive Corporate Officers of the Company and/or its current or future affiliates under the terms and conditions provided for by law; or\n- (iii) granting free shares to employees and/or Executive Corporate Officers of the Company and/or its current or future affiliates, in accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 225-197-1 et seq. and  L.  22-10-59 et  seq. of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  it being specified that the shares may be allocated, in particular, to a company savings plan in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 3332-14 of the French Labour Code; or\n- (iv) retaining and subsequently tendering the shares (in exchange, as payment or otherwise) in connection with external growth transactions, subject to a limit of 5% of the number of shares comprising the share capital; or\n- (v) delivering the shares upon the exercise of rights attached to securities  granting  access  to  the  share  capital  through redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or in any other manner; or\n- (vi) cancelling all or some of the shares bought back, under the conditions  provided  for  in  Article  L.  22-10-62  paragraph  4 of  the  French  Commercial  Code  and  in  accordance  with the authorisation to reduce the share capital granted by the Shareholders'  Meeting  of  10  November  2023  in  the 15 th resolution, which is valid until 9 January 2025; or\n\n(vii) enabling an investment services provider to make a market for Company shares in accordance with liquidity agreements in  line  with  the  terms  of  a  Code  of  Ethics  approved  by  the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF).\n\nThis programme is also designed to enable the Company to trade in  its  shares  for  any  other  authorised  or  compliant  purpose  or any purpose that may be authorised or become compliant with the applicable regulations in the future or that may be permitted as a market practice by the AMF in the future. The Company will inform the shareholders in a press release prior to carrying out any such transactions.\n\nThe number of Company shares purchased may be such that:\n\n- \u00b7 the Company does not purchase more than 10% of the shares comprising its share capital at any time during the term of the share  buyback  programme;  this  percentage  applies  to  the share  capital  as  adjusted  to  reflect  any  corporate  actions carried  out  subsequent  to  this  Shareholders'  Meeting;  in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  22-10-62  of  the French  Commercial  Code,  when  shares  are  bought  back  to favour the liquidity of the shares under the conditions set out by the applicable regulations, the number of shares taken into account  for  calculating  the  10%  limit  corresponds  to  the number of shares purchased less the number of shares sold during the authorisation period; and\n- \u00b7 the number of shares held by the Company at any time does not exceed 10% of the shares comprising its share capital.\n\nThe  shares  may  be  purchased,  sold,  transferred,  delivered  or exchanged, on one or more occasions, by any means authorised, including  via  block  purchases  or  sales,  as  part  of  sale  and repurchase  agreements  or  public  purchase  or  exchange  offers, through the use of financial derivatives, on a regulated market, a multilateral trading facility, from a systematic internaliser or over the  counter,  or  by  means  of  option  strategies  (purchases  and sales of puts and calls and any combinations thereof in compliance with  the  applicable  regulations).  Transactions  carried  out  by block  purchases  or  sales  may  account  for  the  entire  share buyback programme.\n\nThe transactions may be carried out during periods considered appropriate by the Board of Directors. However, during a public offer, buybacks may only be carried out provided that they:\n\n- \u00b7 enable the Company to meet commitments made prior to the launch of the public offer;\n- \u00b7 are undertaken to pursue a share buyback programme already in progress;\n- \u00b7 fall within the scope of the objectives referred to in points (i) to (iii) above; and\n- \u00b7 cannot cause the offer to fail.\n\nThe Board of Directors may also, in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, allocate shares previously bought back to another  objective  (including  shares  bought  back  under  a previous authorisation) or sell the shares (on- or off-market).\n\nThis authorisation would be valid for a period of 18 months from the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  8  November  2024  and  would cancel,  as  from  this  same  date,  any  unused  portion  of  the authorisation  to  trade  in  the  Company's  shares  granted  to  the Board  of  Directors  in  the  14 th resolution  of  the  Shareholders' Meeting of 10 November 2023.",

They are held at the Company's registered office or at any other place stated in the notice of meeting.\n\nDecisions by the shareholders are taken at Ordinary, Extraordinary or Combined Shareholders' Meetings depending on the nature of the resolutions they are asked to adopt.\n\n## 2.5.2 Participation in Shareholders' Meetings\n\nAll shareholders have the right to attend Shareholders' Meetings of the Company and to participate in the deliberations, either in person  or  by  proxy,  regardless  of  the  number  of  shares  they hold. In order for a shareholder to have the right to participate in Ordinary  or  Extraordinary  Shareholders'  Meetings,  the  shares must  be  registered  in  the  name  of  the  shareholder  or  in  the name of the financial  intermediary  acting  on  the  shareholder's behalf  at  00.00  (Paris  time)  two  business  days  prior  to  the Shareholders'  Meeting,  either  in  the  registered  share  accounts kept by the Company or in the bearer share accounts kept by the authorised financial intermediary.\n\nThe  entry  or  recording  of  the  shares  in  bearer  share  accounts kept by the authorised financial intermediary are acknowledged via  a  share  certificate  issued  by  the  financial  intermediary  and attached as an appendix to the postal voting form, proxy form or application for an admission card made out in the name of the shareholder or on behalf of the shareholder represented by the registered  financial  intermediary.  Any  shareholder  wishing  to attend the Shareholders' Meeting in person who has not received their  admission  card  by  00.00  (Paris  time)  two  business  days before  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  may  also  ask  for  such  a certificate to be issued.\n\nIf  a  shareholder  does  not  attend  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  in person, they may choose one of the following options:\n\n- \u00b7 give a proxy to the Chairman of the Shareholders' Meeting;\n- \u00b7 give a proxy to a spouse or partner with whom they have entered into a civil partnership agreement, or to any other person; or\n- \u00b7 vote by post or via the Internet.\n\nA shareholder who has already cast a postal or Internet vote, sent in a proxy form or applied for an admission card or a share certificate may sell all or some of their shares at any time. However, if the sale takes place before 00.00 (Paris time) on the second business day prior to the Shareholders' Meeting, the Company will invalidate or modify accordingly, as appropriate, the postal or Internet vote cast,  proxy  form,  admission  card  or  share  certificate.

However,  a  transfer  following  the  division  of  a deceased's estate or the liquidation of assets between spouses or an inter vivos donation to a spouse or relation close enough to inherit will not result in the loss of the acquired right and will not interrupt the aforementioned ten-year period.\n\n## 2.5.4 Modification of shareholders' rights\n\nThe Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting has the power to modify shareholders' rights, under the conditions defined by law.",

The information provided also takes into account  the  provisions  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  of  Corporate Governance for listed companies.\n\nThe  Company's  compensation  report  for  FY  2024  is  presented below.\n\nDuring FY 2024, Pernod Ricard achieved robust results within an environment of economic and geopolitical uncertainty and spirit market normalisation.\n\nFY 2024 key highlights are:\n\n- \u00b7 organic net sales broadly stable;\n- \u00b7 strong performances in many mature and emerging markets, largely offsetting a still-normalising US and challenging China;\n- \u00b7 pricing,  operational  efficiencies  and  cost  discipline  leading  to organic growth  margin  and  organic  operating  margin expansion;\n- \u00b7 continuing active portfolio management, in particular with the disposal of some strategic local brands and the announcement of the disposal of Strategic Wines brands.\n\nThe  Company's  Compensation  Committee  comprises  four members,  three  of  whom  are  independent  and  one  member representing employees.\n\nThe  role  of  the  Compensation  Committee  is  to  review  and propose to the Board of Directors the compensation to be paid to the Executive Corporate Officer(s), as well as measures relating to  their  retirement  schemes  and  any  other  benefits  granted  to them.  For  this  purpose,  the  Compensation  Committee  analyses the rules governing the determination of the variable portion of the compensation of the Executive Corporate Officer(s) annually to ensure that the criteria applied are in line with the Company's short-,  medium-  and  long-term  strategic  goals.  It  also  ensures consistency  between  the  compensation  policy  of  the  Executive Corporate Officer(s) and members of the Executive Committee.\n\nThe  Compensation  Committee  proposes  to  the  Board  of Directors  the  long-term  incentive  plan  grant  policy  and,  in particular,  the  conditions  of  these  grants  applicable  to  the Company's Executive Corporate Officer(s). Finally, it validates the information  given  to  the  shareholders  on  the  compensation  of the Executive Corporate Officer(s) (in particular the compensation policy  and  the  components  of  compensation  submitted  to  the vote of the shareholders as part of the 'Say on Pay').\n\nThe compensation policy adopted by the Board of Directors on the proposal of the Compensation Committee includes incentives that reflect the Group's strategy focused on achieving long-term profitable growth by conducting business responsibly and in the interests of the Company  and  its  shareholders,  aligning compensation  with  the  Company's  short-  and  long-term performance by engaging executives with share-based incentives. This compensation policy, which reflects the interests of  the  Company,  is  in  line  with  the  Group's  strategy  and  helps secure its long-term  future. The  performance  conditions contained in the compensation policy for Corporate Officers are directly linked to the Group's performance metrics.\n\nIn  FY  2024,  the  Compensation  Committee  met  six  times  and examined the following matters:\n\n- \u00b7 the  compensation  due  to  the  Chairman  &  CEO  for  FY  2023, including the calculation of his annual variable compensation for FY 2023 and a review of the ex-post Say-on-Pay resolution to be recommended to the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 the compensation policy for the Chairman & CEO for FY 2024, adjustment of variable compensation criteria in line with Group strategy  and  review  of  the ex-ante Say-on-Pay  resolution  for recommendation to the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 Directors'  compensation  for  FY  2024  to  be  recommended  to the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 long-term incentive plans, including determining whether the performance  conditions  underlying  the  2020  plans  had  been met and the preparation of the 2023 performance share plan;\n- \u00b7 a report on the meetings held with investors and proxy advisory firms about the compensation policy for the Chairman & CEO;\n- \u00b7 the compensation policy for the Chairman & CEO to be applied from FY 2025 in connection with the renewal of his term of office;\n- \u00b7 gender pay equity and gender equality index.\n\nIn view of the upcoming renewal of the Chairman & CEO's term of  office,  the  Compensation  Committee  carried  out  an  in-depth review  of  his  compensation  policy,  comparing  it  -  with  the assistance of a specialised external firm - with that of his peers and with changes in market practices, while taking into account the  priorities  of  our  shareholders  and  of  proxy  advisory  firms, and the principles set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Code in relation to setting executives' compensation.\n\nThis  analysis  revealed  that  certain  items  of  compensation  were no longer market-competitive, that certain performance indicators of annual variable compensation could be streamlined for  transparency,  and  that  performance  conditions  in  the long -term incentive plan could be reinforced and the relevance of a panel of peers reviewed.\n\nAccordingly,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Compensation Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  proposes  the  following changes to the compensation policy for the Chairman & CEO as from FY 2025:\n\n- \u00b7 increasing  his  fixed  compensation,  which  has  remained unchanged since July  2021  despite  an  inflationary  context,  to align it with the median practice of CAC 40 companies;\n- \u00b7 clarifying  the  maximum  level  for  financial  and  non-financial criteria  of  annual  variable  compensation  to  avoid  potential offsetting effects;\n- \u00b7 introducing  a  maximum  amount  on  long-term  variable compensation  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  fixed  and maximum  annual  variable  compensation,  in  order  to  more closely align the interests of the Company and its shareholders with the median maximum practice of CAC 40 companies, with an annual readjustment;\n- \u00b7 adjusting  the  external  performance  condition  (TSR)  for  the long-term incentive plan, with:\n- \u00b7 narrowing  of  the  scope  of  the  peer  panel  to  companies  in the alcoholic beverages sector;\n- \u00b7 reinforcement of the vesting scale;\n- \u00b7 reinforcing  the  vesting  scale  for  the  CSR  condition  of  the long -term incentive plan.\n\nThese changes are described in more detail in subsection 2.6.2 of this Universal Registration Document. The other components of the compensation policy remain unchanged.",

This criterion, one of the key elements of the Group's decentralised structure, provides an incentive  to  exceed  the  target  for  profit  from  recurring operations. This concept of commitment to the annual target for profit  from  recurring  operations  aligns  the  divisions,  which  are rewarded based on the achievement level of their own targets for profit  from  recurring  operations.  This  criterion  rewards  the management performance of the Executive Corporate Officer.\n\nAchievement  of  the  annual  target  for  Group  share  of  net profit  from  recurring  operations: adjusted  for  the  effects  of exchange rates and changes in the scope of consolidation. This criterion  takes  into  account  the  totality  of  the  Group's  financial elements  that  fall  under  the  Executive  Corporate  Officer's responsibility  for  the  financial  year  aligning  his  compensation with that of the shareholders.\n\nAchievement  of  the  annual  target  for  recurring  free  cash flow: adjusted  for  the  effects  of  exchange  rates.  This  criterion measures the Group's financial performance and value creation.\n\nAchievement  of  the  annual  target  for  the  ratio  of  Group profit from recurring operations to net sales: adjusted for the effects of exchange rates and changes in the scope of consolidation. This criterion measures how effectively the Company generates profit  from  its  operations  and  is  aligned  with  the  Group's commitment to improving its operating margin.",

The Board of Directors decided to increase the fixed compensation of the Chairman & CEO by 6%, which is  below  the  average  increase  of  the  Group  employees  over  three  years,  well  below  the  cumulative  level  of  inflation in France since July 2021 (12.5%), and brings it into line with the median fixed compensation of CAC 40  companies as outlined in the introductory note to this Universal Registration Document.                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Change in the maximum  payout for the financial  criteria of the annual  variable compensation                          | The  analysis  of  the  compensation  policy  revealed  that  the  performance  criteria  for  annual  variable  compensation could be streamlined for greater transparency. As a result, the Board reviewed the maximum  payout for financial and non-financial criteria of the annual variable compensation to cancel out the offsetting  effect between the criteria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                                                                                                         | Accordingly,  the  Board  decided  to  reduce  the  maximum  level  that  the  Chairman  &  CEO's  variable  compensation contingent on financial objectives can represent from 150% to 135% of his fixed compensation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Setting a maximum  amount on long-term  compensation                                                                    | The review of the Chairman & CEO's compensation policy evidenced that the maximum amount of long-term  compensation that can be allocated to him was well below the caps applied by CAC 40 companies and by the  international peer panel. Accordingly, the Board of Directors decided to review the maximum amount that could be allocated, taking the  following components into account: \u00b7 the need to drive forward the Group's new growth phase and continue the transformation process started                                                                                                                        |\n| Amendments to the peer  panel used for the external  performance condition  applicable to the long-term  incentive plan | The  Board  believes  that  narrowing  the  panel  of  peers  used  for  comparisons  for  the  TSR  criterion  to  only  include companies in the alcoholic beverages sector will better reflect relative performance in Pernod Ricard's  market segment. Accordingly, the Board has decided to adjust the panel as follows: \u00b7 eliminate Coca Cola, PepsiCo and Danone, which operate in a different sector; \u00b7 eliminate LVMH, whose spirits business is minor compared with its main business; \u00b7 add the Japanese company Suntory, whose spirits business represents a substantial proportion of its overall  activities. |\n| Change in the vesting scale  for the external  performance condition  in the long-term                                  | To  strengthen  the  alignment  between  the  interests  of  the  Executive  Corporate  Officer  and  those  of  shareholders,  the  Board  decided  to  strengthen  the  external  condition  of  the  long-term  incentive  plan  by  changing the vesting scale and limiting the proportion of shares that vest to 50% for a TSR in 5 th  position of the  new panel (above the median).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| incentive plan                                                                                                          | In line with the commitment to make the performance conditions applicable to the long-term incentive plan  more exacting, the Board also decided to change the vesting scale for the CSR conditions. Consequently, none  of the shares whose vesting is contingent on the CSR conditions will vest if only one of the four objectives is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| for the internal  performance conditions  (CSR conditions)                                                              | achieved and 100% if all of the objectives are achieved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Change in the vesting scale                                                                                             | achieved, 50% of the aforementioned shares will vest if two objectives are achieved, 75% if three objectives are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\nThe other components of the compensation policy remain unchanged.",

However, an early review may take place in the event of significant changes in the Executive Corporate Officer's scope of  responsibilities,  the  emergence  of  a  significant  gap  between his compensation and the market positioning, or an exceptional event. In these specific situations, any adjustments made to his fixed compensation and the reasons for such adjustments would be made public.\n\nOn 28 August 2024, on the recommendation of the Compensation  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  proposed an increase in Alexandre Ricard's annual fixed compensation to \u20ac1,325,000 (up 6%) as from FY 2025 until the end of his term of office.\n\nIn reaching its decision, the Board took into account the following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Chairman  &  CEO's  fixed  compensation  has  remained unchanged since 1 July 2021;\n- \u00b7 the  current  positioning  of  the  Chairman  &  CEO's  fixed compensation  is  below  the  median  of  CAC  40  companies,  as outlined in the introductory note to this Universal Registration Document;\n- \u00b7 the  high  inflation  rates  since  the  last  increase  in  his  fixed compensation;\n- \u00b7 the average pay increase for the Group's employees over the last  three  years,  which  is  higher  than  the  proposed  6% increase.\n\nFinally,  in  the  event  of  the  appointment  of  a  new  Chairman  & CEO, Chief Executive Officer or Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s), these same principles will apply.\n\n## Compensation as Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Executive Corporate Officer does not receive any compensation for offices he holds in the Company or other Group companies.",

As  specified  in  the  introductory  note,  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Compensation Committee,  has  decided  to  reduce  the  maximum  level  of  overperformance  of  the  financial  criteria  from  150%  to  135%  of  the  fixed compensation.

        "page_content": "## Description of the criteria\n\n## Financial criteria\n\nAchievement of the annual target for profit from recurring operations: adjusted  for  the  effects  of  exchange  rates  and changes in the scope of consolidation. This criterion, one of the key elements of the Group's decentralised structure, provides an incentive  to  exceed  the  target  for  profit  from  recurring operations. This concept of commitment to the annual target for profit  from  recurring  operations  aligns  the  divisions,  which  are rewarded based on the achievement level of their own targets for profit  from  recurring  operations.  This  criterion  rewards  the management performance of the Executive Corporate Officer.\n\nAchievement  of  the  annual  target  for  Group  share  of  net profit  from  recurring  operations: adjusted  for  the  effects  of exchange rates and changes in the scope of consolidation. This criterion  takes  into  account  the  totality  of  the  Group's  financial elements  that  fall  under  the  Executive  Corporate  Officer's responsibility  for  the  financial  year,  aligning  his  compensation with that of the shareholders.\n\nAchievement  of  the  annual  target  for  recurring  free  cash flow: adjusted  for  the  effects  of  exchange  rates.  This  criterion measures the Group's financial performance and value creation.\n\nAchievement  of  the  annual  target  for  the  ratio  of  Group profit  from  recurring  operations  to  net  sales: adjusted  for the  effects  of  exchange  rates  and  changes  in  the  scope  of consolidation.  This  criterion  measures  how  effectively  the Company generates profit from its operations and is aligned with the Group's commitment to improving its operating margin.\n\n## Non-financial and qualitative criteria\n\nAs  in  previous  years,  for  confidentiality  reasons  regarding  the Group's  strategy,  details  of  the  non-financial  and  qualitative objectives  may  only  be  disclosed  after  the  event  and  after assessment  of  their  achievement  levels  by  the  Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n## Performance levels\n\nThe achievement levels of the applicable objectives are disclosed on  a  criterion  by  criterion  basis,  once  the  performance assessment has been carried out.\n\n## Termination of office\n\nIf the Executive Corporate Officer leaves during the financial year, the amount of the variable portion of his compensation for the current  year  will  be  determined  pro  rata  to  his  time  in  service during that year, based on the performance level recorded and assessed by the Board of Directors for each of the criteria initially adopted. However, it should be noted that no compensation will be paid if the Executive Corporate Officer is dismissed for gross negligence  or  with  good  cause  or  by  way  of  a  decision  of  the Board of Directors.\n\n## Payment method\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  law,  the  payment  of  annual  variable compensation will be subject to prior approval by shareholders at the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Long-term variable compensation: grant of performance shares\n\nPerformance  share  grants  have  made  up  the  long-term component  of  the  Chairman  &  CEO's  compensation  package since  stock  option  grants  were  no  longer  awarded  in  FY  2022. These grants are designed to incentivise the Chairman & CEO to achieve  the  Group's  long-term  goals  and  to  more  closely  align the Company's best interests with those of its shareholders.\n\nFor  the  reasons  above,  the  vesting  of  the  shares  is  subject  to (i)  the  achievement  of  performance  conditions  related  to  the Group's  strategic  priorities  and  (ii)  the  Chairman  &  CEO  still holding  his  position  ('presence  condition')  at  the  end  of  the three-year vesting period.\n\nAs  explained  in  the  introductory  note  to  this  section,  on  the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors  has  decided  to  change  the  maximum  amount  of long -term  compensation  to  100%  of  the  Chairman  &  CEO's maximum  annual  fixed  and  variable  compensation  instead  of 150% of his fixed compensation.\n\nFor  FY  2025,  the  Board  is  planning  to  grant  a  number  of performance shares whose IFRS value will correspond to 60% of the  Chairman  &  CEO's  maximum  annual  fixed  and  variable compensation to Alexandre Ricard.\n\nTo determine this amount, the Board has taken into account the Group's  relative  performance  in  a  difficult  environment,  the Executive  Corporate  Officer's  excellent  management,  market practices and the more exacting performance conditions.\n\nThe  maximum  amount  of  performance  shares  granted  to  the Executive Corporate Officer is limited to 0.08% of the Company's share  capital  on  the  grant  date  of  the  performance  shares,  as indicated in the resolution that will be submitted to shareholders for their approval at the Shareholders' Meeting of 8 November 2024 (15 th resolution).\n\nIn  addition,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Compensation Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  has  decided  to  amend  the performance conditions in the long-term incentive plan, by:\n\n- \u00b7 External condition: review of the vesting scale and increasing the relevance of the peer panel used, by narrowing its scope to only  include  companies  operating  principally  in  the  alcoholic beverages sector;\n- \u00b7 Review of the vesting scale for the CSR conditions.",

The composition of the Panel may be amended in the event of changes in the companies concerned, particularly in the  event  of  an  acquisition,  absorption,  dissolution,  spin-off,  merger  or  change  of  activity,  subject  to  maintaining  the  overall  consistency  of  the  sample  and  enabling application of the external performance condition in accordance with the performance objective set at the grant date.\n\nWhile the Board determines the performance conditions for each grant  and  promotes  their  stability,  they  may  in  some  cases  be adjusted.\n\nThe  vesting  of  the  performance  shares  is  also  subject  to  a presence  condition  (at  the  vesting  date)  which  applies  for  all beneficiaries including the Executive Corporate Officer, subject to the exceptions specified in the plan regulations (notably in cases of death or disability) or decided by the Board of Directors. In the case  of  the  Executive  Corporate  Officer,  the  Board  of  Directors may decide to remove the presence condition on a pro rata basis if it deems fit, but any such decision must be communicated and justified. The performance shares held will remain subject to all applicable  plan  regulations,  particularly  with  regard  to  the calendar and performance conditions.\n\nThe Board of Directors requires the Executive Corporate Officer:\n\n- \u00b7 to hold a number of shares in registered form until the end of his term of office, corresponding to:\n- \u00b7 in respect of stock options: 30% of the acquisition gain, net of social security contributions and taxes, resulting from the exercise of the stock options, and\n- \u00b7 in respect of performance shares: 20% of the volume of the performance shares that actually vest;\n\n- \u00b7 to  undertake  to  buy,  when  the  performance  shares  vest,  a number  of  additional  shares  corresponding  to  10%  of  the vested performance shares; and\n- \u00b7 once  the  Executive  Corporate  Officer  holds  a  number  of registered  Company  shares  that  matches  more  than  three times  his  gross  annual  fixed  compensation,  the  abovementioned lock-in obligation will be reduced to 10% for both stock  options  and  performance  shares  and  the  Executive Corporate  Officer  will  no  longer  be  required  to  acquire additional shares. If, in the future, the registered holdings fall below  the  ratio  of  three  times,  the  above-mentioned  lock-in and acquisition requirements will once more apply.\n\nIn accordance with the Code of Ethics, (the latest version of which was  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  14  February  2024), and the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Executive Corporate Officer has formally undertaken not to use hedging mechanisms either for stock  options  granted  under  previously  established  plans  or shares  resulting  from  the  exercise  of  these  options,  or  for performance shares received from the Company, until the end of the lock-in period set by the Board of Directors.",

Such  payment  would  not  be  due,  however,  in  the event of (i) non-renewal of the Executive Corporate Officer's term of  office,  (ii)  departure  at  the  Executive  Corporate  Officer's initiative, (iii) a change of position within the Group or (iv) if he is able to claim his pension within a short period of time.\n\nThe  severance  payment  provided  for  in  the  forced  departure clause is subject to the following three performance criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 criterion 1: rate of annual variable compensation achieved over the Executive Corporate Officer's term(s) of office: this criterion will  be  considered  as  met  if  the  average  annual  variable compensation paid over the entire duration of the term(s) of office is no less than 90% of the target variable compensation;\n- \u00b7 criterion  2:  growth  rate  of  profit  from  recurring  operations over the term(s) of office: this criterion will be considered as met if  the average growth rate of profit from recurring operations versus the annual target for each year over the entire duration of  the  Executive  Corporate  Officer's  term(s)  of  office  is  more than  95%  (adjusted  for  the  effects  of  foreign  exchange  rates and changes in the scope of consolidation); and\n- \u00b7 criterion  3:  average  growth  in  net  sales  over  the  term(s)  of office:  this  criterion  will  be  considered  as  met  if  the  average growth in net sales  over  the  entire  duration  of  the  Executive Corporate Officer's term(s) of office is greater than or equal to 3%  (adjusted  for  the  effects  of  foreign  exchange  rates  and changes in the scope of consolidation).\n\n## Multi-year compensation\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  decided  not  to  use  this  type  of long -term cash compensation mechanism, preferring to favour a share-based instrument more closely aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\n- Directors  each  year.  The  performance,  presence  and  lock-in conditions that will apply to these grants are the same as those provided for in the Group's general performance share plan in effect on the grant date; and\n- \u00b7 half  (corresponding  to  10%  of  his  annual  compensation)  in cash.  It  is  specified  that  the  Executive  Corporate  Officer  will undertake  to  invest  the  cash  component  of  this  additional compensation, net of social security contributions and tax, in savings  products  dedicated  to  financing  his  supplementary pension.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  severance  payment  that  may  be  received under the forced departure clause will be calculated according to the following scale:\n\n- \u00b7 if all three  criteria are met,  payment  of  12  months' compensation (14) ;\n- \u00b7 if  two of the three criteria are met: payment of eight months' compensation (14) ;\n- \u00b7 if  one  of  the  three  criteria  is  met:  payment  of  four  months' compensation (14) ; and\n- \u00b7 if none of the criteria are met: no payment.\n\n## Non-compete clause\n\nThe signing of this non-compete clause for a period of one year is intended  to  protect  the  Group  by  preventing  the  Executive Corporate  Officer  from  performing  duties  for  a  competitor,  in return for an indemnity corresponding to 12 months' compensation (most recent annual fixed and variable compensation, set by the Board of Directors).\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code:\n\n- \u00b7 the  indemnity  will  be  paid  monthly  during  the  applicable payment period;\n- \u00b7 the clause provides that the Board of Directors may waive its application when the Executive Corporate Officer leaves;\n- \u00b7 the  indemnity  will  not  be  paid  if  the  Executive  Corporate Officer leaves the Group to take retirement or if the Executive Corporate Officer is over 65 years old; and\n- \u00b7 the  aggregate maximum amount of the indemnity under the non-compete clause and the forced departure clause (sum of both) is capped at 24 months' compensation (most recent annual fixed and variable compensation set by the Board of Directors).\n\nHowever,  such  a  mechanism  might  be  envisaged  if  regulatory changes  or  any  other  circumstance  were  to  make  the  use  of  a share-based  instrument  restrictive  or  impossible.  In  this  event, the principles and criteria for the determination, distribution and maximum  grant  of  shares  stipulated  in  the  policy  relating  to share  plans  will  be  used  in  the  structuring  of  such  multi-year variable  compensation  using  the  most  similar  appropriate procedures possible.",

These  metrics  may  not  be higher than those applicable to the Chairman & CEO.\n\nAny  departure  from  the  policy  may  only  be  temporary  and  in exceptional circumstances, such as in the case of a major event affecting markets in general or that of wines & spirits in particular. The compensation elements that may be departed from, in either a positive or negative sense, are the annual or long-term variable\n\ncompensation (but with no amendments to the applicable caps).\n\nFurthermore, regarding the annual variable compensation policy, in  the  event  of  the  arrival  of  a  new  Executive  Corporate  Officer during the second half of a financial year, the Board of Directors will conduct a performance assessment at its discretion based on a proposal from the Compensation Committee and, in that case, the  new  Executive  Corporate  Officer  will  receive  variable compensation corresponding to the prorated amount of the variable portion approved by the shareholders.\n\n## EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT/CORPORATE OFFICE (TABLE 11 OF THE AMF TEMPLATE)\n\n|                                       |     |    | Defined-benefit   | Defined-benefit   | Indemnities or  advantages due or liable  to be due by virtue of the   | Indemnities or  advantages due or liable  to be due by virtue of the   | Indemnities relating   | Indemnities relating   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----|----|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Executive  Corporate Officers         | Yes | No | Yes               | No                | Yes                                                                    | No                                                                     | Yes                    | No                     |\n| Alexandre Ricard,  Chairman & CEO (1) |     | X  |                   | X                 | X                                                                      |                                                                        | X                      |                        |",

It may reach 70% of his gross  fixed  compensation  if  the  collective  and  individual objectives are achieved (target level) and can rise to a maximum of 126% in the event of exceptional performance in relation to the objectives.  The  criteria  are  reviewed  regularly  and  may  be amended on an occasional basis.\n\nDuring  FY  2024,  he  received  gross  variable  compensation  of \u20ac440,959 in October 2023 relating to FY 2023, i.e., 84.25% of his fixed compensation for FY 2023.\n\n## Exceptional compensation\n\nNo  exceptional  compensation  was  paid  during  or  awarded  for FY 2024.\n\n## Grant of performance shares\n\nOn 10 November 2023, the Board of Directors authorised a global performance share plan.\n\nUnder this plan, C\u00e9sar Giron received the following grant:\n\n- \u00b7 1,665  shares  subject  to  an  external  performance  condition (IFRS value: \u20ac137,995.20); and\n- \u00b7 2,115 shares subject to internal performance conditions (IFRS value: \u20ac321,998.18).\n\nDetails  of  the  overall  performance  share  grant  policy  are provided  below  in  subsection  2.6.5  of  this  Universal  Registration Document.\n\n## Severance benefits\n\nC\u00e9sar Giron is not eligible for any severance or termination benefits.\n\n## Supplementary pension scheme\n\nC\u00e9sar  Giron  is  a  member  of  a  conditional  defined-benefit supplementary pension scheme (Article 39) under Article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code, under which beneficiaries must:\n\n- \u00b7 have at least ten years' seniority within the Group when they retire (voluntary or compulsory retirement);\n- \u00b7 be  at  least  60  years  of  age  when  they  retire  (voluntary  or compulsory retirement);\n- \u00b7 have  claimed  their  basic  and  complementary  French  social security pensions (ARRCO, AGIRC);\n- \u00b7 permanently end their professional career; and\n- \u00b7 end their professional career within the Group. In accordance with the applicable regulations, employees aged over 55 whose contract is terminated and who do not take up another job are deemed to have retired. The aim of the scheme is to supplement the pension provided by France's mandatory state-run pension scheme. It offers retired beneficiaries a life annuity that can be passed on to their spouse and/or ex-spouse in the event of death.\n\nPensions are proportionate to the beneficiary's length of service, capped  at  20  years.  They  are  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the beneficiary's average compensation (fixed and variable) over the three years preceding their retirement.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  supplementary  annuity  is  calculated  by applying the following coefficients to the basis of calculation:\n\n- \u00b7 for  the  portion  of  the  compensation  between 8 and 12 times France's  annual  social  security  ceiling,  the  coefficient  is  2% multiplied by the number of years' service (capped at 20 years, i.e., 40%);\n- \u00b7 between  12  and  16  times  France's  annual  social  security ceiling,  the  coefficient  is  1.5%  per  year  of  service  (capped  at 20 years, i.e., 30%); and\n- \u00b7 in excess of 16 times France's annual social security ceiling, the coefficient is 1% per year of service (capped at 20 years, i.e., 20%).\n\nThe supplementary annuity equals the sum of the three amounts above.\n\nIn addition, the rights granted under this plan, added to those of other pensions, cannot exceed two-thirds of the amount of the beneficiary's most recent annual fixed compensation.\n\nA provision is recognised on the balance sheet during the accrual phase and, when the beneficiary claims their pension, the capital is transferred to an insurer and thus entirely outsourced.\n\nFunding  for  this  scheme  is  the  responsibility  of  Pernod  Ricard, which  pays  premiums  to  a  third-party  insurer  to  which  it  has entrusted management of the scheme.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Article  D.  22-10-16  of  the French  Commercial  Code,  at  30  June  2024,  the  estimated  gross amount of the annuity potentially paid under the defined-benefit supplementary pension scheme for C\u00e9sar Giron would amount to \u20ac186,193 per year.\n\nThe related social security contributions payable by Pernod Ricard correspond to 24% of the contributions transferred to the insurer.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with French government order 2019-697 of 3 July 2019:\n\n- \u00b7 the scheme has been closed since 2016;\n- \u00b7 no additional rights may vest in respect of periods of employment after 1 January 2020.",

In line with the Group's decentralised structure, the terms and conditions of each of these agreements are negotiated at the level of each entity concerned.\n\nSimilarly, outside France, the Group encourages all of its affiliates to  implement local agreements enabling employees to share in the profits of the entity to which they belong.\n\nProfit-sharing agreements of this type exist in countries including Ireland  and  the  United  Kingdom:  in  each  of  these  countries, employees  may  potentially  receive  Pernod  Ricard  shares  based on their entity's annual results.\n\n## Provisions for pension benefits\n\nDetails of the total amounts recorded as provisions or otherwise recognised by the issuer for the payment of pensions are set out in Note 4.7 Provisions to the consolidated financial statements.",

This valuation corresponds to a historical value at the grant date as calculated  for  accounting  purposes.  It  does  not  represent  a current market value, nor the value that could be received by the beneficiary if the shares granted to them vest, especially in view of the fact that it is possible that the performance conditions will not be met.\n\nThe  scope  of  employees  included  only  covers  employees  who were  present  continuously  for  two  consecutive  financial  years. For part-time employees, compensation has been calculated on the basis of full-time equivalents.\n\nThe ratios and annual changes in compensation were calculated on the basis of the gross compensation components paid during or awarded for the current year (and therefore include the variable compensation and profit-sharing due in respect of the prior year). The  legal  scope  of  this  information  covers  Pernod  Ricard  SA. In  addition,  in  accordance  with  recommendation  27.2  of  the AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  the  ratios  are  also  disclosed  for  a  broader scope,  representative  of  the  Group's  business  in  France  and including  Pernod  Ricard  SA  and  all  direct  and  indirect  affiliates located in France.\n\nThe table below was drawn up taking into account the template issued by the AFEP in its guidelines updated in February 2021.\n\nTABLE OF RATIOS DISCLOSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTIONS I.6\u00b0 AND 7\u00b0 OF ARTICLE L. 22-10-9 OF THE FRENCH COMMERCIAL CODE\n\n|                                                                         | FY 2020   | FY 2021   | FY 2022   | FY 2023   | FY 2024   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Change (%) in the compensation of Alexandre Ricard,  Chairman & CEO (1) | +5%       | -33%      | +80%      | +6%       | -7%       |\n| INFORMATION FOR THE SCOPE OF THE LISTED COMPANY                         |           |           |           |           |           |\n| Change (%) in average employee compensation                             | +7.8%     | +2.9%     | +18.5%    | +10.1%    | -11%      |\n| Change (%) in median employee compensation                              | +4.5%     | +2.1%     | +18.5%    | +7.8%     | +1.7%     |\n| Ratio compared to average employee compensation                         | 39.12     | 25.38     | 38.60     | 37.02     | 38.66     |\n| Change (%) compared to the previous financial year                      | -2.6%     | -35.1%    | +52.1%    | -4.1%     | +4.4%     |\n| Ratio compared to median employee compensation                          | 67.68     | 44.31     | 67.38     | 66.02     | 60.32     |\n| Change (%) compared to the previous financial year                      | +0.4%     | -34.5%    | +52%      | -2%       | -8.6%     |\n| ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR THE EXTENDED SCOPE                           |           |           |           |           |           |\n| Change (%) in average employee compensation                             | +6.4%     | +0.6%     | +4.5%     | +8.9%     | +0.8%     |\n| Change (%) in median employee compensation                              | -2.9%     | +4.2%     | +6.1%     | +6.1%     | +8.4%     |\n| Ratio compared to average employee compensation                         | 63.71     | 42.24     | 72.87     | 70.65     | 65.12     |\n| Change (%) compared to the previous financial year                      | -1.2%     | -33.7%    | +72.5%    | -3%       | -7.8%     |\n| Ratio compared to median employee compensation                          | 89.86     | 57.58     | 97.81     | 97.41     | 83.48     |\n| Change (%) compared to the previous financial year                      | +8.2%     | -36.0%    | +69.9%    | -0.4%     | -14.3%    |\n| COMPANY PERFORMANCE                                                     |           |           |           |           |           |\n| Profit from recurring operations                                        | 2,260     | 2,423     | 3,024     | 3,348     | 3,116     |\n| Change (%) compared to the previous financial year (2)                  | -13.7%    | +18.3%    | +19.0%    | +11.3%    | +1.5%     |\n\nNC: Not calculable.\n\n- (1) Factors related to the compensation of the Chairman & CEO explaining the changes in the ratios:\n- \u00b7 FY 2020: payment of the annual variable compensation for FY 2019 for which the achievement rate was 159%;\n- \u00b7 FY 2021: impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the FY 2020 variable compensation paid during FY 2021;\n- \u00b7 FY 2022: increase in the fixed compensation and payment of the annual variable compensation for FY 2021 for which the achievement rate was 180%;\n- \u00b7 FY 2023: payment of the annual variable compensation for FY 2022 for which the achievement rate was 180%;\n- \u00b7\n- FY 2024: payment of the annual variable compensation for FY 2023 for which the achievement rate was 151.25%.\n- (2) Organic growth, adjusted for the effects of exchange rates and changes in the scope of consolidation.",

        "page_content": "## Compensation of Executive Committee members\n\nThe  Compensation  Committee  is  kept  regularly  informed  of changes  in  the  compensation  of  the  Group's  key  executives. The Committee ensures consistency between the compensation policy applicable to the Executive Corporate Officer and the policy applicable to the Group's key executives in France and abroad. It also makes sure that CSR criteria are included in these executives' variable compensation.\n\nThe governance structure of the Pernod Ricard Group was changed during  FY  2024.  The  Chairman  &  CEO  is  now  assisted  by  the Executive Committee (ExCom) and an Executive Leadership Team (ELT),  which  bring  together  the  heads  of  the  Group's  key corporate  functions  and  key  business  leaders  from  its  main markets and brands.\n\nThe compensation of the members of the Executive Committee (excluding  the  Chairman  &  CEO),  which  is  set  by  Executive Management,  comprises  an  annual  fixed  portion,  plus  a  highly incentivising variable portion, for which the criteria are based on both the Group's financial and non-financial performance, as is the case for the Executive Corporate Officer.\n\nThe  members  of  the  Executive  Leadership  Team  and  all  of  the Group's senior managers have a similar pay structure, based on the same Group financial performance indicators as those applicable to the Executive Committee, and they are all assessed based on CSR criteria. They are also assessed on the performance of their entity/market.\n\nTotal  fixed  compensation  awarded  to  the  members  of  the Executive Committee, including the Executive Corporate Officer, amounted to \u20ac5.5 million for FY 2024 (compared with \u20ac8.6 million for  FY  2023).  In  addition  to  this,  total  variable  compensation  of \u20ac5.4 million was paid in FY 2024 in respect of FY 2023 (compared with \u20ac8.4 million paid in FY 2023).\n\nThe total recurring expense in respect of pension obligations for members  of  the  Executive  Committee,  including  the  Executive Corporate Officer, was \u20ac2.8 million in the financial statements for FY 2024 (compared with \u20ac4.1 million in FY 2023).\n\nThe  difference  between  the  two  financial  years  is  due  to  the Group's  tighter  governance  structure,  led  by  an  Executive Committee made up of eight members at 30 June 2024, rather than 17 members, as was the case previously.\n\n## 2.7 Non-discrimination policy and diversity in Top Management\n\nThe non-discrimination policy is based on reliable and consistent global  talent  identification  and  management  processes,  as  well as  succession  planning  focused  on  performance  and  potential. Considerable  effort  has  been  made  over  the  past  few  years  to ensure  the  quality  and  objectivity  of  the  assessment.  The 'TransfoHRm'  HR  Strategy  announced  in  2018  is  inherently  a diverse-centric  strategy  ensuring  that  key  processes  such  as talent development and management are fair, objective, consistent and  equitable.  This  strategy  resulted  in  the  implementation  of the  'Let's  Talk  Talent'  programme,  a  global  performance  and talent management process based on an objective assessment of performance and potential, used for calibration and powered by the Workday platform. This process aims to ensure the greatest consistency across all affiliates globally in performance assessment, personal development and career advancement for all the Group's employees.\n\nMoreover, in the wake of the global 'Better Balance' initiative, a key global area of focus has been to continue accelerating gender balance in senior leadership positions, at a global level. In addition, objectives  have  been  defined  for  the  Group's  Management bodies, identified as the 'Top 500' (15) employees, and a series of actions have been taken to help achieve these objectives (16) .\n\nIn 2019, Pernod Ricard's Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nominations and Governance Committee, established binding objectives  within  its  Sustainability  &  Responsibility  roadmap relating to diversity in the Group's management bodies: by 2030, Pernod Ricard's Top Management will have to include a minimum of 40% of each gender.\n\nAll the initiatives undertaken by Pernod Ricard in favour of diversity and inclusion  are  essential  to  reach  these  targets.  They  lay  the foundations  of  more  equitable,  diverse  and  inclusive  processes for  attracting  and  growing  a  diverse  talent  pipeline  globally  at Pernod Ricard.\n\nThe  Group's  initiatives  are  showing  tangible  progress,  as  the programmes implemented have delivered the following results:\n\n- \u00b7 for the Executive Committee, the proportion of women increased from 7% to 38% between 2015 and 2024; and\n- \u00b7 for the 'Top 500', the proportion of women rose from 19% to 38% between 2015 and 2024.\n\nThe diversity policy and the results obtained are presented annually to the Board of Directors by Senior Management.",

        "page_content": "## 3.1 Our Sustainability & Responsibility (S&R) strategy at a glance\n\n## 3.1.1 A strategy built on a long-standing commitment\n\nPernod  Ricard's  commitment  to  Sustainability  and  Responsibility (S&R)  reaches  far  back  in  the  Group's  history.  Its  founder  Paul Ricard  was  an  early  philanthropist  who  created  the  Paul  Ricard Oceanographic  Institute  in  1966  in  reaction  to  rising  industrial pollution  in  the  Mediterranean  Sea.  The  Group  has  carried  its founder's vision from the beginning, taking a proactive stance to address  social  and  environmental  challenges,  both  present and future.\n\nDoing  so  requires  a  holistic  approach  as  ESG  challenges  are,  by nature, interconnected. Launched in 2019, the Pernod Ricard 2030 S&R roadmap 'Good Times from a Good Place' operates on this principle, embedding sustainable and responsible thinking at the core of the Group's modus operandi .\n\nIn  times  defined  by  'polycrisis',  shaped  by  climate  change  and extreme  weather  events,  pandemics,  economic  and  financial instability,  political  and  social  conflicts  around  the  world,  this approach  matters  more  than  ever  to  ensure  the  resilience  of Pernod Ricard's business.\n\nToday,  Pernod  Ricard  is  committed  to  investing  in  a  net-zero future and accelerating the transition to regenerative agriculture while innovating to adopt more circular solutions. In its approach to  these  challenges,  the  Group  puts  diversity  and  fairness  first, and  seeks  to  empower  people  across  its  supply  chain  while pursuing its wide range of actions promoting responsible alcohol consumption.\n\n## ABOUT THIS SECTION\n\nThis section represents the non-financial performance reporting segment of the present Universal Registration Document. In line with  Pernod  Ricard's  commitments  towards  transparency  and  accountability,  it  features  a  comprehensive  dashboard  of  ESG indicators  in  subsection  3.3,  most  notably  those  pertaining  to  the  Group's  S&R  roadmap  commitments.  These  indicators  are contextualised  and  further  detailed  in  the  subsequent  subsections,  which  follow  an  Environmental,  Social,  and  Governance structure.  This  structure  is  simpler  to  consult  and  helps  to  prepare  regulatory  alignment  with  future  requirements.  The consideration given to presenting this information reflects the Group's intent to continuously implement best practices wherever possible, up to and including disclosure, an ongoing process to be reinforced in the future.\n\n## 3.1.2 A year of S&R at Pernod Ricard\n\nThis  year  has  confirmed  the  acceleration  of  the  Group's  2030  roadmap  'Good  Times  from  a  Good  Place'  to  drive  social  and environmental progress with some commitments achieved ahead of plan. What follows is an overview of key achievements and a brief outlook on the year to come for each of the four pillars of the Group's S&R roadmap: Nurturing Terroir, Valuing People, Circular Making, and Responsible Hosting.\n\n## Nurturing Terroir\n\nPernod Ricard is highly dependent on well-balanced ecosystems and  natural  ingredients:  all  the  Group's  brands  come  from nature and some 350 terroirs (1) around the world. The Group is committed to nurturing every terroir, inclusive of local communities, and  aims  to  address  the  challenges  of  climate  change  and biodiversity  loss  to  ensure  quality  ingredients  now  and  for generations to come.\n\nHaving  completed  a  comprehensive  risk  mapping  for  the 150 terroirs from which the Group sources its key agricultural raw materials (2) ,  the  implementation of sustainable sourcing practices is  now  being  accelerated.  This  initiative  includes  deploying certifications  and  risk  mitigation  plans  across  the  key  supply chains to ensure responsible procurement.\n\n## Valuing People\n\nPernod Ricard is committed to creating a safe, fair, and inclusive environment  where  sharing  warmth,  care,  and  respect  are  the standard  for  engaging  and  empowering  people  everywhere, within the Group and throughout its value chain.\n\nThese commitments gained momentum during FY24. Notably, the Group  rolled-out  its  'Be  the  One'  campaign  reinforcing  the importance for everyone to act at their own level in preserving the mental, social, and physical health of employees. The Group\n\nFor the strategic terroirs, Pernod Ricard is pioneering regenerative agriculture projects. These projects adopt a holistic approach,  considering  the  entire  ecosystem-including  plants, soil, water, carbon, biodiversity and livelihoods.\n\nIn FY25, the Group will continue to implement its comprehensive terroir  strategy  which  aims  to  create  resilient  agricultural systems that benefit both the environment and the surrounding communities.\n\nalso reviewed its global Diversity & Inclusion governance, vision and  priorities  with  the  emphasis  placed  on  inclusion  and launched  a  voluntary  inclusion  self-assessment  designed  to promote inclusive behaviours.\n\nFor  FY25,  the  Group  aims  to  deepen  its  D&I  and  H&S  culture through  engagement  and  empowerment  and  will  notably continue rolling-out its D&I Framework as well as its H&S 'Be the one' campaign and H&S training program 'Care by Learning'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Pernod Ricard is committed to minimising resource use at every step in its value chain by imagining, producing, and distributing products and experiences in more optimised and circular ways. Climate change with its impact on the sourcing of raw materials and water availability is a threat to the Group's business and value chain, therefore mitigation and adaptation to climate change is a major focus of Pernod Ricard's environmental policy. The Group is working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting its business to ensure resilience in the face of climate-related risks.\n\nIn  FY24,  Pernod  Ricard  got  its  new  carbon  reduction  targets validated  by  the  Science  Based  Targets  initiative  (SBTi),  in  line with  its  1.5\u00b0C  pathway  Net  Zero  ambition.  The  Group  also\n\n## Responsible Hosting\n\nPernod  Ricard  is  committed  to  promoting  responsible  drinking and has a role to play in preventing alcohol misuse. To this end, the  Group  works  with  stakeholders  to  achieve  real  change  and continuously strengthens its responsible business practices.\n\nIn FY24, Pernod Ricard continued its effort as a proactive player in the industry to roll out digital labels to empower consumers to make informed and responsible choices about alcohol. More than half  a  billion  bottles  with  digital  labels  have  been  shipped worldwide in 166 markets.\n\nMoreover,  the  Group  continued  to  deliver  strong  responsibility messages  through  initiatives  targetting  our  consumers  to  help them  adopt  responsible  behaviours  regarding  alcohol.  With  its second  wave  in  FY24,  the  Drink  More  Water  campaign  has\n\ncontinued improving the quality of its carbon emissions measure, working closely with suppliers to collect specific emissions factors for 66% of its Scope 3 GHG emissions and developed CO 2 MET, a new tool to track and manage its carbon footprint, in partnership with CO 2 AI. In parallel, the Group successfully reduced its direct carbon emissions (Scopes 1 & 2) as well as its water consumption intensity  at  distilleries,  exceeding  its  targets  for  FY24  on  these two key objectives.\n\nIn FY25, the Group will continue investing in technologies to lower carbon  emissions  linked  to  distillation  and  packaging,  and implementing programmes to deliver on its water management commitments.\n\nreached over 100 million people online in 2 months, and overall since  its  launch  600  million  online  and  more  than  23  million people  on-the-ground  in  61  countries.  Pernod  Ricard  iconic brands  have  now  launched  10  marketing  campaigns  with responsibility  messages  at  their  heart  to  reach  108  million consumers, while 16 out of 30 of the Group's public-facing Brand Homes  have  been  certified  'Responsible  Hosts'  to  create  safe places for their visitors to master the art of tasting.\n\nIn  FY25,  the  Group  will  continue  the  roll-out  of  its  current initiatives while embracing a new Responsible Drinking ambition which  will  aim  at  embarking  our  consumers  in  responsible drinking journey.\n\n## 3.2 Our grain-to-glass strategy in line with our vision 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9'\n\n## 3.2.1 A S&R strategy embedded in the Group's business\n\nThe Pernod Ricard S&R roadmap covers all Group activities, from grain to glass. The Group's S&R ambition sits at the heart of its mission to 'unlock the magic of human connection by bringing Good Times from a Good Place.' For Pernod Ricard, S&R is a key business driver and is proving an important lever to accelerate its transformation by driving innovation, giving purpose to its brands, attracting talent, and bringing to life a vision of a more convivial world.\n\n## PERNOD RICARD'S MANIFESTO\n\n' Cr\u00e9ateurs  de  convivialit\u00e9' :  true  to  Pernod  Ricard's  founding  spirit,  the  Group  has  been  bringing  people  together  since  its beginning, inviting them to share privileged moments and forge new friendships every day through our world-class portfolio of premium wines and spirits.\n\nWe are passionate hosts , a family of exceptional people who are committed to fighting alcohol misuse and creating a better way of living and working together, bringing good times today and for generations to come.\n\nWe  are  respectful  guests ,  who  care  for  and  strive  to  protect  and  nurture  the  terroirs  and  environments  in  which  we  live. We partner with local farmers and respect local communities to benefit our planet, our consumers and business.\n\nWe bring good times from a good place , to create a more convivial world, a world without excess.",

The strategy primarily contributes to 8 SDGs, though it addresses 14 SDGs across the Group's entire value chain.\n\nThe S&R roadmap is the result of a long process of interviews and consultations  with  over  300  internal  and  external  stakeholders and  experts  globally.  Over  20  workshops  were  held  with representatives of Brand Companies, Market Companies, different regions, HQ, and the Top Management team.\n\nThe  Group  closely  monitors  its  commitments,  objectives,  and performance  indicators.  It  reviews,  challenges,  and  adapts  its strategy and related roadmap according to its progress and the surrounding context. This ensures long-term consistency between the  Group's  growing  ambitions  and  its  impact,  while  enabling new,  more  effective  monitoring  tailored  to  the  expectations  of the various stakeholders.\n\n## JOINING FORCES WITH OTHER LEADERS\n\nPernod Ricard joined the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a coalition of global businesses working together to limit the climate crisis, restore nature and tackle inequality, with a vision to build a world where nine billion people are living well and within the boundaries of the planet, by 2050. As part of its membership, Pernod Ricard has also joined the One Planet Business for Biodiversity (OP2B) - an international, cross-sectoral and action-oriented business coalition on biodiversity with a specific focus on regenerative agriculture.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  newly  created  role  truly  embeds sustainability within Operations, enables acceleration and supports the roadmap implementation throughout the Group's value chain, looking at how we source raw materials, how we create, make and serve our brands around the world, as well as how we take care of people throughout our value chain and promote a responsible use\n\nof  alcohol.

For more information on a given commitment, associated policies, and KPIs, refer to the relevant subsection of the present section indicated in the 'Reference' column.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTABLE 1 - ESG KPIs DASHBOARD\n\n| Commitment                                                                                                               | Target  year   | Performance  target   | Performance  in FY23   | Performance  in FY24   | Progress  status   | Reference  URD   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| NURTURING TERROIR (E)                                                                                                    |                |                       |                        |                        |                    |                  |\n| Cover all key agricultural raw materials (1)  by risk mapping                                                            | 2022           | 100%                  | 100%                   | 100%                   |                    | 3.4.2.2          |\n| Produce or source all key raw materials (1) in line with sustainability standards                                        | 2030           | 100%                  | 34%                    | 39%                    |                    | 3.4.2.3          |\n| Implement in all direct affiliates a regenerative agriculture  or biodiversity programme linked to priority terroirs (2) | 2030           | 100%                  | 82%                    | 100%                   |                    | 3.4.2.4          |\n| Test local models for regenerative farming systems  in the Group's vineyards in 8 wine regions (3)                       | 2025           | 8                     | 7                      | 8                      |                    | 3.4.2.4          |\n| Empower, train or support farmers  (S)                                                                                   | 2030           | 5,000 (2)             | 10,506                 | 11,203                 |                    | 3.5.2.2          |\n| VALUING PEOPLE (S)                                                                                                       |                |                       |                        |                        |                    |                  |\n| Ensure gender pay equity across the business                                                                             | Ongoing        | <1% (4)               | 1.3 %                  | 1.6 %                  |                    | 3.5.1.1.1        |\n| Achieve a gender balanced (5)  Top Management (6)                                                                        | 2030           | 40-60%                | 36 %                   | 38 %                   |                    | 3.5.1.1.1        |\n| Offer all employees at least one training session  during the FY                                                         | Ongoing        | 100%                  | 99%                    | 99 %                   |                    | 3.5.1.2.3        |\n| Offer all employees at least one future-fit training session  every 3 years                                              | 2030           | 100%                  | 21%                    | 60 %                   |                    | 3.5.1.2.3        |\n| Become \"best in class\" in the Wines & Spirits industry  for Health & Safety: moving towards zero accidents (7)           | 2025           | Towards 0  accidents  | 60                     | 44                     |                    | 3.5.1.3.1        |\n| Support all medium and high-risk suppliers  through a mitigation plan (8)                                                | 2025           | Mitigation  plans     | In progress            | In progress            |                    | 3.5.2.1          |\n| Align with the United Nations Guiding Principles  (UNGPs) on Human Rights                                                | 2025           | Alignment             | In progress            | In progress            |                    | 3.5.1.5          |\n\n<!-- image -->",

This regulation requires the Group to disclose its business model and information on key non-financial risks  in  this  statement.  These  include  risks  related  to  the environment, employment, society, Human Rights, tax evasion (4) , and corruption.\n\n- \u00b7 For  more  information  on  the  Group's  key  non-financial  risks see subsections 3.3.2.1 and 3.3.2.2 below.\n- \u00b7 For more information on the Group's key risks see section 4. Risk management.\n- \u00b7 For more information on Pernod Ricard's business model see Section 1.\n\n## 3.3.2.1 Presentation of the risk mapping methodology\n\nLast  updated  in  FY21,  the  Group's  risk  mapping  presents  and classifies the risks based on their potential impact and probability of occurrence across the Group's activities (5) . Some of these risks are  specific  to  sustainability.  To  ensure  such  risks  and  any opportunities are properly identified and mapped, Pernod Ricard uses the following methodology:\n\n- \u00b7 every three years, the main risks faced by Pernod Ricard are:\n- i. mapped by direct affiliates and HQ functions, and\n- ii. then consolidated at HQ level by the Group's Internal Audit Department;\n- \u00b7 the same Group risk mapping methodology and tool are used to identify the main sustainability risks for the 'Non-Financial Performance Statement';\n- \u00b7 these sustainability risks are subject to in-depth analysis led by the S&R Department through research, competitive benchmarking, and internal and external stakeholder dialogue (see subsection 3.2.2 Building sustainable & responsible relationships with  our  stakeholders  across  the  value  chain).  Other  key  HQ experts, including from Operations, Legal, HR, Public Affairs, and Finance departments, were also involved in confirming the top 13 risks and opportunities;\n\n- \u00b7 the identified sustainability risks and opportunities were then cross-referenced  with  the  2021  Group  Risk  Mapping  for confirmation and to ensure consistency with the Group's major risks listed in Chapter 4;\n- \u00b7 the  resulting  thirteen  non-financial  risks  and  opportunities were  subsequently  presented  to,  and  signed  off,  by  the  S&R Senior Steering Committee (formerly Executive Committee and Global Sustainable Business CODI members) and the Board of Directors' CSR Committee.\n\nIn  FY24,  Pernod  Ricard  started  to  work  on  the  implementation of  the  new  Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting  Directive  (CSRD). The  Sustainable  Business  and  Finance  teams,  along  with  Tech and Data teams and other key functions have performed a double materiality and gap analysis to better understand the needs and implications  for  Pernod  Ricard's  compliance  with  the  CSRD  and identify  opportunities  to  accelerate  the  S&R  roadmap  and improve business resilience.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is thus essential to identify such potential risks and opportunities and ensure the roll-out of adequate action and/or mitigation plans. What follows is a list  of  the  13  relevant  key  sub-risks  that  have been  identified  and  their  definitions,  as  well  as  opportunities\n\nGiven the nature of Pernod Ricard's activities, the Group does not consider  'tax  evasion'  to  be  a  major  non-financial  risk.  It  was therefore  not  deemed  necessary  to  explore  it  in  this  'NonFinancial Statement'. Nevertheless, 'tax evasion' is discussed in subsection 3.7.2 'Tax policy'.\n\nwhere applicable.\n\n| Risk category & description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Chapter 3 subsections                                             |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                   |\n| Responsible supply chain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 3.5.2.1 Procuring responsibly                                     |\n| Beverage industry supply chains are inherently diverse and fragmented due to the multiplicity and diversity of  actors,  from  agriculture  to  merchandising.

        "page_content": "## 3.4 Our environmental sustainability\n\nPernod Ricard is highly dependent on natural ecosystems: all the Group's  brands  come  from  nature,  in  some  350  terroirs  around the world. All the Group's activities, such as sourcing, production or packaging, require natural resources and impact these ecosystems by generating carbon emissions and waste. Therefore, environmental sustainability is crucial to Pernod Ricard and its many stakeholders in  the  face  of  climate  change,  biodiversity  loss,  and  resource overexploitation. Having embedded S&R at the core of its business, Pernod Ricard is committed to act in the long-term along its supply chain to foster a resilient, regenerative, and circular business model.\n\nIn order to build on the study carried out in FY23 to evaluate the vulnerability  and  resilience  of  its  business  in  light  of  the  latest scientific evidence and consumer insights, the Group has shared with its affiliates a breakdown of the study per region and conducted a more granular analysis of physical risks in each terroir.\n\nThis  work  forms  the  basis  of  this  section,  which  covers  the following topics:\n\n- (i) mitigating & adapting to climate change;\n- (ii) preserving nature & biodiversity;\n- (iii) using resources responsibly.\n\n## 3.4.1 Mitigating and adapting to climate change\n\nClimate change is one of the most urgent challenges facing this generation, and Pernod Ricard's business is particularly vulnerable to its impacts on terroirs, impacting yields and quality of  raw  materials.  Moreover,  Pernod  Ricard  generates  emissions contributing to climate change in a range of ways:\n\n- \u00b7 directly, by using fossil fuels on sites (Scope 1) and consuming electricity that generates GHG emissions (Scope 2);\n- \u00b7 indirectly, through  upstream  and  downstream  activities (agricultural raw materials, packaging, logistics, etc.) (Scope 3).\n\nMitigating  and  adapting  to  climate  change  is  a  major  area  of focus  for  Pernod  Ricard's  environmental  policy.  The  Group  is working  on  reducing  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  generated throughout  its  supply  chain  and  on  adapting  its  business  to ensure resilience to climate-related risks.\n\n## 3.4.1.1 Alignment with TCFD recommendations\n\nFor greater transparency, and to put its operations in perspective with the  reality  of  climate  change  and  its  consequences,  Pernod  Ricard follows the recommendations of the WRI (6) /WBCSD (7) GHG Protocol for carbon accounting, and of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) for climate risk assessment and disclosure. These guidelines provide a framework to disclose exposure, share information concerning the Group's mitigation plans, and assess the Group's effective response to climate-related risks. Regarding the  setting  of  climate  targets,  the  Group  is  committed  and aligned to SBTi guidance. For more information on Pernod Ricard's reporting in accordance with TCFD recommendations in FY24 and where  areas  of  improvement  remain,  refer  to  subsection  3.8.2 'Task-Force  on  Climate  related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD) reporting recommendation alignment table'.\n\n## 3.4.1.1.1 Next steps in the Group's reporting approach\n\nPernod  Ricard  follows  TCFD  recommendations  to  inform stakeholders of its climate-related risks and how these are being managed in the short-, medium-, and long-term. Due to the wide geographical footprint of Group operations, it is crucial to monitor and  analyse  the  impacts  of  climate  change  at  a  regional  level. One of the Group's primary objectives is to make the management of  climate  change-related  risks  and  opportunities  an  essential component of its operating model across its organisation.\n\nPernod Ricard will continue to develop its assessment of climaterelated risks and opportunities, improve the quality of its scenario modelling  and  impact  quantification,  and  to  further  embed  its approach  to  risk  management  and  mitigation  throughout  the organisation.  The  Group  will  continue  to  improve  its  strategic responses  to  the  changing  future  outlined  in  the  latest  IPCC (8) report. For instance, the Group's analysis involved a first consistent screening  of  climate-related  risks  and  opportunities.  This  first iteration  could  not  tackle  the  highly  complex  modelling  task  of analysing compound and cascading risks, as this analysis approached each risk  separately  without  including  retroactive  feedback  loops ( e.g. , the way repeated, combined heatwaves compounded by water scarcity  can  increase  the  risk  of  facility  business  disruption).  In the near future, the Group will integrate a wider compound view\n\ninto  its  future  exercises.  Additionally,  thoroughly  quantifying  the financial  impacts  at  stake  remains  a  work  in  progress,  and  the methodologies  used  in  this  process  are  undergoing  constant improvement.\n\n## 3.4.1.1.2 Disclaimers concerning risks and scenario-led analysis\n\nThe  scope  of  this  TCFD  section  focuses  on  the  main  risks  and includes forward-looking statements based on current high-level estimates  and  assumptions  about  anticipated  events  and  other variables.\n\nClimate  scenarios  are  developed  by  combining  information  on future GHG emissions, corresponding atmospheric concentrations, and other factors such as economic activities, emission reduction policies,  and  technological  changes.  These  projections  of  future events  and  the  scenario  analyses  that  follow  are  based  on publicly  available  information  as  well  as  information  held  by Pernod  Ricard.  Although  the  Group  strives  to  provide  accurate and  timely  information,  there  can  be  no  guarantee  that  such information is accurate as of the date it is received or that it will remain  so  in  the  future.  These  analyses  are  performed  using sophisticated climate models based on assumptions and variables that, given the level of uncertainty related to climate modelling, may or may not materialise in the coming decades. Many of these assumptions  relate  to  factors  that  are  beyond  Pernod  Ricard's ability to control or precisely estimate, such as future market and economic conditions, the behaviours of other market participants, changes  in  consumer  preferences,  costs  of  raw  materials, interest-rate  and  exchange-rate  fluctuations,  changes  in  tax rates, changes in law, and the actions of government regulators.",

With a strong expertise on climate & nature and circularity, the team defines  environmental  targets  for  the  Group  and  co -constructs local action plans with affiliates. Sustainability & Responsibility Leads within affiliates ensure that sustainability risks and opportunities are embedded into local strategies and that the performance is properly  monitored.  The  Sustainable  Business  team,  along  with other  departments  (Procurement,  Innovation,...)  oversees  the execution of the roadmaps, the development of relevant policies and  procedures  e.g.,  carbon  reduction,  responsible  sourcing, sustainable  CapEx,  and  the  definition  of  metrics  (scope  and calculation methodologies). For more information on the Group's governance instances relating to sustainability issues (including climate), refer to subsection 3.2.3 'A new integrated governance structure'.\n\nLast year, the Group also held the Climate Leadership Day ,  an executive-level  event  on  climate-related  issues.  This  first-of-itskind event brought together the Executive Committee members to  discuss  and  agree  on  initiatives  with  large-scale  potential  to improve  the  Group's  climate  resilience  and  implementation\n\nroadmaps relating to high-priority climate-related issues. Topics of  discussion  on  the  agenda  included  resilience  of  agricultural raw materials  to  climate  change,  decarbonisation  of  operations and  supply  chains,  as  well  as  appropriate  governance  and operating models to implement them.\n\n## 3.4.1.2.2 Executive remuneration related to climate change performance\n\nThe non-financial part of the Chairman and CEO's annual variable compensation  includes  CSR  criteria  including  KPIs  related  to carbon, nature and climate.\n\nIn terms of Long Term Incentives, the allocation of performance shares is  subject  to  internal  performance  conditions,  including  a non-financial  criterion  in  addition  to  the  internal  financial performance  criterion.  One  of  the  four  objectives  to  meet  this criterion  is  to  implement  the  roadmap  towards  achieving Scopes 1&2 GHG emissions reduction targets on the Group's own production  sites  by  2030.  This  is  applicable  to  performance shares  granted  to  the  Chairman  and  CEO  and  to  all  the  Top Executives.\n\n## 3.4.1.3 Pernod Ricard approach to risk management\n\n## 3.4.1.3.1 Integrated monitoring of climate risks and opportunities\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities are identified as part of the Group's global risk mapping. The global risk mapping, based on local risks identified by Group affiliates and on functional risks identified by Group functions, is updated every three years by the internal audit team. This team reports to the Chairman and CEO, and also presents its results to the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee. The Group's major risks are monitored annually.

        "page_content": "To  integrate  climate-related  risks  and  opportunities  within Pernod Ricard's multidisciplinary, company-wide risk management process, the Group started by identifying all potentially relevant risks  and  opportunities  across  its  operations  and  value  chain, upstream and downstream.\n\nClimate risks have been identified based on the work of a panel of TCFD Taskforce members. A risks and opportunities universe was  defined  following  a  multi-criteria  analysis  based  on  the likelihood and severity of impacts, weighted by all representatives during ad-hoc TCFD workshops. The highlighted risks during these preliminary  steps  were  then  assessed  in  terms  of  qualitative gradation scale, physical units impacts, and/or financial impacts, depending on the risk considered. The results of the analysis of climate-related risks and opportunities were then integrated into the Group's global risk mapping.\n\nOur environmental sustainability\n\nEnvironmental  risks  and  their  mitigation  plans  are  under  the responsibility of the EVP Integrated Operations and S&R. The Group's environmental  roadmap  also  encompasses  environmental  action plans for the main environmental risks. At Brand level, each Brand Owner with manufacturing activities is required to implement an ISO  14001  certified  Environment  Management  System  for  its production  activities,  and  therefore  has  identified  the  impacts and  risks  of  its  activities  on  the  environment,  climate  change being  one  of  the  most  material.  At  site  level,  local  Business Continuity Plans that include climate change-related considerations are periodically updated and reviewed.\n\n## 3.4.1.4 Pernod Ricard climate risk strategy\n\n## 3.4.1.4.1 Identifying climate-related risks and opportunities\n\n## Use of scenario analysis in the present disclosure\n\nIn  FY23,  the  Group  conducted  its  first  scenario  analysis  for  a selection  of  climate  risks  following  the  TCFD  recommendations using various narratives. These are all-encompassing prospective views  used  to  guide  the  decision-making  process,  which  are further refined into physical scenarios and transition scenarios for operational purposes. They integrate both internal (growth rate, business  evolution,  Pernod  Ricard's  decarbonisation  strategy, etc.)  and  external  drivers  (regulations  &  policies,  technological improvements, etc.). In FY24, a dedicated climate scenario report was  provided  to  each  of  Pernod  Ricard  largest  affiliates.  In parallel, to deepen the understanding of the impact and possible mitigation  actions  related  to  agricultural  supply  chains,  a granular  study  on  physical  risks  was  conducted  for  each  of Pernod Ricard's main terroirs.\n\nThree  IPCC  scenarios  -  Representative  Concentration  Pathways (RCPs) - focused on physical impacts have been considered when assessing  physical  climate  risks  and  Pernod  Ricard  activities exposure:\n\nScenario RCP2.6 (+1.5\u00b0C by 2100)\n\nScenario RCP4.5 (+2.4\u00b0C by 2100)\n\nScenario RCP8.5 (+4\u00b0C by 2100)\n\nThese  three  scenarios  were  used  to  derive  gross  financial estimates, before considering any impact of mitigation measures. These results will inform the implementation of Pernod Ricard's resilience  plan.  External  data  providers  were  used  regarding agricultural impacts (through FAO (9) portals) and ad-hoc climaterelated extreme events (such as water stress and coastal/riverine flooding from the WRI Aqueduct data platform), all aligned with the  RCP4.5  and  RCP8.5  scenarios.  Physical  risks  related  to  the reduced  availability  of  raw  materials  and  the  impacts  on operations of climate-related events have been considered using those physical scenarios.\n\nFor  the  transition  risks  and  opportunities  studied,  two  NGFS (10) scenarios  were  used  and  further  customised  to  provide  a comprehensive  view  of  the  evolution  of  energy-related  drivers (energy  mix  per  geography,  carbon  price,  the  evolution  of emission factors, developments in energy efficiency, etc.):\n\nNGFS 'Delayed Transition' (+1.6\u00b0C by 2100)\n\nNGFS 'Net Zero 2050' (+1.4\u00b0C by 2100)\n\nTwo  transition  narratives  were  drawn  from  this  that  differ  in policy reaction, steepness, and homogeneity across geographical areas,  while  ensuring  to  keep  a  stringent  below  1.5\u00b0C  scenario. This  difference  was  translated  into  divergent  carbon  price pathways  and  policy  implementation  rate,  for  instance,  across time  horizons  and  geographies,  which  led  to  differentiated outcomes per scenario.\n\nIt  must  be  noted  that  scenario  analysis  is  a  process  identifying and assessing the potential implications of a range of plausible future  states  under  conditions  of  uncertainty.  Scenarios  are hypothetical  constructs  and  are  not  designed  to  deliver  precise outcomes  or  forecasts.  Instead,  scenarios  provide  a  way  for Pernod Ricard  to  consider  how  the  future  might  look  if  certain trends continue or certain conditions are met.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Carbon price mechanisms strengthening\n\nAll results are displayed across three time horizons (2030, 2040, 2050) and three different scenarios.\n\nAll  Pernod  Ricard  European  and  UK-located  operations  are already  subject  to  carbon  pricing  mechanisms,  directly  through Pernod Ricard's own  operations,  as  well  as  indirectly  through  its suppliers' increased costs that further pass on these cost increases to the Group. The continued recent spikes in EU and UK carbon allowance  prices,  as  well  as  the  expansion  of  the  implemented and  planned  EU-ETS (13) to  most  major  countries,  adding  to cross -border  international  mechanisms  such  as  CBAM (14) ,  Corsia (for air emissions) and IMO (15) (maritime emissions) could all form a major financial risk for Pernod Ricard. These trends are further supported by IEA (16) and NGFS transition scenarios confirming the need to bind ubiquitous carbon mechanisms at a sound level to reach  emissions  pathways  aligned  with  1.5\u00b0C  or  even  a  'well below' 2\u00b0C scenario (WB2DS).\n\n## Scope and methodology\n\nThe analysis covers both direct impacts related to Pernod Ricard Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, and indirect impacts related to Scope 3 emissions  for  the  following  emission  sources:  agricultural  raw materials, dry goods, upstream and downstream transportation. As such, the analysis covers 100% of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions and 85%  of  Scope  3  emissions,  based  on  the  FY22  Pernod  Ricard carbon footprint.\n\nBased on two transition scenarios outputs (NGFS 'Delayed Transition' and 'Net-Zero 2050' scenarios), Pernod Ricard modelled the impact of  carbon  price  evolution  through  various  scenarios  and  time horizons on its business, including both direct operations (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions). Three prospective drivers were considered:\n\n- \u00b7 carbon price (\u20ac/tCO 2 e);\n- \u00b7 carbon mechanisms coverage rate (i.e. , the share of emissions that  is  truly  subject  to  non-free  allowance  and  is  being  taxed per activity - glass sector, transportation, etc.);\n- \u00b7 supplier  carbon  pass-through  rate  ( i.e. ,  suppliers'  ability  to pass  their  increased  operating  costs  on  to  Pernod  Ricard  by raising their own prices).\n\nThe  Group's  FY22  carbon  footprint  was  divided  into  different geographies  based  on  affiliate  and  suppliers'  locations,  to differentiate  between  several  carbon  price  and  coverage  rate pathways. Carbon price prospective values were taken from the above-listed  public  transition  scenarios  outputs  in  2030,  2040 and 2050.\n\n## Key findings\n\nIn  all  scenarios,  carbon  policies  will  continue  to  differ  between mature markets (OECD (17) ) and the rest of the world, resulting in wide variations in carbon prices by geography.\n\nCarbon  prices  are  expected  to  reach  their  highest  levels  in  the 'Delayed Transition' scenario, wherein most of the transition is led by regulatory strengthening (contra the 'Net-Zero 2050' scenario, wherein  regulatory  strengthening  is  lower  due  to  international cooperation).\n\n## Business interruption risks on production sites: focus on water scarcity and heatwaves\n\nThe  scenarios  used  for  the  current  analysis  are  IPCC  RCP climate  scenarios  RCP4.5  and  RCP8.5.  RCP2.6  has  been discarded from the analysis as being the less stringent and meaningful from a physical risk assessment perspective.\n\nThe increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events induced by climate change will impact Pernod Ricard's operations and  industrial  facilities,  leading  to  direct  damage  to  stock  and content  as  well  as  to  periods  of  business  disruption  periods. Given the nature of the Group's business, cyclones and flooding, as  well  as  extreme  heatwaves  and  water  stress,  constitute  the most material hazards. While Pernod Ricard has already adapted and prepared to cyclones and flooding events through appropriate business  continuity  plans,  construction  design,  and  repeated monitoring,  dealing  with  water  scarcity  and  heatwaves  remain the main challenge to deal with. For more information regarding the Group's commitments, policies, and programmes relating to water management, see subsection 3.4.3.1 'Preserving water resources'.\n\n## Scope and methodology\n\nThe  scenarios  were  used  to  determine  the  exposure  level  of  a selection of 117 sites considered as most impactful for the Group (54 Group-owned production sites and 63 supplier and co -packers facilities) to four hazards: cyclones, flooding, heatwaves, and water stress. This made it possible to analyse the relationship between the  intensity  of  these  hazards  and  the  asset  and  stock  value  at risk, or the loss of production they would generate. This analysis was  performed  for  several  scenarios,  time  horizons,  climate hazards,  by  type  of  site  (distillery,  bottling,  warehouse)  and  by Group affiliate.  As  mentioned,  Pernod  Ricard  chose  to  focus  on water  scarcity  and  heatwaves  in  this  year's  report  as  they represent the most material impacts.\n\nThe impacts of drought & water stress events are highly complex since  they  depend  both  on  climate-related  factors  ( i.e. , the intensity  &  frequency  of  drought  events)  and  socioeconomic factors ( i.e. , the level of pressure put on available water resources). To  define  water  stress  levels,  Pernod  Ricard  used  the  outputs provided by the WRI Aqueduct data platform, at a catchment level. Water  stress  measures  the  ratio  of  total  water  withdrawals  to available  renewable  surface  and  groundwater  supplies.  Higher values  indicate  more  competition  among  users,  and  hence  a higher risk of water shortage and business disruption in case of major drought event.\n\nThe  impact  of  heatwaves  can  be  translated  in  terms  of  labour productivity, using climate indicators quantifying the level of heat stress caused by heatwaves on people. While there is extensive literature  on  the  impacts  related  to  heat  stress  on  people  and labour  productivity,  papers  diverge  highly  as  there  is  no  clear consensus depending on the sector, activity type, geography, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 3.4.1.5 Ensuring business resilience through a decarbonisation roadmap\n\n## 3.4.1.5.1 A transition plan in action\n\nIn June 2019, the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) approved the first Pernod Ricard's GHG emission reduction targets. In July 2021, Pernod Ricard joined the 'Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C' to align its climate mitigation objectives with the Paris Agreement: to achieve net-zero global emissions by 2050 at the latest to limit global  warming  to  1.5\u00b0C.  In  May  2024,  a  new  set  of  targets aligned with 1,5\u00b0C Net Zero was validated by the SBTi, following the  recommendation to set Forest Land and Agriculture (FLAG) targets over the medium- and long-term:\n\n- \u00b7 In  the  near-term: Pernod  Ricard  commits  to  reducing absolute scope 1 & 2 emissions by 54% by FY30 from a FY22 baseline. The Group also commits to reducing absolute scope 3 FLAG emissions by 30.3% and non-FLAG emissions (purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution) by  25%  within  the  same  timeframe.  Pernod  Ricard  also commits  to  no  deforestation  across  its  primary  commodities linked to deforestation by the end of 2025.\n- \u00b7 In  the  long-term: Pernod  Ricard  commits  to  reducing  its absolute  scope  1  &  2  emissions  and  its  scope  3  non-FLAG emissions by 90% by FY50 from a FY22 baseline. Pernod Ricard also commits to reducing absolute scope 3 FLAG emissions by 72% within the same timeframe.\n- A  decarbonisation  roadmap  has  been  defined  for  all  Group production  sites.  This  is  based  on  major  CapEx  projects  and renewable  energy  initiatives  implemented  at  the  main  Group distilleries. On Scope 3, the Group is working alongside its main suppliers  and  building  lasting  relationships  to  accelerate  their decarbonisation pathways, through e.g., co-constructing roadmaps and conducting pilots.\n\nFor  more  information  on  the  Group's  carbon  footprint,  see subsection 3.4.1.6 'Overview of Pernod Ricard's carbon footprint'.\n\nTo  achieve  these  objectives,  the  Group  has  launched  actions addressing  each  of  its  main  emission  sources  and  adopt  new tools  to  accelerate  its  decarbonisation  and  climate  resilience through the use of Artificial Intelligence.\n\n## Scopes 1 and 2 - Own sites' emissions\n\nThe reduction of emissions from production sites relies mainly on two levers:\n\n- \u00b7 improving energy efficiency ;\n- \u00b7 using low-carbon energy sources .\n\nFor more information, see subsection 3.4.1.6.3 Carbon footprint reduction initiatives on Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.\n\n## Scope 3 - indirect GHG emissions\n\nThe Group is undertaking initiatives to reduce its main Scope 3 emissions, namely:\n\n- \u00b7 agricultural raw materials;\n- \u00b7 packaging and point of sale materials;\n- \u00b7 logistics & transport.\n\nThis  involves  not  only  in-house  innovation  efforts,  but  also  a strong  commitment  to  suppliers.  For  more  information,  see subsection  3.4.1.6.4  Carbon  footprint  reduction  initiatives  on Scope 3 emissions.\n\n## 3.4.1.5.2 An adaptation plan in action\n\n## Agricultural raw materials procurement adaptation plan\n\nPernod Ricard's adaptation plan is mainly based on the Group's policies  in  support  of  regenerative  agriculture  and  biodiversity preservation.\n\nImplementing regenerative agricultural practices and using technical and technological tools helps increase local resilience to climatic events. Pernod Ricard is scaling up and extending its regenerative viticulture pilot projects, which are already underway in eight wine regions around the world. The Group also supports similar projects with its grain suppliers, with ongoing research and collaboration efforts  to  encourage  sustainable  practices.  Various  levers  are considered:\n\n- \u00b7 establishing a diversified and resilient cropping system;\n- \u00b7 selecting and managing climate resistant grape varieties;\n- \u00b7 agricultural practices that maintain and improve soil health;\n- \u00b7 reducing  and  optimising  the  amount  of  water  needed  for agricultural production;\n- \u00b7 supporting  and  training  farmers  on  regenerative  agriculture practices;\n- \u00b7 varietal selection targeting resilience and resistance.\n\nFor more information on the Group's policies related to terroirs, see subsection 3.4.2 'Preserving nature & biodiversity'.\n\n## Preserving water resources\n\nTo preserve water resources in its direct operations, the Group focuses its efforts on two main drivers: reducing water consumption by implementing solutions to save, reuse, and recycle water and supporting water replenishment in high-risk watersheds. For the next few years, the Group has consolidated the water reduction roadmaps  from  the  main  contributing  affiliates  and  identified associated investment plans to achieve its 2030 targets. It must:\n\n- \u00b7 reduce water consumption, particularly in water-stressed areas;\n- \u00b7 support replenishment in water-stressed basins where production sites operate;\n- \u00b7 preserve  water  quality  by  monitoring  pollutants  released  by production sites;\n- \u00b7 fully comply with evolving environmental regulations.\n\nFor  more  information  on  Pernod  Ricard's  commitments  related to  water  management,  see  subsection  3.4.3.1  Preserving  water resources.\n\n## 3.4.1.5.3 Measures and objectives\n\nTo ensure it has the means to meet its targets and new regulatory obligations,  Pernod  Ricard  has  set  up  a  robust  governance structure  dedicated  to  Sustainability  &  Responsibility  issues  as well as detailed targets. Reporting and monitoring tools covering all the indicators in all Group affiliates make it possible to check on its progress and ensure all the involved functions are aligned in achieving these objectives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 3.4.1.6.3 Carbon footprint reduction initiatives on Scopes 1 and 2 emissions\n\n## Scopes 1 and 2 - Production site emissions\n\nOn production sites, the Group is working on two fronts:\n\n- \u00b7 improving energy efficiency: operationally, production sites are continuously  improving  their  energy  efficiency  by  monitoring consumption and performing in-depth energy assessments as well as regular investments. The rationale is to set energy-efficiency targets  and  launch  programmes  to  reduce  consumption  ( i.e. , renewing processes, new technologies, etc.). Several large sites have implemented ISO 50001 certified energy management systems;\n- \u00b7 using  low-carbon  energy  sources: the  Group  is  working  to reduce fossil fuel use and switch to renewable energy, with the aim  of  using  100%  renewable  electricity  by  2025  (either through direct sourcing or Renewable Electricity Certificates).\n\nThis year, as part of its carbon reduction roadmap, the Group has continued  investing  heavily  in  the  decarbonisation  of  its distilleries,  with  a  total  of  43  million  euros  dedicated  to  this  in FY24.The main projects are the following ones:\n\n- \u00b7 in  Ireland,  development  of  the  MVR  (Mechanical  Vapour Recompression) strategy across the Midleton distillery, in order to  increase  the  energy  efficiency  and  substitute  the  use  of fossil natural gas by renewable electricity;\n- \u00b7 in Scotland,  development  of  the  MVR  strategy  in  malt distilleries (Glentauchers, Allt a'Bhainne, Dalmunach);\n\nOur environmental sustainability\n\n- \u00b7 in Scotland, adapting the grain distillery in Glasgow, in order to handle wet draff instead of drying it into dry feed (which uses fossil gas),  and  also  implementing  MVR  technology  on the columns;\n- \u00b7 installation  of  electric  boilers  in  small  or  remote  distilleries (such  as  Plymouth  gin  or  Scapa  malt  distilleries)  to  eliminate use of fossil gas;\n- \u00b7 in  Canada,  installation  of  a  MVR  evaporator  in  the  Hiram Walker distillery,  which  will  minimize  use  of  fossil  gas  for  the treatment of by-products.\n\nIn  India,  the  Group  was  able  to  eliminate  its  direct  emissions thanks to the conversion of the distillery  from  coal  to  biomass, which  reduced  its  GHG  emissions  from  over  45.900  tonnes  in FY21 to 530 tonnes in FY24.\n\nThe share of renewable electricity used this year increased from 76% in FY23 to 91% in FY24 (production sites and administrative sites),  taking  into  account  electricity  generated  internally  on production sites and self-consumed (co-generation or photovoltaic production).  This  increase  is  in  line  with  the  RE100  by  FY25 commitment and was allowed by a more centralised procurement of renewable electricity.\n\nTo  encourage  these  transitions,  the  Group  uses  an  internal carbon  price  (shadow  cost  of  carbon)  to  prioritise  low  carbon CapEx  projects  by  improving  the  economic  business  case compared to a pure economic analysis. In FY24, the price used has been \u20ac80 per tonne of CO 2 equivalent.\n\n## PERNOD RICARD INVESTS TO DECARBONIZE ITS DISTILLERIES\n\nThe Group has made major investments to lead the way on low-carbon whiskey and whisky production in Ireland and Scotland. Two of the Group's major Brand Companies are investing in breakthrough emissions reduction technologies: Irish Distillers is investing \u20ac300 million with plans to use mechanical vapour recompression (MVR) at the Midleton distillery in County Cork, Ireland (expected to save up to 35 ktCO 2 e per year by 2030), and Chivas Brothers is allocating \u20ac100 million including for using bioenergy in two single malt distilleries in Scotland (expected to save up to 15 ktCO 2 e per year by 2030).\n\nTo leverage the growth of its premium American Whiskey portfolio, the Group is investing $250 million for a distillery and ageing facilities  in  Marion  County,  Kentucky,  which  aims  to  eliminate  use  of  fossil  fuels.  The  facility  is  also  expected  to  be  the  first distillery  of  its  size  in  the  U.S.  to  achieve  LEED  certification,  an  internationally  recognised sustainability framework for healthy, efficient, carbon and cost saving environmentally friendly buildings. The distillery and warehouses will include such low carbon technologies as electrode boilers powered by certified renewable electricity, enabling the distillery to avoid fossil fuels during bourbon production.\n\nCompared to FY22, the Scopes 1&2 GHG emissions of the Group's production sites decreased by 31% in absolute value, while the carbon intensity of direct activities (measured by the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions per kl of alcohol distilled) improved by 25% versus FY22 and 38% compared to the FY18 base year. Achievements made in FY24 reflect the efforts initiated by the Group in the recent years to reach its 2030 target.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This new credit facility has been committed to by 22 banks, with an initial maturity at April 2028, and includes two one-year extension options.\n\nMoreover, the Group added criteria to its long-term incentives plan ,  which were extended in FY22 to include KPIs relating to carbon reduction (scopes 1 & 2), diversity & inclusion, responsible drinking, and water consumption.\n\nFor  more  information  on  Pernod  Ricard's  long-term  incentives  plan,  please  refer  to  Section  2  of  the  present  document, subsection 2.6.5 'Other aspects of the compensation policy'.\n\nFor more information on Pernod Ricard's credit agreements, including sustainability-linked bonds and the Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) programme dated October 2022 and updated in June 2023, please refer to Section 5 of the present document, subsection 5.6.2 'Financing contracts'.\n\n## 3.4.1.6.4 Carbon footprint reduction initiatives on Scope 3 emissions\n\n## Scope 3 - Engaging with suppliers\n\nPernod  Ricard  firmly  believes  in  the  value  of  collaboration  and recognises  that  addressing  Scope  3  GHG  emissions  requires collective  action  and  a  holistic  approach.  As  such,  the  Group  is actively  engaging  with  its  suppliers  to  create  a  more  sustainable future for its industry and the planet. It prioritises building strong partnerships to develop effective strategies for carbon reduction based on the following core principles:\n\n- \u00b7 improving  the  quality  of  primary  CO 2 data across Pernod  Ricard's  supply  chain. The  Group  understands  that accurate  and  comprehensive  data  is  the  foundation  for informed decision-making. Closely collaborating with suppliers encourages them to refine their data collection processes and provides the Group with a clearer understanding of their carbon emissions.  This,  in  turn,  makes  it  possible  to  identify  areas  of improvement and develop targeted initiatives to reduce their environmental impact;\n- \u00b7 providing suppliers with the necessary tools and resources to  measure  their  carbon  footprint  effectively. Not  all suppliers may benefit from the same level of expertise or have access to advanced measurement techniques. The Group thus provides support by sharing best practices and deploying userfriendly measurement  tools, which enhances suppliers' capabilities when it comes to assessing their carbon footprint and identifying reduction opportunities;\n- \u00b7 open and collaborative discussions with suppliers. The Group complements  these  data-driven  approaches  with  a  strong emphasis on ensuring suppliers have a platform to exchange ideas, share experiences, and set ambitious CO 2 reduction targets in collaboration with the Group. Involving suppliers in decisionmaking processes ensures their expertise and perspectives are considered  and  leads  to  exploring  innovative  and  more ambitious projects with significant impact potential;\n\n- \u00b7 a  commitment  to  pushing  the  boundaries  and  exploring new possibilities. Pernod Ricard firmly believes this is key to true  sustainability,  and  strives  to  embrace  ambitious  projects that  challenge  the  status  quo  -  whether  they  concern implementing renewable energy sources, optimising transportation logistics, or adopting circular economy principles.\n\n## Scope 3 - Agricultural sourced materials\n\nAgricultural  sourced  materials  are  the  main  contributor  to  the carbon  footprint  of  Pernod  Ricard's  value  chain.  Given  the inherent reliance of its products on agriculture, establishing and supporting  improved  agricultural  practices  is  a  strategic  priority for the Group. The Group has been running regenerative viticulture pilot projects in its own vineyards to test new practices. It is also working with suppliers of agricultural raw materials to establish the best pathways to lower carbon emissions and increase carbon sequestration within the terroirs.\n\nIn these endeavours, the first step is to identify the baseline by collecting specific emission factors for the Group's main contributors and then to identify carbon emission drivers. In FY24, the protocol written and validated last year to refine the emissions related to broken rice and distillation in India by taking into account state and  supplier  specific  data  has  been  deployed  at  greater  scale. The Group has also modelled the decarbonisation pathways for its most  contributive  terroirs  by  taking  into  account  the deployment of  agricultural  practices  defined  in  its  regenerative agriculture framework.\n\nAgricultural  materials  are  a  highly  challenging  area  when  it comes to supporting change. Chief among these challenges will be  to  limit  the  risk  carried  on  the  return  and  to  gradually implement less-emitting practices. As such, the Group integrates economic considerations from the start of discussions in order to finance the transition (tests, training, financing of new equipment or inputs) as well as premiums aimed at encouraging and then compensating for any additional production costs.",

        "page_content": "## Scope 3 - Packaging and point of sale materials\n\nPackaging and point of sale materials (promotional items) account for the second-largest share of GHG emissions in Pernod Ricard's value chain. To reduce their carbon impact, the Group focuses on:\n\n- \u00b7 enhancing its eco-design approach to packaging, mainly focusing on weight reduction and increasing recycled content;\n- \u00b7 collecting  primary  data  on  its  suppliers'  carbon  footprint  to achieve a better understanding of its makeup, pinpoint issues, and develop relevant action plans to address them;\n- \u00b7 encouraging  suppliers  to  produce  CO 2 reduction  roadmaps aligned with the Group's Scope 3 Science-Based Target;\n- \u00b7 as per its CO 2 reduction roadmap, implementing joint actions with suppliers to reduce emissions connected to their manufacturing operations  (see  subsection  3.4.3.2  'Circularity:  limiting  and eliminating waste');\n- \u00b7 exploring new  technologies and innovative low-carbon methods to meet Group packaging production requirements;\n- \u00b7 exploring alternative packaging and distribution models.\n\n## IMPLEMENTING LOGISTICS EMISSIONS TRACKING WITHIN PERNOD RICARD BRAND COMPANIES\n\nIn FY24, the Group has been working on the Short Sea and Road European Tender to select the best suppliers and transport modes for the flows from Brand Companies to Market Companies, with contracts spanning FY25 and FY26. It was a collaborative effort involving multiple key players: Logistic and Customer Service Teams, Global Legal Team, Sustainability Team, Global Supply Chain  Team  and  Global  Procurement  Team.  Significant  GHG  emissions  reductions  have  been  achieved  by  selecting  more sustainable modes of transport (biofuel trucks or intermodal rail).\n\nPernod Ricard has joined the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA), a non-profit buyer's group within the maritime sector which aims to accelerate commercial zero-emission shipping, enable economies of scale, and help cargo owners maximize emissions reduction. This initiative will take effect from FY26.\n\nMartell  Mumm  Perrier  Jou\u00ebt  is  a  partner  of TransOceanic  Wind  Transport  (TOWT) ,  a  company  implementing  innovative logistics  solutions  for  low-carbon  transport  by  sail  since  2011.  The  construction  of  the  TOWT  vessel,  Anemos,  is  progressing  in Concarneau, with the first shipments of Martell cognac, Mumm and Perrier-Jou\u00ebt champagnes to the US scheduled from August 2024.\n\n## 3.4.2 Preserving nature & biodiversity\n\nAll  Pernod  Ricard  products  take  their  character  from  the  land where they were grown. The Group is committed to nurturing every terroir and its biodiversity, in a manner meeting the challenges of climate  change,  to  secure  quality  ingredients  now  and  for generations  to  come.  As  such,  the  Group  works  hand  in  hand with farmers, suppliers, and communities (see subsection 3.5.2.2 'Supporting  farmer  communities')  to  develop  sustainable  and regenerative agriculture practices in its terroirs, including its own vineyards. These practices aim to:\n\n- \u00b7 protect  ecosystems,  enhance  biodiversity  and  natural  capital (wild or cultivated) by preserving habitats and trophic chains;\n- \u00b7 reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  explore  potential carbon  sinks  within  Pernod  Ricard  agricultural  chains,  which also involves adapting crops and agricultural practices.\n\nThis subsection covers the following topics relating to Pernod Ricard's endeavours in this area:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's agricultural footprint;\n- \u00b7 mapping the Group's terroirs;\n- \u00b7 sustainable sourcing & certification;\n- \u00b7 regenerative agriculture & biodiversity programmes.\n\n## Scope 3 - Logistics & transport\n\nPernod Ricard seeks to optimise land transport by:\n\n- \u00b7 improving vehicle loading;\n- \u00b7 adjusting schedules;\n- \u00b7 using multi-modal options whenever possible (train, barge, etc.);\n- \u00b7 using  alternative  biofuels  for  truck  transportation  and  more efficient vehicles.\n\nPernod  Ricard  uses  the  EcoTransIT  World  software  solution  to accurately  calculate  its  logistics  CO 2 emissions,  using  a  datamodelled methodology. This allows the Group to achieve quality routing accuracy, and a clearer picture of its logistics providers' transport  performance.  Adopting  reliable  carbon  emission tracking  is  key  for  decision-making  processes  in  order  to  select the best transport mode, route, carrier, and/or port for each leg of a shipment's journey.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  disruptions  to  one  component  (e.g.,  soil,  water, climate,  landscape)  directly  impacts  the  others,  Pernod  Ricard pays  close  attention  to  ecosystems'  constitutive  parts  to  better understand the mechanisms at work and restore natural balances.\n\nIt is in this spirit that the Group intends to gradually move away from conventional models to reduce pressure on resources and promote  regenerative  agricultural  models  to  generate  positive outcomes.\n\n## PERNOD RICARD & REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE\n\nRegenerative agriculture is a holistic system that aims to maximise positive impacts on climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity as well  as  on  the  well-being  of  agricultural  communities.  It  involves  combining  agroecological  practices  at  the  field,  farm,  and landscape level to improve the health and natural fertility of the soil, restore ecosystems, and improve water retention capacity and  water  stress  resistance.  In  the  long  term,  this  model  also  aims  to  reduce  GHG  emissions,  increase  carbon  storage  and improve resilience.\n\nA defining feature of regenerative agriculture is that it is people-centric: it aims to provide health and a balanced life for farming communities  as  well  as  long-term  economic  viability.  In  turn,  this  improves  the  overall  resilience  of  the  terroir,  and  secures ingredient yields and quality of ingredients.\n\nIn practical terms, this translates to a range of farming practices, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 regular crop rotation;\n- \u00b7 planting cover crops to protect soils;\n- \u00b7 managing water sustainably;\n- \u00b7 minimising chemical fertiliser usage;\n- \u00b7 diversifying landscapes and crops;\n- \u00b7 minimising soil disturbance;\n- \u00b7 fostering equitable relationships.\n\nFor Pernod Ricard, regenerative agriculture and nature regeneration are a joint solution at terroir level to address major areas of impact, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity, water balance, and community inclusivity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each supply chain is unique, possessing its own distinct characteristics. Recognizing this, Pernod Ricard adopts a bottom-up approach to regenerative agriculture,  meticulously  designing  projects  that  consider  local circumstances.\n\nTo  ensure  initiatives  are  effective  and  contextually  appropriate, collaboration  with  leading  local  organizations  in  each  terroir  is necessary. For instance, in France, Pernod Ricard has joined the PADV (Pour une Agriculture Du Vivant) movement. Using PADV's regeneration index, the Group assessed the initial conditions of\n\nthe  partner  farms  and  implemented  strategies  to  enhance  the resilience  of  these  terroirs.  In  Mexico,  the  partnership  with  the Centro Mario Molina focuses on conducting a baseline assessment of the local  footprint  and  developing  an  innovative regenerative agriculture project for Blue Agave production.\n\nIn FY24, Pernod Ricard implemented 29 regenerative agriculture and biodiversity programmes across various regions. Additionally, in all of the Group vineyards (eight in total), sustainable farming practices are pioneered, from agroforestry to the introduction of pollinator gardens, and from the use of different mixes of cover crops to sheep grazing.\n\n## PERNOD RICARD BRAND & AFFILIATES REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE PROGRAMMES\n\n## Martell cognac and Mumm and Perrier-Jou\u00ebt champagne\n\nFollowing a comprehensive diagnosis of the two French terroirs, Martell Cognac and Mumm and Perrier-Joue\u0308t Champagnes set up a pilot programme to explore three main areas: soil life, plant health and nutrition, and landscape management. Working with expert  agroecologists,  the  programme  involves  training  the  Group's  own  winegrowers  as  well  as  its  partners  on  better understanding the complexity of natural ecosystems and how they can transition to more sustainable practices.\n\n## Irish distillers\n\nPernod Ricard Irish  Distillers  &  Heineken  Ireland  have  just  launched  a  three-year  collaboration  project  to  support  15  malting barley farmers adopt regenerative agricultural practices on their farms. Emphasis on knowledge-sharing and involvement of key players including malting company Boortmalt and global non-profit Earthworm Foundation.\n\n## Pernod Ricard North America\n\nPernod  Ricard  North  America  collaborates  with  their  main  grain  suppliers  to  embed  more  sustainable  and  regenerative agricultural practices tailored to their farms' unique needs and terroir. One such approach is cover-cropping, which introduces specific  plants  into  farmers'  seasonal  agricultural  field  rotation.  Real  improvements  in  soil  health,  carbon  sequestration  and nitrogen fixation have been recorded.\n\n## Next steps & future commitments\n\nThrough its pilot projects, the Group aims to identify the most suitable set of practices for each local context. Once the most appropriate solutions are identified, the consequent step is to scale up regenerative agriculture. To achieve this, dialogue and collaboration with other relevant off-takers within the same supply chain is essential to ensure the necessary support for producers and their successful transition to sustainable farming practices.\n\n## 3.4.3 Using resources responsibly\n\nThe world's finite resources are under massive pressure and the traditional linear production model has reached its limits. Circularity is one of Pernod Ricard's key priorities, with the Group especially focusing on:\n\n- \u00b7 preserving and restoring water resources used for the Group's operations;\n- \u00b7 designing circular packaging and fostering circular distribution models;\n- \u00b7 minimising & recovering the Group's production waste.\n\nSuch a shift will see fewer resources consumed, less waste generated, and ultimately reduce Pernod Ricard's environmental impact and carbon emissions.",

From irrigating crops to processing raw materials, distilling, blending eaux-de-vie and formulating products, water is involved at every stage of a product's life cycle.\n\nThe Group thus faces several challenges. It must:\n\n- \u00b7 reduce water consumption in its operations;\n- \u00b7 support replenishment in water-stressed basins where production sites and co-packers operate;\n- \u00b7 preserve water quality by monitoring pollutants released by production sites;\n- \u00b7 fully comply with evolving environmental regulations.\n\n## PERNOD RICARD PARTNERSHIPS FOR WATER CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT\n\nPernod  Ricard  has  been  a  member  of  the UN  CEO  Water  Mandate since  September  2010,  reaffirming  its  commitment  to protecting water resources. This year, as part of the UN 2023 Water Conference, Pernod Ricard contributed with UNITAR and industry peers to the launch of the ' Water Academy ',  which is focused on delivering innovative training and building human capacities on pressing water-related issues at a large scale.\n\nIn  India,  Pernod  Ricard  India  Foundation's  flagship  programme WAL  (Water,  Agriculture,  Livelihoods) aims  to  foster  water resilience,  promote  sustainable  and  regenerative  resource  management,  while  securing  the  livelihoods  of  disadvantaged communities such as smallholder farmers, women and young people.\n\nThe River Within is  a  new long-term program between Chivas Brothers, the River Trusts and the Spey Catchment Initiative to help  protect  and  restore  some  of  Scotland's  iconic  waterways.  Projects  will  focus  on  direct  activity  along  riverbanks  and waterways designed to help increase biodiversity and overall health of the river ecosystem. This in turn will help limit the rise of water temperatures, preserve floodplain resilience and increase river security.\n\nRegarding the agricultural supply chain, the drip irrigation technique is used in all irrigated vineyards operated by the Group. This reduces the water used to what is strictly necessary. Moreover, given the predominance  of  agricultural  raw  materials  in  Pernod  Ricard's water footprint, the Group works locally with the affiliates' suppliers to establish sustainable agriculture standards that minimise water consumption  (see  subsections  3.4.2.4  Regenerative  agriculture &  biodiversity  programmes  and  3.4.3.1.2  Water  resources preservation strategy).\n\n## 3.4.3.1.1 Water use in operations & wastewater\n\n## Water use in vineyards\n\nPernod  Ricard  sources  grapes  from  17  wine-growing  countries, seven of which have vineyards directly operated by the Group.\n\nAs  perennial  crops,  vineyards  are  particularly  sensitive  to  the effects of climate change and in particular droughts, fires or even frost. The trend towards the increasing frequency and severity of such events has been confirmed over the past three years in the Group's vineyards. In FY24, the water consumption of the Group own  vineyards  amounted  to  10.5  million  m 3 ;  this  represents  a slight increase compared to the FY23 values, but is in line with the\n\nglobal downward trend already observed in the past years. The improvement of the resilience of vines to water scarcity stays at the heart of the strategy implemented in the pilot programmes on regenerative viticulture across the vineyards.\n\n## Overview of the Group's water use in operations\n\nTo  reduce  direct  water  consumption  at  production  sites,  the Group focuses its efforts on two main drivers:\n\n- \u00b7 improving systems to measure and monitor water use;\n- \u00b7 implementing solutions to save, reuse and recycle water.\n\nThe Group's Long-Term Incentives Plan (LTIP) includes CSR criteria, one  of  them  being  linked  to  the  implementation  of  the  water roadmap ( i.e. ,  a  20.9% reduction in water consumption intensity in distilleries by 2030 compared to FY18). In FY24, there is a decrease of water intensity in distilleries (-10% compared to FY23), mainly driven  by  the  implementation  of  water  saving  projects  at  the Midleton distillery (construction of a rainwater harvesting system and  recycling  of  treated  waste  water),  the  Glenlivet  distillery (installation  of  a  closed  loop  cooling  water  system)  and  the Nashik distillery (reuse of effluent treatment plant water).\n\n<!-- image -->",

They were not included in FY22 data.\n\nThe  environmental  impact  of  the  Group's  activities  begins  with product,  packaging  &  point  of  sale  (POS)  material  design  and continues  throughout  the  life  cycle.  The  packaging  and  POS material development phases represent a key means of minimising end  of  life  waste  and  reducing  the  Group's  environmental footprint.  For  this  reason,  Pernod  Ricard  adopts  circular  design principles when designing new packaging and POS materials.\n\nGlass  and  cardboard  are  the  main  materials  used  (more  than 95% of total weight). Plastic packaging accounts for less than 1% of  primary  packaging  and  Pernod  Ricard  strives  to  limit  the quantities used, as illustrated by the Group's commitments to the New Plastics Economy vision of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, of which the Group is a signatory and partner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.4.3.2.2 Programmes & partnerships to collect packaging for recycling\n\n## and reuse\n\nPernod Ricard aims to play a key role in defining industry standards for the circularity of packaging. Pernod Ricard also participates in local  packaging  collection  and  recycling  schemes  to  address packaging  end-of-life.  The  internal  sustainable  packaging  and POS  guidelines  underpin  the  Group's  ambition  and  design-forrecycling guidelines for packaging and POS materials. While the Group  is  pushing  for  the  respect  of  the  guidelines  through regular training of packaging team and central expertise support to  affiliates,  the  Group  is  looking  for  a  system  to  measure applicability  at  scale.  The  Sustainable  Packaging  guidelines  are based on the five eco-design principles described below.",

The  key  issue  is therefore to improve waste sorting solutions for consumers so that packaging can be recycled or reused. Pernod Ricard has set up or joined various programmes worldwide to improve recycling:\n\n- \u00b7 Europe: Group contribution of around \u20ac12 million to national schemes designed to improve the collection and recycling of domestic packaging, including glass;\n- \u00b7 United  States: it  joined  the  'Glass  Recycling  Coalition'  to  foster  efficient  and  economically  viable  recycling  channels  by involving all players in the chain (glass manufacturers, bottlers, recycling service providers, etc.);\n- \u00b7 Brazil: it joined the 'Glass is Good' project, designed to increase the glass recycling rate by involving all industry players.\n\nProjects  are  currently  being  explored  with  local  partners  in  nine  key  markets  (India,  US,  Canada,  China,  France,  Brazil,  Spain, South Africa and Poland) to increase glass collection and recycling.\n\nIn FY23, Pernod Ricard's venture capital fund, Convivialit\u00e9 Ventures has taken a minority share in ecoSPIRITS, a circular economy technology startup focusing on low carbon, low waste distribution systems for the premium wine and spirits industry, after the launch of two pilots in 2022 in Asia (Hong Kong and Singapore) with Absolut vodka, Beefeater gin and Havana Club rum. In FY24, the Group has taken an other step towards circularity with the successful launch of an ecoSPIRITS pilot for Havana Club in Cuba, allowing  to  reduce  by  88%  the  carbon  emissions  and  99%  glass  waste  of  the  brand.  Moreover,  Pernod  Ricard  reaffirmed  its engagement  to  leverage  innovation  and  enhance  circularity  at  scale,  by  signing  a  five-year  global  licensing  agreement  with ecoSPIRITS, to promote circularity in the spirits industry by replacing 75cl bottles with 4.5l containers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Group's  policy  is  focused  on  limiting  food  waste  and eliminating  landfill  waste,  ensuring  all  waste  generated  on industrial sites is recycled.\n\nThe  Group  takes  steps  to  minimise  food  waste  throughout  its value chain:\n\n- \u00b7 in upstream agriculture, this involves reusing by-products from food production to produce alcohol e.g. broken rice in India or sugarcane molasses in Cuba;\n- \u00b7 in  developed  countries,  where  the  Group  sources  most  of  its agricultural raw materials, the quality of infrastructure and short supply routes prevent products such as cereals from perishing;\n- \u00b7 at  production  sites,  the  majority  of  waste  generated  by  the transformation of raw agricultural materials ( e.g. spent grains, vinasse  and  grape  pomace)  is  reused  to  make  animal  feed, biogas, farm compost, or for other industrial purposes;\n- \u00b7 at the consumer level, waste generation is very low as wine & spirits have a long shelf life and Group packaging is designed to last until the product is fully consumed.\n\nProduction sites mostly generate non-hazardous waste (hazardous waste  represent  1%  of  total  waste  generated).  Non-hazardous waste include:\n\n- \u00b7 waste  from  the  transformation  of  agricultural  raw  materials not recovered as by-products (grape marc, stalks, lees, etc.);\n- \u00b7 waste produced by the site's activities (sludge from treatment plants, office waste, green waste, etc.).\n\nHazardous  waste  includes  products  used  for  site  operations (chemical  product  containers,  used  oils,  solvents,  electrical  and electronic waste, neon tubes, batteries, etc.).\n\nTo achieve Pernod Ricard's overall waste reduction goals, affiliates are  pursuing efforts  to  reduce  the  quantity  of  waste  generated and to identify recycling and energy recovery processes. The Group will  continue to identify appropriate treatment processes locally for  hazardous  waste  requiring  the  use  of  a  specific  treatment process to prevent environmental risks.\n\nThis  year,  the  quantity  of  non-hazardous  waste  sent  to  landfill has increased by 60 tonnes, reaching 192 tonnes. This increase is mainly  due  to  punctual  generation  of  non-recycled  waste. Hazardous  waste  landfilled  amounts  to  28  tonnes,  bringing  the total  amount of waste generated by production activities sent to landfill  to  192  tonnes.  Overall,  80  industrial  sites  out  of  94  have achieved zero waste to landfill, and 93% of total waste is recycled. It remains a significant reduction from the 10,253 tonnes in FY10, and  the  result  of  the  Group's  zero-waste-to-landfill  policy implemented across all production sites.\n\n- \u00b7 packaging waste (glass, paper, cardboard and plastics);\n\n|                                       | Unit   | FY23      | FY24      |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE                   |        |           |           |\n| Total non-hazardous waste recycled    | t      | 32,974    | 30,834    |\n| Total non-hazardous waste incinerated | t      | 2,201     | 1,657     |\n| Total non-hazardous waste landfilled  | t      | 119       | 163       |\n| TOTAL QUANTITY OF NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE | t      | 35,293    | 32,654    |\n| HAZARDOUS WASTE                       |        |           |           |\n| Total hazardous waste recycled        | t      | 320       | 115       |\n| Total hazardous waste incinerated     | t      | 57        | 50        |\n| Total hazardous waste landfilled      | t      | 13        | 28        |\n| Total hazardous with other treatment  | t      | 79        | 318       |\n| TOTAL QUANTITY OF HAZARDOUS WASTE     | t      | 469       | 512       |\n| TOTAL WASTE (1)                       |        |           |           |\n| Total waste landfilled                | t      | 132       | 192       |\n| % of waste recycled                   | %      | 93 %      | 93 %      |\n| TOTAL WASTE                           | t      | 35,762    | 33,166    |\n| ORGANIC BY-PRODUCTS (2)               |        |           |           |\n| TOTAL QUANTITY OF ORGANIC BY-PRODUCTS | t      | 1,209,259 | 1,062,139 |\n\n- (1) Excluding waste generated in the construction and demolition activities.\n- (2) Organic by-products are secondary or incidental products deriving from the manufacturing process which can be sold or used for the production of other products, or transformed into biogas.

Based on the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems criteria, these EMS are the cornerstone of the Group's strategy and help with:\n\n- \u00b7 tackling long-term environmental risks;\n- \u00b7 reducing Pernod Ricard's environmental impact; and\n- \u00b7 seizing opportunities at every level.\n\nThese EMS are designed to disseminate the Group's environmental standards  throughout  the  business  and  embed  environmental considerations  into  its  management  practices,  which  in  turn helps manage risks and create a more circular business.\n\nPernod Ricard EMS operate along the following principles:\n\n- (i) the Headquarters' Operations Division oversees and coordinates measures at Group level by:\n- a. setting shared goals,\n- b. monitoring performance,\n- c. circulating guidelines with minimum requirements,\n- d. sharing best practices.\n\nEach Brand Company is required to evaluate its performance against  these  requirements  annually.  Where  necessary, compliance action plans must be implemented;\n\n- (ii) Pernod Ricard's activities, both for the Brand Companies and the Market Companies, must comply with the environmental requirements outlined in the Group's environmental guidelines:\n- a. affiliates  are  accountable  for  complying  with  local  legal requirements. They must also report any local incidents or non-compliance to Headquarters,\n\n|                                                           | FY23    | FY24   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| % of production sites certified ISO 14001                 | 86% (1) | 84%    |\n| Number of environmental incidents reported to authorities | 16      | 3      |\n\n- b. affiliates  are  accountable  for  assessing  their  long-term risks. They must thus identify ways of reducing their own environmental impact and apply the Group's policy locally;\n- (iii) major production sites are required to be ISO 14001 certified. In  FY24,  84%  of  production  sites  were  ISO  14001  certified (covering 99.4% of production);\n- (iv) Group  employees  and  administrative  sites  are  required  to follow the 'S&R Office' guidelines regarding different topics such as green offices, governance, energy, water, waste and business travel.\n\nIn  FY24,  3  environmental  incidents  were  reported  to  local authorities. Incidents include all possible potential impacts from an industrial site. This year, two incidents were related to spillage or leakage events, either of alcohol or waste water affecting soils or water. The other reported incident was related to a start of fire near a bottling line. A root cause analysis was conducted for all these events and corrective action plans drawn up. Operational procedures are in place to prevent and control various forms of incidents, and limit their impact on the environment.\n\nAs  of  FY25  the  Group  will  implement  a  new  system  for  the tracking  of  such  incidents,  ensuring  real-time  traceability  of actions and mitigation measures across the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moreover, as  a  consumer-oriented  company,  the  Group  believes  that  its employees  must  reflect  the  world  in  which  it  operates  and  the diversity of its consumer base. As such, Pernod Ricard is committed to a strong Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) agenda, and to creating an environment  where  its  teams  feel  valued,  heard,  and  safe  in order to thrive.\n\nTo  continue  accelerating  the  D&I  journey,  the  Group  created  a dedicated  Global  D&I  Director  role  (CDO  equivalent)  at  the beginning  of  FY24  and  renewed  its  Global  D&I  council  through the  year,  composed  of  12  senior  leaders  from  the  organization representing the diversity of the global presence in Management Entities,  Brand  companies  and  the  HQ,  with  the  sponsorship  of two Executive  Committee members (EVP Integrated Operations &  S&R  and  EVP  Finance  &  IT).  This  diverse  group  representing different  affiliates  comprises  global  top  senior  executives  with the  objective  of  accelerating  the  Group's  global  D&I  journey while acting as global ambassadors of this commitment.\n\nWhile continuing to accelerate Diversity - with a special continued focus  on  Gender  balance  in  senior  leadership  positions,  FY24 marked  a  new  impulse  with  a  revised  governance,  vision  and priorities  placing  an  emphasis  on  inclusion,  at  the  heart  of conviviality  and  fully  linked  to  the  expected  behaviours  of  the revamped values.\n\nThe Group sees D&I as a real business catalyst for Social Sustainability now  and  in  the  future,  making  an  impact  not  only  on  the employees but also on the suppliers, consumers and communities with  the  brands.  Pernod  Ricard's  Global  Diversity  &  Inclusion Framework  allows  Market  and  Brand  Companies  to  share  a common D&I ambition and global objectives, while empowering all affiliates and respecting local specificities and business needs in  their  respective  markets.  This  framework  is  comprehensive, driving  D&I  directly  in  the  Group's  ways  of  working,  complete with  detailed  KPIs  to  provide  direction  with  regards  to  its  four global  priorities  -  equitable  talent  processes,  convivial  culture, innovation & growth and enhanced reputation - translated into improved  business  performance.  This  complements  the  work already  achieved  by  management  in  local  affiliates  to  establish their own D&I agendas and plans.\n\nFIGURE 15 - PERNOD RICARD D&I FRAMEWORK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs  measuring  progress  and  employee  experience  are  key  to progressing  the  D&I  journey,  Pernod  Ricard  also  added  an Inclusion Index to 'I Say', the Group's annual employee feedback survey  (see  subsection  3.5.1.2.5  Employee  engagement).  The question 'I feel a sense of belonging at my affiliate' scored 75 in I Say 2023 (+2 vs. Glint's Global External Benchmark).\n\nFurthermore,  after  having  conducted  a  D&I  maturity  model assessment in FY23, Pernod Ricard globally launched a voluntary inclusion  self-assessment  for  all  employees  at  the  end  of March 2024, with a double objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 First, to get a real measure of the level of inclusion at Pernod Ricard,  calculated  in  aggregate  data  by  the  employee's answers  when  being  confronted  to  D&I  related  situations  in\n\norder to identify  stereotypes  and  unconscious  bias  regarding micro aggressions, working relationships, and behaviours in a manager position. Almost 3,000 employees benefited from the self diagnosis and at Group level, nearly 70% were shown to be inclusive in their working relationships.\n\n- \u00b7 Secondly,  to  give  an  opportunity  to  the  employees  to  selfidentify  on  a  voluntary  basis,  to  help  Pernod  Ricard  better measure  the  percentage  of  workers  who  feel  diverse  in  the organization.  25%  of  Pernod  Ricard's  employees  self-identify their diversity and feel part of a minority group.\n\nThis  knowledge  will  help  the  Group  and  affiliates  go  further  to ensure everyone feels included in the organization.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, in terms of gender pay equity ,  the Group has conducted a global initiative involving an annual audit of  over  70 countries since FY19. This initiative aims to identify the behavioural  drivers  and  roots  causes  of  gender  pay  gaps  to ensure pay equity across the Group through a long-term systematic compensation  review.  Following  the  results  of  these  audits,  all Group  affiliates  have  been  implementing  gender  pay  equity initiatives over the years. The strategy has consisted of adjusting the  lowest  salaries  (negative  outliers)  to  achieve  a  reduction  in pay gap globally. Beyond merely adjusting remuneration, affiliates have  also  included  other  actions  in  their Gender  Pay  Equity strategy , including in terms of hiring policies, promotion & retention strategies,  employee  assessment  and  development,  pay  for performance linkage, review of any bias in their talent management and  performance  management  process.  Thanks  to  this  set  of initiatives, the results have demonstrated significant improvement at Group level over the past few years.\n\nIn FY24 :\n\n- \u00b7 raw gender pay gap is -2%, thus in favour of women;\n- \u00b7 both  adjusted  and  raw  pay  gaps  were  maintained  within  a -2 / +2 range;\n- \u00b7 the adjusted pay gap significantly decreased in countries with high headcount;\n- \u00b7 strong  reduction  of  the  gap  in  countries  where  it  was significantly in favour of women. This had a negative impact on the Group's results but is consistent with its global objective.\n\nFurthermore, the 'TransfoHRm' HR Strategy announced in 2018 is inherently a diverse-centric strategy ensuring that key processes such as talent development and management are fair, objective, consistent and equitable. From TransfoHRm, Let's Talk Talent was born as a consistent global performance and talent management process based on an objective assessment of performance and potential, with a common language and methodology across all affiliates.  As  part  of  this  programme,  Managers  and  HR  are supported and trained in performance evaluation and calibration to ensure common understanding, objectivity, and consistency in the  way  that  it  is  applied  across  the  business.  These  global processes  are  designed  to  overcome  the  traditional  pitfalls  of talent management practices, and ensure diversity and inclusion continues  to  be  promoted  throughout  the  Group  while  also making sure all employees benefit from equal opportunities for a successful and fulfilling career at Pernod Ricard.\n\nFrom  a generational  diversity perspective,  the  Group  is  also committed  to  attracting  and  hiring  young  talents  on  various development  contracts  ( i.e. ,  apprenticeships,  training,  etc.).  The Group also recruits and develops young graduates through VIE (international  volunteers  in  industry)  and  international  young graduate  programmes,  such  as  the  Jameson  International Graduate Programme.\n\nPernod Ricard sponsors the Youth Action Council (YAC) (19) with the objective to create a direct link between the next generation of employees and consumers and the Group's Top Management to bring shared value to Pernod Ricard.\n\nIn keeping with these commitments, Pernod Ricard's D&I strategy also directly connects with talent management and development . It  is  firmly  embedded in the annual global strategic talent review process and succession planning. It is a strategic business priority for senior management, and it is also a key enabler to growing a diverse  global  talent  pipeline.  These  talent  processes  focus  on assessing,  identifying  and  preparing  the  future  leaders  in  the business with a D&I angle in mind.",

The totality of Pernod Ricard UK leadership team has benefited from this program.\n\nIrish  Distillers,  Pernod  Ricard  Brazil  and  Pernod  Ricard  Headquarters have  hosted  several  conferences  this  year  to  raise awareness and continue to educate employees on inclusion. Examples of some of the themes presented this year: Unconscious biases, The Art of being yourself at work, How we can all become more Inclusive to all.\n\nPernod Ricard India has been working on enhancing representation of women across the workforce. In their Sales team, they have built one-to-one connections and ensured a safe and inclusive work environment for women.\n\nPernod  Ricard  France reinforced  its  support  for  people  in  vulnerable  situations  by  joining  the  steering  committee  of  FACE (Foundation pour l'inclusion), alongside six other companies.\n\n(1) DEI: Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Pernod  Ricard  continues  to  progress  on  gender  balance, increasing the number of women in senior leadership positions by 2 points compared to last year.\n\nA  key  explanation  for  this  is  the  Pernod  Ricard  Strategic  Talent Review  process  focused  on  planning  and  preparing  a  more diverse  talent  pipeline  for  specific  leadership  roles  or  functions currently identified as not balanced enough.\n\nThe  Group  continues  developing  and  supporting  women  talent across several initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 leadership programs & Talent assessment;\n- \u00b7 mentoring;\n- \u00b7 EVE inter-enterprise seminar: launched in Europe in FY24 and in FY25, with Talent from Asia too;\n- \u00b7 the creation of a Global Women ERG called 'Women in Tech' that supports STEM women and builds allyship.\n\nPernod Ricard continues to work on gender diversity and parity across  the  Company,  designing  and  implementing  internal programmes  and  processes  to  accelerate  the  development  of diverse talents globally (see subsections 3.5.1.2.2 Talent management and 3.5.1.2.3 Training our employees).\n\n## Evolution of women representation among Pernod Ricard's Top Management (target 40-60% by 2030)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.5.1.1.2 Hiring & employability of workers with disabilities\n\nPernod  Ricard's  commitment  to  a  welcoming  and  inclusive environment  entails  striving  to  ensure  its  workplace  culture, environment and ways of working are as adapted as can be to the  needs  of  each  employee.  Where  workers  with  disability  are concerned,  affiliates'  compliance  with  local  laws  is  the  starting point,  not  the  end  goal  of  the  policy.  A  number  of  initiatives across  the  Group  are  helping  to  make  work  environments friendlier to workers with disabilities, including:\n\n- \u00b7 adapting premises and investing in appropriate equipment;\n- \u00b7 providing training;\n- \u00b7 raising employee awareness;\n- \u00b7 conducting joint projects with specialised establishments;\n- \u00b7 participating in dedicated forums; and\n- \u00b7 recruiting workers with disabilities.\n\nIn  line  with  local  needs  and  requirements,  affiliates  also  put  in place relevant initiatives for accessibility. For example, in the UK, employers are obliged within reason to make sure that disabled workers  have  the  same  access  to  everything  involved  in  doing and keeping their job as non-disabled workers. In FY24, Pernod Ricard  sent  affiliates  a  global  survey  to  gather  information  on detailed  local  regulations  on  Disability  aiming  to  accelerate  the collective  efforts  for  employability  of  workers  with  disabilities. Thanks to this first step in FY24, the Group will go a step further in FY25 and will implement a Global Disability plan.\n\nIn  France,  the  share  of  employees  with  a  declared  disability reached  3.5%  in  2022  and  remained  around  3.4%  in  2023, including Martell Mumm Perrier Jouet at 4.8%.\n\n## GROUP PARTNERSHIPS FAVOURING EMPLOYABILITY OF WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES\n\nAffiliates of Pernod Ricard have established robust local partnerships to enhance the employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities.\n\n- \u00b7 Irish Distillers has collaborated with Together Academy and Ability @Work, resulting in the meaningful employment of young individuals as Brand Ambassadors.\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard in  France seeks to facilitate access to its job opportunities for workers with disabilities by advertising careers and open positions on the website of the Agefiph public organisation dedicated to developing inclusivity. Also, Pernod Ricard Talent Acquisition French Team welcomed disabled student supported by the organisation ARPEJEH for a workshop aiming to give them advice for successful interviews. Since two years, the Group Legal teams and Havana Club participates to the Step up program to welcome every year interns during one month internship.\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard Spain continued its plan to welcome more people with disability by searching new specific recruitment sources and  continued  to  evolve  the  accessibility  of  its  offices  and  awareness  session  for  internal  employees  and  promotion  of volunteering in order to make disability more visible.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As part of its  anti-discrimination  efforts,  the  company  has  undertaken  an initiative  to  measure  unconscious  bias,  microaggressions,  and workplace relations in both quantitative and qualitative terms.\n\nIn  FY24,  Pernod  Ricard  launched  Horizons,  a  significant  and transformative  initiative  combining  further  transparency,  equity and visibility on careers and development opportunities, and help reduce  any  potential  bias  in  internal  recruitment  and  career management  and  development.  The  initiative  seeks  also  to ensure more equitable talent development processes and equal opportunities.  Employees  participating  in  this  year's  pilot  were given access to a new Talent Marketplace. This platform, powered\n\nby  AI,  matches  skills  with  open  positions  and  development opportunities, suggesting career and development paths. This favours equitable opportunities for growth, based on an employee's skills.\n\nIn  addition,  Pernod  Ricard  is  conscious  that  discrimination  can start by non-intentional micro aggressions in the workplace, and a such creating awareness and training are critical. Therefore, in addition,  in  March,  the  Group  launched  a  global  inclusion  selfassessment  designed  to  promote  inclusive  behaviours.  Almost 3,000 employees worldwide have participated in this assessment, equipping themselves with the tools to be true allies. Thanks to self-identification,  Pernod  Ricard  increased  its  awareness  on diversity to drive further actions on Inclusion.\n\n## SAMPLE ACTIONS FROM GROUP AFFILIATES AGAINST DISCRIMINATION\n\n- \u00b7 PR Winemakers launched the first Reconciliation Action Plan in Australia that outlines our commitment to building connections with  Aboriginal  and  Torres  Strait  Islander  Peoples,  deepening  our  cultural  understanding  and  establishing  partnership opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.\n- \u00b7 French  affiliates  of  Pernod  Ricard have  endorsed  the  'Stop  to  ordinary  sexism  in  the  workplace'  Engagement  Charter, committing  to  a  zero-tolerance  policy  and  actively  promoting  awareness.  French  employees  started  to  benefit  from  an insightful e-learning to understand what everyday sexism is, how it manifests and how to respond it. The goal was to equip individuals with the ability to recognize a sexist comment or action and to respond effectively, whether they are a victim or a witness.\n- \u00b7 At Pernod Ricard HQ ,  the  PR-ide  Network  for  the  inclusion  of  LGBTQIA+  colleagues  partnered  with  't\u00eatu.Connect'  to  raise awareness continuously throughout the year, and mostly recently on 'Being yourself at work'. The yearly Pride Party serves as an opportunity to engage with the lives of LGBTQIA+ colleagues, drawing on the knowledge and expertise of organizations such as SOS Homophobie and L'Autre Cercle.\n- \u00b7 Irish  Distillers :  As  part  of  the  Work  Life  Balance  &  Miscellaneous  Provisions  Act  2023  in  Ireland,  employees  are  allowed  to request up to 5 days of unpaid leave to care for family members with a serious medical condition. Irish Distillers went a step further by making it 5 days paid leave for Family Carers.\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard Spain recognized its talent with seniority by creating a Hall of fame displayed in all the offices and sites and employee's  video  to  make  visible  all  the  advantages  and  social  benefits  available  around  seniority  share  career  path,  in complement to a reverse mentoring ensuring knowledge sharing and inclusion of everyone.\n- \u00b7 Pernod  Ricard  South  Africa supports  disadvantaged  individuals  in  local  communities  to  access  new  opportunities  for education, employment and financial independence, changing the trajectory of their lives through opportunities which were previously denied to them. Among the initiatives: a university bursary program for almost 80 students across 4 universities, a disabled learnership for 5 years positively impacting almost 20 students living with disability this FY24 and a graduate intern program for the 4th year in a row supporting almost 30 students to provide equal opportunities to them.\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard Brazil continued its plan to increase the visibility of people with diverse ethnic backgrounds in the workforce, and committed to removing barriers for black employees through education by funding language courses for 20 interns only 5% of Brazil's population speaks English).\n\nAround the world, Pernod Ricard employees are organised in a wide  network  of  Employee  Resources  Groups  (ERGs),  where employee-led peer groups help foster a diverse, inclusive workplace. These  function  as  cultural  advocates,  allies,  ambassadors,  and partners  in  building  open  forums  to  share  experiences  and celebrate cultural movements across communities. Each Group has its own focus, such as (20) :\n\n- \u00b7 raising  awareness  on LGBTQIA+  causes and  supporting inclusion: PRISM (Pernod Ricard North America), PRIDE (Chile), Fluid (UK), PR-ide (France), True Colours (The Absolut Company), PRIDE (Pernod Ricard Winemakers);\n\n- \u00b7 supporting  the  integration  of international  communities : Expats in France (France), Se habla espagnol (France), PaRa Amigos (North America), First Nations (Pernod Ricard Winemakers);\n- \u00b7 supporting gender balance in the IT industry: Women in tech;\n- \u00b7 supporting women and allies : Libra (UK), Womxn (North America).\n\nAs  a  way  to  measure  relevant  D&I  indicators  and  employee engagement, the Group has various feedback tools implemented over  the  past  few  years:  I  Say  Employee  feedback  survey (capturing  Inclusion  Index),  global  Wellbeing  Pulse  Survey, Onboarding & Exit surveys, and the D&I Maturity Self- Assessment for all affiliates.",

        "page_content": "## 3.5.1.2 Supporting our employees to grow\n\nThe Group's strategy for talent attraction, development and retention relies  on  providing  good  working  conditions,  a  favourable remuneration policy and benefits, all while supporting people in developing  their  skills  and  building  successful  careers.  Talent management is and will remain a key strategic business priority for the Group. As such, the Pernod Ricard S&R roadmap includes key  commitments  to  ensure  long-term  employability  through comprehensive access to training and development opportunities.\n\n## 3.5.1.2.1 Compensation and benefits for employees\n\n## Compensation policy\n\nGroup  Senior  Management's  compensation  is  overseen  by  HQ, whereas each affiliate manages its policy locally while upholding a set of common rules. These include developing a performance culture  and  offering  compensation  that  is  competitive  locally, leveraging external benchmarking and compensation data. This also involves setting up straightforward, meaningful, and motivating compensation  packages.  Total  payroll  is  discussed  in  Note  3.5 Expenses  by  type in  Section  6  'Annual  consolidated  financial statements'. This year, payroll accounted for 14.3% of net sales.\n\n## Performance culture: employee profit-sharing policies\n\nPerformance  is  encouraged  through  favourable  profit-sharing and  incentive  policies.  A  gross  amount  of  \u20ac54  million  was  paid under such plans to over 7,890 employees, to which contributions (21) of  over  \u20ac8.9  million  were  added.  Moreover, share-based long-term incentive plans policy (such as allocating performance shares or restricted shares for example) were once again implemented in FY24 for over 500 employees worldwide.\n\nIn  2019,  the  Group  launched  its  first  ever  Employee  Share Ownership  Plan  called  'Accelerate'.  The  second  edition  of  the Plan was rolled out in 2022 in 24 markets (covering around 80% of Group employees and the initiative once again proved highly successful,  with  an  overall  sign-up  rate  of  45.7%).  In  2021,  the Group launched Pay for Performance directly linking reward and recognition to performance. This helps building a high-performance culture across the organisation, allowing managers to differentiate the  reward  and  recognition  received  by  their  teams  based  on their contribution and performance both on the 'What' and the 'How' of their deliverables.\n\n|                                                                     | FY23        | FY24        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Total gross amount paid under  profit - sharing and incentive plans | \u20ac50 million | \u20ac54 million |\n\n## Welfare protection and health insurance\n\nIn line with the Group's commitment, all employees are offered a welfare protection plan covering major risks (death and invalidity). Some choose not to be covered or are covered by their spouse's employer.\n\n| Number and %                                                                                                                                                   | FY23   | FY24   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Employees covered by a welfare  protection plan (death and invalidity)  with a benefit equivalent to at least  one year of the employee's fixed  annual salary | 93.4%  | 94.1%  |\n| Employees benefitting from  health insurance                                                                                                                   | 98.2%  | 97.9%  |\n\n## Promoting wellbeing & quality of life in the workplace\n\nThe  Group  is  committed  to  offering  employees  good  working conditions and as such it is engaged in upgrading and accommodating workspaces  wherever  possible.  The  Group  believes  its  office spaces  should  offer  an  opportunity  to  showcase  the  belief  that humans  need  to  come  together  in  person  to  create  convivial moments.  In  the  years  following  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  the value of this human connection is understood all the better. Also, following  an  internal  survey  in  FY24,  93%  of  Pernod  Ricard's affiliates have a flexible hours, policy.\n\nLike many of the Group's offices, Pernod Ricard's global flagship in Paris, The Island, embodies a 'conviviality by design' approach. It was designed to offer the best work environment by incorporating different  styles  of  workspaces  and  workstations,  and  giving employees the flexibility to choose. Employees also have access to  a  range  of  specialists,  activities,  fitness  equipment  and  other services, in line with the Group's broader commitment to health and wellbeing. The Island received HQE certifications ('Excellent') for  its  construction  and  exploitation  recognising  that  it  adheres to the highest environmental and employee wellbeing criteria.\n\n## 3.5.1.2.2 Talent management\n\nPernod Ricard's people development strategy is anchored in the Group's Leadership Attributes, which were rolled out across the organisation in 2020. Now, as part of the Group values evolution carried out this year, Pernod Ricard has just finished to evolve as well  the  leadership  model  (under  the  name  'The  Way  We Perform') which will be deployed early next fiscal year.\n\n## Leadership Attributes\n\nThe  Leadership  Attributes  represent  the  leadership  behaviours Pernod  Ricard  needs  to  ensure  its  current  and  future  success. They  are  embedded  in  its  global  Human  Resources  strategy through  various  HR  processes  such  as  leadership  assessment and development programmes, annual performance appraisals, 360  feedback  surveys,  coaching  and  mentoring.  All  these processes and programmes help Pernod Ricard's employees grow their  leadership  skills  and  be  better  prepared  to  master challenges and drive change to deliver its business goals.\n\n## TransfoHRm/Workday\n\nThe Group-wide HR strategy TransfoHRm is powered by a single Group-wide HR management system, the global digital platform Workday,  introduced  in  2018.  This  has  been  very  successful  in helping manage the key group HR processes in a consistent way across all the affiliates. Pernod Ricard has been able to quantify the return on investment:\n\n- \u00b7 having streamlined business processes;\n- \u00b7 established a common language;\n- \u00b7 created unified and reliable information worldwide;\n- \u00b7 better  decision  making,  leveraging  AI  as  part  of  the  new recently launched Talent Marketplace\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employees and their managers now have a robust and reliable tool to access information about their position, career path, compensation and performance & development information. Employees are fully empowered to be proactive with their career development. Through comprehensive roadmap planning and a strong partnership with IBM for end-user support  and  technical  upgrades,  Pernod  Ricard  kept  investing toward a software-powered transformation of Human Resources management.\n\nPernod Ricard is committed to introducing additional functionality to support the ongoing improvement of the employee experience. In  2024,  the  group  successfully  launched  'HR  buddy',  its  first conversational  chatbot  designed  to  answer  questions  from  all employees about the yearly performance, talent and performance campaign. Pernod Ricard will continue to investigate and deploy new  generative  AI  use-case  linked  with  HR  requirements,  to empower both its stakeholders and the internal customers.\n\nTo  enhance  end-user  adoption,  improve  efficiency,  and  gather bottom-up  feedback  from  all  over  the  Group,  Pernod  Ricard continued  the  Workday  Adoption  Programme  initiative,  a combination  of  best  practices  workshops,  user-centric  analyses through common Key Process Indicators, and detailed feedback sessions.  The  group  also  upgraded  its  Workday  training  offer with  the  new  '360  Workday  Essential'  program,  a  blended training program for HR employees, designed as a 'refresher' on core  business  processes  and  good  practices.  Leveraging  group assets and local champions following a train-the-trainer strategy to  ensure  maximum  impact,  this  program  was  successfully launched in two geographical zones (LATAM and UK) and shall be expanded in the coming fiscal year to new regions.\n\nAlthough  many  initiatives  focused  on  employee  and  end-users experience, the Group kept on investing in dedicated modules to support  the  business  and  streamline  the  needs  in  resources  to ensure sustainable performance. The Workday Adaptive Insight module  continued  its  expansion  during  the  whole  fiscal  year 2024,  which  allowed  Human  Resources  to  forecast,  plan  and manage  employee-related  costs  as  these  represent  the  largest overhead. Corresponding  information  has  spread  in  the organization, enabling closer business monitoring throughout all affiliates.  A  new  milestone  was  achieved  in  2024  as  data  from Adaptive  planning  is  now  available  and  displayed  directly  into Workday for top Executives, as part of the 'Cockpit' initiative.\n\nFollowing the objectives to support business and strategy through global solutions, the 'Cockpit initiative' aims at providing a simple yet  comprehensive  depository  for  people-related  performance\n\n## 3.5.1.2.3 Training our employees\n\n| Policy           | Commitment                                                                                                                              |   Target date | Objective   | FY23   | FY24   | Progress  status   |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| 2030 S&R roadmap | Develop employability throughout employees'  working lives: offer all employees at least one  training session during the FY            |          2030 | 100%        | 99%    | 99%    | On plan            |\n| 2030 S&R roadmap | Develop employability throughout employees'  working lives: offer all employees at least one  future-fit training session every 3 years |          2030 | 100%        | 21%    | 60%    | In progress        |\n\nindicators. The Cockpit centralizes data from various global data sources at Pernod Ricard and acts as a single stop shop host on the Workday platform. It leverages the various efforts performed over previous years to align and harmonize referentials, allowing top  executives  to  have  access  to  group-wide  data  on  both employees, positions, workforce planning, engagement rates and more to come in the future.\n\nThese ambitious initiatives will ensure that HR effectively embeds the new ways of working and proactively partners and supports managers & employees to co-create their unique experience at Pernod Ricard.\n\n## Let's Talk Talent\n\nLet's Talk Talent is a global talent management and development framework  shared  across  all  affiliates  thanks  to  a  common language to assess performance and potential. This assessment focuses not only on 'what' has been achieved, but also on 'how' achievements were obtained, in line with the Leadership Attributes. This enables Pernod Ricard to assess, provide feedback and develop teams,  identifying  the  skills,  competencies  and  behaviours  that are  needed  to  support  the  strategic  plans  whilst  fostering  a diverse,  high-performing  culture.  This  process,  along  with  the learning agility assessment of individual growth potential, forms the  basis  for  identifying  and  developing  talent  within  the Company for career development and succession planning.\n\nAs part of this Let's Talk Talent process, the Company fosters a culture of continuous feedback between supervisors and employees. Pernod Ricard offers employees opportunities and resources to grow and empowers them to take steps to advance their careers and to develop within the business.\n\n## Embedding a skills-based organization\n\nTo  support  Pernod  Ricard's  talent  management  ambition,  the Group introduced skills based development through a new Talent Marketplace powered by AI, launched this year. Building on the D&I  objectives  of  creating  equitable  and  fair  opportunities,  the Talent  Market  Place  creates  visibility  on  employee  skills  and matches customized development through mentorship, learning, gigs, career opportunities in a single platform.\n\nIn January 2024, the Talent Market Place was successfully piloted across HR, Finance and Legal functions reaching 2,200 employees. The global launch planned for the fall of 2024 will reach out all employees,  allowing  visibility  of  all  the  employees'  skills  and enabling to showcase development and career opportunities to all.",

The goals were to identify market best practices, integrate benchmarks for better assessment and development of talents, provide  clearer  assessment  and  development  reports  for  both business  and  employees,  explore  new  technologies,  and  seek scalable opportunities.\n\nThis framework targets talents from Band E to the ELT (Executive Leadership Team), aiming to assess and support the development of  current  and  future  generations  of  leaders  at  Pernod  Ricard. Through assessing against the Pernod Ricard leadership model, the  framework  seeks  to  provide  us  with  a  holistic  view  of  their skills,  leadership  potential,  strengths,  and  development  areas. The  assessment  outcomes  will  enable  the  Group  to  nurture high -potential  individuals  and  better  prepare  talents  for  future leadership roles.\n\nAs  a  result  of  the  RFP,  Pernod  Ricard  partnered  with  three external  global  providers  to  develop  a  range  of  leadership assessment and development programmes. The Group successfully piloted  these  new  programmes,  involving  158  employees,  with 50% of participants being women.\n\nTo  further  support  the  talents  in  their  leadership  development, the  Group  continued  its  'Mixers'  and  'Shakers'  leadership training programmes in partnership with INSEAD. In FY24, these programmes were updated to include Q&A sessions with Pernod Ricard  experts  on  the  topics  of  D&I,  S&R  and  Health  &  Safety. A total of 68 talents (of which 50% female) participated in these trainings, held at Pernod  Ricard  University's campus  in La Voisine, France.\n\n## 3.5.1.2.4 Social dialogue\n\nThe Group has a long tradition of social dialogue and promotes freedom  of  association  in  every  country  in  which  it  operates. In  addition,  it  firmly  believes  in  the  importance  of  providing  a working environment with optimal working conditions:\n\n## EU Works Council\n\nWith over 50% of its employees based in the EU, the Group has mainly focused its efforts on EU employee representatives. This council brings together one or more representatives from every affiliate  within  the  EU  with  over  45  people.  It  had  a  total  of 24 representatives in FY24.\n\nThe EU Works Council meets at least once a year. A Select Committee, elected  by  their  peers,  of  five  members  from  five  different countries, meets at least once a year. The Select Committee may act  on  its  own  initiative  in  response  to  any  social  measure  that might be taken within the EU involving at least two countries in which  Pernod  Ricard  has  local  teams.  To  share  information, content  is  co-written  by  delegates  and  the  HR  Department annually and published on the intranet.\n\nThe France Group Committee meets once a year. It brings together employee representatives appointed by the largest trade unions in the French affiliates. The purpose of this meeting is to review the  Group's  business  activities,  together  with  an  analysis  of employment trends and forecast changes for the year ahead.\n\nThe Group Committee and the EU Works Council are chaired by the Group Chairman & CEO, Alexandre Ricard, and moderated by the HR Department.\n\n## Signing of labour agreements\n\nAffiliates  signed  roughly  192  agreements  with  a  range  of  social partners  worldwide.  This  encourages  improved  social  dialogue.

It was reinvigorated in 2021 with I Say 2.0 , leveraging digital and data in partnership with Glint and moving to an annual global survey.\n\nIn FY24, the Group rolled out the eighth edition of I Say , its pulse, survey  empowering  managers  and  HR  to  leverage  advanced analytics  and  insights  to  better  understand  employees'  needs. Thanks to Glint's digital platform, it allows them to quickly access, analyse  the  results  and  roll  out  action  plans  to  address  the improvement  areas  identified. The results can then be benchmarked against Glint's data from external organisations.\n\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard's employees said they are happy to work at their affiliate  and  the  majority  of  the  Group's  employees  would recommend  Pernod  Ricard  as  a  great  place  to  work,  with  a score of 74.\n\nThese  sentiments  have  been  mirrored  externally  as  well,  as Pernod  Ricard  has  been  included  in  the  ranking  of  Forbes' World's Best Employers 2023 for a second year in a row.\n\nIn  FY24,  the  Group  also  launched  its  third  edition  of  the wellbeing pulse survey to gather more in-depth feedback from employees  on  issues  like  their  perception  of  their  work-life balance and how they managed stress.\n\nFollowing the pandemic, wellbeing and engagement continue to be important areas of focus for the Group.\n\n- \u00b7 I  say  remains  a  key  moment  in  the  employees  journey  at Pernod Ricard, this year again a very high rate of participation (86%)  which  once  again  highlight  the  strong  connection  of Pernod Ricard employees with the organization.\n\n|                                                                            | I Say 2023    | I Say 2023        | Wellbeing pulse survey   |   Wellbeing pulse survey |   Wellbeing pulse survey |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Scores                                                                     | Pernod Ricard | Global  Benchmark | Food&Bev  benchmark      |                     2023 |                     2024 |\n| Wellbeing [My affiliate takes a genuine interest  in employees' wellbeing] | 70            | 70                | 69                       |                       70 |                       69 |\n| Overall Engagement score                                                   | 74            | 74                | 75                       |                       74 |                       72 |\n| eSat [How happy are you working at your affiliate?]                        | 73            | 74                | 75                       |                       73 |                       72 |\n| Recommend [I would recommend my affiliate  as a great place to work]       | 74            | 74                | 74                       |                       74 |                       72 |\n\n| Number and %                   | FY23   | FY24          |\n|--------------------------------|--------|---------------|\n| Total departure rate* (1)      | 14.1%  | 15.1%         |\n| Number of departure - Male     | NEW    | 1,604 (14%)   |\n| Number of departure - Female   | NEW    | 1,250 (16.6%) |\n| Number of resignations*        | 1,618  | 1,473         |\n| Number of resignation - Male   | NEW    | 808 (7.1%)    |\n| Number of resignation - Female | NEW    | 665 (8.8%)    |\n| Voluntary departure rate* (2)  | 8.5%   | 7.8%          |\n| Absenteeism rate**             | 3.7%   | 3.9 %         |\n\n- (2) The rate of voluntary departure is calculated by dividing the number of resignations by the average workforce with permanent contracts.\n- * Permanent contracts.\n\nThe increase of the total departure rate is notably linked to the implementation of the organisation evolution announced by the Group on 30 August 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Pernod  Ricard's approach  to  Health  &  Safety  (H&S)  is  underpinned  by  the 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de Convivialit\u00e9' vision. Standards and processes are developed to manage employee and on-site contractor activities, from  risk  assessment  to  the  implementation  of  mitigation measures, including on-field assessments.\n\nAs  of  FY23,  a  comprehensive  H&S  approach  has  been  taken, covering  everything  from  physical  to  mental  health,  for  those working  in  an  industrial  environment  as  well  as  administrative (offices) and sales representatives.\n\n## 3.5.1.3.1 Building a safe environment\n\n| Policy            | Commitment                                                                                                                                  |   Target date | Objective                                |   FY23 |   FY24 | Progress  status   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| 2030 S&R  roadmap | Become 'best in class' in the Wines & Spirits  industry for Health & Safety: moving towards  zero accidents (employees and temporary staff) |          2025 | Moving towards zero  lost time accidents |     60 |     44 | On plan            |\n\n## Global H&S policy\n\nThe Group is committed to developing a culture in which everyone has a role to play and where employees take ownership by sharing responsibility for their own safety and that of their co-workers.\n\nThis vision was turned into a Global Health & Safety Policy called 'Taking  Care  of  Each  Other'  in  2019.  The  strategic  priorities  to achieve Pernod Ricard's goals are :\n\n- \u00b7 Culture :  to  develop  a  culture  where  safety  is  at  the  heart  of Convivialit\u00e9 ;\n\n- \u00b7 Leadership : to  develop  leadership  through  engagement, motivation and empowerment;\n- \u00b7 Performance : to  improve  business  performance  through excellence in Health & Safety.\n\nThis  policy  was  approved  by  Pernod  Ricard's  Chairman,  Chief Executive  Officer,  the  Executive  Committee  and  the  Board  of Directors. The EVP Integrated Operations and S&R oversees the implementation  of  the  Group's  Health  and  Safety  policy.  The management  of  the  local  affiliates  is  responsible  for  its implementation.",

        "page_content": "## H&S Culture\n\nDelivering  on  this  vision  requires  management  systems.  In  this regard,  the  Group's  industrial  sites  are  required  to  be  OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 certified. In addition, Pernod Ricard is committed to,  and  actively  fosters,  a  H&S  culture  in  which  everyone  is involved  in  taking  care  of  each  other.  To  drive  this  change, third -party audits on safety culture and standards compliance are being  rolled  out  across  the  major  production  sites.  Each  audit gives rise to an assessment of the site's maturity, and an action plan to move to the next level on the maturity scale.\n\nTo  address  high  risk  situations,  Pernod  Ricard  continuously defines new standards. In FY23, LIFE (Life threatening and Fatal Event) requirements have been developed, covering a wide range of activities (including work at height, chemicals, confined spaces, explosive  environments,  hazardous  gases,  fire  &  evacuation, equipment safety, forklifts, racks & pallets, truck loading/unloading, truck fleets, work permits, and hazardous energy). Specific risks related  to  sales  and  head  office  activities  are  being  tackled through LIFE requirements related to these functions (including responsible drinking, driving, ergonomics, risk assessment, safe events, contractors management, and emergency planning).\n\nAll affiliates have implemented prevention measures following a self-assessment  of  their  local  practices  both  on  industrial  and non-industrial  sites.  A  LIFE  assessment  programme  performed by  third  parties  is  currently  underway  both  on  industrial  and non -industrial  sites.  All  the  areas  of  improvement  identified  by the  third  party  are  addressed  through  a  detailed  action  plan discussed during follow-up call with the leadership team of the industrial or non industrial sites.\n\nEducation and awareness are also critical in the journey and the Group  aims  to  deepen  its  H&S  culture  through  engagement, motivation, and empowerment. As such, the Pernod Ricard training program 'Care by Learning' continues to be rolled out through a pre-defined  sequence  of  modules  for  both  industrial  and  non industrial population. Also the corporate campaign 'Be the one', launched last year, continues to be rolled out across the Group. It has become a real movement, reflected in strong commitments, creative  initiatives  to  further  engage  and  raise  awareness,  or concrete tools to help everyone make H&S a priority.\n\nExamples include:\n\n- \u00b7 2024 resolutions by top management and many workshops in the groups to push the people to make a strong H&S commitment;\n- \u00b7 be the one - the card game to start every meeting with a safety moment;\n- \u00b7 many local initiatives or videos - for industrial and non-industrial employees  -  to  address  all  aspects  of  the  health,  safety  and well-being  (rap  song  in  India,  video  in  LATAM,  safety  events worldwide, etc.).\n\nAt Group level, the \"Be the one\" hero movie was launched internally and externally in January 2024, reinforcing the importance of each of  us  being  the  one  and  taking  action  at  the  own  level. The communication campaign was awarded a silver prize at the TOP/COM Corporate Business Awards.\n\n## PERNOD RICARD H&S PARTNERSHIPS\n\nPernod Ricard is actively engaged with H&S networks to share best practices and has increased its visibility in this sphere by attending and presenting at various events and conferences, including:\n\n- \u00b7 People Sustainability the Future: conference in London, December 2023;\n- \u00b7 HSE  Fleming  both  Health  and  Safety  Director  and  EVP  Integrated  Operations  and  S&R  presented  'Exploring  Leadership Dynamics in Safety Performance Enhancement', April 2024.\n\nSince  FY22,  the  Group's  H&S  efforts  have  resulted  in  a  more  than  43%  reduction  in  lost  time  accident  frequency  rate.  Workplace accidents and associated KPIs cover 100% of interim, fixed-term and permanent contracts.\n\n| Workplace accidents and % of sites certified          | FY22   | FY23   | FY24   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of workplace accidents with lost time (1)      | 70     | 60     | 44     |\n| Frequency rate (1)(2)                                 | 3.4    | 2.6    | 1.9    |\n| Severity rate (1)(3)                                  | 83     | 125    | 52     |\n| Number of fatalities (1)                              | 0      | 0      | 0      |\n| % of production sites OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 certified | 91%    | 86%    | 84%    |\n\nThe accident severity rate has decreased by 58% compared to last FY. This result highlights the commitment to continuous improvement and safety excellence.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moreover,  there  is  clear  evidence  that  enhancing  wellbeing (broadly defined) makes employees less accident/hazard prone. The  Group  considers  that  giving  a  strong  impulse  to  mental health leads to a virtuous circle benefiting every person in terms of  wellbeing  and  motivation,  which  can  radiate  through  the company and ultimately drive business in a sustainable way.\n\nThese beliefs and commitments were made concrete in FY24 through several initiatives and the development of a global framework.\n\n## Be the One\n\nFor the World Day for Safety and Health at Work, on the 28 th of April, the Group launched a major campaign, ' Be the One ' to care, to flag,  to  notice,  etc.  This  campaign  acknowledges  that  accidents\n\nstart with small details. Easy overlooked, many small factors can lead to risk and accidents if they are not identified and addressed. 'Be  the  One'  thus  aims  to  help  employees  identify  hazards, change their habits, and foster a sense of caring about safety, but also  about  people.  Through  this  new  campaign,  the  Group  is laying the foundations of a more holistic approach to preserving the mental, moral, and physical health of its employees.\n\n## Mental Health First Aid\n\nIn keeping with same, Pernod Ricard began deploying 'mental health  first  aid'  sessions in  France,  a  programme  already deployed  in  other  affiliates  such  as  Pernod  Ricard  Winemakers in  Australia  while  leading  working  groups  on  quality-of-life issues.  The  next  steps  involve  expanding  a  network  focused on mental wellbeing and peer-to-peer support at the Group HQ level  to  formally  widen  the  Health  &  Safety  scope  to  include mental health.\n\n## 3.5.1.4 Educating employees on alcohol and responsible drinking\n\n| Policy           | Commitment                                                                                      | Target date   | Objective   | FY23   | FY24   | Progress  status   |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| 2030 S&R roadmap | Maintain all Group employees trained  on alcohol and responsible drinking  through the MOOC (1) | Ongoing       | 100%        | 94%    | 96%    | On plan            |\n| 2030 S&R roadmap | Train sales staff and brand ambassadors  on responsible sale of alcohol (2)                     | 2025          | 100%        | 19%    | 27.5%  | In progress        |\n\nPernod Ricard's employees are the primary and best ambassadors for responsible drinking. The Group enlists its employees worldwide with  the  common  goal  of  promoting  a  conscious  approach  to drinking.\n\n## Online training on alcohol & responsible drinking\n\nLaunched in 2020 and translated into 21 languages, Pernod Ricard's online training provides information on alcohol and alcohol-related risks  to  enable  employees  to  make  informed  decisions  as  to whether to drink alcohol and how to drink responsibly.\n\nThe training also embeds the Group's Global Responsible Drinking Charter.  The  Group  expects  all  employees  to  comply  with  this Charter as a breach could present a risk to the health, safety, and well-being of employees and third parties.\n\nThis training has been made compulsory for all Group employees worldwide.  Continuing  its  efforts  from  past  years,  in  FY24  the Group  almost  achieved  its  100%  target  by  reaching  96%  of  its active  employees  trained  on  responsible  drinking  and  has committed to keeping this target on a yearly basis.\n\n## Training of sales staff and brand ambassadors on the prevention of alcohol-related risks\n\nPernod  Ricard's  sales  staff  and  brand  ambassadors  are  at  the frontline  of  the  Group's  business.  Because  of  their  job,  they might find themselves in challenging situations related to alcohol consumption. To this end, the Group has also been rolling out this past year a dedicated training programme to prevent alcohol-related risks amongst employees of relevant job families. Throughout this training, they learn how to identify alcohol-related risks, prevent potentially  conflictual  situations,  and  behave  in  a  professional and safe manner.\n\nTo effectively implement the training, a series of train-the-trainer sessions  have  been  organized  together  with  the  Sales  teams. In  each  affiliate  the  Sales  Director,  a  field  manager,  a  sales representative and the S&R manager are trained to then cascade and facilitate this education within their local teams.\n\nThese  trainings  have  been  further  extended  this  year  to  also cover all global Brand Ambassadors and to provide a platform of sharing on the topic of responsible drinking to this community.\n\nIn  FY25,  the  training  will  continue  to  be  rolled  out  to  ensure  all these employees are trained by the end of the year. This is part of the  overall  employee  journey  at  Pernod  Ricard,  which  includes offering responsible drinking support to employees when needed.",

The Group also recognises that it has a responsibility and an ethical duty to ensure Human Rights are respected across its worldwide operations and value chain.  Doing  so  requires  adhering  to  internationally  recognised standards and addressing any gaps wherever they are found.\n\n## Global Human Rights Policy\n\nMindful  of  the  new  challenges  arising  from  globalisation, Pernod  Ricard  introduced  its  first  Global  Human  Rights  Policy in  FY19.  Jointly  developed  with  numerous  internal  stakeholders, the policy is structured in three key areas:\n\n- \u00b7 'in our own operations';\n- \u00b7 'in the supply chain'; and\n- \u00b7 'in our local communities'.\n\nThe  commitments  therein  have,  since  FY19,  featured  in  the Pernod Ricard Code of Business Conduct and Supplier Standards.\n\nAs  a  global  organisation,  Pernod  Ricard  entrusts  its  affiliates  to adopt, abide, and promote the policy. When visiting affiliates, the Group's cross-functional internal audit teams perform some labour evaluations,  and  Managing  Directors'  performance  evaluations cover  labour  matters  together  with  societal  and  financial performance. Any targets are specific to each affiliate.\n\nIn  FY21,  Pernod  Ricard  launched  an  assessment  questionnaire through its HR network to embed a UNGPs approach. This reflects its  Human Rights policy and was focused on its own employees and  internal  practices.  In  addition,  there  was  independent country-level screening and mapping of potential Human Rights risks. With these two tools, the goal was to:\n\n- \u00b7 help affiliates raise awareness;\n- \u00b7 identify gaps in relation to the eight commitments to the Group's employees in the Human Right policy; and\n- \u00b7 develop appropriate action plans.\n\nOverall,  the  findings  demonstrated  the  implementation  of  a number of best practices. The findings also pointed to the need for  increased  communication  and  best  practice  sharing  of  the Health & Safety and Diversity & Inclusion efforts and roadmaps, and better dissemination of the Group's Human Rights policy and whistleblowing tool, Speak-Up. In FY22, the Group developed and promoted a video on Human Rights and the different Group tools and topics associated to raise employee awareness.\n\nThe  top  priorities  identified  by  affiliates  were  Health  &  Safety, Discrimination  and  Diversity  &  Inclusion,  which  demonstrated alignment with the Group's growing efforts in developing roadmaps in  these  areas  (see  subsections  3.5.1.1  'Diversity  &  Inclusion (D&I)', 3.5.1.2 'Supporting our employees to grow', and 3.5.1.3 'Health, safety & wellbeing').\n\nIn  FY24,  the  Group  organised  a  human  rights  capacity  building workshop  with  the  participation  of  the  Headquarters'  Head  of Global  Functions.  Facilitated  by  Shift,  the  leading  centre  of expertise on the UNGPs, the objectives were to raise awareness on the UN Guiding Principles, develop a common understanding of the expectations of Pernod Ricard in respecting human rights and identify next steps. Some of the next steps identified include the  building  of  a  strong  governance  and  human  rights  culture across the organization, reinforcement of due diligence processes and the review of coalitions and partnerships and the exploration of new ones.\n\nIn  FY25,  the  Group  will  start  conducting  human  rights  impact assessments and exploring approaches to progressively identifying and  address  salient  human  rights  issues.  Moreover,  Pernod Ricard  will  continue  to  raise  awareness  of  its  employees  and develop a training  plan  to  build  capability  for  functions  directly related to managing human rights.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  is  available  in  French, English and Spanish;\n- \u00b7 suggested  sustainability  provisions  for  contracts.  These  are available in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Mandarin.\n\nThe Responsible Procurement process (named Blue Source) applies throughout  the  Group  and  is  supported  by  Top  Management. Affiliates  are  responsible  for  its  application  and  monitor  any suppliers or subcontractors identified as risky.\n\nThe Blue Source process includes as of today half of Pernod Ricard's affiliates and is implemented for the following perimeter:\n\n- \u00b7 dry Goods (packaging);\n- \u00b7 wet Goods (agricultural raw material);\n- \u00b7 point Of Sale material.\n\n## 3.5.2.1.2 Supplier Standards\n\nThe Blue Source process , which is implemented throughout the Group,  allows  affiliates  to  apply  the  Responsible  Procurement strategy locally with their suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nSupplier Standards are to be signed by all suppliers, either directly on the Partner Up platform for the suppliers that are in the scope (see subsection 3.9.1 'Methodology note on non-financial reporting') or electronically and saved locally by each entity.\n\nThe aim is to increase awareness around:\n\n- \u00b7 human Rights and labour law;\n- \u00b7 health & safety;\n- \u00b7 environmental impact;\n- \u00b7 responsible drinking;\n- \u00b7 integrity and fair business practices.\n\n## KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n| Number of suppliers                                                                                                                                              | FY23   | FY24   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Who signed the Supplier Standards (1)                                                                                                                            | 1,973  | 1,959  |\n| Analysed using the risk mapping tool                                                                                                                             | 2,190  | 2,089  |\n| Identified as risky (high or medium risk)                                                                                                                        | 1,740  | 1,700  |\n| Identified as risky and covered by an EcoVadis assessment                                                                                                        | 345    | 328    |\n| Identified as at risk with production sites covered by an audit in accordance with social, environmental  and ethical standards                                  | 111    | 51     |\n| Identified as at risk following the results of the assessment/audit (EcoVadis, SMETA) but not having started  the implementation of the required mitigation plan | 43     | 37     |\n\nThis document was updated in 2019 and includes commitments\n\npertaining to 'respecting land and water rights of communities',\n\n- 'environmental regulations', 'animal welfare', and 'tax evasion'.\n\nMoreover, the Group took the opportunity of introducing Supplier Standards to raise awareness amongst suppliers and encourage them to do likewise. Pernod Ricard will suspend dealings with any direct suppliers (Wet and Dry Goods) and key indirect suppliers (POS) who fails to sign the updated version or failed to provide an equivalent commitment.\n\nThe Blue Source process also provides the Risk mapping tool for each affiliate to identify which suppliers (Wet and Dry Goods, POS) and  subcontractors  should  be  assessed  first  according  to  set criteria regarding:\n\n- \u00b7 production or service;\n- \u00b7 size;\n- \u00b7 country footprint;\n- \u00b7 net sales;\n- \u00b7 dependence of the supplier on the affiliate;\n- \u00b7 annual expenditure;\n- \u00b7 critical nature of the product;\n- \u00b7 social, environmental and supply chain risks of the supplier.\n\nSupplier's  risks  are  reanalysed  every  three  years  for  low-risk suppliers, two years for medium risk and every year for high-risk suppliers.\n\n## 3.5.2.1.3 Sustainability assessment and audits\n\nPernod Ricard asks for reassessments of its high and medium-risk suppliers in order to identify areas for improvement and review the effectiveness of their action plans. Such assessments include:\n\n- \u00b7 sustainability assessment using the EcoVadis platform around four key topics: environment, labour, ethics and supply chain;\n- \u00b7 social and ethical audit standards in line with the SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) standards and any other similar audits covering the same criteria of analysis.\n\nFor this Blue Source analysis, Pernod Ricard assumes that the risk does not stop at the amount of the expense: due to its activity and location, a supplier with a low expense may be just as much at  risk  as  a  supplier  with  a  high  expense.  Accordingly,  expense coverage is not calculated in this analysis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These also indicate what actions employees can take to mitigate risks with their suppliers.\n\nFor  example,  Pernod  Ricard  offers  an  online  learning  module covering all fundamental aspects of sustainability and responsibility applied  to  Procurement  which  includes  interactive  explanations of what \"buying responsibly\" means, why it is an important topic for  the  Group  and  how  the  employees  can  practice  responsible procurement  locally.  In  addition,  other  trainings  are  offered  in various  formats  throughout  the  year,  including  individual  calls with  procurement  teams,  specific  workshops  and  seminars.  In order  to  strengthen  Pernod  Ricard's  affiliates  adoption  of  the Blue Source Process, performance reviews meetings are planned twice a year with each affiliate.\n\nIn summary, the Group will take the following steps:\n\n- \u00b7 ask all suppliers, across all categories, to sign up to the Supplier Standards on Partner Up (22) or manually;\n- \u00b7 complete an analysis of direct suppliers (Dry Goods and agricultural raw materials) and key indirect suppliers (POS) (23) ;\n- \u00b7 explore  partnership  plans  to  engage  in  a  multi-stakeholder programme. Pernod Ricard is already working with Bonsucro, a  global  multi-stakeholder  NGO  to  promote  sustainable sugarcane production, processing and trade worldwide;\n- \u00b7 train  Procurement  Managers  or  functions  on  Responsible Procurement  processes  including  labour  rights  and  Human Rights considerations;\n- \u00b7 expand  Responsible  Procurement  processes  to  other  key indirect categories.\n\nAs a signatory of the UN Global Compact (UNGC), Pernod Ricard also  participates  in  various  webinars  on  Human  Rights,  decent work and living wages.\n\n## 3.5.2.1.4 The Amazone Project\n\nIn FY22, to reinforce the Responsible Procurement programme, the Company launched the 'Amazone project', which aims to enhance procurement-related risk management  and  contribute  to delivering on 2030 S&R targets.\n\nThis  project  aspires  to  transform  Pernod  Ricard  Responsible Procurement model in terms of scope, methods, technology used and resources involved.\n\nIt is divided in two phases:\n\n- 1) a  diagnosis  phase  with  the  objective  to  understand  the programme maturity, challenge the existing model and get best practices and recommendations adapted to Pernod Ricard organisation;\n- 2) a  preparation  phase  to  implement  the  new  Pernod  Ricard Responsible Procurement model starting FY23 which includes the following workstreams:\n- a. risk Data Providers : select and implement external sources and databases for an automated supplier risk rating,\n- b. risk  Mapping  Methodology : review  and  update  the Pernod Ricard's  risk  mapping  methodology  and  update of supplier risk questionnaires,\n- c. suppliers  onboarding :  review  of  risk  arbitration  rules within the Group supplier onboarding process,\n- d. supplier  Standard :  conduct  benchmark  and  review  of stakeholder's expectations to identify best practices and gaps,\n- e. governance :  work  on  role  and  responsibilities  for  the coordination and the implementation of the programme,\n- f. evaluation and audit strategy : conduct benchmark and identify best solutions for risk assessment,\n- g. engagement :  build  engagement plan (training, support documentation etc.) externally (for suppliers) and internally (internal stakeholders).\n\nEnd  of  FY24,  Pernod  Ricard  launched  a  pilot  with  key  and strategic  suppliers  to  test  the  new  processes,  the  new  risk mapping and database as well as the new risk arbitration rules.\n\nThe objective is to validate the new processes, tools and rules to deploy them starting FY25.\n\nBy the end of FY24, the Group has decided to add the Supplier Standards in the Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) and Contracts with the suppliers. This is part of the simplification and reinforcement of its Responsible Procurement ambition.\n\n## 3.5.2.1.5 Human Rights\n\nAs  'Cr\u00e9ateurs  de  convivialit\u00e9',  Pernod  Ricard  cares  about  the lives the Group impacts and is committed to driving the respect for people's  fundamental  dignity,  treating  everyone  fairly, celebrating the differences for everyone to thrive throughout the supply  and  value  chain:  Human  rights  considerations  feature front and centre of the Group's commitments.\n\n## PARTNERSHIPS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS: UN GLOBAL COMPACT\n\nFrom FY18 to FY22, Pernod Ricard contributed to the UN Global Compact's Decent Work in Global Supply Chains Action platform, an alliance of companies committed to upholding Human Rights and fundamental labour rights and principles. These companies work through their supply chains, taking collective action to foster decent work conditions. This partnership has informed and contributed to the Group's own endeavours regarding the sustainability of its supply chain (see subsection 3.5.2 'Empowering people throughout our value chain').",

        "page_content": "In FY21, the Group's risk mapping of priority terroirs through a dedicated  tool  (see  subsection  3.4.2.2  'Mapping  the  Group's terroirs')  sought  to  achieve  full  traceability,  but  also  to  assess environmental  and  social  risks  in  these  terroirs  and  implement sustainability  programmes  (see  subsection  3.4.2.3  'Sourcing ingredients sustainably').\n\nOver  the  past  year,  the  Group  conducted  an  assessment  to identify  areas  of  improvement  in  line  with  its  duty  of  vigilance, notably in human rights and supplier vigilance. A human rights capacity building with senior management was also organised at Headquarters' level to develop a common understanding of the\n\nexpectations  of  Pernod  Ricard  in  respecting  human  rights  and identify next steps. Some of the next steps identified include:\n\n- \u00b7 reinforcing  the  governance  and  human rights training across the organization, notably within the responsible procurement function;\n- \u00b7 enhancing  the  supplier  risk  assessment  screening  and  due diligence processes; and\n- \u00b7 updating  its  policies  to  address  salient  human  right  risks  of workers in the value chain and affected communities.\n\n## 3.5.2.2 Supporting farmer communities\n\n| Policy           | Commitment                            |   Target date | Objective   | FY23   | FY24   | Progress  status   |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| 2030 S&R roadmap | Empower, train or support farmers (1) |          2030 | 5,000       | 10,506 | 11,203 | Achieved           |\n\n(1)\n\nCumulative figure.\n\nA  terroir  is  more  than  the  soil  and  the  ingredients  it  produces: these  can  only  be  grown  through  the  local  communities  and season workers living and working there, whose know-how has been cultivated over generations. To speak of terroirs is to speak of  people,  communities,  and  livelihoods,  all  of  which  the  Group's commitments to Regenerative Agriculture seek to benefit. As such, Pernod Ricard engages with its farmer communities to:\n\n- \u00b7 develop sustainable practices;\n- \u00b7 improve livelihoods;\n- \u00b7 increase access to health and education; and\n- \u00b7 more  broadly,  empower  local  populations  and  increase  their resilience.\n\n## PERNOD RICARD PARTNERSHIPS TO EMPOWER, TRAIN, AND SUPPORT FARMERS\n\n## Mexico\n\nIn Mexico, Kahl\u00faa works with coffee-producing communities and local NGO Fondo Para La Paz to help them increase their yields without compromising biodiversity. The programme supported new agricultural practices like the planting and development of climate resistant varieties as well as fair compensation, with a specific focus on female empowerment. In FY23, the programme reached an important milestone with the communities now being able to supply all of Kahlua's coffee needs while preserving biodiversity and expanding to other customers.\n\n## Ireland\n\nIn the south of France, where Irish Distillers source their maize, the Group has enrolled 27 farmers in the regenerative index to identify their areas of progress and transform their practices, such as no or low tillage. As part of this project, the Group is also working to develop a fair economic model to ensure long-term mutual commitments.\n\n## India\n\nThe WAL (water agriculture, livelihood) projects in India operates with major aspects of community empowerment, for instance by training farmers. Engaging with agri-communities, the initiative promotes best practices to improve agricultural production and protecting their terroir, by focusing on locally feasible, climate resilient and low-cost approaches. A key objective of WAL is to empower the small, marginal and tribal farmers to help them go beyond subsistence farming with sustainable farming practices. The WAL projects have reached more than 7000 farmers around India in FY24.\n\nFor  this,  Pernod  Ricard  engages  with  its  communities  including by working on the ground to understand farmers' behaviours and possible barriers to change and provide solutions and incentives to maximise adoption.\n\nThe Group's terroir strategy includes helping new socio-economic models  develop,  for  instance  by  conducting  workshops  on production costs linked to the implementation of new practices, and other levers to de-risk agricultural transformation for smallholder communities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To guide bartenders  and  bar  owners  with  this  transition,  Pernod  Ricard has created The Bar World of Tomorrow (BWOT).\n\nThe BWOT started in 2020 as an online training course, created in partnership with the Trash Collective and the Sustainable Restaurant Association.  The  course  is  available  worldwide  and  covers  all aspects of S&R from fresh ingredient use to responsible serving of  alcoholic  beverages  to  waste  management.  Directly  aligned with  the  UN  SDGs,  it  focuses  on  four  key  areas:  ingredients; service; bar; staff.\n\nThe free e-learning course is available to all adults of legal-drinking age (24) .  It  is  available  in  English,  French,  Spanish,  Portuguese, Russian, German, Polish, Turkish and Mandarin. In FY20, a toolkit was shared on how to run training sessions online or in-person on the key principles of the BWOT. This is aimed at guiding S&R leaders, brand ambassadors and/or advocacy colleagues to train bar owners and bartenders. All training sessions are reported to local S&R leaders to report back the number of attendees to HQ.\n\nIn addition, several tools were created to share with participants:\n\n- \u00b7 a detailed checklist for bartenders & bar owners;\n- \u00b7 cocktail recipes;\n- \u00b7 a responsible serving cheat sheet; and\n- \u00b7 a 'badge' of completion.\n\n## BWOT & TIMEOUT PARTNERSHIP FOR EMPOWERMENT\n\nSince the last fiscal year, the Group partnered with TimeOut to help launch the 'Bar World of Tomorrow' award at their TimeOut Food & Drinks awards and recognise the most sustainable and responsible bars. With the winners selected by the Sustainable Restaurant Association, the nominated bars are evaluated across all dimensions of the BWOT programme to evaluate and identify the most proactive and impactful establishments. Building on a previous collaboration between TimeOut and Pernod Ricard Hong Kong, the Group sponsored the 'Bar World of Tomorrow' award in Paris and Lisbon in FY24.\n\nWith  2,202  bartenders  having  completed  the  BWOT  training online and 15,855 bartenders trained in person since the creation of the programme (with 5,747 only in FY24), the Group continues to  surpass  its  initial  target  to  train  10,000  bartenders  by  2030. This  is  the  result  of  a  large-scale  roll-out  of  the  programme  in recent  years  and  the  efforts  of  affiliates  to  train  the  hospitality community  in  bars,  hotel  chains  and  other  partners.  From partnerships with local hospitality schools, to spaces and seminars dedicated  to  BWOT  at  global  bar  shows,  the  programme continues to strengthen its engagement with bartenders.\n\nBWOT continues to evolve as a broader global movement aiming to create and engage with a community seeking a wider positive impact, especially since its integration with the Group's on-trade advocacy program, SIP (Share Inspire Pioneer), as the sustainability pillar for this hospitality platform.\n\n## Next steps and future commitments\n\nIn the next fiscal year, the Group will develop an updated global roadmap  on  the  direction  and  objectives  for  the  programme, especially  since  it  surpassed  its  initial  target.  New  KPIs  will  be identified as future targets for the group as affiliates continue to engage  with  the  hospitality  community  on  sustainable  and responsible practices.",

Nevertheless, the Group acknowledges that drinking alcohol can carry health risks when misused.\n\nPernod Ricard  and  its  19,557  employees  are  fully  committed  to promoting  responsible  drinking.  This  stance  stems  directly  from the Group's vision of being ' Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9 ', as conviviality is  incompatible  with  excessive  or  inappropriate  drinking.  Adult consumers ought to be encouraged to make responsible choices about whether to drink or not, and how much alcohol to drink. Moreover,  moderate  drinking  goes  hand-in-hand  with  Pernod Ricard's premiumisation strategy.\n\nThe  Group  believes  collective  action  is  essential  to  achieve  real and  positive  change  and  collaborates  with  its  stakeholders, including industry peers, governments, and local communities to strengthen its responsible practices. The Group's has a positive role to play in promoting responsible drinking and can be part of the solution to prevent alcohol misuse.\n\n## Responsible Drinking Roadmap\n\nPernod Ricard supports the World Health Organisation's (WHO) goal of reducing harmful drinking by 20% worldwide by 2030 (25) . However, the Group does not believe that a cut in average per capita consumption in itself supports public health needs as this notion is not backed up by facts: pursuing such a strategy in the past  has  led  to  lower  consumption  amongst  moderate  drinkers without  a  meaningful  impact  on  the  populations  that  drink  at harmful levels.\n\nConsequently, the Group's responsible drinking roadmap focuses on preventing alcohol misuse and aims to achieve this goal through actions best suited for each target group. It encompasses a wide range  of  tools,  including  training,  self-regulation,  labelling, communication campaigns, and prevention programmes to find the most effective approach for each target audience and context.\n\nThe  Group's  Responsible  Hosting  pillar  is  coordinated  by  the Alcohol in Society team within the Public Affairs Department and is  implemented  through  the  network  of  S&R  and  Public  Affairs leaders.\n\nIn  FY25,  the  Group  will  continue  the  deployment  of  current responsible drinking initiatives while developing a new Responsible Drinking strategy. It will ensure the transition from risk management philosophy  to  consumer-facing  ambition  by  which  will  aim  at embarking the consumers in responsible drinking journey.\n\n## 3.5.3.1 Consumer information\n\n| Policy           | Commitment                                                                                                                                                      |   Target date | Objective   | FY23    | FY24    | Progress  status   |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|---------|---------|--------------------|\n|                  | Feature the three responsible drinking logos  on all Pernod Ricard products (1)                                                                                 |          2024 | 100%        | 41% (3) | 95% (3) | On plan            |\n| 2030 S&R roadmap | Feature a digital label on all Pernod Ricard  products informing consumers on product  contents, potential health risks, and how  to enjoy them responsibly (2) |          2024 | 100%        | 41% (3) | 95% (3) | On plan            |\n\nPernod Ricard strongly believes that providing clear and comprehensive information is key to empowering consumers to make informed and responsible choices about alcohol consumption. To that end, the Group is committed to disclose the content of its products, the potential health risks of alcohol consumption and relevant responsible drinking information.\n\n## Responsible drinking logos\n\nFollowing  implementation  guidelines  issued  in  2021,  in  FY24, Pernod Ricard kept working on its commitment to feature three responsible  drinking  logos  on  all  products:  an  age  restriction logo,  a  logo  warning  against  driving  whilst  intoxicated,  and  a logo warning against drinking during pregnancy that the Group has added to labels since 2006.\n\n## Digital Labels\n\nIn  FY24,  continuing  its  efforts  as  a  proactive  player  in  the industry,  Pernod  Ricard  rolled  out  its  digital  labels  worldwide across  its  portfolio.  This  digital  labelling  system  is  designed  to better inform consumers about the products they purchase and to  enable  them  to  make  well-informed  and  responsible  choices when it comes to drinking alcohol.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Digital  labels  have been successfully implemented in a total of 166 markets:\n\n- \u00b7 72  markets  with  geolocated  fully-deployed  content  which enables  the  consumer  to  access  tailor-made  information  in local language, including on local regulations;\n- \u00b7 94  countries  with  a  generic  content  in  English  or  Spanish, depending on geolocation.\n\nMore  than  half  a  billion  bottles  with  digital  labels  have  been shipped worldwide, and the QR codes have been scanned more than 350,000 times since 2022, the year of the project's launch.\n\nIn the upcoming year, the Group aims to raise awareness on this initiative  amongst  consumers though dedicated communication campaigns.\n\n## 3.5.3.2   Responsible marketing and sales\n\n| Policy           | Commitment                                                                                   | Target date   | Objective   | FY23   | FY24   | Progress  status   |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n|                  | Have no complaint upheld against Group  marketing campaigns                                  | Ongoing       | 0           | 1      | 0      | Achieved           |\n|                  | Comply with the IARD Digital Guiding  Principles (DGPs)                                      | 2024          | 95%         | 95.5%  | 98.6%  | Achieved           |\n| 2030 S&R roadmap | Reach full completion rate on the e-learning (1) for the Code for Commercial  Communications | Ongoing       | 100%        | 80%    | 90.6%  | On plan            |\n|                  | Implement age-gating on direct  to consumer Pernod Ricard websites                           | Ongoing       | 100%        | 100%   | 98%    | On plan            |\n\nPernod  Ricard  is  committed  to  being  an  industry  leader  in standards for the responsible marketing of alcoholic beverages. The Group has had its own Code for Commercial Communications (CCC)  since  2007  to  ensures  that  the  Group's  commercial communications  do  not  encourage  or  condone  irresponsible consumption or misuse.\n\nThrough continuously revising and consistently applying the CCC, Pernod  Ricard  continues  to  deliver  a  brand  experience  centred on  conviviality  and  responsibility  that  complies  with  industry commitments and advertising authority requirements. In 2020, the Group  updated  its  CCC,  strengthening  all  guidelines  (provision mandating  models  be  over  25  years  of  age  and  meet  certain requirements).  In  2021,  it  added  guidelines  regarding  product placement to keep raising standards. In FY23, the Group added a new  'Sustainability  Claims'  golden  rule  and  launched  its  first Sustainability Claims Guidelines, designed to avoid 'green/socialwashing'  or  misleading  consumers.  An  updated  version  of  the Code will be released in FY25 covering new areas such as RTDs, cross-over products and e-gaming.\n\nPernod Ricard also has an online training programme to ensure employees  in  relevant  functions  are  aware  of  and  comply  with the provisions of the CCC. In FY24, 90.6% of the relevant population had successfully completed this course, an improvement of 10ppt on FY23 and new digital measures have been introduced in FY25 to improve compliance further.\n\n## Responsible Marketing Panel (RMP)\n\nCreated in 2005, the RMP is responsible for the ethical oversight of Pernod Ricard's advertising. Its six members and chair are not supervised by the Marketing Department. The RMP reports to the Executive  Committee  every  month.  It  is  sponsored  by  two Executive Committee members who are consulted on changes to the Code for Commercial Communications (CCC) and the drafting of  implementing  guidelines  to  ensure  Pernod  Ricard  complies with the highest standards of responsible marketing.\n\nAll  marketing campaigns must be submitted to the RMP, which issues  an  opinion  within  seven  working  days.  Decisions  of  the RMP are binding.\n\nIn FY24, the RMP assessed 775 requests:\n\n- \u00b7 523 formal compliance requests, of these:\n- \u00b7 480 campaigns were approved with no restrictions,\n- \u00b7 40 campaigns were approved, subject to modifications,\n- \u00b7 3 campaigns were rejected;\n- \u00b7 252 requests for advice.",

These requirements  apply  across  the  most  commonly-used  platforms (Facebook,  Instagram,  Twitter,  and  YouTube)  and  websites  and include  requirements  for  age-verification,  responsible  drinking statements, transparency, restrictions on user generated content, and  adding  forward  advice  notices  compliance  by  2024.  An external audit in FY22, using bot h manual and AI checks, covered 1,032  URLs  and  found  Pernod  Ricard  had  achieved  95.3% compliance.  The  FY23  audit  covered  1,127  URLs  and  found compliance had risen slightly to 95.5%. Since then, Pernod Ricard has significantly rationalised its digital sites. In FY24, the external audit covered 806 URLs and found a 98.6% compliance rate.\n\n## Raising Global Standards\n\nPernod  Ricard  and  other  IARD  member  companies  have  also continued to work in partnership with global and regional online retailers,  e-commerce  and  delivery  platforms  to  raise  global standards.  In  FY24,  IARD  members  and  six  leading  digital platforms, including Google, Meta, Pinterest, Snap, TikTok, and X, announced their collective commitment to further strengthening online  safeguards  where  necessary  by  2025  to  prevent  people below  legal  drinking  age  from  inadvertently  seeing  alcohol advertising online and to provide confidence that age-assurance methodologies used by digital platforms are robust.\n\nTo  prevent  the  online  sale  and  delivery  of  alcohol  to  underage individuals  and  to  reduce  harmful  alcohol  consumption  among adults, the Group implements IARD's global standards for online alcohol  sales  and  delivery (26) .  In  FY24,  98%  of  Pernod  Ricard Direct-to-Consumer  sites  were  verified  as  age-gated.  The remaining  site  has  been  updated.  Meanwhile,  the  Group  has begun  a  pilot  programme  of  mystery  shopper  checks  to  verify delivery compliance with age verification checks in key markets.\n\n## 3.5.3.3   Responsible Drinking Brand Campaigns\n\n| Policy                                         | Commitment                                                                                                                      |   Target date |   Objective |   FY23 |   FY24 | Progress  status   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| 2030 S&R roadmap /  Long term incentive  plans | Roll out at least 12 marketing campaigns*  by strategic brands to promote responsible  drinking behaviour among their consumers |          2027 |          12 |      5 |     10 | On plan            |\n\nPernod  Ricard's  commitment  to  promote  responsible  drinking involves  actions  at  every  step  of  the  consumer  journey.  This includes the ways the Group address consumers well before the sale of a product. Pernod Ricard believes that marketing can be a force  for  good  by  creating  social  value  and  helping  consumers adopt  responsible  behaviour  regarding  alcohol.  Brands  know how to talk to consumers, and their campaigns can be effective at changing attitudes and social norms for better.\n\nAs  such,  the  Group  formally  committed  to  leveraging  the creativity  of  its  brands  to  deliver  responsibility-minded  messages to consumers through dedicated campaigns.\n\nIn  FY24,  5  campaigns  were  rolled  out  covering  Poland,  Mexico, the UK, and Singapore and Taiwan. Among them, Jameson's 'Sip Wisely' campaign was the Group's first responsible drinking campaign broadcasted on a sports stadium as part of the partnership with a football league, notably The English Football League. Additionally, Ballantine's 'Real Party' campaign empowered young people to either refuse a drink or drink water instead since binge drinking remains a major issue in Poland. Absolut's 'Call It A Night' campaign highlighted  the  LGBTQ+  community  in  the  UK.  It  centred  on creating  a  safe  environment  in  night  venues  and  encouraged consumers  to  spot  the  signs  of  when  to  call  it  a  night  before anyone gets verbally hurt.\n\nIn total, since FY22, 10 campaigns in 7 different markets have already been  launched  reaching  108  million  people  with  responsible drinking messages.\n\nMoving  forward,  the  Group  is  now  working  on  developing  a methodology  to  measure  efficiency  of  such  campaigns.  They already undergo a pre-test which, on top of standard marketing metrics,  assesses  whether  the  responsibility  message  is  well understood  and  makes  consumers  want  to  moderate  their consumption.  The  next  step  is  to  develop  a  robust  post-test assessment to evaluate the impact of most extensive campaigns.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  such,  the Group  has  committed  that  all  its  affiliates  will  contribute  to  a minimum of either:\n\n- (i) one  local  responsible  drinking  initiative  implemented  in partnership  with  industry  peers,  civil  society,  or  local authorities; or\n- (ii) one  global  responsible  drinking  initiative  developed  by  the Group.\n\nIn FY24, 94% of Group markets implemented at least one external local  or  global  initiative.  The  combination  of  both  types  of initiatives (in 57% of markets) is considered most effective way to deliver on this commitment.\n\n## 3.5.3.4.1 Local initiatives\n\nThe  Group  believes  that  its  affiliates  are  well-placed  to  identify alcohol-related  issues  relevant  locally  and  encourages  building strong partnerships with local trade associations for more impactful initiatives.  This  year,  most  of  them  (85%)  were  implemented  in partnership, out of which 80% together with trade associations.\n\n## 3.5.3.4.2   Global initiatives\n\nGlobal initiatives are coordinated from HQ and aim at strengthening the Group's responsible drinking effort by giving affiliates readyto-use tools and assets. They address key alcohol-related issues to  have  a  global  impact  while  acting  at  the  local  level.  In  FY24, Pernod Ricard continued to implement the two global responsible drinking initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 DRINK MORE WATER; and\n- \u00b7 Autosobriety Training Programme.\n\n## DRINK MORE WATER\n\nPernod Ricard is committed to fighting binge drinking around the world,  notably  through  its  'DRINK  MORE  WATER'  flagship programme which aims to reduce harm linked to this dangerous drinking practice. Building on the Group's historical programme Responsible  Party  and  the  partnership  with  Erasmus  Student Network, dating from 2009, 'DRINK MORE WATER' targets all young adults  globally  with  its  own  visual  identity  and  peer-to-peer approach. The 'DRINK MORE WATER' digital campaign uses bold visuals to attract attention and give a clear call to action to the Gen Z, by speaking their own language.\n\nBuilding  on  the  success  of  the  initial  'DRINK  MORE  WATER' campaign in 2021, a new edition was launched in Spring 2024 to refresh the campaign and continue to shake up the status quo by inspiring  future  generations  of  smart  drinkers.  The  new  edition proved  to  be  equally  appreciated  by  the  young  adults  and  has once again gained wide global outreach online. Across the two editions,  the  digital  campaign  has  reached  around  600  million young adults across 60 countries.\n\nThe programme is also extended onto the field at many events across the world such as iconic festivals, student parties, carnivals as  well  as  corporate,  trade  and  sports'  events.  Since  2021,  the activations  on  the  field  have  reached  over  32  million  young adults, providing them with prevention messages and free water.\n\nThrough FY25, the campaign will continue to be rolled out both online and on the field, using the second edition, and the Group will  keep  building  on  global  partnerships  with  Tomorrowland, Boiler  Room  and  One  Young  World  to  increase  global  impact. These  partnerships  will  provide  platforms  to  amplify  raising awareness  on  responsible  drinking  amongst  the  Gen  Z  and implementing  concrete  actions  on  the  field  to  reduce  harm  at events where alcohol is consumed.\n\n## Autosobriety partnership with UNITAR\n\nPernod Ricard strongly believes that alcohol-related road traffic crashes  are  preventable  and  should  never  happen.  And  to  this end,  education  is  key:  people  need  to  understand  how  alcohol affects the ability to drive in order to make the right choice not to drive while intoxicated.\n\nFor the past four years Pernod Ricard has been partnering with the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) on  the  roll-out  of  the  Autosobriety  training  programme.  This initiative aims to provide road safety stakeholders with educational tools to raise awareness on the risks associated with drinking and driving.  The  overall  objective  is  to  contribute  to  the  UN  Global Road  Safety  Performance  Target  #9  to  halve  the  number  of alcohol-related road traffic injuries and fatalities by 2030.",

Since its beginning, 67 partners have been mobilized to support Autosobriety, including 17 implementing partners from Pernod  Ricard  and  UNITAR's  network  (Group's  affiliates  and CIFAL  centres  respectively)  and  50  external  partners  from governmental sector, academics, NGOs, and private sector.\n\nIn  FY24,  the  Autosobriety  programme  was  deployed  in  10 countries,  including  South  Africa,  Dominican  Republic,  Mexico, Ecuador, Poland, Cambodia, China, Vietnam, Spain and Thailand, and reached 20,318 beneficiaries among which 3,287 trainers and 17,031 final road users.\n\nIn FY24, the program has seen an acceleration in China where it targeted university students who are the main force of drivers-tobe through in-depth online education via Autosobriety application and  on-the-ground  activities.  In  South  Africa,  new  partnership was  concluded  with  a  specialised  corporate  driving  training centre to cover the audience of professional drivers.\n\nIn  FY25,  to  complement and strengthen the current training-oftrainers'  modality  of  Autosobriety  implementation,  the  Group aims  at  developing  new  set  of  assets  targeted  directly  at  road users to amplify the outreach of the program.\n\n## 3.5.3.5   Consumer experience at Brand Homes\n\n| Policy           | Commitment                                                                                            |   Target date | Objective   | FY23             | FY24    | Progress  status   |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|---------|--------------------|\n|                  | Obtain the Responsible Host certification  for all Group's public-facing Brand Homes                  |          2025 | 100%        | Self- assessment | 53%     | On plan            |\n| 2030 S&R roadmap | Raise awareness of responsible drinking  for visitors through Responsible Host  certified Brand Homes |          2030 | 10M         | -                | 280,374 | On plan            |\n\nAs  a  responsible  host,  Pernod  Ricard  wants  to  offer  its  guests safe experiences when enjoying its products. The Group's Brand Homes are the showcase of its brands and the experiences they offer to their visitors should always be associated with responsible drinking. To that end, the Group put in place a Responsible Host accreditation scheme in partnership with the Sustainable Restaurant Association to ensure best-in-class responsible drinking practices in all its brand homes worldwide.\n\nIn  FY22,  the  Group  had  issued  its  Responsible  Host  Standards consisting of 18 mandatory criteria among which:\n\n- \u00b7 offering water and snacks to visitors free of charge;\n- \u00b7 always using measuring tools used when serving alcohol;\n- \u00b7 distributing  scratch  cards  to  help  guests  track  how  much alcohol they have consumed;\n- \u00b7 distributing spittoons and  emphasizing  the  educational component of the tasting;\n- \u00b7 helping to prevent drink-driving after the visit.\n\nTo  obtain  'Responsible  Host'  badge,  each  Brand  Home  must undergo a two-phase verification process that ensures application of high standards. In FY23, most Brand Homes performed a selfassessment  of  their  compliance  with  the  standards  and  put  in place necessary remedies.\n\nIn  FY24,  upon  completion  of  the  self-assessment,  they  were audited by a mystery shopper, with findings assessed against all 18  criteria  by  an  independent  third-party,  The  Sustainable Restaurant Association.\n\nIn FY24, 16 out of 30 public-facing Brand Homes have been certified 'Responsible  Hosts'.  Among  the  pioneers  are  The  Glenlivet Distillery, Monkey 47 Distillery, Maison Yellow, TX Whiskey Ranch, Martell Visitor Center, Jameson Distillery Bow Street, and others.\n\nFor  the  upcoming  year,  the  Group  aims  to  enhance  external communications on this  initiative,  and  building  on  the  growing popularity of these unique places, improve consumer awareness of responsible drinking, reaching 10 million visitors by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  such,  the Group  is  committed  to  being  a  leader  in  sustainability,  setting high performance targets for itself while striving for transparency and  accountability  in  its  reporting.  These  commitments  are expressed  by  the  highest  levels  of  Group  management,  from the  dedicated  ESG  committees  to  direct  involvement  with  the Executive  Board  and  decision-making.  As  part  of  ensuring the right level of knowledge and leadership on ESG matters, the Group  dedicated  two  specific  learning  sessions  in  FY23  to accelerate engagement on these topics.\n\nThe first was Climate Leadership Day organised for its Executive Committee  members  to  discuss  and  agree  on  initiatives  with large-scale potential for increasing the Group's climate resilience and  implementation  roadmaps  in  relation  to  high-priority climate-related  issues.  The  second  was  a  meeting  organised  at Board  level  to  address  more  forward-looking  and  long-term issues with a three-fold session which focused on climate change, the future of crops and the possible futures anticipated for the world in the next 30/40 years.\n\nIn  FY24,  the  focus  has  been  on  CSRD,  ensuring  the  Board, Executive  Committee  and  Executive  Leadership  Team  have  a good  understanding  of  the  new  directive,  its  implications  for Pernod Ricard and how to implement it throughout the Group.\n\n## 3.6.1 Ensuring quality, food safety & product compliance\n\nPernod Ricard aims to provide only the highest quality of products to its customers and thus places particular importance on consumer health  and  safety.  These  commitments  drive  the  Group's  significant  efforts  to  prevent  the  risks  associated  with  alcohol  misuse (see  subsection  3.5.3  Raising  consumer  awareness  on  responsible  drinking)  as  well  as  its  stringent  and  proactive  food  safety  policy covering product design, sourcing, and manufacturing.\n\n## 3.6.1.1 Product safety control\n\nThe method implemented for consumer product safety control is that of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), which aims to  identify  all  potential  points  of  risk  in  the  manufacturing process in order to set up appropriate preventive measures.\n\nPernod Ricard ensures its operations comply with internationally recognised  standards,  with  all  Brand  Companies  producing  the Group's  Strategic  Brands  (see  Section  1,  subsection  1.3.1  'Our Brand Portfolio') being ISO 9001 certified, which represents 100% of the volume produced. Despite the Wines & Spirits segment's lower  exposure  to  food  safety  risks  than  others  in  the  food industry, the Group chose to go further by certifying its facilities to  the  ISO  22000  standard  (Food  safety  management  systems). Some facilities are also certified under the FSSC 22000 scheme, an extension of the existing ISO 22000 standard, on a proactive basis.\n\n|                                                                                               | FY23   | FY24   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| % of sites ISO 22000/FSSC 22000 certified by June of the fiscal year                          | 75%    | 75%    |\n| % ISO 22000/FSSC 22000 certified in volume produced covering all the Group's strategic brands | 100%   | 100%   |\n| % of Brand Companies producing Group's strategic brands certified ISO 9001                    | 100%   | 100%   |\n\n## 3.6.1.2 Quality standards & control\n\nPernod Ricard foremost priorities are to:\n\n- (i) ensure  its  products  comply  with  applicable  regulations  in each market; and\n- (ii) guarantee food safety for consumers.\n\nThe Group's industrial activities follow internal quality standards created in-house. They comprise various specific guidelines with the aim of controlling risks such as accidental product contamination or the presence of a foreign body in a bottle. These standards are audited as part of an internal cross-audit process.\n\nEvery two months, all affiliates receive a summary of the information gathered  by  the  Group's  continuous  food  law  and  food  safety monitoring, which helps them stay up to date on regulations and food safety risks. The Group also draws up a chemical analysis plan annually  for  its  main  products.  In  FY24,  it  covered  112  finished products and led to over 4,601 analyses being carried out.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Group  endeavours  to  ensure  full  product traceability  with  regards  to  GMOs (27) ,  in  strict  compliance  with labelling  regulations.  Accordingly,  all  affiliates  conduct  a  risk assessment to identify potential sources of raw materials, taking the  necessary  steps  to  ensure  their  control.  Although  the distillation  stage  eliminates  the  risk  that  GMO  material  may  be present in distilled products, the Group established supply chains of guaranteed GMO-free products for certain corn-based alcohols in the US and Europe.",

        "page_content": "## 3.6.1.3 Consumer complaint tracking & management\n\nThe Group uses an in-house system to record and track quality complaints from customers and consumers in real time. Currently, the system is an interactive web tool, Intelex (Loop application), which was launched in FY22 to replace the Complaint Management System (CMS) web tool dating from 2007. The Loop application has been connected to standardised Pernod Ricard public forms on all relevant websites to ensure consumers enjoy easy access to the means of providing feedback. To ensure a rapid response, the  system  immediately  informs  the  affiliate  in  question  so corrective  action  can  be  taken  and,  in  the  event  of  a  serious product  safety  concern,  immediately  informs  the  affiliate  Top Management and Headquarters as well.\n\nCrisis management procedures exist for each affiliate, particularly for  product  health  risk  involving  a  product  recall  if  necessary. These procedures are subject to regular testing, training for the employees involved, and updates. Quality indicators, including the complaints rate, are regularly presented to Senior Management.\n\n|                                                                                         | FY23   | FY24   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Number of complaints received  through the 'CMS/Intelex  (Loop)' during the fiscal year | 4,517  | 4,566  |\n\n## 3.6.2 Acting ethically\n\n## 3.6.2.1 Preventing corruption and anti -competitive practices\n\nIntegrity has long been a core value of Pernod Ricard, alongside the  belief  that  there  can  be  no  sustainable  business  success without it. The Group thus follows zero-tolerance policy with respect to corruption and all related misconduct, not only because it is an ethical requirement but also because it is a necessary precondition of trust with all its stakeholders. To ensure this stance holds true in  all  Group business dealings, Pernod Ricard Top Management strives to leads by example and offer employees the right tools including training and digital resources - to facilitate compliance with all relevant ethical and regulatory standards.\n\n## 3.6.2.1.1 Unambiguous tone from the top\n\nIn FY22, Pernod Ricard overhauled its Code of Business Conduct (28) , which applies to all Group employees, to make it more practical and easier to use, with a focus on clear messaging. It is endorsed and  prefaced  by  Chairman  &  CEO  Alexandre  Ricard,  reiterating the fact that a reputation for integrity and professionalism is the cornerstone  on  which  Pernod  Ricard  was  built  over  decades. These  high  standards  are  underpinned  by  the  Group's comprehensive  and  robust  anti-corruption  programme,  which the Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer is in charge of structuring and promoting.\n\n## 3.6.2.1.2 Corruption & influence peddling risk mapping update\n\nIn  FY22,  Pernod  Ricard  updated  its  Group  corruption  and influence peddling risk mapping through a wide-ranging project covering  the  Group's  full  perimeter  and  involving  more  than 1,440 employees and 300 workshops worldwide. The results were presented  to  the  Executive  Board,  the  Executive  Committee,  and the Audit Committee, to generate a new corruption and influence peddling  risk  map  that  is  an  accurate  reflection  of  the  Group's operational  and  geographical  realities.  The  resulting,  comprehensive programme  is  designed  to  protect  against,  detect  and  assess specific risks, as described below.\n\n## Prevention\n\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard's Code of Business Conduct: offering practical advice on how to behave in real life situations as well as who to contact  in  case  of  doubt,  the  new  version  of  the  Code  still includes a section covering anticorruption and business integrity in general, but also addresses a wide range of topics, including:\n- \u00b7 competition law,\n- \u00b7 prevention of insider trading and conflicts of interest,\n\n- \u00b7 health & safety,\n- \u00b7 diversity & inclusion,\n- \u00b7 speaking on social media,\n- \u00b7 data ethics,\n- \u00b7 harassment,\n- \u00b7 bullying,\n- \u00b7 confidentiality,\n- \u00b7 sustainability & responsibility;\n- \u00b7 Group anticorruption policy: in  accordance  with  the  French 2016  Sapin  II  law,  the  Policy  specifically  details  the  Group's rules to prevent, deter and detect public and private corruption and  influence  peddling  risks.  It  also  provides  employees  and stakeholders  with  clear,  pragmatic  examples  of  potentially sensitive situations;\n- \u00b7 Prior  verification  policy: third  parties  doing  business  with Pernod Ricard are subject to a due diligence process to determine their compliance risk profile (low, medium or high), allowing the Group  to  adjust  contractual  and  operational  relationships  to mitigate potential risks as appropriate. The procedure sets out various  levels  of  verification,  depending  on  the  initial  risk assessment  of  each  relationship  category,  as  identified  by Pernod  Ricard's  Sapin  II  risk  mapping  on  corruption  and influence peddling. This due diligence process is implemented via 'Partner  Up',  the  Group's  global  web-based  platform, where  any  employee  engaging  the  Group  in  a  business transaction  can  perform  appropriate  prior  verification  on  the concerned third parties;\n- \u00b7 Online training: employees receive training on all chapters of the Code of Business Conduct. A new mandatory e-learning was launched in 2023 to train employees on the updated version of the  Code,  following  a  'learning  by  doing'  approach.  The deadline  for  this  e-learning  completion  by  the  mandatory target  audience  was  31  December  2023.  It  now  forms  a mandatory  part  of  the  onboarding  pack  for  new  employees. Completion  is  digitally  monitored  and  completion  rate  at Group level on June 28, 2024 was 98%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  per  the protections  offered  to  whistle-blowers,  alerts  can  be  filed anonymously  (where  allowed  by  local  legislation)  and  the Group  promotes  a  clear  non-retaliation  policy  (subsection 3.7.1.3 'Whistle-blower system'). Pernod Ricard's whistleblowing policy is underpinned by 'Speak Up', a global whistleblowing line accessible to all worldwide (via the Internet or telephone), 24/7, in a wide variety of languages.\n- \u00b7 Internal control principles: they  apply  to  all  Group  affiliates and  specify  that  all  Pernod  Ricard  affiliates  must  comply, among other things, with the Pernod Ricard Code of Business Conduct  and  the  Procurement  Code  of  Ethics.  Each  year, Pernod  Ricard  sends  a  self-assessment  questionnaire  to  all affiliates wherein they must state whether they are compliant with Group policies. The reliability of the responses is confirmed in  a  letter  of  representation  signed  by  the  Chief  Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of each entity.\n\n## 3.6.2.2 Responsible lobbying\n\nAs  part  of  its  proactive  approach  to  issues  relating  to  its sustainability and responsibility commitments - from responsible drinking  to  sustainable  agriculture  -  and  due  to  its  status  as  a global leader in its industry, Pernod Ricard actively participates in public debates relating to the adoption of laws and regulations that  affect  its  activities.  The  Group  is  committed  to  proceeding with transparency and integrity in all these dealings and, as such, follows a strict policy on lobbying and influencing practices.\n\nGroup policy  on  lobbying  is  governed  by  the  Code  of  Business Conduct.  Following  its  update,  a  mandatory  e-learning  module was created for employees on the prevention of corruption and bribery. It contains specific rules on dealings with public officials in the chapter related to prevention of corruption. It also draws from more specific professional Codes (29) , with which Pernod Ricard complies.  Moreover,  Pernod  Ricard  ensures  compliance  with specific  laws  &  regulations  apply  across  the  countries  where  it operates. For instance, in France, the Group is registered on the list of interest representatives established by the High Authority\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\nhttps://www.hatvp.fr/fiche-organisation/?organisation=582041943#%2.\n\n## Control & assessment\n\n- \u00b7 The  Ethics  &  Compliance  Team  works  with  the  internal  audit team  to  support  the  compliance  audit  stream  in  the  annual audit cycle. Finally, internal audit is also tasked with monitoring Group  compliance  with  the  rules  in  place  to  fight  corruption and influence peddling.\n\n## Remediation\n\n- \u00b7 Each time a breach of the Code of Conduct rules is confirmed following an internal investigation, a wide range of remediations and  mitigating  measures  may  be  decided  by  management, including  disciplinary  sanctions  on  any  employee  responsible for  such  misconduct.  The  Group  promotes  a  zero-tolerance policy regarding breaches of internal rules and values and may -  in  accordance  with  local  labour  laws,  decide  to  apply sanctions up to termination of employment.\n\n## Prevention of anti-competitive practices\n\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard is committed to the public policy goals underpinning Competition  law  and  to  acting  lawfully  in  the  marketplace. Such  concerns  are  unambiguously  addressed  in  a  specific section of the Pernod Ricard Code of Business Conduct, under the  label  'Compete  fairly'.  The  e-learning  also  includes  a section on Competition law.\n\nfor  Transparency  in  Public  Life (30) and  equally  for  engagement with EU policy makers through the EU Transparency Register (31) It strictly complies with the various national reporting obligations regarding lobbying activities, notably in France, EU and the USA.\n\nOn the substance of the lobbying actions, a significant  focus  is placed on the promotion of public policies and regulations that are aligned with Pernod Ricard's S&R commitments, whether in terms  of  environmental  preservation  or  public  health.  This  is particularly true in Europe, where relevant regulations are more advanced. The Group's main lobbying objectives feature on the company's  website,  in  the  spirit  of  public  disclosure.  Pernod Ricard  conducts  much  of  the  lobbying  through  the  trade associations, with which are usually like-minded on many issues. To  the  extent  the  S&R  strategy  is  reviewed  by  the  Board  of Directors,  such  supervision  applies  by  extension  to  those lobbying  activities  that  seek  to  promote  the  S&R  commitments into public policies.",

For instance, it is a signatory to a best practices guide concerning parliamentary lobbying expenditure.\n\nPernod Ricard is also a proactive signatory of a declaration published on 25 February 2014, alongside seven other companies who are members of the Forum of Committed Companies set up by Transparency International France. This declaration is open to all companies,  business  federations,  professional  associations,  trade  unions  and  NGOs  (members  and  non-members  of Transparency  France's  Forum)  who  wish  to  show  leadership  through  their  ethics  and  corporate  social  responsibility commitments. This joint declaration on lobbying was strengthened and updated in May 2019, with new signatories reaffirming their commitments (1) .  As a result of this commitment and relationship, Pernod Ricard expanded the description of its advocacy priorities  and  positions  on  its  public  facing  website  this  year (2) .  This  provides  more  detail  to  the  public  as  to  the  public  policy options that Pernod Ricard promotes in its dealings with stakeholders.\n\n- (1) https://transparency-france.org/actu/declaration-commune-entreprises-membres-de-transparency-international-france-lobbying.\n- (2) https://www.pernod-ricard.com/en/our-group/our-role-society.\n\n## 3.6.2.3 Data protection\n\nProtecting and using personal data with respect is a pillar of the Group's  digital  transformation.  The  right  handling  of  personal data constitutes a business opportunity for Pernod Ricard to:\n\n- \u00b7 ensure the accuracy and relevance of the personal data it collects;\n- \u00b7 develop consumer, customer and employee trust;\n- \u00b7 secure brand image; and\n- \u00b7 continue to promote its culture of conviviality.\n\nIt is also an opportunity to rethink and optimise processes by adopting best practices on personal data subject's rights management, etc.\n\nThe  regulatory  framework  for  data  protection  that  applies  to Pernod  Ricard  is  complex  and  still  evolving.  Since  the  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018, many countries  and  regions  have  adopted  data  protection  laws  and regulations,  and  non-compliance  with  these  rules  may  expose the Group to sanctions.\n\n## 3.6.2.3.1 Global data protection strategy & governance\n\nPernod Ricard has implemented a strong data protection strategy and  governance.  The  Group  has  drafted  a  comprehensive  data protection  roadmap  and  works  daily  on  data  protection compliance,  in  parallel  with  specific  actions  to  address  local requirements where relevant.\n\nThe  Group  DPO  (Data  Protection  Officer)  and  the  Group's  data protection  network  enable  Pernod  Ricard  to  implement  data protection compliance actions, implement policies and procedures at local level, and share best practices.\n\nThis governance structure involves a wide range of stakeholders, including the Group DPO, local Privacy Champions, along with a Data  Protection  Committee  and  the  various  internal  business teams (TECH, marketing, HR, etc.).\n\n## 3.6.2.3.2 Employee engagement & upskilling\n\nAs a pillar of the Group's digital transformation, data protection is a matter that concerns everyone at Pernod Ricard. This is why Pernod Ricard places particular focus and effort on:\n\n- \u00b7 legal monitoring;\n- \u00b7 employee training (including with Group-wide training as well as both mandatory and tailored subject-specific trainings);\n- \u00b7 internal awareness campaigns; and\n- \u00b7 more generally on change management.\n\nIn  FY22,  the  new  version  of  the  Group's  Code  of  Business Conduct featured an updated dedicated section on the respectful use of personal data, featuring guidelines and recommendations for employees to refer to in their day-to-day work. The Group-wide, mandatory  employee  training  related  to  this  Code  of  Business Conduct now includes a Data Protection module. Other training modules that are tailored to the challenges and specific features of  each  employee's  field  of  activity  are  also  implemented.  This function-based customisation enables the Group to further data protection awareness and adoption.\n\n## 3.6.2.3.3 Customized tools and procedures\n\nThe Group has created various customized, user-friendly tools and procedures to ensure data protection compliance. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 comprehensive overarching documentation to ensure consistent implementation  of  data  protection  compliance  and  common standards. These are based on a global data protection golden rules and policy, along with detailed procedures, standard data protection clauses and toolkits;\n- \u00b7 data  protection  by  design  and  by  default  procedures  and processes  implemented  on  new  projects,  with  specific  data protection documentation on major projects;\n- \u00b7 questionnaires  to  assess  the  maturity  of  third  parties  and compliance level on data protection;\n- \u00b7 checklists and templates on specific topics such as handling data subject requests or handling potential personal data breaches.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Glass  and  cardboard  are  the  main materials  used  (over  95%  of  total  weight).  Plastic  packaging accounts  for  less  than  1%  of  primary  packaging,  and  Pernod Ricard  strives  to  limit  its  quantities,  as  demonstrated  by  its commitment  to  the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation's  vision  of \"The New Plastics Economy\", of which it is a signatory and partner.\n\nIn  addition  to  packaging  collection  programs  and  partnerships for recycling and reuse, Pernod Ricard is working to reduce waste in  the  Group's  operations.  The  Group's  waste  management policy is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 packaging collection programs and partnerships for recycling and reuse;\n- \u00b7 the reduction of waste in Group operations, whether packaging waste,  waste  from  the  processing  of  unrecycled  agricultural raw materials or waste from site activities.\n\n(For more information, please refer to section 3.4.3.2 Circularity: limiting and eliminating waste)\n\n## Focus on climate change impacts\n\nPernod Ricard's business is particularly vulnerable to its impacts on  terroirs,  impacting  yields  and  quality  of  raw  materials. Moreover, the Group generates emissions contributing to climate change in a range of ways:\n\n- \u00b7 directly, by using fossil fuels on sites (Scope 1) and consuming electricity that generates GHG emissions (Scope 2);\n- \u00b7 indirectly, through upstream and downstream activities (agricultural raw materials, packaging, logistics, etc.) (Scope 3).\n\nMitigating  and  adapting  to  climate  change  is  a  major  area  of focus  for  Pernod  Ricard's  environmental  policy.  In  may  2024,  a new set of targets aligned with 1,5\u00b0C Net Zero was validated by the SBTi, following the recommendation to set Forest Land and Agriculture (FLAG) targets:\n\n- \u00b7 In the near-term: Pernod Ricard commits to reducing absolute scope 1 & 2 emissions by 54% by FY30 from a FY22 baseline. The  Group  also  commits  to  reducing  absolute  scope  3  FLAG (forest, land and agriculture) emissions by 30.3% and non-FLAG emissions (purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution) by 25%.\n\nRegulated information\n\n- \u00b7 In the long term: Pernod Ricard commits to reducing its absolute scope 1 & 2 emissions and its scope 3 non-FLAG emissions by 90% by FY50 from a FY22 baseline. Pernod Ricard also commits to reducing absolute scope 3 FLAG emissions by 72%.\n\nA  decarbonisation  roadmap  has  been  defined  for  all  Group production  sites.  This  is  based  on  major  CapEx  projects  and renewable  energy  initiatives  implemented  at  the  main  Group distilleries. On Scope 3, the Group is working alongside its main suppliers  and  building  lasting  relationships  to  accelerate  their decarbonisation pathways, through e.g., co-constructing roadmaps and conducting pilots.\n\n(For  more  information,  please  refer  to  section  3.4.1.5  Ensuring business  resilience  through  a  decarbonisation  roadmap  and 3.4.1.6 Overview of Pernod Ricard's carbon footprint)\n\n## PROGRESS FY24:\n\n- \u00b7 distillery water  intensity decreased  due  to  water conservation projects;\n- \u00b7 group's  vineyards  significantly reduced  water  use through  precision  tools  like  drip  irrigation,  with  future focus on regenerative viticulture for drought resilience;\n- \u00b7 the Group achieved its replenishment targets, returning water to high-risk areas;\n- \u00b7 engagement  with  communities  to support water conservation  and  provide  or  improve  access  to  safe water and sanitation;\n- \u00b7 non-hazardous  waste  landfilled  increased,  mainly  in Argentina, due to the disposal of gape residues;\n- \u00b7 several sites achieved zero landfill waste, maintaining a sharp decline thanks to the Group's zero-waste policy;\n- \u00b7 implementation  of  multiple  watershed  protection  and restoration projects;\n- \u00b7 climate reports for top affiliates;\n- \u00b7 decarbonisation  pathways  established  for  key  terroirs, aligned with the regenerative agriculture framework.\n\n## OUTLOOK FY25:\n\n- \u00b7 investigate  and  roll-out  water  reduction  initiatives  at production sites, mainly at large distilleries;\n- \u00b7 update of the water stewardship strategy with a review levers and ambition;\n- \u00b7 participate  in  local  packaging  collection  and  recycling schemes to address packaging end-of-life;\n- \u00b7 strengthen  the  reporting  of  environmental  incidents  to ensure  the  traceability  of  mitigation  measures  to  be implemented.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each  of  these  ingredients  is grown in a terroir shaped by its unique characteristics in terms of climate,  soil  type,  ecosystems  and  the  know-how of the various local populations  and  communities.  This  represents  over 350 terroirs in some 60 countries.\n\nThe Group has set up a three-level action plan to identify risks in agricultural supply chains, meet its duty of vigilance and achieve its ambition of preserving its terroirs. This involves mapping the different terroirs (terroir mapping)  to  ensure  traceability, assessing  the  social  and  environmental  risks  on  these  terroirs, and implementing sustainable development programs according to their importance. The goal of covering 100% of key agricultural materials  by  this  risk  analysis  was  achieved  by  2023.  (For  more information, please refer to section 3.4.2.2 Mapping the Group's terroirs)\n\nPernod Ricard has developed a number of programs to manage the specific risks identified and provide the best possible support for its brands:\n\n- \u00b7 Adoption of the Key Principles of Sustainable Agriculture, which present  a  set  of  best  practices  to  guide  all  affiliates  in  the management of landscapes, biodiversity, plant health and soil life, water, human rights and relations with suppliers;\n- \u00b7 Program to certify its key raw materials according to sustainable agriculture specifications;\n- \u00b7 Development  of  regenerative  agriculture  and  biodiversity programs.\n\n## Focus on the fight against deforestation\n\nAs  part  of  its  new  set  of  targets  aligned  with  1,5\u00b0C  Net  Zero validated by the SBTi, Pernod Ricard commits to no deforestation across  its  primary  commodities  linked  to  deforestation  by  the end of 2025.\n\nWhile Pernod Ricard is not involved in operations that contribute significantly  to  deforestation,  analysis  is  underway  to  identify sensitive  areas  more  accurately.  This  will  enable  the  Group  to implement policy and plans to combat deforestation jointly with suppliers.\n\n(For  more  information,  please  refer  to  section  3.4.1.5  Ensuring business  resilience  through  a  decarbonisation  roadmap,  3.4.2.3 Sourcing  ingredients  sustainably and  3.4.2.4 Regenerative agriculture & biodiversity programmes).\n\n## PROGRESS FY24:\n\n- \u00b7 in-depth  evaluations  of  strategic  terroirs  following  full risk mapping of agricultural raw materials;\n- \u00b7 certification choices for terroirs reflecting local traditions and sustainable agriculture guidelines publication;\n- \u00b7 union for Ethical BioTrade membership to promote ethical sourcing and sustainability in flavouring ingredients;\n- \u00b7 partnership  with  the  Organisation  for  Biodiversity Certificates to develop a biodiversity index for ecosystem enhancement certification.\n\n## OUTLOOK FY25:\n\n- \u00b7 reduce greenhouse gas emissions and investigate carbon sinks in agriculture;\n- \u00b7 expand sustainable agriculture certifications for key crops;\n- \u00b7 seek alternatives where certification isn't feasible;\n- \u00b7 promote large-scale regenerative agriculture;\n- \u00b7 aid  farmers  with  agronomic,  financial  solutions,  and knowledge sharing.\n\n## Managing the risk of negative impacts on employee health and safety\n\nA global approach to health and safety has been adopted, covering all  aspects  of  the  physical  and  mental  health  of  all  employees, whether they work on a manufacturing site, in offices or as sales representatives.\n\nIt takes the form of:\n\n- \u00b7 a Global Health and Safety policy 'Taking Care of Each Other' since  2019  focusing  on  three  strategic  priorities:  Culture, Leadership and Performance;\n- \u00b7 implementation of prevention measures following a self -assessment  of  local  practices  both  on  industrial  and non -industrial sites;\n- \u00b7 LIFE (Life Threatening and Fatal Event) requirements covering a  wide  range  of  high-risk  activities  both  on  industrial  and non -industrial sites. A LIFE assessment programme performed by  third  parties  is  currently  underway  and  all  areas  of improvement  are  to  be  addressed  through  a  detailed  action plan;\n- \u00b7 Training and a network of health and safety champions;\n- \u00b7 OHSAS 18001 / ISO 45001 industrial site certifications.\n\nEmployee  online  training  on  alcohol-related  and  responsible drinking compulsory for all Group employees.\n\n(For  more  information,  please  refer  to  section  3.5.1.3  Health, safety  &  wellbeing  and  3.5.1.4  Educating  employees  on  alcohol and responsible drinking).\n\n## PROGRESS FY24:\n\n- \u00b7 strong impulse to mental health and wellbeing through the Mental Health First Aid programmes in some affiliates and the launch of the \"Be the One\" campaign across the Group, reinforcing the importance for employees to act at their own level in preserving the mental health, moral and physical health of employees;\n- \u00b7 for  sales  staff  and  brand  ambassadors,  rolling  out  of  a dedicated training to learn how to identify alcohol-related risks, prevent potentially conflictual situations, and behave in a professional and safe manner. A series of train-thetrainer  sessions  were  organised  this  year  to  onboard senior sales management, who will further cascade and facilitate this education within their teams.\n\n## OUTLOOK FY25:\n\n- \u00b7 expanding a network focused on mental wellbeing and peer-to-peer support at the Group HQ level to formally widen the Health & Safety scope to include mental health;\n- \u00b7 strengthening  its  H&S  culture  by  notably  continue rolling-out the 'Be the One' campaign and H&S training program  'Care  by  Learning'  through  a  pre-defined sequence modules for both industrial and non-industrial environments;\n- \u00b7 rolling-out of third party LIFE assessments on industrial and non -industrial sites.",

With regard to employee rights, an initial analysis of practices made it possible to mobilize the Human Resources community on these issues  in  2021  and  define  priorities  by  affiliates  (health  and safety, discrimination and diversity and inclusion).\n\nIn the first half of 2024, it was decided to strengthen the Group's overall  approach to human rights, in particular by appointing a Social  Sustainability  manager,  also  covering  human  rights,  and the  creation  of  a  dedicated  'Social  Sustainability'  centre  of expertise. This global approach complements existing actions on certain employee-related issues, notably linked to:\n\n- \u00b7 diversity & Inclusion, which includes actions in favour of gender diversity, disabled workers and the fight against discrimination and unconscious prejudice (for more information, please refer to section 3.5.1.1 Diversity & Inclusion (D&I));\n- \u00b7 employee compensation and social protection (please refer to section 3.5.1.2.1 Compensation and benefits for employees);\n- \u00b7 social dialogue (please refer to section 3.5.1.2.4 Social dialogue).\n\nPernod Ricard regularly organizes employee engagement surveys that  enable  employees  to  express  their  views  on  their  working conditions and define targeted action plans. These I Say surveys show the very high level of employee commitment. A pulse survey dedicated  to  well-being  enabled  the  collect  of  more  in-depth feedbacks from employees on subjects such as their perception of  work/life  balance  and  how  they  manage  stress  (to  find  out more, please refer to section 3.5.1.2.5 Employee engagement).\n\n## PROGRESS FY24:\n\n- \u00b7 organisation of a half-day capacity building on human rights with key head of functions at Pernod Ricard Headquarters facilitated by Shift;\n- \u00b7 creation  of  a  dedicated  Social  Sustainability  centre  of expertise and appointment of a Global Social Sustainability Manager to coordinate social sustainability commitments, provide  guidance  on  human  rights-related  issues  and support human rights due diligence and implementation.\n\n## OUTLOOK FY25:\n\n- \u00b7 reinforce the Group's human rights governance;\n- \u00b7 review  the  Global  Human  Rights  Policy  into  different policies  addressing  salient  human  right  risks  and  CSRD requirements;\n- \u00b7 progressively develop awareness activities for employees and develop a training plan to build capability for functions directly related to managing human rights;\n- \u00b7 develop an approach to conducting and rolling-out Human Rights Impact Assessments.\n\n(For  more  information,  please  refer  to  section  3.5.1.5   Acting  for Human Rights)\n\n## Managing the risk of negative impacts on consumers\n\nThe Group has put in place a responsible consumption strategy focused  on  the  fight  against  alcohol  abuse,  steered  by  the \"Alcohol  in  Society\"  team  within  the  Public  Affairs  Department and implemented throughout the Group via the network of S&R and Public Affairs managers.\n\nThe strategy's main lines of action are:\n\n- \u00b7 informing  consumers  about  the  contents  of  its  products  and the potential health risks associated with alcohol consumption;\n- \u00b7 responsible marketing and sales practices, including online sales;\n- \u00b7 brand campaigns promoting responsible consumer behavior;\n- \u00b7 or  the  encouragement  of  responsible  consumption  initiatives by these affiliates.\n\n(For  more  information,  please  refer  to  section  3.5.3  Raising consumer awareness on responsible drinking)\n\nWith  the  perspective  of  consumers'  health  and  safety,  Pernod Ricard  has  developed  a  strict,  proactive  food  safety  policy covering product design, sourcing and manufacturing, based on the following actions:\n\n- \u00b7 controlling product safety by identifying potential risk points in the  manufacturing process using the HACCP (hazard analysis critical control  point)  method,  and  certifying  Brands  in accordance with the best food standards;\n- \u00b7 industrial procedures based on quality standards and controls (ISO 22000) for food safety and product traceability with regard to GMOs;\n- \u00b7 the monitoring and handling of consumer complaints facilitated by  an  internal  system  for  recording  customer  and  consumer quality  complaints  in  real  time,  and  regularly  tested  crisis management procedures.\n\n(For  more  information,  please  refer  to  section  3.6.1  Ensuring quality, food safety & product compliance)\n\n## PROGRESS FY24:\n\n- \u00b7 annual chemical analysis plan for main products;\n- \u00b7 real-time in-house system for tracking quality complaints;\n- \u00b7 age, driving, and pregnancy warning logos on all products;\n- \u00b7 Global digital labels to inform consumers and encourage responsible drinking;\n- \u00b7 own Commercial Communications Code (CCC) to prevent irresponsible alcohol promotion.\n\n## OUTLOOK FY25:\n\n- \u00b7 ensure full product traceability with regards to GMO;\n- \u00b7 reinforce  existing  responsible  drinking  programs  and create a new strategy, shifting from risk management to making responsible drinking appealing to consumers;\n- \u00b7 develop  methods  to  measure  the  effectiveness  of responsible  drinking  campaigns,  including  pre-tests  for message clarity and influence on consumption moderation, with plans for robust post-test evaluations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  process  is  currently  being  overhauled  (Amazone project)  to  strengthen  the  support  of  medium  or  high  risks suppliers through mitigation plans.\n\nThe specific exercise of the duty of vigilance has been taken into account in strengthening the responsible purchasing approach; the need for a specific purchasing resource has been identified.\n\nThe  Blue  Source  process  includes  actions  throughout  the purchasing process:\n\n- \u00b7 supplier  Standards  which  set  out  the  Group's  commitments included  in  contracts  and  the  Group's  overall  Terms  and Conditions;\n- \u00b7 risk assessment of each supplier using a system of automated risk  calculation  questionnaires  (based  in  particular  on  the supplier's sector and country);\n- \u00b7 trigger measures to assess supplier practices, the intensity of which  depends  on  the  level  of  risk  identified  (from  Ecovadis assessments to SMETA audits);\n- \u00b7 corrective action plans and supplier monitoring.\n\n(For  more information, please refer to section 3.5.2.1 Procuring responsibly)\n\n## 3.7.1.4 The alert and reporting mechanism\n\nPernod Ricard fosters a culture of trust, openness and transparency, where  all  employees  and  stakeholders  can  fearlessly  express their concerns about the Group's activities. The Group's Code of Business  Conduct  includes  a  whistle-blowing  policy,  which  calls on  all  employees  and  other  stakeholders  to  report  any  ethical suspicions  they  may  have  regarding  practices  or  situations deemed contrary to or incompatible with the Pernod Ricard Code of Business Conduct, related policies or any laws or regulations.\n\nPernod Ricard's Ethics and Compliance team operates the Groupwide  Speak  Up  alert  line,  which  enables  stakeholders  to  report potential  inappropriate  behaviour  securely  and  confidentially. Hosted by an independent external service provider, this system is  available  on  line  or  by  phone,  24  hours  a  day,  7  days  a  week and in several languages. Any report deemed to be made in good faith may be investigated after prior assessment by the Integrity Committee. The website address is available on the intranet, in the Code of Business Conduct, and on the Pernod Ricard website: https://speakup.pernod-ricard.com.\n\nIf the allegations prove to be well-founded, the Integrity Committee or  its  local  delegate  examines  their  seriousness  and  makes recommendations  on  the  implementation  of  mitigation  and/or remediation  measures  and/or  the  use  of  disciplinary  measures against  implicated  persons.  Pernod  Ricard  also  has  a  zerotolerance  policy  with  regard  to  retaliation  against  any  person who, in good faith, makes a report (of inappropriate behaviour, for example) or assists in an investigation.\n\nIn 2022, as part of the review of the Group's Internal Rules and the enhancement of the Code of Business Conduct, a dedicated section regarding the Speak Up alert line and policy was added. To  ensure  the  documents  and  processes  were  comprehensive and  effective, the changes  were  presented  to  employee representatives of French affiliates during dedicated sessions.\n\n## PROGRESS FY24:\n\n- \u00b7 identification of duty of vigilance gaps and recommendations to  feed  existing  responsible  procurement  action  plan into a comprehensive roadmap for supplier vigilance.\n\n## OUTLOOK FY25:\n\n- \u00b7 review  of  the  Supplier  Standards  into  a  comprehensive Responsible  Procurement  Policy  with  regard  to  the future  challenges  of  the  duty  of  vigilance  and  CSRD requirements;\n- \u00b7 strengthen  overall  supplier  vigilance  approach  and governance  from  the  risk  identification  by  purchasing category and raw materials (in anticipation of the CSDDD directive) to supplier non-conformity control and monitoring procedures;\n- \u00b7 draw up reinforced action plans for high-risk purchases, starting with copackers;\n- \u00b7 explore the extension of the Integrity Committee and the review of the process to review alerts from the value chain.",

The  Group  remains  vigilant  as  to  the operational and commercial reality of its transactions and refuses to take part in any artificial tax arrangements.

By implementing a classification system  for  sustainable  activities,  the  new  regulation  aims  to redirect capital flows towards a more sustainable economy.\n\nUnder the Taxonomy Regulation, technical screening criteria are defined  to  identify  which  activities  significantly  contribute  to six major environmental objectives:\n\n- (i) climate change mitigation;\n- (ii) climate change adaptation;\n- (iii) sustainable use  and  protection  of  water  and  marine resources;\n- (iv) transition to a circular economy;\n- (v) pollution prevention and control; and\n- (vi) protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  reporting  companies  shall  provide financial  information  in  their  Universal  Registration  Document (URD) on activities that are Taxonomy-eligible (where the activity is  covered by the Taxonomy Regulation) for all 6 objectives and Taxonomy-aligned (where the eligible activity meets the technical screening  criteria  and  businesses  comply  with  the  minimum safeguards) under the two climate objectives (i) and (ii).\n\nTherefore, Pernod Ricard is required to publish Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs)  highlighting  the  proportion  of  its  Taxonomyeligible  and  Taxonomy-aligned  turnover,  capital  expenditures ('CapEx')  and  operating  expenditures  ('OpEx')  resulting  from products and services associated with economic activities defined as sustainable in Annexes I & II of the Climate Delegated Acts (35) .\n\n## Implementation of the EU Taxonomy at Pernod Ricard\n\nIn order to ensure Pernod Ricard understanding and compliance with the EU Taxonomy, a dedicated internal taskforce has been created, with experts from all the required teams (Sustainability, Finance,  Global  Engineering  &  Manufacturing  and  Procurement teams), who have worked for several months with external help from specialized consultants.\n\n## Presentation of the eligibility results\n\nThe  scope  of  calculation  of  the  Taxonomy  indicators  is  the consolidated financial perimeter as detailed in Note 7 Consolidation Scope in  subsection  6.6  'Notes  to  the  consolidated  Financial Statements'.\n\n## Turnover\n\nAfter  conducting  the  eligibility  assessment  for  the  Group's Turnover, one activity contributing to the two climate objectives has been identified: 13.2 Libraries, archives, museums and cultural activities .  This activity represents in FY24 less than 1% of Pernod\n\nTo  ensure  a  collaborative  approach  to  this  hybrid  project  that links finance to growing CSR expectations, the group was led by both financial and sustainability teams.\n\nRicard's  total  revenue.  Given  the  amount,  this  revenue  is  not reported for the FY24 Taxonomy reporting. Additionally, Pernod Ricard's  core  business,  related  to  the  manufacture  and  sale  of beverages, is at present not included in the Delegated Act.\n\nConsequently, the Group's eligible turnover represents 0% of its FY24  consolidated  turnover  (\u20ac11,598  million,  see  subsection  6.1 'Annual  Consolidated  Statements') (36) . Subsequently  to  this choice of not reporting eligible turnover for the exercise, turnover alignment with European Taxonomy activities is assessed to be 0%.\n\nAs required per the regulation, eligibility and alignment results can be summarized by objective as:\n\n|                                                                    | Proportion of turnover   | Proportion of turnover   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Objectives                                                         | Eligible                 | Aligned                  |\n| Climate change mitigation (CCM)                                    | 0%                       | 0%                       |\n| Climate change adaptation (CCA)                                    | 0%                       | 0%                       |\n| Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources (WTR) | 0%                       | N/A                      |\n| Transition to a circular economy (CE)                              | 0%                       | N/A                      |\n| Pollution prevention and control (PPC)                             | 0%                       | N/A                      |\n| Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems (BIO)    | 0%                       | N/A                      |\n\nPlease note that, for the FY24 exercise, alignment is not required beside Climate change mitigation (CCM) and Climate change adaptation (CCA) objectives.

As a result, it is deemed non-material and exempt from the calculation of  the  numerator  of  OpEx  KPI  as  permitted  by  regulation (39). Subsequently to this non-material nature of eligible OpEx for the exercise,  OpEx  alignment  with  European  Taxonomy  activities  is assessed to be 0%.\n\nAs required per the regulation, eligibility and alignment results can be summarized by objective as:\n\n|                                                                    | Proportion of OPex   | Proportion of OPex   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Objectives                                                         | Eligible             | Aligned              |\n| Climate change mitigation (CCM)                                    | 0%                   | 0%                   |\n| Climate change adaptation (CCA)                                    | 0%                   | 0%                   |\n| Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources (WTR) | 0%                   | N/A                  |\n| Transition to a circular economy (CE)                              | 0%                   | N/A                  |\n| Pollution prevention and control (PPC)                             | 0%                   | N/A                  |\n| Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems (BIO)    | 0%                   | N/A                  |\n\nPlease note that, for the FY24 exercise, alignment is not required beside Climate change mitigation (CCM) and Climate change adaptation (CCA) objectives.

To date, its implementation has reduced total energy consumption almost by half (48%) at Chivas Brothers' Glentauchers distillery, near Keith in Speyside, Scotland, reducing the  site's  total  carbon  emissions  by  53%  as  a  result.  Hoping  to provide insights that will benefit the industry at large if adopted at  other  suitable  distillation  sites,  Pernod  Ricard  and  Chivas Brothers, have chosen to make the expertise and learnings from the successful integration of enhanced heat recovery technologies 'open source.', while the Group's invested 43M\u20ac in this technology across its different affiliates in FY24.\n\nFocus on solar energy deployment and heat-pump installation: participating to activity 7.6 'Installation, maintenance and repair of  renewable  energy  technologies',  the  Group's  investment  in FY24 in renewable energy technologies, under the form of solar energy deployment and heat-pump installation, are also reflected in its European Taxonomy alignment results. For the exercise, the deployment of 1,325 kW of solar power on the Group's Nashik, Rocky and Behror sites in India, and the choice of Irish Distillers to  resort  to  a  heat-pump  based  system  for  the  upgrade  of  its Middleton  hot  water  network  therefore  qualify  as  a  significant contribution to the European Taxonomy climate change mitigation objective.\n\nIt  is  also  to  be  noted  that  other  significant  investments  directly aimed  at  improving  Pernod  Ricard's  environmental  footprint were  made  in  FY24  while  not  fitting  the  European  Taxonomy framework. Namely, Irish Distillers significant investment (0.3M\u20ac) in  a  rainwater  harvesting  project,  while  not  eligible  to  the currently  defined  European  Taxonomy  activities,  is  designed  to improve  Pernod  Ricard  current  local  water  usage  and  help  its path toward sustainability.\n\n## Substantial contribution criteria\n\nThe group has conducted the review of substantial contribution criteria for all identified eligible activities.\n\nFor  activity  6.5,  vehicles  abiding  by  applicable  Euro  6  emission standards or using an electric or plug-in hybrid propulsion were deemed to meet the substantial  contribution  criteria  related  to CO 2 emissions.\n\nIn the case of real estate assets (activities 7.1 and 7.7), the Group checked compliance with the technical screening criteria and, in particular,  for  criteria  related  to  nearly  zero-energy  building (nZEB).\n\nThe substantial contribution criteria for activities 7.3 and 7.6 are, respectively,  lists  of  energy  efficient  equipment  and  renewable energy technologies were assessed on a project per project basis. Similarly, the substantial contribution criteria for activity 4.8 was assessed  based  on  the  nature  of  bioenergy  used  by  identified projects,  as  well  as  their  characteristics  (rated  input,  energy efficiency, technologies used, and CO 2 emissions reduction associated).\n\nIn  the  case  of  activity  4.25,  substantial  contribution  criteria  was assessed  based  on  the  nature  of  the  technology  related  to projects identified, namely Mechanical Vapor Recompression.\n\nFinally, for activity 8.2, the nature of projects supported as well as climate  risks  assessment  performed  by  the  said  projects  were used to assess the substantial contribution.\n\n## Do Not Significant Harm (DNSH) adaptation to climate change\n\nTo report on the contribution to the objective of climate change mitigation,  the  Group  has  carried  out  a  Taxonomy-compliant climate risk and vulnerability assessment in 3 steps:\n\n- 1. analysis of the exposure of the Taxonomy-eligible activities to physical climate risks.\n- 2. assessment of  physical  climate  risks  according  to  scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.\n- 3. implementation and assessment of adaptation solutions.\n\nOther  applicable  DNSH  were  appreciated  according  to  Pernod Ricard's  methodology  by  assessing  all  required  DNSH  criteria linked to an investigated project.\n\n## Minimum safeguards\n\nMinimum safeguards were reviewed at Group level, in light of the requirements of the Platform on Sustainable Finance's report on minimum safeguards (40) published  in  October  2022,  in  terms  of human  rights,  consumer  interest,  anti-corruption,  responsible taxation and competition laws.\n\nTo be compliant with minimum safeguards, the Group continuously improves its procedures to ensure the alignment with the OECD Guidelines  for  Multinational  Enterprises,  the  United  Nations Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights,  the  United Nations International Bill of Human Rights and the fundamental instruments  identified  in  the  Declaration  of  the  International Labour Organisation (ILO) on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.",

        "page_content": "## Links to S&R achievements & initiatives\n\nPernod Ricard's strong climate, biodiversity and circular economy commitments  are  fully  embedded  in  its  S&R  strategy  'Good Times  from  a  Good  Place'  which  covers  the  entire  value  chain, from  grain  to  glass.  The  Group  would  like  to  highlight  the  fact that  significant  sustainability  initiatives  launched  by  Pernod Ricard  do  not  necessarily  fall  under  the  definition  in  the Taxonomy Regulation. As a result,  Taxonomy  KPIs  are  not  fully reflecting the Group's progress towards sustainability objectives, as its ambitious 2030 roadmap is aligned with the UN SDGs (41) .\n\n## Priority ambition to combat climate change\n\nPernod Ricard makes it a priority to fight climate change. This is translated into the ambitious carbon reduction targets set by the Group, aligned with the Science-Based Targets Initiative.\n\nPernod  Ricard  reviewed  in  FY24  its  carbon  reduction  objectives following latest FLAG (Forest, Land and Agriculture) guidance. Its near  and  long-term  science-based  GHG  emissions  reduction targets in line with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory have been validated by the Science  Based  Targets  initiative  (SBTi).  For  Scopes  1  and  2,  the Group's target is to reduce its emissions by 54% by 2030 from its FY22 base year. This will mainly be achieved through investment in new energy-related technologies in Group distilleries, such as mechanical vapour recompression in Ireland (Irish Distillers) and Scotland (Chivas Brothers). In FY24, Pernod Ricard invested 43M\u20ac CAPEX  in  this  technology.  In  addition,  the  Group  is  building  a distillery  and  ageing  facilities  in  Marion  County,  Kentucky,  that aims  at  being  carbon  neutral.  In  parallel,  the  Group  will  switch globally  to  renewable  electricity  sources  by  2025,  following  the Group commitment to RE100 (42) .\n\nFurthermore,  in  2022,  the  Group  launched  its  inaugural 'sustainability-linked'  bond  (SLB)  issue  for  \u20ac750  million.  This transaction  is  indexed  to  two  environmental  commitments  on carbon (Scopes 1 and 2 absolute reductions from FY18 base year) and reduction of its water consumption in its distilleries per unit of alcohol produced.\n\nSince then, and based on the same targets, in October 2022, the Group signed its second SLB, setting the terms for a new eurodenominated bond issuance for an aggregated principal amount of \u20ac1.1  billion.  In  May  2023,  the  Group  signed  its  first sustainability  linked  RCF  (Revolving  Credit  Facility)  totalling \u20ac2.1 billion to refinance an existing facility expiring in June 2024 ahead of time.\n\nPernod Ricard is also focused on reducing its Scope 3 emissions, which  are  indirectly  generated  by  the  Group  and  its  suppliers. Carbon  reduction is now  fully integrated into business\n\ndiscussions  with  glass  manufacturers,  in  order  to  ensure  they commit  to  lower  carbon  emissions  for  their  supplies  to  the Group.  Together  with  its  regenerative  agriculture  engagement, this will contribute to achieving the Group's commitments:\n\n- \u00b7 no  deforestation  across  its  primary  commodities  linked  to deforestation by the end of 2025;\n- \u00b7 reducing absolute scope 3 FLAG (forest, land and agriculture) emissions by 30.3% and non-FLAG emissions (purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution) by 25% by FY30;\n- \u00b7 reducing  its  absolute  scope  1  &  2  emissions  and  its  scope  3 non-FLAG emissions by 90% by FY50 from a FY22 baseline;\n- \u00b7 reducing absolute scope 3 FLAG emissions by 72% by FY50.\n\nThe KPIs of the Group's Taxonomy-eligible turnover, Capex and Opex  are  expected  to  increase  when  the  Manufacture  of  Food and Beverage will be added to the Delegated Regulations.\n\n## Projects to contribute to circular economy transition and biodiversity protection\n\nPernod Ricard's commitment to protect biodiversity is reflected in its strong regenerative agriculture engagement. The ambition of the Group is to have a positive impact in all its main 'terroirs', where raw materials are sourced. In its vineyards, Pernod Ricard local affiliates are testing regenerative practices, restoring life in the  soil  and  in  the  ecosystem.  Projects  are  being  initiated  with farmers  to  develop  alternative  ways  to  grow  cereals  or  other crops  used  by  the  Group  that  have  a  positive  impact  on biodiversity and farming resilience.\n\nFurthermore, Pernod Ricard supports various projects in the field of  circular  economy,  including  the  investment  in  ecoSPIRITS,  a circular economy technology startup focusing on low carbon, low waste  distribution  systems  for  the  premium  wine  and  spirits industry. In FY23, Pernod  Ricard's  venture  capital  fund, Convivialit\u00e9 Ventures has taken a minority share in ecoSPIRITS, a circular economy technology startup focusing on low carbon, low waste  distribution  systems  for  the  premium  wine  and  spirits industry.  In  FY24,  Pernod  Ricard  and  ecoSPIRITS  announced entering a new stage in their relationship with a five-year global licensing agreement to enable the distribution of Pernod Ricard's spirits  brands  in  ecoSPIRITS'  circular  packaging  technology  to on -trade venues around the world.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It relates to the period from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024.\n\nRegarding the mandatory themes set out in Article L225-102-1 of the  French  Commercial  Code  related  to  the  Non-Financial Performance  Statement  (NFPS),  prepared  in  accordance  with European  Directive  2014/95/EU  on  the  Non  Financial  Reporting Directive (NFRD):\n\n- \u00b7 Animal welfare: Pernod  Ricard  is  committed  to  not  funding, conducting, or commission any animal testing, unless they are explicitly required by law. This engagement is extended to the Group's suppliers.\n- \u00b7 Sport  activities: Pernod  Ricard  encourages  its  employees  to take part in sports. For example, it offers its employees at the HQ gym classes and subsidises sport activities.\n- \u00b7 Regarding  Nation  and  Army  link,  there  are  no  specific initiatives to report.\n\n## Scope of social reporting\n\nThe  social  analysis  in  this  report  is  based  on  all  Group  entities reporting  data  for  their  employees  for  the  relevant  period. When  the  Group  acquires  full  ownership  of  a  new  entity,  its corporate  HR  data  is  included  in  full  in  the  figures  during  the following fiscal year at the latest. At the end of each fiscal year, the list of entities within the Group's social reporting is compared to  the  financial  reporting  list  to  ensure  completeness.  In  FY24, reporting covered 143 entities with employees during the year.\n\nThe scope of consolidation and level of detail for corporate data have  changed  since  FY19.  Social  data  is  no  longer  reported by  affiliate  but  by  legal  entity.  Employees  are  included  in  the headcount  of  the  legal  entity  with  which  they  have  an employment contract.\n\nThe following entities are inactive in Workday but still existing for historical  data  review.  These  entities  have  no  headcount  at  the end  of  the  fiscal  year  and  have  had  no  employee  movements in FY24:\n\n- \u00b7 Lillet SAS - merged with Pernod-Ricard France during FY23.\n- \u00b7 The Whisky Exchange - whose structure changed in FY24. The following entities were updated in FY24:\n- \u00b7 Del Maguey - fully owned by Pernod Ricard since FY23 - first year of reporting.\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard Margarita C.A. - fully owned by Pernod Ricard since FY23 - first year of reporting.\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard Marketing USA merged with Pernod Ricard USA LLC during FY24.\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard IP Management merged with Pernod Ricard USA LLC during FY24.\n- \u00b7 Absolut  Elyx  Spirits  USA  LLC  merged  with  Pernod  Ricard  USA LLC during FY24.\n- \u00b7 Distilled Innovation AB merged with The Absolut Company on June 1 st 2024.\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard Czech Republic has been created on April 1 st , 2024 as part of sell of Becherovka brand (Jan Becher).\n- \u00b7 Jan Becher - sold in FY24.\n- \u00b7 8degrees - sold in FY24.\n- \u00b7 Domaine Jean Martell - All employees have been transferred to Martell on 01/10/2023.\n- \u00b7 Le  Maine  au  Bois  -  All  employees  have  been  transferred  to Martell on 01/10/2023.\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard Namibia - closed during the FY24.\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard Asia Duty Free Ltd - Service Team - phase out as part of organisation evolution - empty January 2024.\n- \u00b7 Seagram China - phase out as part of organisation evolution empty February 2024.\n- \u00b7 DrinksAndCo Marketplace S.L.U. - closed during the FY24.\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard Lanka - closed during the FY24.\n- \u00b7 ABV  Global  -  first  year  of  reporting  as  part  of  the  structure change for The Whisky Exchange.\n- \u00b7 SDL - first year of reporting as part of the structure change for The Whisky Exchange.\n- \u00b7 The Whisky Experience - first year of reporting as part of the structure change for The Whisky Exchange.\n- \u00b7 Whisky Auction - first year of reporting as part of the structure change for The Whisky Exchange.\n\nIn FY24 the Pernod Ricard Group changed its global governance structure.  Company  hierarchy  was  impacted  to  reflect  this  new setup:\n\n- \u00b7 The former EMEA-LATAM and ASIA-PACIFIC regions were removed to  enable  a  closer  relationship  with  a  set  of  10  Management entities  (ME)  for  Market  Companies:  Pernod  Ricard  Latin America,  Pernod  Ricard  Northern  Europe,  Pernod  Ricard Southern  Europe,  Pernod  Ricard  Central  &  Eastern  Europe, Pernod Ricard China, Pernod Ricard India, Pernod Ricard Asia Pacific,  Pernod  Ricard  Africa  &  Middle  East,  Pernod  Ricard Global  Travel  Retail.  Legal  entities  were  reassigned  from former  organization  to  the  new  one.  Pernod-Ricard  North America remains a separate Management Entity at the same level as the 9 new ones listed above.\n- \u00b7 Group  wines  business  includes  the  affiliates  Bodegas  Tarsus and  Pernod  Ricard  Winemakers  Spain,  based  in  Spain,  and Pernod  Ricard  Winemakers  Kenwood  and  Pernod  Ricard Winemakers  Mumm  Napa,  based  in  the  United  States. A  distinction  is  made  between  Brand  Companies  and  Market Companies  for  Australia  and  New  Zealand  resulting  in  two entities  for  each  country.  Local  market  companies  are  now integrated  into  the  Management  Entity  Pernod  Ricard  Asia Pacific.\n- \u00b7 No changes were performed on company hierarchy for Brand Companies except for the creation of The Absolut Group (TAG), which expands previous scope of The Absolut Company to the entities for Gin brands in the Pernod-Ricard Group (The Kyoto Distillery and Black Forest Distillers)\n\nThe social reporting indicators are selected to provide the Group with  a  reliable  and  accurate  picture  of  its  global  footprint.  The data  collected  enables  Pernod  Ricard  to  be  increasingly  socially responsible in respect of its employees worldwide.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Are excluded from this  analysis:  A&P  (Advertising  &  Promotions),  IT,  Business Services, Travel, Co-packing and Manufacturing (incl. Logistics).\n\nThis  perimeter  also  focuses  only  on  37  Pernod  Ricard  entities which are: Chivas, Corby, Global Travel Retail (Asia, Dom Rep, US), Havana  Club,  Irish  Distillers,  Jan  Becher,  MMPJ,  PR  Argentina, PR Brasil,  PR  China,  PR  Deutshcland,  PR  Espana,  PR  Finland,  PR France, PR Hellas & Kam, PR HQ (preferred suppliers), PR India, PR Italia,  PR  Japan,  PR  Korea,  PR  Mexico, PR Portugal, PR South Africa,  PR  Turkey,  PR  UK,  PR  NA  (USA,  Hiram  Walker  &  Sons, Ungava  Spirits),  PRW  Australia,  PRW  New  Zealand,  PRW  China (Helan Mountain), PRW Spain, PRW USA, TAC, Wyborowa, Yerevan Brand Company.\n\nThe other entities are excluded from this perimeter because they purchase low volumes of the above purchasing categories and do not  have  the  dedicated  Procurement  resources  to  manage the spend.\n\nA continuous effort to clean up the supplier database was carried out  this  year,  reducing  the  number  of  suppliers.  This  explains the  lower  figures  this  fiscal  year,  which  represent  a  higher percentage of suppliers in the scope.\n\nIndicators relating to responsible drinking cover all Pernod Ricard affiliates (Brand Companies and Market Companies). When several affiliates are located in the same country, the implementation of the S&R strategy and the associated action plans may be carried out by a single affiliate.\n\n## 3.9.1.2 Clarification on indicators\n\n## Social indicators\n\n## Headcount\n\nFor headcount repartition, an additional view is implemented in order  to  see  aggregated  data  by  geographical  areas  (based  on default location from company):\n\n- \u00b7 Europe,  Middle  East  &  Africa :  Andorra,  Angola,  Armenia, Austria,  Belarus,  Belgium,  Bulgaria,  Croatia,  Czech  Republic, Denmark,  Estonia,  Finland;  France;  Germany;  Ghana;  Greece, Hungary,  Ireland,  Italy,  Kenya,  Latvia,  Lithuania,  Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania,  Russian  Federation,  Serbia,  Slovakia, Slovenia,  South  Africa,  Spain,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom.\n- \u00b7 Asia & Pacific: Australia, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia,  Japan,  Kazakhstan,  Korea,  Malaysia,  New  Zealand, Philippines, Republic of Union of Myanmar, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam.\n- \u00b7 Americas (included  LATAM):  Argentina,  Brazil,  Canada,  Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, United States of America, Uruguay, Venezuela.\n\nAverage headcount is calculated in terms of full-time equivalents, without  taking  account  of  short-term  employee  absences. Long -term absences involving contract suspensions are reflected in the calculation of the FTE.\n\nSince FY19, employees are included in the headcount of the legal entity with which they have an employment contract. Expatriates and seconded employees are included in the headcount of their host affiliates.\n\nPernod  Ricard  China  employees  are  accounted  for  as  staff  on permanent  contracts.  Chinese  employment  contracts  have  a statutory term and are only converted into permanent contracts\n\n## Scope of environmental reporting\n\nPernod  Ricard's  environmental  reporting  relates  to  industrial sites  and  vineyards  under  the  Group's  operational  control  on 30  June  in  the  financial  year  in  question  and  operational throughout  the  year.  It  does  not  cover  logistics  warehouses outside industrial sites (only involves a few isolated warehouses). Offices'  (administrative  sites  -  head  offices  or  sales  offices) environmental  impact  reported  here  relates  to  their  energy consumption  and  use  of  renewable  electricity  only.  The integration of new sites in the environmental reporting perimeter (acquisitions or commissioning of new sites) starts only after one full fiscal year of activity.\n\nThe FY24 reporting covers 94 industrial sites, comprising 2 new sites and 2 sites removed since FY23. The industrial scope for this financial year therefore covers:\n\n- \u00b7 a  production  volume of 1,002 million litres  (finished  products either bottled or in bulk), compared with 1,117 million in FY23; and\n- \u00b7 a  volume  of  distilled  alcohol  of  265  million  litres  in  FY24, compared with 298 million litres in FY23.\n\nThis  year,  due  to  unavailable  data,  GHG  emissions  linked  to indirect procurement have been estimated based on FY23 data, corrected  using  the  percentage  of  evolution  of  the  global turnover of the group.\n\nafter a number of years. However, given the specific characteristics of  employment legislation in China, Pernod Ricard considers its employees to be permanent staff. Due to the characteristics  of local labour laws, the same rule applies to Pernod Ricard Minsk employees, as the concept of fixed-term contract does not exist in Belarus.\n\nWork-study  contracts  (apprenticeship  contracts  and  training contracts)  are  not  counted  as  fixed-term  contracts.  This  also applies to work placement students, temporary workers and VIE programme volunteers.\n\nHeadcount and FTE calculations consider employees leaving the Group  on  the  last  day  of  the  fiscal  year  as  active.  The  related termination  events  are  then  included  in  the  next  fiscal  year  to calculate departure rates & turnover.\n\nThe definition for the 'Top Management' classification refers to employees from COMEX to Band C job levels.\n\nThe definition of 'Middle Management' classification as part of the gender representation figures was added in FY24 and reflects solely employees with Band D job levels.\n\n## FTE: calculation methodology\n\nThe  updated  method  incorporates  finer  calculations  to  ensure greater  accuracy  in  determining  FTE  numbers.  Now  the  FTE formula accounts for the total worked calendar days calculated for each month of the fiscal year:\n\nFTE calculated = [(Total worked calendar days in the selected Month) / (Total calendar days in the selected Month) * FTE% of the selected Month + \u2026 (for each Month)]/12",

        "page_content": "## Absenteeism\n\nThe absenteeism rate is calculated based on the theoretical number of hours and working days worked per year. Maternity/paternity/ parental leaves are included in the absenteeism rate.\n\n## Health & Safety\n\nThe number of accidents and subsequent calendar days lost are set  against  the  annual  full  time  equivalent  for  both  permanent employees & temporary workers.\n\nAdditionally,  and  in  line  with  the  Group  H&S  policy,  newly acquired companies are only included in their second full fiscal year for:\n\n- \u00b7 frequency/severity rates for workplace accidents;\n- \u00b7 number with lost time; and\n- \u00b7 number of fatalities.\n\nCommuting accidents are not included in accident numbers. They are thus not used to calculate frequency and severity rates.\n\nDoubtful cases of lost-time accidents are requested to be reported by each affiliate and are reviewed quarterly by a H&S Committee composed  of  HQ  H&S  Director  and  manager,  Brand  Co  H&S managers  and  Market  Co  H&S  coordinators  requesting  that  a case  be  reviewed.  Exclusion  of  doubtful  cases  can  be  decided when  the  work-relatedness  is  excluded  and  based  on  the  H&S reporting protocol rules.\n\nThe calculation method of Accident Frequency Rate is based on the number of permanent and temporary employees declared by all  affiliates  and  these  data  are  externally  certified  on  time  per year. It's a way to insure that Pernod Ricard's Accident Frequency Rate cover 100% of the employees concerned.\n\n## Training\n\nTraining hours rules have been harmonised:\n\n- \u00b7 when available, actual hours will be used;\n- \u00b7 when  the  hours  are  not  available/tracked  (e.g.,  for  some e -learning) 1hr will be used by default.\n\nFor the training salaries costs, the required hourly rate is calculated as following: [Total theoretical gross salary including employer's social  contributions  for  the  concerned  employee]  divided  by [Theoretical number of worked days per year per employee] divided by [Theoretical number of worked hours per day for employee].\n\nFor  future-fit  training,  the  definition  of  relevant  items  was reviewed  to  better  identify  learning  actions  designed  to  equip employees with the skills, knowledge, and capabilities needed to thrive in the future workplace and prepare them for anticipated changes in technology, business practices, and job requirements. This broader description lead to a significant increase in the total number  of  employees  concerned.  Corresponding  data  for  the fiscal  year  2024  recover  employees  who  attended  at  least  1 future-fit training during the last twelve Months.\n\n## Gender: breakdown criteria\n\nWhen  available,  indicators  based  on  gender  will  focus  on  the values 'Female' and 'Male' only, based on information provided by  local  affiliates.  For  employees  registered  as  'Other'  or  'Not declared'  (0.001%  of  global  workforce),  corresponding  figures will  be  aggregated  to  the  'Female'  values  until  technical  and governance  framework  is  reviewed  as  part  of  future  D&I initiatives within the group.\n\nMethodology & third-party verification\n\n## Turnover\n\nTurnover refers to the rate at which employees leave an organization over a specified period.\n\nIt  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  total  count  of  departures  by  the average Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) over the fiscal year.\n\nIn  mathematical  terms,  if  'D'  represents  the  total  number  of departures and 'FTE' represents the average Full-Time Equivalent over the year, the turnover can be represented as:\n\nTurnover = FTE/D\n\nFor  FTE  calculation  methodology,  please  refer  to  the  dedicated section.  For  the  count  of  departures,  all  types  of  departures leading  to  the  end  of  the  employment  contract  during  the reference period are taken into account.\n\nThis calculation provides a ratio that represents the proportion of employees  who  have  left  the  organization  in  relation  to  the average number of employees (FTE) over the year. A higher turnover rate may indicate a higher level of employee dissatisfaction, while a  lower  rate  may  suggest  a  more  stable  workforce.  It's  an important metric for understanding the health and stability of an organization.\n\n## Societal indicators\n\n## Responsible Procurement\n\nRegarding Responsible Procurement information, the global data are  extracted  from  Partner  Up  tool.  As  part  of  the  launch  of Partner Up in 2020, a spend threshold have been implemented for  all  Pernod  Ricard  entities  (\u20ac75,000  annual  spend).  Some suppliers  are  excluded  from  Partner  Up  platform  because  the tool  is  not  fully  deployed  or  cannot  be  deployed  in  these countries: China, Brazil (for Brazil, only non-Brazilian third parties are created on Partner Up), Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Cuba (where only suppliers outside of Cuba are entered in Partner Up). In this case, the list of suppliers is reported manually to Pernod Ricard Headquarters via and Excel sheet report.\n\nRegarding  the  calculated  indicators:  only  active  suppliers  are considered  (active  supplier:  doing  business  with  Pernod  Ricard for the last two years; beyond two years and without any activity, the supplier is considered inactive):\n\n- 1. having  signed  the  Supplier  Standards:  number  of  active suppliers  who  have  signed  the  Supplier  Standards  (using Partner Up or outside Partner Up);\n- 2. analysed  using  the  Risk  Mapping  tool:  number  of  active suppliers who have been analysed by the Risk Mapping Tool (using Partner Up or outside Partner Up);\n- 3. identified  as  risky  (high  or  medium  risk):  number  of  active suppliers identified with high or medium risk (results of the Risk Mapping Tool);\n- 4. identified  as  risky  and  covered  by  an  EcoVadis  assessment: number of active suppliers, identified as risky (high or medium) and  evaluated  by  EcoVadis  (valid  evaluation,  expired evaluation excluded);\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  January  2022,  the  Group  stopped  its  membership  of  the  AIM Progress initiative.\n\n## Digital Labels\n\nThe  KPIs  related  to  the  digital  labels  have  been  calculated excluding 2 markets:\n\n- \u00b7 India:  the  implementation  of  digital  labels  in  India  will  take longer  than  in  other  markets,  as  it  is  linked  to  a  long  and complex  process  of  state-by-state  regulatory  validation  of labels. In FY24, this represented around 33% of total labels.\n- \u00b7 China:  the  digital  labels  were  ready  to  be  deployed  in  China, but a new draft of local regulations required the project had to be put on hold, in order to understand the implications of new regulations  on  the  Pernod  Ricard  digital  labels.  In  FY24,  this represented around 7% of total labels.\n\n## Bar World Of Tomorrow\n\nThe  number  of  bartenders  and  bar  owners  trained  to  the  Bar World of Tomorrow (BWOT) correspond to the total consolidated number of training sessions completed, since the official launch in 2020.\n\n## Environmental indicators\n\n## Production indicators\n\nThe Group footprint on agricultural land is assessed by the areas on  which  purchased  agricultural  raw  materials  are  used.  These equivalent  areas  are  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  agricultural yields  of  the  various  materials  used  by  the  Group (44) . For transformed  products,  industrial  yields  are  also  used  to  assess the quantity of agricultural materials purchased.\n\nIn FY24, regenerative agriculture and biodiversity programs have been accounted based on direct affiliates as defined in FY23 and previous  fiscal  years,  to  ensure  continuity  and  comparability  of performance over the years.\n\nThe  number  of  farmers  empowered,  trained  or  supported  are accounted taking into consideration the total number throughout the years, not referring exclusively to FY24.\n\nThe ratio of key raw materials covered by sustainable certifications is calculated based on the annual spent.\n\nSite  environmental  performance  is  expressed  using  various ratios. These depend on the business category used by the Group to classify sites:\n\n- \u00b7 distilleries:  data  broken  down  by  volumes  of  pure  distilled alcohol;\n- \u00b7 bottling sites: data broken down by volumes of bottled finished products;\n- \u00b7 wineries: data broken down by volumes made into wine;\n- \u00b7 vineyards:  data  broken  down  by  surface  area  cultivated  with vines.\n\nAt  Group  level,  consolidated  performance  is  expressed  based either on:\n\n- \u00b7 the  amount  of  distilled  alcohol  for  environmental  impact primarily due to distillation (e.g., water or energy consumption), expressed in units per thousand litres of pure distilled alcohol (kl PA);\n- \u00b7 the bottled volume or the volume of finished products manufactured (including  products  delivered  in  bulk)  when  bottling  or production is the main source of impact (such as in the case of solid waste), expressed in units per thousand litres (kl);\n- \u00b7 the number of hectares occupied by vineyards for agricultural properties, expressed in units per hectare (ha).\n\nFor  industrial  sites,  this  distinction  is  sometimes  complex,  as some sites have several activities. As such, since the time frames involved in bottling may sometimes differ widely from those for distilling (aged spirits: whiskies, cognac, etc.), these figures may be  difficult  to  interpret  from  year  to  year.  Both  calculation methods are therefore presented for some indicators.\n\nSetting  overall  Group  quantitative  targets  for  the  quantity  of water  or  energy  consumed  per  unit  produced,  for  example, becomes complex as the consolidation of targets depends on the business  mix  during  the  year  and  the  consolidated  indicator chosen. For that reason, the performance captured by indicators should be used with care and interpreted over the long-term.\n\n## Water indicators\n\nThe  Water  Risk  Assessment  is  done  using  the  Aqueduct  Water Risk  Atlas,  a  tool  developed  by  the  World  Resources  Institute (WRI). The Internal Water Risk Index (IWRI) is calculated based on the blended rating from three Aqueduct indicators:\n\n- \u00b7 overall Water Risk;\n- \u00b7 baseline Water Stress;\n- \u00b7 2030 projected Water Stress - projected using a 'Business as Usual' scenario.\n\nFour water risk levels are defined as a result of 'Internal Water Risk Index' analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 extremely high-risk, sites with an IWRI of over 4;\n- \u00b7 high-risk, sites with an IWRI between 3 and 4;\n- \u00b7 medium-risk, sites with an IWRI between 2 and 3;\n- \u00b7 low-risk, sites with an IWRI under 2.\n\nSites  from  the  top  two  risk  levels  (i.e.,  IWRI  of  3  or  higher)  are required  to  replenish  their  water  consumption  through  water projects.  Dedicated  co-packers  only  include  bottling  process activities  with  at  least  90%  of  production  volume  relating  to Pernod Ricard. The water quantities replenished through projects in  place  are  consolidated  at  country-level  and  for  watersheds with the same level of risk.\n\n## Energy indicators\n\nThe  definitions  for  'renewable  energy  consumption'  and 'renewable  electricity  consumption'  were  reviewed  following the  FY19  publication  to  be  aligned  with  RE100  requirements. Since FY20:\n\n- \u00b7 total renewable electricity consumption is calculated using the portion covered by green or renewable energy certificates plus renewable electricity produced and used on site;\n- \u00b7 total  renewable  energy  consumption  is  calculated  using  total renewable  electricity  consumption  plus  other  renewable energy used on site (biogas, biofuel, etc.).",

        "page_content": "## Carbon indicators\n\n## Scopes 1&2\n\nScopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions include all Pernod Ricard production sites, offices  and  vineyards  entitled  to  the  environmental reporting  during  the  current  fiscal  year  (see  subsection  3.9.1 'Methodology note on non-financial reporting').\n\n## It excludes:\n\n- \u00b7 emissions from refrigerants: the Group has been working on the complete elimination of CFCs and HCFCs, last assessment confirmed they are not significant (<1%),\n- \u00b7 nitrogen  and  sulphur  oxide  emissions  (NOx  and  SOx)  from fossil fuel combustion. These emissions are low in the alcoholic beverages sector relatively to global emissions.\n\nFor  Scopes  1  and  2  GHG  emissions,  both  location-based  and market-based energy emissions are calculated. The location-based method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy  consumption  occurs;  the  market-based  method  reflects emissions  from  electricity  that  companies  have  purposefully chosen, and derives emission factors from contractual instruments, which include any type of contract between two parties for the sale  and  purchase  of  energy  bundled  with  attributes  about  the energy generation, or for unbundled attribute claims.\n\n## Scope 3\n\nScope  3  GHG  emissions  cover  all  Pernod  Ricard  affiliates  with manufacturing activities and market companies.\n\nIt includes, as upstream emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 purchased goods and services: all packaging and agriculturalrelated  purchased  goods  (including  purchased  alcohol),  all purchased services.\n- \u00b7 capital goods, assessed based on CapEx;\n- \u00b7 fuel- and Energy-Related Activities (not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2);\n- \u00b7 upstream  transportation  and  distribution,  which  includes transportation of supplied glass packaging & agricultural goods, transportation of finished goods from the manufacturing sites to market companies, downstream transportation from market companies  (finished  goods  from  warehouse  to  first  paying customers);\n- \u00b7 use phase of sold product;\n- \u00b7 investments made in other companies;\n- \u00b7 waste generated in operations;\n- \u00b7 business travel;\n- \u00b7 employee commuting;\n\nIt includes, as downstream emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 downstream transportation and distribution, including storage in retailers warehouses and emission linked to the customer's ride from their home to the retailers;\n- \u00b7 end of life treatment of sold products.\n\nThe  following  categories  and  sources  of  emissions  are  not applicable to Pernod Ricard:\n\n- \u00b7 processing  of  sold  products:  this  category  does  not  apply  to Pernod  Ricard  as  the  Company  does  not  sell  intermediate products to downstream customers for processing;\n- \u00b7 downstream leased assets: Pernod Ricard does not have any leased asset;\n- \u00b7 franchises: Pernod Ricard does not operate any franchise.\n\nMethodology & third-party verification\n\nRegarding the Scope 3, the Group is improving year on year the precision of emission factors used to calculate Scope 3 emissions from  purchased  goods,  going  from  generic  to  supplier-specific ones.  Such  specific  accounting  methodology  will  allow  Pernod Ricard to track much more precisely all the efforts deployed by the Group and its suppliers to reach its Net Zero target. Thanks to intensive supplier data collection over the last two years, the Group  is  able  to  assess  its  Scope  3  emissions  with  supplier specific  emissions  factors,  covering  66%  of  Scope  3  emissions for FY24.\n\nAdditionally,  SBTi  guidelines  recommend  not  to  change  the emission factors or methodology that were validated during the SBTi  submission  process.  To  be  able  to  comply  with  these recommendations  while  disclosing  the  best  data  available  to date, Pernod Ricard discloses two scope 3 carbon footprint based on two distinct emission factors databases:\n\n- \u00b7 Scope  3  GHG  emissions  for  FY22,  FY23  and  FY24  -  based  on emission  factors  and  methodologies  validated  by  the  SBTi (see  section  3.4.1.6  Overview  of  Pernod  Ricard's  carbon footprint);\n- \u00b7 Scope  3  GHG  emissions  for  FY22,  FY23  and  FY24  -  based  on more  up  to  date  emission  factors  and  methodologies (see appendix 3.8.3).\n\nOnce a 5% significance threshold is reached, the most up-to-date emission factors and methodologies will be submitted to the SBTi for approval.\n\n## Packaging indicators\n\nPackaging  indicators  are  calculated  based  on  total  tonnage purchased during the fiscal year. All affiliates are in scope.\n\nThe share of recycled content in the glass bottles or in the PET bottles is considering only post-consumer recycling (PCR).\n\nThe  share  of  recyclable,  compostable  or  reusable  packaging  is calculated based on the following definitions :\n\n- \u00b7 recyclable packaging: is considered recyclable a full packaging when  its  main  material  represents  more  than  95%  of  total packaging weight and is recyclable (post-consumer collection, sorting and recycling is proven to work globally in practice and at scale - glass, cardboard, aluminium cans, PET bottles) and its other materials are not hindering the recycling in this stream;\n- \u00b7 reusable packaging : packaging designed to be reused for the same  purpose  in  a  closed  loop  system.  Can  be  reused  in business-to-business or business-to-consumer applications;\n- \u00b7 compostable packaging : Entire packaging is compostable if it is proven to be in compliance with international standards such as EN 13 432 for industrial and home compost and is effectively collected and sorted to be composted.\n\nThe reduction in weight of virgin plastic used is calculated in total tonnage  of  virgin  plastic  used  in  the  packaging  containers  and associated  caps  (excluding  plastic  caps  and  closures  used  on glass bottles or POS material).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The main interpretations used to roll out this regulation are  mentioned  in  the  following  section.  Pernod  Ricard  has ensured  that  there  is  no  double  counting  in  the  calculation  of turnover,  CapEx  and  OpEx  KPIs  across  activities  as  directly allocable turnover, CapEx and OpEx are considered.\n\n## Turnover\n\nThe Group's revenue is mainly generated from the manufacture of  beverages,  an  economic  activity  not  covered  by  the  existing Green Taxonomy regulation. As a result, most of Pernod Ricard's revenue is not eligible to the Green Taxonomy.\n\nHowever, following a detailed analysis, it has been identified that a small share of the revenue is linked to the ticketing activity for its  brand  homes.  The  revenues  generated  by  this  activity  are excluded  from  the  reporting  of  Taxonomy-eligibility  as  they represent less than 1% of the FY24 consolidated turnover and are therefore deemed non-material.\n\nAs long as beverage production is not covered by the Taxonomy, Pernod Ricard's turnover will not be eligible to the Taxonomy.\n\n## Capital expenditures (CapEx)\n\n## Non IFRS16 CapEx\n\n## Eligibility\n\nThe  eligibility  assessment  of  non  IFRS16  CapEx  is  based  on  a detailed  review  and  eligibility  analysis  of  Pernod-Ricard's  total non IFRS16 CapEx budget. The analysis was conducted in order to associate each relevant non IFRS16 CapEx project with appropriate activities covered by the Taxonomy on a project per project basis, thus  avoiding  double  counting,  for  a  total  of  14  activities identified with eligible non IFRS16 CapEx. In the case of activities related  to  construction  or  acquisition  of  buildings  (7.1  and  7.7), Pernod Ricard warehouses CapEx have been deemed not eligible to  activities  listed  in  the  regulation  for  objectives  1  and  2  as alignment criteria  for  real  estate  activities  are  not  applicable  to these investments.\n\n## Alignment\n\nBased on the eligibility assessment conducted on Pernod Ricard's total non IFRS16 CapEx budget, the 4 most contributing affiliates were selected for alignment investigation, on 9 of the 14 activities previously  identified,  covering  76.3%  of  all  eligible  non  IFRS16 CapEx  identified.  Additionally,  activities  associated  with  HQ coordinated projects, namely 4.25 - production of heat/cool from waste  heat  and  8.2  -Computer  programming,  consultancy  and related activities,  were  assessed for eligibility  beyond the scope of  the  4  selected  affiliates,  thanks  to  their  centralized  nature. Subsequently, activities 4.9, 5.7 and 7.2 were not investigated for alignment  given  the  level  of  detail  required  by  the  associated substantial  contribution  and  DNSH  criteria  was  considered  too ambitious for this exercise, with regards to the marginal CapEx amount  associated.  No  results  were  extrapolated  to  business units or projects that were not the subject of a detailed analysis. All  applicable  substantial  contribution  and  DNSH  criteria  were assessed during the alignment investigation.\n\n## IFRS16 CapEx (leased buildings and vehicles)\n\n## Eligibility\n\nAll  IFRS16  expenses  for  FY24  related  to  long-term  vehicles  and building leased (new or renewed leases over the exercise) were considered eligible to the European Taxonomy, given the nature of  leased  assets,  fulfilling  applicable  activities  descriptions  (6.5 and 7.7).\n\n## Alignment\n\n## Vehicles\n\nFor IFRS16 CapEx related to long-term vehicle rental, alignment analysis of the Group's leased vehicles fleet was performed on a selection of Pernod Ricard's 22 most contributing affiliates in FY24, for with 62% coverage of the Group's total newly leased vehicles expenses  over  the  fiscal  year.  No  results  were  extrapolated  to business units or projects that were not the subject of a detailed analysis. When information was unavailable, related assets were deemed not aligned. An estimation has been carried out to obtain the  total  amount  of  IFRS  16  Capex  aligned  by  affiliate.  Namely, the proportion of aligned assets per affiliates was applied to the affiliate's  related  IFRS16  CapEx  value  over  the  exercise.  As  a result,  figures  reported  are  likely  to  minimize  the  amount  of aligned CapEx. All applicable substantial contribution and DNSH criteria were assessed during the alignment investigation.\n\n## Buildings\n\nFor IFRS16 CapEx related to long-term building rental, alignment analysis of the Group's leased building stock was performed on a selection of Pernod Ricard's 2 of the most contributing affiliates in  FY24,  with  a  45%  coverage  of  the  Group's  total  newly  leased building expenses over the fiscal year. No results were extrapolated to  business  units  or  projects  that  were  not  the  subject  of  a detailed  analysis.  When  information  was  unavailable,  related assets were deemed not aligned. As a result, figures reported are likely  to  minimize  the  amount  of  aligned  CapEx.  All  applicable substantial contribution and DNSH criteria were assessed during the alignment investigation.\n\n## Operating expenditures (OpEx)\n\nArticle 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation states that where the OpEx is non-material for the business model of the company, it shall be exempted from the calculation of the numerator of OpEx KPI and disclose that numerator as being equal to zero. The calculation of the  OpEx  as  defined  by  the  Taxonomy  has  been  based  on  the identification  and  calculation  of  R&D,  short-term  rentals  and maintenance  and  repairs  expenses,  including  R&D  workforce costs. Upon this review, OpEx (as defined by the regulation) are deemed non-material as they represent less than 5% of PernodRicard total OpEx. Therefore, the company is exempted from the calculation of the numerator and its OpEx KPI equals 0.\n\nAdditionally, in accordance with the Climate delegated act 2022/1214, no  activities  related  to  nuclear  energy  or  fossil  gas  have  been identified  within  Pernod  Ricard's  operations,  as  detailed  in  the dedicated regulatory table.",

This includes specific definitions for each indicator, which are passed on to all Managers involved in collecting and consolidating data.\n\nPernod  Ricard  constantly  seeks  to  improve  the  collection  and analysis of its data. It accordingly updates its procedures and user guide  annually  in  line  with  the  Group's  evolving  needs. Improvements are made to ensure compliance with:\n\n- \u00b7 the  requirements  of  the  decree  implementing  article  225  on corporate transparency obligations on social and environmental matters; and\n- \u00b7 in accordance with applicable national or international frameworks.\n\nUpdates also result from contributions from affiliates when reporting data and auditor feedback. Any changes from the previous year are highlighted.\n\nSince FY23, the global solution 'Intelex' is used to register and provide consolidated results for the following indicators:\n\n- \u00b7 frequency/severity rates for workplace accidents;\n- \u00b7 number of fatal work accidents;\n- \u00b7 number of fatal accidents with lost time;\n- \u00b7 number of interim staff non-fatal accidents with lost time;\n- \u00b7 number of non-fatal work accidents and associated lost days.\n\nEnvironmental  indicators  are  collected  since  FY22  by  the same tool.\n\nFor  EU  Green  Taxonomy  indicators,  this  reporting  exercise  has been led jointly by the Finance and Sustainability teams, mobilising affiliates'  Sustainability,  Finance,  Operations  and  Purchasing\n\ndepartments.  The  main  interpretations  used  to  roll  out  this regulation are mentioned in the following section. Pernod Ricard has ensured that there is no double counting in the calculation of turnover,  CapEx  and  OpEx  KPIs  across  activities  as  directly allocable turnover, CapEx and OpEx are considered.\n\n## Methods for consolidating and checking data\n\nOnce  submitted  by  entities,  data  is  compiled  at  management entity  level,  then  at  Management  Entity  or  Brand  level  for submission  to  the  Headquarters.  The  data  is  processed  and consolidated  at  each  level.  Each  entity  collecting  and  compiling data  is  responsible  for  the  indicators  reported  and  certifies  the data as well as the checks done.\n\nThis  control  is  facilitated  by  automatic  checks  within  the  data entry  tool  in  the  consolidation  documents  sent  to  the  Market Companies  or  Brand  Companies  and  in  the  consolidation  tool. Amongst other things, these include consistency checks against previous years and between the indicators themselves. For social indicators,  at  each  step  the  affiliates  can  explain  any  variations versus the previous financial year. For variations of 10% or more, a comment is required to facilitate understanding and tracking.\n\nOnce all the data have been collected, the Headquarters performs consistency  checks  to  identify  any  reporting  or  input  errors. When there are significant variations, the Group checks with the affiliates  to  ensure  the  data  is  valid.  Finally,  the  Headquarters consolidates these data.\n\nRegarding  the  EU  Taxonomy,  Pernod  Ricard  has  ensured  that there is no double counting in the calculation of turnover, CapEx and  OpEx  KPIs  across  activities  as  directly  allocable  turnover, CapEx and OpEx are considered.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  guidelines  are  set  out  by  the Group's governing bodies and General Management based on applicable  laws  and  regulations,  as  well  as  on  the  values, standards and internal rules in place within Group companies;\n- \u00b7 the accounting, financial and management information provided to the Group's governing bodies accurately reflect the performance and financial position of Group companies;\n- \u00b7 the Group's assets are protected; and\n- \u00b7 operational and control duties are segregated.\n\nOne of the objectives of the internal control systems is to prevent and manage all risks arising from the Group's business activities, in  particular  accounting  and  financial  risks,  including  error  and fraud,  as  well  as  operational,  strategic  and  compliance  risks. However, like all control systems, they cannot offer an absolute guarantee that such risks have been fully eliminated.\n\n## 4.1.2 Description of the internal control environment\n\n## 4.1.2.1 Components of the internal control system\n\nThe principal bodies responsible for internal control are as follows:\n\n## At Group level\n\n- \u00b7 The Executive Committee is the permanent body in charge of coordinating and managing the Group, in cooperation with the Chairman  &  CEO  whom  it  assists  with  his  duties  and responsibilities.  The  Executive  Committee  sets  the  Group's strategic objectives in line with the priorities decided by the Board of  Directors,  coordinates their implementation and steers the Group's overall performance. Its members are global heads of the  Group's  corporate  functions,  operational  divisions  and geographic regions.\n- \u00b7 The Internal Audit Department is headed by the Group Chairman & CEO and reports to the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee. The internal audit team based at headquarters is in charge of putting in place internal control rules, managing risks and executing the audit plan. The internal control unit is responsible for communicating information related to control activities within the Group. It monitors the internal control system on a continuous basis and regularly ensures that the system is operating effectively. The audit plan is drawn up once the Group's main risks have been identified\n\nand analysed and is validated by the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee. It sets out the various cross-functional issues to be reviewed during the financial year, the list of affiliates to be audited, the main topics to be covered during these audits, and the list of thematic audits. Once the work has been completed, the findings are submitted to the Audit Committee, the Statutory Auditors and the Executive Committee for examination and analysis.\n\n## At affiliate level\n\nThe Management Committee comprises the affiliate's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Heads of its main functions. The Management Committee is responsible for managing the main risks that could affect the affiliate.\n\nThe affiliate's Chief Financial Officer ,  assisted in most cases by an internal controller, is tasked by the Managing Director of the affiliate with establishing appropriate internal control systems for the  prevention  and  management  of  risks  arising  from  the affiliate's operations, in particular accounting and financial risks, including error and fraud.\n\n## 4.1.2.2 Identification and management of risks\n\nRisk identification and management work in FY 2024 focused on:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewing  the  Group's  risk  map,  carried  out  by  General Management and the Audit Committee in conjunction with all of  Pernod  Ricard's  corporate  functions  and  affiliates.  This annual review takes into account the major changes in the risk environment to which the Pernod Ricard Group is exposed;\n- \u00b7 tightening  internal  control  within  the  Group  through  various projects, including continued development of data analytics to strengthen auditing methods;\n- \u00b7 implementing  the  self-assessment  questionnaire  on  internal control  and  risk  management.  This  questionnaire,  which  was updated  during  the  financial  year,  complies  with  the  AMF reference framework for risk management and internal control systems, and is supplemented by an application guide; and\n\n- \u00b7 performing  audits:  35  affiliates  were  audited  in  FY  2024.  The purpose of the audits was to ensure that the Group's internal control  principles  were  properly  applied  by  its  affiliates.  They also enabled a review of the processes in place, best practices and potential  areas  for  improvement  on  various  cross-functional themes.\n\nAll  of  the  areas  for  improvement  identified  were  addressed  by specific  action  plans  drawn  up  by  each  affiliate  and  at  Group level, which were validated by the Executive Committee and the Audit  Committee.  Their  implementation  is  regularly  monitored and assessed by the Group's Internal Audit Department.\n\nThese  audits  improved  the  quality  of  internal  control  and  risk management within the Group.",

        "page_content": "## 4.1.2.3 Key components of internal control procedures\n\nThe key components of internal control procedures are as follows: A formal delegation of authority procedure sets out the powers of the Chairman & CEO, as well as the powers delegated to members of the Executive Committee.\n\nThe internal  control  principles outline  the  common  principles and rules that apply to all of the Group's affiliates with respect to internal  control  for  each  of  the  16  main  operational  cycles identified.\n\nThe self-assessment questionnaire is regularly updated to comply with the AMF reference framework for risk management and internal control  systems.  In  particular,  it  covers  corporate  governance practices,  operational  activities  and  IT  support.  Shared  with  the Group's  affiliates,  it  enables  them  to  assess  the  adequacy  and effectiveness  of  their  internal  controls.  Responses  to  the questionnaires  are  documented  and  reviewed  by  the  Group's Internal Audit Department. This work is detailed in:\n\n- \u00b7 a summary per affiliate and an overall Group summary, both of which are provided to the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee; and\n- \u00b7 a letter of representation from every affiliate to the Chairman  &  CEO  of  its  parent  company  and  a  letter  of representation  from  the  various  parent  companies  to  the Chairman  &  CEO  of  Pernod  Ricard.  This  letter  commits  the affiliates' management to ensuring that their control procedures adequately address the identified risks.\n\nThe Internal  Audit  Charter applies  to  all  employees  who  have management  and  audit  duties.  It  defines  the  standards,  tasks, responsibilities, organisation and operation of the Group's Internal Audit  Department,  in  order  to  ensure  that  every  employee understands the importance of following and continuously improving the internal control process.\n\nControls are performed to ensure that the Group delivers on its commitments,  based  on  three  pillars:  the  strategic  plan,  the business plan (updated at the beginning of each year in order to set  objectives  and  during  the  year  after  each  rolling  forecast, including financial and non-financial objectives) and performance reporting.\n\nThese  controls  are  carried  out  by  management  control  teams who  report  to  the  Finance  Departments  of  headquarters  and affiliates. They consist of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 a multi-year strategic plan is established for the Group's main brands, revised every three years;\n- \u00b7 this strategic plan is then rolled down into a business plan, which is issued at the beginning of the financial year by headquarters and  is  sent  to  all  affiliates.  The  executive  summary  of  the business plan is approved by the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 reporting  is  prepared  on  the  basis  of  data  input  directly  by affiliates  working  to  a  specific  timetable  provided  at  the beginning  of  the  year  and  in  accordance  with  the  reporting manual and the accounting policies published by headquarters;\n- \u00b7 a  monthly  performance  analysis  is  carried  out  as  part  of  the reporting process and is presented by the Finance Department to the Executive Committee and at Audit Committee and Board of Directors meetings; and\n- \u00b7 a common management and consolidation system that allows each affiliate to directly input all its accounting and financial data.\n\nCentralised treasury management is  led  by  the  Treasury  Unit of the Group's Finance Department.\n\nThe Pernod Ricard Quality, Safety and Environment Standards set  out  the  rules  to  be  followed  in  these  areas.  The  Group's Operations Department is responsible for ensuring their application.\n\n## 4.1.2.4 Headquarters' legal and operational control over affiliates\n\nAffiliates are mostly wholly owned, either directly or indirectly, by Pernod Ricard.\n\nPernod  Ricard  is  represented  directly  or  indirectly  (through  an intermediate affiliate) on its affiliates' Boards of Directors.\n\nThe  Group's  internal  control  principles  set  out  the  various internal control rules applicable to all affiliates.\n\nThe  role  assigned  to  Pernod  Ricard,  as  described  in  the subsection  'Our  governance  and  organisational  structure'  in Chapter  1  'Presentation  of  the  Group'  of  this  Universal Registration Document, is an important component of the control of affiliates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Geopolitical and macroeconomic instability\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nDue to its international scope, the Pernod Ricard Group is exposed to the risks of geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic instabilities. The acceleration of international tensions observed in recent years may lead to an increase in customs barriers or international sanctions, as was the case in the context of the trade war between the United States and China, on the one hand, and the European Union, on the other  hand,  as  well  as  the  adoption  of  Western  sanctions  against Russia following the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe  current  uncertain  macroeconomic  environment  shaped  by  the return  of  high  inflation  may  also  lead  to  changes  in  consumer behaviour.\n\nThese  geopolitical  and  macroeconomic  disruptions  to  the  Group's markets  could  lead  to  heightened  volatility  in  Pernod  Ricard's commercial and financial results. For Russia and Ukraine specifically, these  markets  represented  approximately  3%  of  the  Group's worldwide net sales before the conflict.\n\nMacroeconomic  instability  and,  in  particular,  potential  constraints on  consumer  purchasing  power,  may  have  a  negative  impact  on how often people drink and therefore on the Group's sales.\n\nOngoing geopolitical tensions could also make it difficult to access certain markets or could result in retaliatory tariffs that would affect Pernod  Ricard's  exports,  as  has  happened  in  the  past  with  the United States and China.\n\nThese  economic  crises  and  trade  tensions  could  weigh  on  the Group's operating margin.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nFor  the  Group,  the  best  way  to  protect  itself  is  to  diversify  its  business,  both  geographically  and  by  category.  It  is  already  present  in 75 countries and has a leading brand in each main category of spirits. Pernod Ricard continues to develop new distribution channels (e-commerce, home entertainment) and to explore new consumption opportunities by expanding its range of products to include lowalcohol and even alcohol-free beverages. Accordingly, the Group regularly assesses its routes-to-market and local partners. Pernod Ricard also closely monitors political and regulatory developments to anticipate potential business disruptions as much as possible, and engages in regular dialogue with public authorities to ensure that its business is not undermined by tensions wholly unrelated to the Wine & Spirits industry.  In  addition,  crisis  management  programmes  are  in  place  in  all  affiliates.  Lastly,  under  certain  circumstances,  production  and logistics infrastructures can be adapted.\n\n## 2. Changes in market environment\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nDistributor  concentration  and  consolidation,  both  locally  and internationally, have been ongoing for several years. E-commerce is also  becoming  an  increasingly  important  alternative  to  traditional distribution channels. This competitive environment affects the Group's ability to increase its prices and may sometimes force Pernod Ricard to envisage more aggressive and frequent promotional campaigns. The  Group  also  faces  heightened  competition  from  both  major international  players  with  its  strategic  brands  and  local  groups  or producers with its local brands, driven by the increasing success of craft products or products perceived as such, such as vodka in the United States.\n\nLastly,  purchase  price  inflation  (materials,  services),  which  is particularly high in the current environment, is closely monitored by the Group in order to limit the impact on margins.\n\nPotential risks and impacts include:\n\n- \u00b7 the  increased  bargaining  power  of  Pernod  Ricard's  customers leading to margin erosion and/or loss of market share;\n- \u00b7 temporary removal of products from shelves and/or removal of promotional materials;\n- \u00b7 pressure on Pernod Ricard to align prices across markets within a region;\n- \u00b7 more  intense  competition  in  mature  markets  and  increasingly competitive emerging markets, requiring the Group to boost its advertising  and  promotional  investments,  or  even  to  reduce  or freeze  prices  in  order  to  protect  market  share,  with  a  negative impact on results;\n- \u00b7 damage to the brand image of products due to price reductions; and\n- \u00b7 a  decrease  in  margins  due  to  a  deterioration  in  purchasing conditions with the Group's suppliers and/or a limited ability to raise its product prices to reflect higher costs.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nTo mitigate risk, Pernod Ricard earmarks approximately 16% of net sales for advertising and promotion (A&P) expenses to reinforce brand equity and, in turn, improve pricing power. In addition, Pernod Ricard has rolled out several revenue growth management initiatives, such as the development of a promotional effectiveness tool, the analysis of market conditions and pricing structures, and the dedication of resources to pricing management. These initiatives are adopted by the affiliates and coordinated at Group level by headquarters. Particular  attention  is  paid  to  margin  indicators,  a  key  metric  monitored  by  Group  management.  The  Group  has  implemented  the appropriate organisation and initiatives (PR Procure) to ensure satisfactory purchasing conditions for its raw materials while maintaining relationships of mutual trust with its key suppliers.",

Supply chain disruptions\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nWhile the global crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated the resilience of the Pernod Ricard Group's supply chain, it also showed that large-scale, unpredictable events could occur and render access to markets more complex. Other factors also remain relevant, such as the failure of a key supplier, the unavailability of certain raw materials (due to weather conditions, in particular) or the closure or impossibility of  access  to  certain  routes,  whether  sea  or  land.  For  example,  a trend towards the concentration of suppliers of raw materials and packaging has been observed for a number of years. Today, several of the Group's affiliates work with the same suppliers, which creates risk-charged interdependence should one of them fail (e.g., in the event of a major accident at one of their production sites).\n\nA disruption to the supply chain could occur due to the unavailability of certain raw or packaging materials, causing production of some of the Group's products to be shut down.\n\nFurthermore, the unavailability of certain products on the shelves, for  one  or  more  of  the  reasons  mentioned  here,  could  result  in penalties  being  charged  to  the  Group  by  its  customers  for  noncompliance with the agreed commercial terms and conditions and service rates.\n\nLastly, an unexpected rise in the cost of raw or packaging materials could significantly increase the Group's operating costs. As it is not certain  that  this  increase  could  be  offset  by  higher  prices,  the Group's results might be affected.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nIn  the  context  of  business  continuity  and  to  support  the  Global  Strategy  of  creating  an  agile,  flexible  and  sustainable  supply  chain,  a dedicated department, GFO - Global Flow Optimization, is responsible for integrating and executing a centralised strategy that is aligned with  the  Group's  strategic  brands,  affiliates  and  global  functions,  to  promote  better  synergies,  support  business  growth,  strengthen continuity  plans  and  deliver  value  through  operational  activities.  Working  closely  with  all  departments  -  S&OP,  Procurement, Manufacturing,  Logistics,  Tax  &  Public  Affairs  and  Sustainability  -  GFO  proactively  and  durably  drives  the  process  of  identifying opportunities, mitigating risk and ensuring continuous improvement.\n\n## 4. Information systems and cybersecurity\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPernod  Ricard's  performance  has  been  fuelled  by  its  digital transformation  and  the  extensive  use  of  information  technologies and data.\n\nIn  the  context  of  rapid  adoption  of  technology,  along  with  an increase  in  the  frequency  and  sophistication  of  cyberattacks, companies  are  facing  a  greater  exposure  to  risks  stemming  from unavailability of technological infrastructure or information systems, cybersecurity incidents and industrial control system (ICS) failures. These  systems  are  essential  to  Pernod  Ricard's  day-to-day operations, in particular to support the manufacture, warehousing and distribution of products, as well as the processing, transmission and storage of electronic data, both for the Group's operations and financial statements and for communication between Pernod Ricard\n\nemployees, customers and suppliers.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nPernod Ricard's technologies are managed by a Global technology function, which includes a team specifically dedicated to cybersecurity. This team is committed to proactively managing information systems and cybersecurity risks in order to protect Pernod Ricard's digital assets in IT and industrial control systems environments.\n\nThe Cybersecurity team operates on a comprehensive multi-year cybersecurity strategy and a security risk framework designed to reduce the level of exposure to cyber risks and continuously strengthening the maturity of our security posture.\n\nThe Group has adopted proactive measures which include the deployment of cybersecurity technologies, regular system audits, attack and simulation testing, security training and awareness activities, security monitoring, and continuous improvement of security practices which are integral to our strategy. They are supplemented by an active incident response and crisis management plan that allows for swift action and transparency in the event of a security breach, minimising potential impact to our organisation.\n\nThe Cybersecurity team also reports to an executive committee specifically focused on the security of the Group demonstrating leadership commitment to govern and continually invest in improving our security maturity.\n\nLastly,  the  risk  is  also  mitigated  through  cyber  insurance  coverage  with  the  standard  guarantees.  In  this  way,  the  Group's  risk management policy transfers part of the risk to insurers.\n\nThe  potential  impacts  of  information  system  outages  or  of  a cyberattack depend on the nature of the issue and may include:\n\n- \u00b7 leakage, loss, theft of personal, strategic or confidential data, and the resulting chain of potential repercussions;\n- \u00b7 unauthorised modification or destruction of data;\n- \u00b7 system failures or malfunctions; and\n- \u00b7 inability to perform day-to-day operations.\n\nAlthough the Group makes significant investments to maintain and safeguard its IT and industrial control systems, particularly in view of growing cybercrime threats, any malfunction, significant disruption, loss or disclosure of sensitive data could disrupt the normal course of  business,  and  have  financial,  legal,  regulatory,  operational  or reputational consequences.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Disruption of demand and consumer behaviour\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nConsumer expectations and behaviour are evolving quickly, in terms of preferences regarding product offerings (craft spirits, the low/no alcohol trend), purchasing methods (e-commerce, fast delivery) and brand  dialogue  and  experiences  (digital  marketing,  cross-channel touchpoints, etc.).\n\nPernod Ricard must adapt its organisation, portfolio, business model and market access routes according to these new trends and must continue to innovate, always placing the consumer at the centre of its decisions and marketing and commercial choices.\n\nDifficulties  in  detecting  and  predicting  future  consumer  behaviour could result in under-investment in categories, products and channels that turn out to be strong or, conversely, over-investment in those that are running out of steam.\n\nOver  time,  Pernod  Ricard  could  lose  market  share  or  miss  out  on growth opportunities and damage its brand image and/or reputation.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nTo mitigate this risk, Pernod Ricard takes action across its entire organisation:\n\n- \u00b7 the Consumer Insights organisation studies consumer behaviour and societal shifts to anticipate changes in trends. Consumer Insights was strengthened in  2019  by  its  centralisation  and  the  creation  of  market  representatives  as  well  as  by  the  intensification  of  social listening resources;\n- \u00b7 an innovation centre of excellence has been set up which develops products and services with high added value, both for the Group and for its consumers and users. In addition, an agile TLO (test, learn, optimise) experimentation method has been implemented;\n- \u00b7 from a strategic standpoint, business model diversification, market access methods and portfolio management are closely monitored and changes deemed relevant are implemented. For example, the Group is present in the direct-to-consumer sales channel through The Whisky Exchange, a brand combining an online marketplace and brick-and-mortar stores. The creation of Conviviality Ventures in 2017 also enabled indirect investment in new activities that complement those of Pernod Ricard by leveraging the rich and innovative start-up ecosystem; and\n- \u00b7 the comprehensive digital transformation of the Group is ongoing. It includes six transformation priorities organised under Key Digital Programs  that  are  focused  on  continuously  improving  marketing  and  sales  processes  and  maximising  opportunities  to  establish partnerships  through  incubation  programmes.  These  programmes  harness  the  power  of  data  analytics  and  the  latest  available technologies such as machine learning algorithms.\n\n## 6. Negative media coverage\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe growing resonance of social media, and the reach and influence it gives to information, mean that Pernod Ricard could become the subject of negative media coverage or inappropriate posts or messages. In addition, the Group's size and the nature of its business expose it to the spread of false or misleading information in both traditional and  social  media,  as  observed  in  recent  years.  The  Group  cannot rule  out  the  possibility  of  being  affected  by  this  type  of  event, against which it must continue to protect itself.\n\nA malicious attack aimed at harming Pernod Ricard's reputation, its brand portfolio or its main affiliates could significantly damage the Group's  image  and  reputation.  Widespread  negative  media coverage  could  jeopardise  consumer  confidence  in  Pernod  Ricard brands, resulting in a potential sales decline.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nThe Group has implemented a series of internal and external measures to manage this risk. Internal measures focus primarily on raising the awareness of Pernod Ricard employees on the impact of social media and sharing communications best practices. External measures include monitoring commentary in both traditional and social media and preparing a response accordingly to assert the Group's positions and protect it from smear campaigns.",

        "page_content": "## 7. Misuse of artificial intelligence\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe risk of misuse of artificial intelligence can result from a lack of awareness or insufficient understanding of it, as well as from poorquality  data  ingestion.  The  risks  associated  with  the  misuse  of artificial  intelligence  include  ethical  concerns  such  as  bias  and invasion  of  privacy,  security  threats  such  as  cyberattacks,  and misinformation and disinformation.\n\nMisuse  of  artificial  intelligence  can  lead  to  reputational  and  legal impacts as well as financial  losses.  Security  breaches  can  result  in data compromise and loss of customer trust. In addition, reliance on artificial intelligence may lead to potential non-compliance with laws and  regulations,  affecting  the  stability  and  overall  growth  of  the business.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nAs  a  technology  that  is  developing  rapidly,  artificial  intelligence  gives  rise  to  a  wide  range  of  fast-changing  risks  and  opportunities, requiring new practices to be adopted. Guidelines on the use of artificial intelligence are available to all Pernod Ricard employees, and a broad-based awareness campaign has been launched throughout the Group. In addition, Pernod Ricard has introduced an internal 'secure GPT' solution to minimise the risk of data leakage or copyright infringement. The Group has also extended its GreenOps/FinOps tools and methodology to encompass artificial intelligence, to reduce the power consumption of AI and minimise its environmental impact.\n\n## 8. Talent management (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPernod  Ricard's  success  depends  on  the  engagement  of  its employees  and  its  ability  to  attract  and  retain  them  as  well  as develop  their  skills,  particularly  in  highly  competitive  labour markets,  such  as  North  America,  Asia  Pacific,  Africa  and  specific countries, where turnover rates are normally higher than in the rest of  the  world.  This  competitive  talent  market  is  heightened  on occasions  by  the  search  for  scarce  skills  (such  as  in  digital professions),  changes  in  the  aspirations  and  motivations  of  new generations and the recent pandemic impact that has accelerated certain trends. Additionally, career development through international  geographic  mobility  can  sometimes  be  a  challenge, particularly  due  to  diversity  of  career  paths,  dual  careers,  cost control, post-Covid impacts, etc.\n\nThe  Group  is  aware  that  talent  management  and  engagement remain key areas of focus to ensure the sustainability of its activity and  the  transmission  of  key  know-how  within  the  organisation. Having excessively high turnover or unduly long job vacancies could have a financial impact and demotivate teams. This could potentially slow  the  implementation  of  key  Group  development  projects  and have an adverse impact on its business, results or reputation.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nTo  mitigate  risk,  the  Group  has  established  and  embedded  worldwide  a  robust  talent  management  strategic  plan,  fully  leveraging technology and data, with a common language globally to assess performance and manage talent. This, together with a skills development framework  and  offer,  were  put  in  place  to  grow  and  develop  talent  and  facilitate  dynamic  career  management  and  development. Accordingly, shared global processes and tools were developed to allow all affiliates to optimise the assessment of performance and skills, to  formalise  the  identification  of  talents,  to  carry  out  succession  planning,  to  encourage  internal  mobility  and  to  monitor  employee engagement and well-being. Since 2019, a talent management and performance methodology and process (Let's Talk Talent) powered by a  global  human capital management system, and a global leadership model with expected behaviours at each level, have been put in place.\n\nAdditionally,  in  FY  2024,  the  Group  launched  phase  1  of  Horizons,  Pernod  Ricard's  global  talent  marketplace,  leveraging  artificial intelligence for providing employees with further visibility on career and development opportunities that match their skills, experience and motivations.\n\nShared across the whole Group, the above-described global Talent & Performance framework puts the employee at the centre of Human Resources  processes  providing  even  greater  objectivity,  consistency  and  transparency  globally  when  assessing  and  developing  our employees, and using a common language for everyone. Moreover, Pernod Ricard University trains the Group's future leaders and talents through leadership and functional skills-based development programmes. Succession plans are regularly reviewed by top management and Human Resources, especially for  key  positions  within  the  Group  and  annual  Strategic  Talent  &  Succession  Planning  meetings  are conducted at the very top senior executive level to ensure Pernod Ricard has talent ready at the right time in the right place. Furthermore, from a talent engagement perspective, on a yearly basis, the Group conducts Global Employee Engagement and Well-being surveys. Lastly, we regularly implement measures designed to enhance quality of work life and to continue to foster Diversity, Equality & Inclusion (DE&I). These  include,  among  many  others,  remote-working  arrangements,  measures  related  to  well-being  at  work,  the  modernisation  of workspaces, managerial awareness-raising programmes and the implementation of the global DE&I roadmap.\n\n- (1) This risk is also covered in section 3.3.2.2 of the Non-Financial Performance Statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Fraud\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPernod Ricard is exposed to the risk of fraud, in particular due to its presence in many countries and the acceleration of its digitisation.\n\nAny  type  of  fraud,  whether  internal  or  external,  could  lead  to financial losses (including legal costs to recover defrauded amounts or  products),  leakage  of  sensitive  information  or  theft  of  major physical  assets.  It  could  also  have  a  significant  impact  on  the Group's reputation.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nTo mitigate the risk, the Pernod Ricard Group has implemented a strict framework of internal control rules and related tools, based on the Group's internal control principles, as well as a quarterly monitoring process in the event of fraud. In addition, regular campaigns are run for internal control teams in order to raise awareness on fraud risks and consolidate the Group's processes. The Group also conducts internal and external audits each year to ensure the effectiveness of measures in place. Lastly, the risk is mitigated through fraud insurance coverage with the standard guarantees. In this way, the Group's risk management policy transfers part of the risk to insurers.\n\n## 10. Social tension\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nSocial  tension  with  heightened  division  and  conflict  within  society can be caused by various factors, including financial and economic disparities, cultural differences and political polarisation. This can be exacerbated  by  misinformation,  manipulation  of  social  media  and systemic bias, leading to increased distrust, reduced social cohesion and potential civil unrest. Within the Group, any difficult interactions with  employee  representative  bodies  could  prevent  the  smooth running of our affiliates (due to strikes, disruptions, etc.).\n\nThe impact of social tension on the Group can take various forms, such as a decrease in sales volumes due to lower purchasing power, disruptions to production and our supply chains, or damage to our brands' image.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nThe Group has implemented a series of measures to manage this risk. The main aim is to ensure that there are robust crisis management policies in place throughout the Group. All of our affiliates work closely together to scrupulously monitor all of our markets. The affiliates also maintain good relations with the trade unions, and audits are regularly carried out to assess internal practices.",

Loss of a major industrial site/strategic inventory\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nCurrently,  the  following  events  could  result  in  the  loss  of  a  major industrial site or strategic inventory:\n\n- \u00b7 a  fire  and/or  explosion  related  to  the  manufacture,  handling  or storage of flammable products (e.g., alcohol);\n- \u00b7 a natural disaster such as an earthquake, hurricane or flood; or\n- \u00b7 a malicious act.\n\nSeveral  Group  sites  are  located  in  seismic  zones,  particularly  in New Zealand, Armenia, California and Mexico.\n\nCertain sites, including the San Jos\u00e9 plant in Cuba, are exposed to the risk of cyclones.\n\nLastly, the Group stores a significant stock of maturing products, such as  Scotch  whisky,  Irish  whiskey,  cognac,  rum,  brandy  and  wines, which are flammable liquids.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nTo manage this risk, an Operations Risk Manager who reports to the Group Health and Safety Director within the Operations Department is responsible  for  coordinating  work  by  affiliates  to  implement  preventive  measures  (design  and  maintenance  of  facilities,  training,  operating procedures, etc.) and physical protection mechanisms (automatic sprinkler systems, retention basins, emergency procedures, etc.). The risk is also mitigated by property damage and business interruption insurance coverage with the standard guarantees. In this way, the Group's risk management policy transfers part of the risk to insurers. In addition, in cooperation with insurers, some 40 industrial sites are reviewed each year and the quality of risk is assessed to determine recommendations for improving each site. A Group monitoring programme for business continuity and management systems is also in place. Strategic affiliates have identified the various  scenarios  that  could  affect  their  operations  and  have  drawn  up  business  continuity  plans  including  the  implementation  of\n\nemergency solutions and access to alternative production methods in the event of the loss of a site.\n\n## 2. Toxic contamination (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe Group purchases most raw materials (grapes, grains, agave, etc.) used  in  the  manufacture  of  its  wine  and  spirits  from  farmers  or industrial producers (alcohol, sugar, flavourings, etc.). The presence of undesirable substances in these raw materials or a defect in the distillation, fermentation or bottling process could result in chemical (contaminant),  biological  (microorganism),  physical  (foreign  body) or allergen contamination.\n\nThe Group's reputation and image may be undermined at any time by one-off incidents at an industrial site or relating to a specific product. For example, contamination, whether arising accidentally, or through a  malicious  act,  could  cause  injury  or  intoxication  to  a  consumer, thereby  exposing  the  Group  to  litigation  and  causing  reputational harm to the brands.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nThe Group has implemented protection and control systems to limit the risk of contamination. The management of this risk is based on the hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) method, which aims to identify the risks involved in the manufacturing process and to bring them under control, as well as on the implementation of specific internal guidelines and operating requirements. The Group has also implemented management systems compliant with the ISO 22000 standard for food safety management, which is aimed specifically at controlling this type of risk.\n\nHeadquarters periodically  carries  out  contaminant  screening  tests,  covering  all  Strategic  International  Brands  and  the  most  important Strategic Local Brands. This involves an array of chemical analyses covering all contaminants considered possible, and detection testing of around 80 unwanted molecules and several hundred pesticides.\n\n- (1) This risk is also covered in section 3.3.2.2 of the Non-Financial Performance Statement.\n\nThe loss of a major industrial site or strategic inventory is considered a major risk for Pernod Ricard. The materialisation of this risk could result  in  a  significant  operating  loss  and  an  accompanying  sharp drop  or  prolonged  interruption  in  the  supply  of  certain  products, thereby preventing the Group from meeting consumer demand. Moreover, an incident at one of the sites, whether accidental or the result  of  a  malicious  act,  could  jeopardise  the  safety  of  Group employees or cause environmental damage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Climate change (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nClimate  change  is  the  source  of  various  risks  to  Pernod  Ricard's business,  including  risks  to  the  supply  of  raw  materials  such  as grapes and grains, risks relating to the availability of water resources (floods,  droughts,  etc.),  climate-related  incidents  (cyclones,  fires, etc.), and increasing costs (carbon tax).\n\nThe need to reduce carbon emissions, which are the root cause of climate change itself, generates new risks and opportunities for the Group, in particular in terms of the reduction of direct and indirect emissions  (see  the  Group's  Net  Zero  commitments)  and  the transition to renewable energies.\n\nIncreasingly irregular crop yields, climate events such as frost, hail and drought and shifting climatic boundaries can affect the quality, availability and, to a greater extent, price of raw materials.\n\nIn  terms  of  grains  and  sugar  cane,  the  effects  of  climate  change, coupled  with  rising  global  demand,  are  contributing  to  increasing market price volatility, which must be taken into account in procurement strategies and business supply models.\n\nIn  terms  of  grapes  -  another  of  the  Group's  key  raw  materials  climate models point to an increase in the alcohol content of wine and  champagne,  adjustments  to  certain  qualitative  factors  and changes in phytosanitary pressure, as well as the risks of frost and drought, which vary depending on geography.\n\nA  similar  risk  exists  in  relation  to  the  water  supply  for  production sites. A number of sites use groundwater for their supply, which can also be affected by climate change.\n\nFrom a regulatory point of view, environmental issues, and in particular climate-related  issues,  are  leading  to  stricter  carbon  emissions regulations. In Europe, the Group's four largest distilleries are subject to  the  European  Union  carbon  emission  trading  system  (EU-ETS). The direct financial challenge is moderate for Pernod Ricard but is expected to increase significantly in the years to come. The economic impact of energy and carbon regulations is also felt through indirect consumption  via  the  Group's  suppliers  (especially  with  respect  to glass, alcohol and transport).\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nFor  grapes,  the  relevant  trade  associations,  such  as  those  for  cognac  and  champagne  and  wine  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  have incorporated  this  issue  into  their  research  programmes  in  order  to  adapt  practices  to  these  changes  (choice  of  grape  varieties,  vine training, vinification, etc.).\n\nThe availability and quality of water at production sites are key to ensuring the quality of Pernod Ricard's products and are monitored very\n\nclosely. Responsible water management is a significant component of the Group's S&R policy, with each site responsible for ensuring that its use of groundwater or river water and its wastewater discharges do not harm the environment. Sites located in areas identified as high risk in terms of water supply are subject to enhanced monitoring to ensure the sustainability of resources by minimising water consumption and returning an equivalent volume of water to the withdrawal site. The Group is committed to offsetting 100% of water consumption at production sites and co-packers located in highly water-stressed basins by 2030, by replenishing water resources in these regions.\n\nIn terms of the financial impact of carbon emissions generated directly by the Group's business or indirectly by its suppliers, a carbon emissions reduction plan aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C (Scopes 1 and 2) and 2\u00b0C (Scope 3) scenario has been implemented.\n\nPernod Ricard's  climate  impact  was  incorporated  into  the  Good  Times  from  a  Good  Place  roadmap.  In  concrete  terms,  the  Nurturing Terroir and Circular Making pillars commit the Company to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 promoting regenerative agriculture: by 2025, pilot regenerative agriculture programmes will be developed by the Group for vineyards in eight wine-growing regions - Argentina, California, the Cognac region, Champagne, Spain, Australia, New Zealand and China - aiming to improve the quality of soils and ecosystems. Identical initiatives are under way for the Group's other major strategic raw materials to increase the resilience of agricultural systems. These programmes also represent a unique opportunity to create carbon sinks through soil sequestration and to have a positive impact on the climate;\n- \u00b7 reducing carbon emissions from Group operations (Scopes 1 and 2): this programme aims to reduce carbon emissions from operations by 54% by 2030 (vs. 2018), with a focus on energy efficiency, use of biomass and 100% renewable electricity supply (by 2025);\n- \u00b7 reducing  the  Group's  indirect  carbon  emissions  (Scope  3),  mainly  linked  to  the  purchase  of  agricultural  products,  packaging  and upstream and downstream transport: the Group requires its suppliers to commit to decarbonising their operations, and has launched a number  of  internal  optimisation  programmes.  With  regard  to  packaging,  the  Group's  policy  encourages  lightweighting,  the  use  of recycled  materials,  recyclability,  and  bans  on  single-use  promotional  items.  Pilot  projects  are  under  way  to  test  alternative,  circular product distribution  methods.  As  regards  transport,  the  Group  is  working  to  optimise  loads  and  develop  multi-modal  solutions  and alternative transport options.\n- (1) This risk is also covered in section 3.3.2.2 of the Non-Financial Performance Statement.",

Health and Safety (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPreventing  and  managing  occupational  risks  forms  part  of  the Company's obligations towards its employees.\n\nThe notion of 'occupational risk' can be defined as all threats to the health  of  employees  encountered  in  the  context  of  their  work. They may result in an accident or a so-called 'occupational' illness. Pernod  Ricard  is  committed  to  preventing  the  following  nonexhaustive list of occupational risks:\n\n- \u00b7 risks relating to falls and slips;\n- \u00b7 risks relating to noise and vibrations;\n- \u00b7 electrical risk;\n- \u00b7 fire and explosion risk;\n- \u00b7 road risk;\n- \u00b7 risks relating to the use of certain machines or work equipment; and\n- \u00b7 psychosocial risks.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nIn late 2017, the Group embarked on a process to reduce occupational accidents by launching a comprehensive review of industrial sites with the greatest potential for improvement. The main sites are now assessed by an external company in accordance with specific criteria in terms of their safety culture, ability to manage major risks and ISO 45001 occupational health and safety management system.\n\nThanks to this review and the commitment of General Management, the Group announced its ambition to achieve zero accidents with lost\n\ntime by 2025. To accomplish this, it launched the Taking Care of Each Other programme with the following three strategic goals:\n\n- \u00b7 develop a culture where safety is central to the Group's values of conviviality;\n- \u00b7 engage, motivate and empower all employees and subcontractors on the issue of safety; and\n- \u00b7 improve operational efficiency through excellence in Health and Safety.\n\nThis programme, which is closely monitored by the Group's Top Management, is part of the Group's S&R strategy and has gradually been extended to all employees in both industrial and non-industrial sites within its affiliates.\n\n- (1) This risk is also covered in section 3.3.2.2 of the Non-Financial Performance Statement.\n\nPersonal injury is one of the main potential impacts for the Group. The most serious examples are:\n\n- \u00b7 the death of one or more employees, subcontractors, visitors or other third parties;\n- \u00b7 permanent  disability  of  employees,  subcontractors,  visitors  or other third parties; and\n- \u00b7 occupational illness.\n\nThe legal and reputational impacts related to inadequate management  of  working  conditions  must  also  be  taken  into account.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Environmental damage (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nDue  to  the  agricultural  and  industrial  nature  of  its  activities, encompassing  farming  (vineyards  and  agave  fields),  as  well  as distillation,  processing,  maturation  and  bottling  at  its  industrial sites, the Group may cause environmental damage and therefore is exposed to various risks in this respect. In particular, unintentional spills  or  accidental  leaks  of  wastewater  or  vinasse  can  occur,  and various types of pollution can arise (soil, air and water pollution, in particular  from  intensive  farming  practices).  Any  such  incidents could  lead  to  physical  risks  for  employees,  suppliers  and  local communities,  but  could  also  impact  biodiversity  (flora  and  fauna) and cause temporary disruption to local businesses.\n\nThe  Group  is  also  a  contributor  to  climate  change  as  it  emits greenhouse  gases  (CO 2 ),  both  directly  (through  its  Scope  1  and  2 emissions) and indirectly (Scope 3, via its value chain).\n\nSuch impacts caused by the Group could lead to temporary business interruptions in the regions or areas where the damage was caused. Furthermore,  there  could  be  legal  consequences  if  damage  is caused  in  an  area  that  is  subject  to  specific  environmental protection  regulations,  and/or  if  its  impact  leads  to  breaches  of pollution  thresholds  or  contamination  of  an  area  that  would  then require a remediation plan.\n\nFor  example,  an  accidental  spillage  of  vinasse  or  polluted  water could  affect  the  quality  of  the  surrounding  natural  environment, requiring  the  water  concerned  to  be  treated  at  a  treatment  plant. This could result in activity having to be temporarily suspended at the  site  concerned  in  order  to  identify  the  source  of  the  damage, and could also lead to the Group having to pay compensation for the impact caused.\n\nDepending  on  the  type  of  environmental  damage  involved,  there could  be  an  impact  on  the  health  and  safety  of  employees  and suppliers, requiring the site to be temporarily shut down or giving rise to financial penalties (such as higher carbon taxes as explained in  the  section  about  risks  related  to  climate  change).  There  could also be reputational repercussions for the Group.\n\nThe  potential  financial  impact  of  these  risks  on  the  Group  is  not considered to be significant, particularly regarding the introduction of stricter carbon emissions regulations, as described in the section about risks related to climate change.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nIn order to limit the risks of environmental damage, the Group has developed environmental standards that apply to all of its industrial sites. These guidelines cover all activities and potential impacts, including waste and wastewater management and treatment. They detail the steps to be taken to prevent any damage or impact on the environment and set out precise rules that must be followed.\n\nAdditionally, the Group has drawn up emergency procedures for unforeseeable accidental events such as leaks or unintentional spills, to enable incidents to be managed quickly and effectively and minimise their impact. Studies are carried out if a notification is made of any such incidents in order to identify the causes and factors that led to the damage concerned. The findings of these investigations are then incorporated into the Group's environmental standards to prevent similar events from happening again.\n\nThe Group's industrial sites are ISO 14001 certified, which means that they have highly effective environmental management systems. Each site subject to environmental risks also has a business continuity plan to apply in the event of an incident, in order to avoid temporary shutdowns and ensure that their local operations can carry on.\n\nLastly, with regard to the damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions, the Group's Sustainability & Responsibility policy - Good Times from a Good Place - is aimed at minimising its climate impact and environmental footprint across its value chain. Thanks to ambitious targets,  validated  by  the  Science  Based  Target  Initiative  (SBTi)  and  translated  into  effective  action  plans,  such  as  the  deployment  of Mechanical Vapour Recompression (MVR) technology, the risks faced by the Group in relation to environmental damage (both caused and suffered) are mitigated and anticipated. The Group has also indexed several financing transactions to environmental indicators, including Scope 1 and 2 emissions and the water used in its distilleries, clearly illustrating its objective of minimising its impact.\n\n- (1) This risk is also covered in section 3.3.2.2 of the Non-Financial Performance Statement.\n\n## 6. Product quality issues (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe main product quality issues that concern the Group arise from the quality level and compliance of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 product ingredients;\n- \u00b7 packaging;\n- \u00b7 the production process; and\n- \u00b7 the development process of new products.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nQuality  risk  management  is  based  on  a  joint  quality  management  approach  implemented  worldwide  at  all  production  affiliates. Coordinated by the Group's Operations Department, this risk management policy is based on internal Pernod Ricard standards and on systematic risk analyses.\n\nIt draws on the standards setting out best practices and minimum requirements in each of the areas concerned by quality:\n\n- \u00b7 foreign bodies;\n- \u00b7 contamination;\n- \u00b7 traceability;\n- \u00b7 quality control;\n- \u00b7 product recall/withdrawal, etc.\n\nIt is also underpinned by a mandatory quality certification programme for Group production sites based on a minimum of the following two international standards:\n\n- \u00b7 ISO 9001 for quality management; and\n- \u00b7 ISO 22000 for food safety management.\n\nDepending on their needs and goals, affiliates may also obtain FSSC 22000 and/or IFS and/or BRC certification.\n\n- (1) This risk is also covered in section 3.3.2.2 of the Non-Financial Performance Statement.\n\nThe success of the Group's brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of them.\n\nA  quality  issue  with  one  of  the  products  in  the  portfolio,  affecting the integrity of its brand or its image among consumers, could have a negative impact on the Group's sales.",

Regulatory constraints (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThroughout  the  world,  the  Group's  operations  are  subject  to  a growing number of regulations. Regulatory decisions and changes in  legal  and  regulatory  systems  could  have  adverse  impacts  on Pernod Ricard's business, particularly in the areas of advertising and promotions, labelling and access to distribution.\n\nIn almost all countries, the production, import/export and sale and distribution of alcohol are subject to special regulations, which are constantly changing. Similarly, the presentation, labelling, advertising  and  promotion  of  alcoholic  products  are  subject  to increasingly  strict  regulations,  often  intended  to  better  inform consumers about the risks  of  alcohol  abuse,  for  example  through health  warnings  on  labels,  or  to  minimise  the  exposure  of  at-risk groups such as minors.\n\nThe  religious,  cultural  and  media  environments  of  each  country result in a wide variety of regulations related to alcoholic beverages. There is a trend towards increased restrictions on these products, along with their promotion and distribution, at significantly different paces from country to country.\n\nMoreover, a large number of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) regulations are emerging throughout the world, particularly in the  European  Union,  compelling  the  Group  to  review  its  practices and put in place action and compliance plans, both for its reporting and  risk  management  processes  and  for  its  S&R  policies  and initiatives.\n\nRegulatory decisions and  changes  in  legal  and  regulatory requirements  in  these  areas  could  have  a  negative  impact  on Pernod Ricard's business as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 advertising  and  promotions: regulatory  authorities  in  the countries where the Group operates could impose restrictions on the advertising of alcoholic beverages (e.g., audio-visual or digital advertising  or  sponsorship  of  sporting  events).  One  effect  of these  limitations  would  be  to  prevent  or  restrict  the  Group's ability  to  retain  or  recruit  consumers  for  its  brands  in  a challenging competitive environment. Restrictions on advertising freedom  could  also  limit  the  Group's  ability  to  launch  new innovations.  They  therefore  have  a  significant  impact  on  the Group's  business.  Lastly,  some  countries  could  impose  price controls,  particularly  price  floors  aimed  at  limiting  promotions and  ultimately  sales  by  keeping  alcohol  relatively  expensive. These  policies,  which  have  historically  been  observed  in  certain specific  countries  (former  Soviet  Union,  Canada),  are  now  being introduced more widely (Scotland, Ireland) and apply in addition to specific taxes on alcohol;\n- \u00b7 labelling: changes  to  labelling  requirements  for  alcoholic beverages  could  diminish  the  appeal  of  these  products  for consumers,  who  might  switch  to  other  less  tightly  regulated products,  resulting  in  a  decline  in  sales.  Furthermore,  such changes  could  result  in  increasing  costs,  thereby  affecting  the Group's results;\n- \u00b7 access  to  distribution: government  authorities  in  countries where the Group operates may seek to restrict consumer access to the Group's products. For example, the prohibition of alcohol in Bihar (India) led to the cessation of Pernod Ricard's operations in  that  State.  Similarly,  restrictions  on  how,  when  and  where alcoholic  beverages  can  be  sold  are  regularly  implemented  in many  countries.  These  restrictions  tend  to  drive  consumers towards  illegal  or  parallel  distribution  channels,  which  compete with the Group's lawful business;\n- \u00b7 S&R  strategy,  actions  and  reporting: as  ESG  issues  grow  in number  and  become  an  increasingly  central  preoccupation  for various stakeholders  (civil society, investors, governments, companies,  etc.),  governmental  authorities  are  imposing  more and  more  regulations  to  provide  a  better  framework  for companies'  sustainability reporting and  ensure  that  they implement  strategies  and  actions  that  respond  both  to  the impacts  caused  by  their  businesses  and  to  the  underlying  risks and opportunities. However, the multitude of these regulations which  include  the  European  Non-Deforestation  Directive,  the Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting  Directive  (CSRD)  and  the future Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) could lead to a risk of non-compliance if compliance monitoring is not  sufficiently  rigorous.  Any  such  non-compliance  could  have reputational  and/or  legal  impacts  for  the  Group.  The  potential financial  impact  of  these  risks  on  the  Group  is  not  currently considered  significant,  but  this  could  change  in  the  future. Implementing  these  new  regulations  could  require  additional investment,  as  well  as  the  mobilisation  of  significant  internal resources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Pernod Ricard's teams promote the Group's positions and solutions to local decision-makers and lawmakers. Pernod Ricard does this indirectly through its membership in trade associations, or directly when the subject specifically concerns the Group.\n\nPernod Ricard is also committed to ensuring that the products distributed are promoted responsibly and in compliance with the ethical marketing or commercial standards of the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking (IARD). Internal controls are in place to ensure compliance  with  the  Pernod  Ricard  Code  for  Commercial  Communications,  which  sets  out  all  the  rules  applicable  to  marketing communications.\n\nIn  line  with  its  S&R  ambitions,  Pernod  Ricard  also  seeks  to  contribute  proactively  to  changing  legislation  and  practices  and  promote alternatives to exclusively repressive solutions to treat alcohol abuse, which have not proven effective. Currently, more than 150 initiatives to  prevent  the  effects  of  alcohol  abuse  and  dangerous  drinking  have  been  developed  by  the  Group  worldwide,  independently  or  with partners.  Since  2021,  three  pictograms  (warning  against  underage  drinking,  drinking  while  pregnant  and  drink-driving)  have  started appearing on all bottles produced by the Group's brands, three years ahead of the initial timetable (wherever permitted by regulations in the country of sale). A digital label in the form of a QR code has also been introduced on all Group products to inform consumers of the health risks associated with alcohol abuse and provide the list of ingredients and nutrition facts.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) action plan (2022-2030) to reduce the harmful use of alcohol recognises the role of self-regulation in marketing  (where  Pernod  Ricard  has  particularly  ethical  practices)  as  well  as  voluntary  consumer  information  practices,  such  as  the initiatives taken by the Group. This action plan provides Member States with a range of public policy options - without calling for a binding global  framework agreement - and reaffirms the value of public/private dialogue, taking a markedly different approach than with the tobacco industry.\n\nAs  part  of  its  work  on  preparing  for  upcoming  ESG  regulations,  particularly  the  CSRD,  the  Group  has  set  up  a  dedicated  internal governance  structure  that  regularly  monitors  regulatory  compliance  and  whose  members  include  representatives  from  all  of  the departments  involved  (Operations,  Human  Resources,  Finance,  Public  Affairs,  Legal,  etc.).  Pernod  Ricard  also  regularly  monitors  any changes in these regulations and any ensuing implications for the Group in order to ensure that each regulatory framework is strictly respected, in line with the Group's stated aims. Lastly, Pernod Ricard's S&R strategy gives a holistic view of the entire value chain and covers a wide range of ESG domains. Forming an integral part of the Group's business model, the S&R strategy - Good Times from a Good Place - and its roadmap to 2030 pave the way for these new regulations, the introduction of which has prompted the Group to step up the pace of the strategy's rollout.\n\n- (1) This risk is also covered in section 3.3.2.2 of the Non-Financial Performance Statement.",

Breach of compliance requirements (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPernod  Ricard  uses  its  own  distribution  affiliates  to  market  its products worldwide. For this reason, Pernod Ricard operates in many countries  where  anti-corruption  laws  may  have  an  extraterritorial impact.\n\nExamples  include  the  US  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act,  the  UK Bribery  Act  and  France's  Sapin  II  law.  The  Group  must  therefore take into account and rigorously monitor the risk of corruption and influence peddling, and understand how such risks are treated by all relevant legal systems, in all regions of the world where it operates. Company employees may interact, sometimes only marginally, with political  and administrative officials. The nature of Pernod Ricard's business,  driven  by  its Cr\u00e9ateurs  de  convivialit\u00e9 vision,  means  that\n\ninappropriate invitations may be sent to public officials. The  Group  is  also  required  to  comply  with  requirements  set  by personal  data  protection  regulations,  including  the  General  Data Protection  Regulation  (GDPR).  It  must  also  comply  with  France's Duty of Care law, which aims to prevent violations of human rights, health and safety and environmental standards. In addition, the UK Modern  Slavery  Act  2015  requires  Group  affiliates  to  publish  a statement  on  the  measures  taken  to  prevent  slavery  and  human trafficking  in  their  operations  and  supply  chain.  Similar  laws  also exist in Australia (2018) and in Canada (2024) against forced labour and child labour.\n\nRecent  regulations  concerning,  in  particular,  the  fight  against corruption  and  influence  peddling,  and  compliance  with  business ethics  expose  Pernod  Ricard  to  the  risk  of  administrative  and criminal sanctions, as well as a reputational risk in the event of noncompliance.\n\nIn addition,  certain  corrupt  practices,  consisting  of  offering excessive  and/or  inappropriate  benefits,  even  without  deliberate intention to obtain an undue advantage, are severely punished by the  anti-corruption  laws  of  three  of  the  main  countries  where  the Group  operates  and  provide  for  the  criminal  liability  of  both  the legal entities and the individuals involved, and entail heavy financial penalties  for  the  company  as  well  as  for  the  perpetrators  of  such practices.\n\nReputational damage resulting from a legal conviction or breach of regulations could damage the Company's overall credibility, and an illicit  or  reprehensible  act,  even  if  it  consists  of  an  isolated  event, could  negatively  impact  all  Group  employees  seeking  to  deliver  a message to public authorities. This would hamper efforts to legally lobby  against  legislation  that  is  harmful  to  the  Group's  business sector. It could also result in regulatory changes that may damage the Company's business (tax increases, marketing restrictions, etc.). The risk  of  non-compliance  with  the  applicable  regulations  on  the protection  of  personal  data  exposes  Pernod  Ricard  to  a  risk  of administrative  sanctions  (including  financial  sanctions  of  up  to \u20ac20 million or 4% of annual global revenue in the case of the GDPR) and criminal sanctions, as well as a reputational risk, in the event of non-compliance.  Disputes  may  arise  from  failure  to  comply  with these  regulations,  as  well  as  from  failure  to  comply  with  France's Duty of Care law.\n\nFor these reasons, all such regulations could have a negative impact on the Group's business.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nPernod Ricard has drawn up a risk map for corruption and influence peddling, updated in 2022. This tool aims to identify and manage corruption and influence peddling risks inherent to the Group's business and specific to production and distribution processes, as well as cross-functional  risks.  The  Group  is  also  committed  to  promoting  a  'zero  tolerance'  policy  clearly  communicated  by  the  Group's management and relayed by local management to the affiliates. Specific rules for employees and stakeholders have also been put in place, as set out in the Group's Code of Business Conduct, which was also updated in 2022. The Code is backed by a mandatory online course, fully reviewed and refreshed in May 2023, to help exposed employees better understand the risks of breaches (including corruption and influence  peddling  risks,  in  particular)  and  to  enable  them  to  adopt  the  appropriate  preventative  behaviours.  Pernod  Ricard  has  also implemented  the  following  digital  tools  to  support  its  compliance  initiatives:  Speak  Up,  a  global  whistleblowing  platform  to  report behaviour  that  violates  the  Code  of  Business  Conduct  and,  more  generally,  applicable  law;  Gifted!,  an  application  dedicated  to  the declaration and approval of gifts and invitations; and Partner Up, a dedicated platform for assessing third parties working with the Group. In  line  with  changes  in  legislation  and  stakeholder  expectations  around  these  issues,  the  Group  has  also  embarked  on  due  vigilance processes for human rights and the environment throughout its value chain. In 2024, the Group's Vigilance Plan was revised to take into account  new  regulatory  requirements  in  terms  of  CSR  compliance.  In  particular,  the  Group  decided  to  strengthen  its  due  diligence approaches  around  human  rights  and  procurement,  building  on  the  work  carried  out  in  previous  years.  For  example,  Blue  Source,  a mandatory process for all Pernod Ricard's direct purchases, which has been in place since 2015, has been extensively revised. The purpose of this process is to ensure that the Group's partners are compliant in these areas and support them in implementing action plans where necessary. Potential partners who are assessed and do not meet the standards are not selected to support the Group in its operations.\n\nIn addition, the Group's lobbying policy is governed by specific guidelines as well as the Code of Business Conduct, which contains specific provisions to prevent any reprehensible practices, even if unintentional. In France, Pernod Ricard files a disclosure statement with the French High Authority for Transparency in Public Life ( Haute Autorit\u00e9 pour la Transparence de la Vie Publique - HATVP) (2) and is a member of Transparency  International's Forum  des  Entreprises  Engag\u00e9es (3) .  The  Group  is  also  a  joint  signatory  of  a  best  practices  guide  on parliamentary lobbying spending published by Transparency International.\n\nLastly, Pernod Ricard has implemented a strong personal data protection strategy and governance. The Group has drawn up a roadmap on this  subject.  The  Group  DPO  (Data  Protection  Officer)  and  the  Group's  personal  data  protection  network  enable  Pernod  Ricard  to implement data protection compliance actions, implement policies and procedures at local level, and share best practices.\n\n- (1) This risk is also covered in section 3.3.2.2 of the Non-Financial Performance Statement.\n- (2) https://www.hatvp.fr/fiche-organisation/?organisation=582041943 (French only).\n- (3) https://transparency-france.org/entreprise/forum-des-entreprises-engagees (French only).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Taxes and levies (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nAs an international player in the Wine & Spirits sector, the Group is very sensitive to changes in indirect taxation, in particular customs duties  and  excise  taxes  on  alcoholic  beverages,  such  as  the temporary  retaliatory  duties  introduced  by  the  US  government  in 2019  on  imports  of  single  malt  Scotch  whisky  and  Spanish  wines. This was followed by duties on certain categories of cognac in 2021. The Group is also exposed to possible changes to tax regulations in the  countries  where  it  operates,  particularly  with  regard  to  direct taxation, notably at the instigation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD),  the  European  Union  and national  governments  (such  as  changes  in  tax  rates,  the  ongoing Pillar Two tax reform or the EU Public CBCR proposal), and changes to accounting policies and standards.\n\nPernod Ricard may also be subject to tax audits in several countries, and  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  tax  authorities  will  accept  the positions taken by the Group, even if the Group deems them to be correct and reasonable in view of its operations.\n\nAn increase in import duties and excise taxes or a change in laws relative to duty free sales could result in an increase in the price of the  Group's  products  and  a  reduction  in  the  consumption  of  its Wine & Spirits brands or an increase in the Group's costs, thereby affecting  the  Group's  financial  position  and  operating  profit. Nevertheless,  this  risk  is  mitigated  by  significant  advertising  and promotional investment which can, in certain cases, limit the impact on consumption of an increase in prices.\n\nOther changes in tax regulations could also have a material impact on the Group's results, such as an increase in the corporate tax rate in the countries where the Group operates.\n\nLastly,  in  the  event  that  the  tax  authorities  successfully  challenge the Group on any material positions, the Group may be subject to additional  tax  liabilities  that  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the Group's financial position if they are not covered by provisions or if they otherwise trigger a need for a cash payment.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nThe  Group's  tax  policy  is  based  on  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  sound  conduct  and  proactive  and  efficient  tax management. It involves the rejection of all artificial arrangements, the application of a transfer pricing policy based on the arm's length principle, efficient organisation of the tax function within the Group and transparent dealing with tax authorities. Very often, when the Group is confronted with increases in customs duties that affect the entire Wine & Spirits sector in a given country, the authorities of the exporting country provide diplomatic support to resolve the problem. Furthermore, the Group's diversification in terms of geographies and product categories is another way it mitigates the potential impact of tax risks.\n\n- (1) This risk is also covered in section 3.7.2 of the Non-Financial Performance Statement.\n\n## 4. Illicit trade and parallel markets\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe  Group's  trademarks  are  key  to  its  competitiveness.  However, they are threatened by various forms of illicit and parallel trade, including unauthorised  reproduction  and  use,  imitation,  use  of  misleading symbols and bottle refills using counterfeit liquids, etc.\n\nUnauthorised  flows  of  authentic  products  affect  the  Group's performance by unfairly competing with products from its approved distribution  network.  In  addition  to  this,  fraudulent  imitations  and reproductions  pose  a  serious  threat  to  consumer  health  as  the growing  sophistication  of  counterfeiting  techniques  is  making authentication increasingly difficult.\n\nIllicit trade and parallel markets undeniably represent missed sales opportunities  for  the  Group,  which  impact  its  financial  results. Fraudulent use of the Group's trademarks also damages its image and reputation, and could cause consumers to avoid our products if authenticity  were  not  guaranteed  (in  the  case  of  refills  and counterfeit finished products) or if third parties intentionally created confusion with the Group's trademarks (brand imitation).\n\nIllicit  trade  also  increases operating costs. While legal action is the preferred option and usually results in a satisfactory outcome, these measures  represent  a  cost  for  the  Group  (legal  fees,  storage  and destruction costs, etc.). In some countries, it can also be difficult to obtain swift and dissuasive penalties against counterfeiters.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nA specific organisation has been put in place to protect and defend the Group's IP rights and its products, designed to maximise efficiency while minimising costs.\n\nThe Global Trade Intelligence team leads the fight against illicit trade in the Group's products worldwide by coordinating all action against counterfeiting (identical/near-identical reproduction of the Group's trademarks on bottles) and other forms of trafficking. This action takes the form of investigations on the ground or online, and legal action combined with initiatives to raise awareness among local authorities. The  Global  Trade  Intelligence  team  also  supports  the  teams  at  the  Group's  headquarters  and  affiliates  in  developing  technical/ technological  measures  to  improve  product  protection,  traceability  and  authentication.  Examples  of  such  measures  include  a  scheme based  on  the  principle  of  the  smart  bottle,  introduced  in  strategic  markets  such  as  China,  which  enables  consumers  to  check  the authenticity of the Group's products using a QR code integrated into the packaging.\n\nThe defence of IP rights also involves operational staff, who are called on to identify imitations (products/trademarks) on the market and pass on all necessary information to the above teams for action.\n\nThe Group also set up a centralised team in late 2014 to protect trademarks, known as the Group Intellectual Property Hub. This unit protects the Group's IT rights and defends them against any attempt by third parties to file similar rights, thereby preventing consumers from being misled and the Group's brands from being undermined or diluted. It also protects anti-counterfeiting innovations through patents.  Since  1  July  2022,  this  team  has  also  been  responsible  for  IP  litigation,  which  used  to  be  managed  by  the  Brand  Companies. IP litigation is any legal action taken to remedy (i) counterfeiting (identical reproduction of the Group's trademarks on any medium other than  bottles)  and  (ii)  brand  imitation  (on  any  medium  whatsoever),  including  online.  This  new  organisation  further  strengthens  the effectiveness of the fight against unauthorised use of the Group's rights and optimises protection strategies.",

In addition, the Group routinely faces litigation in the normal course of business.\n\nThe  Group  provides  for  provisions  for  all  litigation  in  which  it  is involved and all contingencies it faces. At 30 June 2024, these provisions totalled  \u20ac405  million,  compared  with  \u20ac390  million  at  30  June  2023 (see Note 4.7 Provisions to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nMajor  litigation  of  any  type  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the Group's financial position (in the event of a fine or damages), or the Group's image and reputation due to media coverage and posts on social  media,  and  may  result  in  the  loss  of  rights,  in  particular IP rights (such as the cancellation of a trademark).\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nTo  avoid  litigation,  the  Legal  Department,  which  is  responsible  for  the  Group's  protection  and  defence,  has  implemented  preventive measures. Marketing and operational teams are made aware of legal issues on an ongoing basis, model agreements are provided, and legal  teams  provide  support  at  the  very  early  stages  of  projects.  Legal  functions  have  been  established  at  regional  and  local  levels  to ensure better local monitoring. In addition, a quarterly report listing the major risks identified by local legal teams, particularly with regard to  compliance,  counterfeiting,  cyberattacks,  personal  data  and  potential  major  litigation,  is  sent  to  headquarters  staff,  who  oversee coordination.\n\n## IV.  Financial risks\n\nThe Group's main financial risks are market, credit and liquidity risks.  They  are  measured  and  managed  via  risk  management policies and procedures put in place to reduce their occurrence or impact.\n\nIn a persistently uncertain economic environment, to manage the liquidity  risk  that  may  result  from  the  repayment  of  financial liabilities  at  their  contractual  maturity,  Pernod  Ricard  has  taken precautionary measures to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet its needs and continues to diversify its sources of financing, thereby limiting dependence on lenders.\n\nIn September 2023, the Group carried out a \u20ac1.350 billion bond issue (a \u20ac600 million tranche maturing in four years and a \u20ac750 million tranche  maturing  in  ten  years) (1) and  redeemed  a  \u20ac500  million bond in October 2023. These transactions substantially extended the average maturity of the Group's bond debt.\n\n## 1. Foreign exchange risk (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nDue  to  its  international  presence,  the  Group  is  exposed  to fluctuations in the currencies it operates in (excluding the euro, its functional and reporting currency) and uses to record its assets and liabilities (transaction and translation risks).\n\nFluctuations of this nature may therefore have an impact on Pernod Ricard's results and shareholders' equity. The risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 translation  risk  for  the  financial  statements  of  consolidated affiliates using a functional currency other than the euro; and\n- \u00b7 transaction risks on operating cash flows not denominated in the entities' functional currency.\n\nMoreover,  currency  fluctuations  against  the  euro  (notably  the  US dollar)  may  impact  the  nominal  amount  of  liabilities  and  the financial  expense  recorded  in  euros  in  the  consolidated  financial statements, which could affect the Group's reported results.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nAs a rule, it is Group policy to invoice end customers in the functional currency of the distributing entity. The resulting net foreign exchange exposures are hedged by the use of forward instruments.\n\nResidual risks may be partially hedged by the use of financial derivatives (forward purchases, forward sales or options) intended to hedge highly probable receivables or payables or to secure the receipt of dividends.\n\nIn  terms  of  asset  risk,  financing  foreign  currency-denominated  assets  acquired  by  the  Group  with  debt  in  the  same  currency  provides natural hedging.\n\n- (1) Note 4.9 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAt 30 June 2024, the Group's cash position stood at \u20ac2.7 billion, in addition  to  approximately  \u20ac2.9  billion  in  undrawn  committed credit lines, including a \u20ac2.1 billion revolving credit line set up in April 2023.\n\nThe  loan  agreements  notably  include  obligations  to  provide lenders with information and comply with certain commitments customary to this type of arrangement (in particular that the loan will continue to rank pari passu ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Interest rate risk (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPernod Ricard is exposed to changes in interest rates on its financial liabilities and its liquid assets. Such changes may have a positive or negative effect on its financial expenses.\n\nAt  30  June  2024,  the  Group's  debt  consisted  of  floating-rate  debt (2%)  and  fixed-rate  debt  (98%),  in  addition  to  a  hedging  portfolio intended to limit the negative effects of interest rate fluctuations.\n\nThe Group is affected by changes in interest rates in its functional currency and, more marginally, by changes in the interest rates of other currencies contributing to its consolidated net debt. A rise or fall of 50 basis points in interest rates (euro or US dollar) would result in an increase or decrease of \u20ac4 million in the cost of net debt.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nAs part of its financing policy, the Pernod Ricard Group seeks to limit interest rate risk by favouring fixed-rate funding for a significant portion of its debt.\n\n- (1) Note 4.9 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3. Credit risk (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nCredit  risk  for  the  Group  primarily  consists  of  the  risk  of  financial loss  stemming from a default (cash flow difficulties or liquidation) among customers indebted to a Group affiliate.\n\nThe non-recovery of a trade receivable in the event of a customer default or liquidation would have a negative impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nThe diversity and size of the Group's distribution network, spread across many countries, and the diversification of its main customers in the supermarket sector, limit its exposure to this risk.\n\nInternal procedures are in place to assess the financial health of the Group's customers and adapt credit terms and activity as appropriate. Lastly, credit risk is mitigated through credit insurance coverage with the standard guarantees. In this way, the Group's risk management policy transfers part of the risk to insurers.\n\n- (1) Note 4.9 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 4. Pension funds (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe Group's unfunded pension obligations amounted to \u20ac277 million at 30 June 2024. During FY 2024, the Group's contributions to pension plans totalled \u20ac70 million.\n\nThe Group's pension obligations are for the most part covered by balance sheet provisions and partially by pension funds or insurance. The amount of these provisions is based on certain actuarial assumptions, including, for example, discounting factors, demographic trends, pension trends, future salary trends and expected returns on plan assets.\n\nThe  asset/liability  balance  is  subject  to,  among  other  factors,  the performance of invested assets. A liquidity crisis or major financial shock  could  significantly  undermine  the  performance  of  financial assets  and  jeopardise  the  asset/liability  balance.  A  pronounced asset/liability  imbalance  may  require  an  increase  in  the  Group's pension obligations recognised in the balance sheet and result in an increase in the provision for pensions. This could have a significant negative impact on the Group's financial results.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION\n\nSpecific  governance  and  a  management  policy  have  been  implemented  and  are  regularly  reviewed  in  line  with  the  risk  profile  of  the Group's various pension plans. The investment strategy is subject to frequent review in order to minimise the volatility of assets. The buy-in transaction completed in September 2019 for the largest of the Group's pension funds is a concrete example of the proactive strategy to minimise risks. The fund's Trustee purchased an insurance policy from a highly rated and well-established insurance company to cover the majority of the pension obligations. The insurance policy therefore reduces the Group's exposure for that fund to funding deficits arising from market risks, including inflation and interest rate risks, and longevity risks. In addition, defined-benefit plans (mainly for affiliates in North America, the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe) are subject to an\n\nannual actuarial valuation on the basis of country-specific assumptions.\n\n- (1) Note 4.7 to the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## 4.3 Insurance and risk coverage\n\nFor  Pernod  Ricard,  insurance  represents  a  solution  for  the financial transfer of major risks facing the Group. This transfer is accompanied by a policy of prevention to reduce risk as much as possible. The Group carefully evaluates its risks in order to finetune the level of coverage of the risks it incurs.\n\nThe  Group  has  two  types  of  coverage:  Group  insurance programmes  and  local  policies.  The  Group  programmes  are monitored by the Audit Director who coordinates the insurance and  risk  management  policy,  as  well  as  by  an  operational  risk manager in charge of monitoring industrial risk prevention.\n\n## 4.3.1 Insurance policies\n\nIn  order  to  cover  the  main  risks,  Pernod  Ricard  has  set  up international  insurance  programmes  for  all  Group  affiliates, except  where  this  is  not  possible  due  to  local  regulatory constraints. These programmes provide the following coverage:\n\n- \u00b7 property damage and business interruption losses;\n- \u00b7 operating/product liability, including costs and losses incurred by the Group due to accidental and/or criminal contamination;\n- \u00b7 environmental liability;\n- \u00b7 Corporate Officers' civil liability;\n\n## 4.3.2 Coverage\n\n| Type of insurance                                          | Coverage and limits on the main insurance policies (1)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Property damage and business  interruption losses          | \u00b7 Coverage: comprehensive (except exclusions). \u00b7 Basis of compensation: \u00b7 replacement value for personal property and rebuild value for real estate, except for certain  affiliates  who  have  chosen,  with  the  contractual  agreement  of  the  insurers,  to  use  another  basis of compensation;

All these players have the experience and resources required to manage exceptional situations.\n\n## 4.4 Risks and litigation: provisioning procedure\n\nIn the course of its business, the Pernod Ricard Group is involved in legal proceedings and subject to tax, customs and administrative audits. The Group only recognises provisions for risks and contingencies when it is probable that a present obligation arising as a result of a past event will require the payment of an amount that can be estimated reliably. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the liability. Provisions may therefore require the use of judgement by Group management.\n\n## 4.5 Financial and accounting information\n\n## 4.5.1 Preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements\n\nIn addition to the management information described above, the Group prepares interim and annual consolidated financial statements. This  process  is  managed  by  the  Consolidation  Department attached to the Group's Finance Department, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 communication  of  the  main  Group  accounting  and  financial policies through a procedures manual;\n- \u00b7 preparation  of  specific  instructions  by  the  Consolidation Department,  including  a  detailed  timetable,  that  are  shared with the affiliates prior to each consolidation;\n- \u00b7 preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  on  the basis of the information provided, to cover the entire scope of consolidation; and\n- \u00b7 use  of  a  common  software  package  by  Group  affiliates.  The maintenance  of  this  software  package  and  user  training  are carried out by the Group's Finance Department, with occasional assistance from external consultants.\n\nIn  addition,  consolidated  affiliates  sign  a  letter  of  representation addressed  to  the  Statutory  Auditors,  which  is  also  sent  to headquarters. In this letter, the management of each consolidated affiliate certifies that the financial information sent to headquarters  as  part  of  the  consolidation  process  gives  a  true and fair view of the company's position and results of operations.\n\n## 4.5.2 Preparation of Pernod Ricard's parent company financial statements\n\nPernod Ricard prepares its parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

        "page_content": "## 5.5 Definition of alternative performance measures and reconciliation to IFRS measures\n\nPernod Ricard's management process is based on the following alternative performance measures (APMs), which have been chosen for planning  and  reporting  purposes.  The  Group's  management  believes  that  these  measures  provide  valuable  additional  information for users of the financial statements in understanding the Group's performance. These APMs should be considered as complementary to IFRS measures and reported movements therein.\n\n## 5.5.1 Organic growth\n\nOrganic  growth  is  calculated  after  excluding  the  impacts  of exchange  rate  movements,  acquisitions  and  disposals,  changes in applicable accounting principles and hyperinflation.\n\nThe exchange rate impact is calculated by translating the current year's  results  at  the  prior  year's  exchange  rates  and  by  adding changes in the current and prior years' translation adjustments.\n\nFor  acquisitions  in  the  current  year,  the  post-acquisition  results are  excluded  from  the  organic  movement  calculations.  For acquisitions in the prior year, post-acquisition results are included in the prior year but are only included in the organic movement calculations of the current year from the anniversary date of the acquisition.\n\nThe impact of hyperinflation on profit from recurring operations in  Turkey  and  Argentina  is  excluded  from  organic  growth calculations  by  capping  local  unit  price/cost  increases  to  a maximum of 26% per year, equivalent to 100% over three years.\n\n## 5.5.2 Free cash flow\n\nFree  cash  flow  comprises  net  cash  from  operating  activities,  aggregated  with  the  proceeds  from  disposals  of  property,  plant  and equipment and intangible assets and after deduction of capital expenditure.\n\n## 5.5.3 'Recurring' measures\n\nThe  following  three  measures  represent  key  indicators  for  the measurement  of  the  recurring  performance  of  the  business, excluding significant items that, because of their nature and their infrequent occurrence, cannot be considered as inherent to the recurring performance of the Group:\n\n## \u00b7 Recurring free cash flow\n\nRecurring free cash flow is calculated by restating free cash flow for non-recurring items.\n\n## \u00b7 Profit from recurring operations\n\nProfit from recurring operations corresponds to operating profit excluding other non-recurring operating income and expenses.\n\n## \u00b7 Group share of net profit from recurring operations\n\nGroup share of net profit from recurring operations corresponds to  net  profit  attributable  to  Group  shareholders  before  other non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses,  non-recurring financial income and expenses and non-recurring income taxes.\n\n## 5.5.4 Net debt\n\nNet debt, as defined and used by the Group, corresponds to total gross debt (translated at the closing rate), including lease liabilities and derivatives designated as fair value hedges and net foreign currency asset hedges (hedging of net investments and similar), less cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## 5.5.5 EBITDA\n\nEBITDA stands for 'earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation'. EBITDA is an accounting measure calculated using the Group's profit from recurring operations excluding depreciation and amortisation on operating fixed assets.\n\nWhere  a  business,  brand,  brand  distribution  right  or  agency agreement was disposed of or terminated in the prior year, the Group excludes the results for that business from the prior year in the organic movement calculations. For disposals or terminations in  the  current  year,  the  Group  excludes  the  results  for  that business  from  the  prior  year  from  the  date  of  the  disposal  or termination.\n\nThis measure enables users to compare the Group's performance on a like-for-like basis, focusing on areas that local management is most directly able to influence.",

One of the provisions of these agreements concerned the creation  of  a  joint  venture  in  Japan  called  Suntory  Allied  Ltd,  in which 49.99% of the share capital and voting rights are owned by Allied Domecq and 50.01% by Suntory Ltd. Suntory Allied Ltd has\n\nbeen  granted  the  exclusive  distribution  rights  for  certain  Allied Domecq brands in Japan until 31 March 2029.\n\nThe  management  of  Suntory  Allied  Ltd  is  jointly  controlled  by Pernod  Ricard,  as  successor-in-interest  to  Allied  Domecq,  and Suntory Ltd.\n\n## 5.6.1.2 Sale and repurchase agreements\n\nPernod Ricard did not enter into any sale and repurchase agreements during FY 2024.\n\n## 5.6.2 Financing contracts\n\n## 5.6.2.1 Credit agreements\n\n## 2023 Credit Agreement\n\nOn 27 April 2023, Pernod Ricard and certain of its affiliates signed a new sustainability-linked loan totalling \u20ac2.1 billion (the ' Credit Agreement ')  in  order  to  refinance  ahead  of  term  its  existing \u20ac2.5  billion  credit  facility  maturing  in  June  2024.  The  initial maturity  date  of  the  Credit  Agreement  is  five  years,  expiring  on 27 April 2028, with an option to extend for one year at the end of the fifth year and an additional year at the end of the sixth year. The first extension option was exercised in March 2024, extending the  maturity  to  27  April  2029.  The  facility  is  linked  to  two environmental commitments: a reduction in the Group's absolute greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) and a reduction in its water consumption per unit of alcohol produced.\n\nThe obligations of each of the borrowers under the Credit Agreement are  guaranteed  by  Pernod  Ricard.  No  security  interest (s\u00fbret\u00e9 r\u00e9elle) was granted under the terms of the Credit Agreement.\n\nThe  Credit  Agreement  includes  an  'Accordion'  feature  which allows for borrowing of up to an additional \u20ac400 million beyond the initial \u20ac2.1 billion allocation.\n\n## 5.6.2.2 Bond issues\n\nThe Group has issued bonds (the ' Bonds ') through (i)  Pernod  Ricard,  and  (ii)  Pernod  Ricard  International  Finance LLC, a wholly owned affiliate of Pernod Ricard, whose issues are guaranteed by Pernod Ricard.\n\nThe  nominal  amount  of  the  Bonds  and  the  interest  thereon constitute  direct,  unsubordinated  and  unsecured  obligations  of the issuer in question, ranking equally amongst themselves and pari  passu with  all  other  unsecured  and  unsubordinated  debt, present and future, of said issuer. In addition, Pernod Ricard and Pernod Ricard International Finance LLC have undertaken not to grant  any  security  interests  in  respect  of  bonds  or  other  debt securities admitted, or liable to be admitted, to trading on a regulated market,  an  over-the-counter  market  or  other  stock  exchange\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 Credit Agreement (Bilateral Credit)\n\nOn  22  March  2022,  Pernod  Ricard  and  Pernod  Ricard  Finance entered into a bilateral revolving credit agreement (the ' Bilateral Credit Agreemen t', referred to jointly with the Credit Agreement as  the  ' credit  agreements ') with  a  principal  amount  of \u20ac500 million, for an initial period of three years, with the option of an extension of one year at the end of the third year and one additional year at the end of the fourth year.\n\nThe  obligations  of  Pernod  Ricard  Finance  under  the  Bilateral Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Pernod Ricard. No security interest (s\u00fbret\u00e9  r\u00e9elle) was  granted  under  the  terms  of  the Bilateral Credit Agreement.\n\n## Provisions of the credit agreements\n\nThe  credit  agreements  contain  customary  representations  and warranties, as well as the usual restrictive covenants contained in such contracts.\n\nunless the bonds benefit from similar collateral or other collateral approved,  as  the  case  may  be,  by  the  mass  of  bondholders (Pernod Ricard) or by the meeting of bondholders (Pernod Ricard International Finance LLC).\n\nThese bond issues include a clause regarding change of control, which  could  trigger  the  compulsory  early  repayment  of  Bonds upon request of each bondholder in the event of a change of control of  Pernod  Ricard  (benefiting  a  person  or  a  group  of  persons acting in concert) and leading to a deterioration in Pernod Ricard's credit rating.\n\nIn addition, bondholders may request early redemption of these Bonds if certain customary events of default arise.",

Under the terms of the Programme, Pernod Ricard and Pernod Ricard International Finance LLC may issue Bonds by means of private placements  in  various  currencies.  The  issues  of  Pernod  Ricard International Finance  LLC  under  the  programme  will  be guaranteed by Pernod Ricard SA. The securities may be admitted\n\n## 5.6.2.4 Sustainability-linked bond\n\nOn 7 April 2022, Pernod Ricard conducted its first issuance of bonds incorporating environmental commitments, totalling \u20ac750 million with a maturity of seven years.\n\nOn 2  November  2022,  Pernod  Ricard  conducted  two  new  bond issuances  incorporating  the  same  environmental  commitments. The first  issuance  was  for  \u20ac600  million  with  a  six-year  maturity, and  the  second  issuance  was  for  \u20ac500  million  with  a  ten-year maturity.\n\nPernod Ricard has chosen two Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are relevant, core and material to its overall business and of strategic  significance  to  the  Group's  current  and/or  future\n\nto trading on Euronext Paris. The maximum nominal amount of securities outstanding under the Programme is set at \u20ac7 billion (or the equivalent in any other currency). During the meeting on 24 April 2024, the Board of Directors authorised Pernod Ricard to issue  bonds  under  the  Programme  up  to  a  total  maximum nominal amount of \u20ac2,850 billion less any amounts issued since 30  August  2023  (or  the  equivalent  in  any  other  currency)  for  a period of one year from 24 April 2024.\n\noperations. The KPIs are aligned with the S&R roadmap and the United Nations 2030 SDGs. For these two KPIs, Pernod Ricard has set  ambitious  Sustainability  Performance  Targets  (SPTs)  to highlight its commitment and leadership across the sector, with both short-term and long-term trajectories.\n\nThe  two  criteria  chosen  are  related  to  environmental  topics  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 absolute reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 and 2);\n- \u00b7 reduction in water consumption per unit of alcohol produced at distilleries.\n\nIn regard to the key performance indicators to which the bond is linked, Pernod Ricard monitored its performance during the financial year, and progress towards the targets:\n\n| KPI                                                                          | SPT                                                                                                                         |   FY 2018  baseline (1) |   FY 2024  performance (1) | Change   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|----------|\n| Absolute Scope 1 and 2  GHG emissions (ktCO 2 e)  - Market-based             | 26% reduction by FY 2025 (emissions below 220 ktCO 2 e) 54% reduction by FY 2030 (emissions below 138 ktCO 2 e)             |                     298 |                      208   | -30 %    |\n| Water consumption per  unit of alcohol produced  in distilleries (m 3 /kLAA) | 12.5% reduction by FY 2025 (consumption below 16.7 m 3 /kLAA) 20.9% reduction by FY 2030 (consumption below 15.1 m 3 /kLAA) |                      19 |                       16.6 | -13 %    |\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions in absolute terms (Scopes 1 and 2, as defined in the Group's Sustainability Linked Financing Framework  issued  in  September  2023)  fell  by  around  30% between FY 2018 and FY 2024.\n\nThis  progress  reflects  the  efforts  made  by  the  Group  in  recent years to achieve its 2030 objective, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 the numerous  investments made  in  energy  efficiency (such as the replacement of boilers with high energy efficiency units  and  the  recycling  of  steam  using  mechanical  vapour recompression technology);\n- \u00b7 the  increased use  of  biofuels and  biomass  in  distilleries, especially at the Dalmunach site;\n- \u00b7 the installation of on-site solar panels ; and\n- \u00b7 the  purchase  of  renewable  electricity through  PPAs  and green certificates in recent years.\n\nIn particular, the Nashik site in India has fully transitioned to the exclusive  use  of  biomass  in  its  boilers,  instead  of  coal,  thereby reducing  its  Scope  1  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  around 3,500  tCO 2 e.  In  addition,  the  Midleton  site  in  Ireland  has  been able  to  reduce  its  Scope  1  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by 7,500  tCO 2 e  thanks  to  the  deployment  of  mechanical  vapour recompression (MVR) technology on its stills and the installation of boilers that consume less energy.\n\nIn FY 2024, water consumption at distilleries fell by around 13% in intensity versus FY 2018. This improved performance is attributable to  the  programmes  put  in  place  across  the  Group's  distilleries, designed to optimise industrial  processes,  invest  in  distribution networks  and  enhance  water  recycling  measures.  In  particular, projects run this year to enhance rainwater collection and restore the permeate filter for wastewater treatment at the Midleton site have  slashed  its  water  consumption  by  around  380,000  m 3 . The Glenlivet site in Scotland has also reduced its water consumption by some 18,000 m 3 by  installing  a  closed-loop  reuse  system  for cooling tower water.\n\nThese key performance indicators have been subject to verification by an independent third party, which provided a limited assurance conclusion.  The  report  is  available  on  the  Group's  website.

Changes in accounting standards\n\n## Standards, amendments and interpretations applicable since 1 July 2023\n\nSince  1  July  2023,  the  following  standards,  amendments  and interpretations are effective:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendment  to  IAS  12  'Income  Taxes'  -  International  Tax Reform: Pillar Two Model Rules;\n- \u00b7 Amendment to IAS  1  'Presentation  of  Financial  Statements': Disclosure of Accounting Policies.\n\nThe application of these amendments had no material impact on the Group's financial statements at 30 June 2024.\n\nOECD  Pillar  Two  rules  providing  for  a  15%  minimum  tax  per jurisdiction for multinational corporations have been adopted by the EU and should therefore apply as from 1 January 2024. The corresponding  European  Directive  was  transposed  into  French law  in  December  2023.  Pernod  Ricard  has  applied  the  exemption under  the  IAS  12  amendment  regarding  the  recognition  and disclosure  of  deferred  taxes  under  Pillar  Two.  Accordingly,  no deferred tax was recognised in the consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2024 with respect to additional future income tax.\n\nThe Group is actively working to implement these new regulations. Based on recent analyses, the Group does not anticipate that this amendment  will  have  a  material  impact  on  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3. Measurement basis\n\nThe  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  the historical cost method, except for certain categories of assets and liabilities,  which  are  measured  in  accordance  with  the  methods provided by IFRS.\n\n## 4. Principal uncertainties arising from the use of estimates and judgements by management\n\n## Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS means that Group management makes a certain number of  estimates  and  assumptions  which  have  an  impact  on  the amount of the Group's assets and liabilities, and items of profit and loss during the financial year. These estimates are made on the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern and  are  based  on  information  available  at  the  time  of  their preparation. Estimates may be revised where the circumstances on  which  they  were  based  change  or  where  new  information becomes  available.  Future  outcomes  can  differ  from  these estimates.\n\n## Goodwill and intangible assets\n\nAs explained in Note 4.1 Intangible assets and goodwill , in addition to  annual  impairment  tests  applied  to  goodwill  and  intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (such as trademarks), the Group carries  out  spot  impairment  tests  where  there  is  an  indication that an intangible asset may be impaired. Any impairment loss is calculated using discounted future cash flows and/or the market values  of  the  assets  in  question.  These  calculations  require  the use  of  assumptions  regarding  market  conditions  and  projected cash flows, and any changes in these assumptions may thus lead to results different from those initially estimated.\n\n## Provisions for pensions and other long-term employee benefits\n\nAs explained in Note 4.7 Provisions , the Group runs defined benefit and  defined  contribution  pension  plans.  In  addition,  provisions are  also  recognised  in  virtue  of  certain  other  post-employment benefits  such  as  life  insurance  and  medical  care  (mainly  in  the United States and the United Kingdom). The carrying amount of these provisions at the balance sheet date is set out in Note 4.7 Provisions .\n\nThese benefit obligations are based on a number of assumptions such as discount rates, future salary increases, employee turnover and life expectancy.\n\nThese assumptions are generally updated annually. The assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 and the procedures used in their determination  are  set  out  in  Note  4.7  Provisions .  The  Group considers  that  the  actuarial  assumptions  used  are  appropriate and justified.  However, such actuarial assumptions may change in the future and this may have a material impact on the amount of  the  Group's  benefit  obligations  and  on  its  profits.  Sensitivity analyses are presented in Note 4.7 Provisions .\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deferred tax assets in respect  of  tax  losses  are  recognised  if  it  is  probable  that  the Group will have future taxable profits against which such losses may be used. The assessment of whether the Group will be able to use these tax losses is largely a matter of judgement. Analyses are  carried  out  to  decide  whether  or  not  these  tax  loss carryforwards are likely to be usable in the future.\n\n## Provisions\n\nAs explained in Note 4.7 Provisions ,  the  Group is involved in a number of disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. In some cases, the amounts sought by the claimants are significant and the legal proceedings can take several years. In  this  context,  provisions  are  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the Group's best estimate of the amount that will be payable based on the  information  available  (notably  that  provided  by  the  Group's legal advisers). Any change to assumptions can have a significant effect  on  the  amount  of  the  provision  recognised.  The  carrying amount of these provisions at the balance sheet date is set out in Note 4.7 Provisions .\n\n## Judgements\n\nIn  the  absence  of  standards  or  interpretations  applicable  to  a specific  transaction,  Group  management  uses  its  judgement  to define  and  apply  accounting  policies  that  provide  relevant  and reliable  information  in  the  context  of  the  preparation  of  the financial statements.\n\n## Hyperinflation\n\nAccording to the provisions of IAS 29, Argentina and Turkey are considered to be hyperinflationary economies.\n\nHowever,  given  the  contribution  of  operations  in  Argentina  and Turkey  to  the  Group's  financial  statements,  the  impact  of  the application  of  IAS  29  has  been  deemed  non-material,  and  the corresponding restatements have not been made.\n\n## 5. Business combinations\n\nBusiness  combinations  carried  out  before  1  July  2009  were recognised using the accounting standards in force at 30  June  2009.  Business  combinations  after  1  July  2009  are measured and recognised in accordance with the revised version of  IFRS  3,  whereby  the  consideration  transferred  (cost  of  the acquisition)  is  measured  at  the  fair  value  of  assets  transferred, equity  interests  issued  and  liabilities  incurred  at  the  acquisition date.  Identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  acquiree  are measured  at  fair  value  at  the  acquisition  date.  Costs  directly attributable  to  the  acquisition,  such  as  legal,  due  diligence  and other  professional  fees  are  recognised  as  other  operating expenses as incurred.\n\nAny consideration transferred in excess of the Group's interest in the  net  fair  value  of  the  acquiree's  identifiable  assets  and liabilities is recognised as goodwill. The option is available for each transaction  to  apply  either  proportionate  or  full  goodwill methods. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of foreign entities is denominated in the functional currency of the business acquired. Goodwill is not amortised. Instead, it is subject to an impairment test once a year or more often if there is any indication that it may have been impaired.\n\nFinally, in accordance with IFRS 3 as revised and IAS 27 as amended, the  Group  recognises  in  shareholders'  equity  the  difference between  the  consideration  transferred  and  the  proportionate share  of  non-controlling  interests  in  the  fair  value  of  acquired assets and liabilities.\n\n## 6. Foreign currency translation\n\n## 6.1 Presentation currency used in the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe  Group's  annual  consolidated  financial  statements  are prepared  in  euros,  which  is  the  functional  currency  and  the presentation currency of the Parent Company.\n\n## 6.2  Functional currency\n\nThe functional currency of an entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. In most cases, the functional currency is the entity's local currency. However, in a  very  limited  number  of  entities,  a  functional  currency  that  is different  from  the  local  currency  may  be  used  if  it  reflects  the entity's economic environment and the currency in which most of the entity's transactions are denominated.\n\n## 6.3  Translation of transactions denominated in foreign currencies\n\nTransactions  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are  generally translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate applicable  at  the  transaction  date.  Non-monetary  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised at the historical  exchange  rate  applicable  at  the  transaction  date.  At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing exchange rate. Any resulting exchange differences are recognised in profit and loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on debts designated  as  hedges  for  the  net  foreign  currency  assets  of consolidated affiliates. These are recognised directly in shareholders' equity, under translation differences, until the disposal of the net investment. Exchange differences related to operating activities are  recognised  within  operating  income  and  expenses  for  the period;  exchange  differences  related  to  financing  activities  are recognised within financial income and expenses or in shareholders' equity.\n\n## 6.4  Translation of financial statements of affiliates whose functional currency is different from the euro (the presentation currency)\n\nThe balance sheet is translated into euros at the year-end exchange rate. The income statement and cash flow statement are translated on the basis of average exchange rates. The differences resulting from the translation of the financial statements of these affiliates are  recognised  in  translation  differences  within  shareholders' equity  under  other  comprehensive  income.  On  disposal  of  a foreign entity, the cumulative translation differences recognised in shareholders' equity are reclassified in profit and loss.",

        "page_content": "## 7. Assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations', where they are significant, assets and liabilities  held  for  sale  are  no  longer  subject  to  depreciation  or amortisation. They are shown separately in the balance sheet at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.  An  asset  is  considered  as  being  held  for  sale  if  its  carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather  than  through  continuing  use.  In  order  for  this  to  be  the case, the asset must be available for immediate sale and its sale must be highly probable. Items in the balance sheet related to discontinued  operations  and  assets  held  for  sale  are  presented under specific lines in the annual consolidated financial statements. Income statement items related to discontinued operations and assets  held  for  sale  are  presented  separately  in  the  financial statements for all periods reported if they are significant from a Group perspective.\n\n## 8. Consideration of climate risks\n\nIn  2023,  the  Group  conducted  its  first  climate  scenario  analysis following the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD),  for  a  selection  of three risk categories.\n\nThese risks concern:\n\n- \u00b7 shortages of agricultural raw materials;\n- \u00b7 business interruption risks on our production sites; and\n- \u00b7 the strengthening of carbon price mechanisms.\n\nOn a  long-term  perspective,  the  analysis  results  show  that  few terroirs  and  productions  sites,  mainly  in  India  and  Brazil,  are most likely exposed to extreme climate events.\n\nRegarding  the  impacts  of  carbon  pricing  mechanisms,  Pernod Ricard believes that reaching its 2030 Science-Based Target (SBT) would  avoid  major  costs,  thanks  to  reduced  operating  costs related to lower Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The estimation of direct and  indirect  impacts  along  Pernod  Ricard's  value  chain  is  still ongoing  due  to  their  complexity,  and  further  work  in  this  area will  be  conducted in 2025. Although still difficult to predict, it is not impossible that this reduction in energy expenditure and the adaptation plan for the risk of increased carbon prices will result in  a  long-term  financial  benefit  compared  with  a  business-as-usual scenario without the implementation of any additional decarbonisation measure.\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nConsidering the information studied to date, the Group believes that climate change has no short-term impact on the assumptions used to prepare the financial statements, given the nature of its business and its geographical footprint. The Group's consideration of climate change mitigation and adaptation concerns is notably reflected in its 'Good Times from a Good Place' strategy through its  commitments  in  terms  of  'Net  Zero  Carbon',  which  were further strengthened  in  2024,  the  supply  of  sustainable agricultural  raw  materials,  the  footprint  of  its  terroirs  and  the circularity of its packaging and promotional items.\n\nIn addition:\n\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard used the following assumptions in the business plan projections used to prepare its impairment tests:\n- \u00b7 assumptions  relating  to  the  short-term  effects  of  climate risks  (changes  in  the  price  of  raw  materials,  energy  and transport,  etc.).  The  long-term  effects  of  these  changes cannot be quantified at this stage,\n- \u00b7 more responsible consumption habits, and\n- \u00b7 the  costs  of  implementing  the  'Good  Times  from  a  Good Place' strategy (e.g., those reflected in changes in staff costs or in the cost of sales);\n- \u00b7 The  implementation  of  this  strategy  does  not  challenge  the useful life of its property, plant and equipment. However, and in  line  with  its  roadmap  and  the  2030  target  of  reducing  the climate impact of its activities, the Group is making efforts by means of its industrial investments;\n- \u00b7 The  Group  also  affirms  its  climate  commitment  through  its financing strategy:\n- \u00b7 Since 2022, the Group has issued sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) for a total of \u20ac1.9 billion, with the interest rates linked to  the  achievement of the Group's sustainability objectives, measured using the two following criteria:\n- - Absolute reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 and 2),\n- - Reduction  in  water  consumption  per  unit  of  alcohol produced at distilleries;\n- \u00b7 Pernod Ricard also entered into its first sustainability-linked revolving  credit  facilities  indexed  to  the  two  criteria  above for  a  total  amount  of  \u20ac2.1  billion  in  order  to  refinance  an existing facility expiring in June 2024;\n- \u00b7 For several years now, all executives - including the Executive Corporate Officer - have been assigned short- and long-term objectives  linked  to  the  Group's  sustainability  performance. Vesting of shares under the long-term incentives plan for which they are eligible is subject to the two abovementioned criteria.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Acquisitions and disposals\n\nDuring the course of the year, Group affiliate Corby Spirit & Wine acquired  a  90%  stake  in  Ace  Beverage  Group  Inc,  the  largest independent player in the fast-growing Canadian ready-to-drink (RTD) market.\n\nThe  Group  also  closed  the  sale  of  its  Clan  Campbell  blended Scotch whisky brand to Stock Spirits Group, as well as the sale of the Becherovka brand and related assets (including the production facilities in Karlovy Vary) to the Maspex group. These transactions are part of Pernod Ricard's active portfolio management strategy, aimed  at  adapting  to  the  needs  of  consumers  and  providing greater opportunities for premiumisation.\n\n## 2. Bond issues and redemptions\n\nOn 15 September 2023, Pernod Ricard SA carried out a bond issue for  an  amount  of  \u20ac1,350  million  in  two  tranches:  a  \u20ac600  million four-year  tranche  and  a  \u20ac750  million  ten-year  tranche,  each bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 3.75%.\n\nOn 24 October 2023, Pernod Ricard SA redeemed in full and at maturity a \u20ac500 million bond issued on 24 October 2019, bearing a 0% coupon.\n\nOn 7 May 2024, Pernod Ricard SA carried out a bond issue for an amount of \u20ac1,500 million across two tranches: a \u20ac700 million 6.5-year tranche and an \u20ac800 million 10-year tranche, bearing interest at the fixed annual rate of 3.375% and 3.625%, respectively.\n\nAfter  obtaining  the  approval  of  the  French  Financial  Markets Authority  ( Autorit\u00e9  des  March\u00e9s  Financiers -  AMF)  on  the  base prospectus, on 26 May 2020, Pernod Ricard set up a Euro Medium Term  Notes  (EMTN)  programme,  updated  on  11  October  2021, 24 October 2022 and 24 October 2023 (the 'Programme'). Under the terms of the Programme, Pernod Ricard and Pernod Ricard International Finance LLC may issue bonds by means of private placements  in  various  currencies.  The  issues  of  Pernod  Ricard International Finance  LLC  under  the  programme  will  be guaranteed by Pernod Ricard SA. The securities may be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris. The maximum nominal amount of securities outstanding under the Programme is set at \u20ac7 billion (or the equivalent in any other currency). During the meeting on 24 April 2024, the Board of Directors authorised Pernod Ricard to issue  bonds  under  the  Programme  up  to  a  total  maximum nominal amount of \u20ac2,850 billion less any amounts issued since 30  August  2023  (or  the  equivalent  in  any  other  currency)  for  a period of one year from 24 April 2024.",

        "page_content": "## NOTE 2 Segment information\n\n## Net sales\n\nThe  Group's  net  sales  primarily  comprise  sales  of  finished products  and  are  recorded  in  the  income  statement  upon transfer of control of the products. They are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or to be received after deducting  trade  discounts,  volume  rebates,  certain  costs associated  with  business  and  promotional  activity  and sales -related taxes and duties, notably excise duties.\n\n## Costs of commercial and promotional activity\n\nPursuant  to  IFRS  15,  certain  costs  of  services  rendered  in connection  with  sales,  such  as  advertising  programmes  in conjunction  with  distributors,  listing  costs  for  new  products, promotional  activities  at  point  of  sale,  and  advertising  and promotion expenses, are deducted directly  from  net  sales  if there  is  no  distinct  service  whose  fair  value  can  be  reliably measured.\n\n## Duties and taxes\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 15, certain import duties, in Asia for instance, are classified as cost of sales, as these duties are not specifically  re-billed  to  customers  (as  is  the  case  for  social security stamps in France, for example).\n\n## Discounts\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 15, early payment discounts are not considered  to  be  financial  transactions,  but  rather  are deducted directly from net sales.\n\nThe Group is focused on the business of selling and manufacturing wines  and  spirits.  The  Group  is  structured  into  three  operating segments  constituted  by  the  following  geographical  areas: Americas, Europe, and Asia/Rest of the World.\n\nGroup management assesses the performance of each operating segment  on  the  basis  of  net  sales  and  profit  from  recurring operations, defined as the gross margin after logistics expenses, less  advertising  and  promotion  expenses  and  structure  costs. The  segments  presented  are  identical  to  those  included  in  the reporting  provided  to  General  Management,  in  particular  for performance analysis.\n\n## Gross margin after logistics expenses, contribution after advertising and promotion expenses, profit from recurring operations and other operating income and expenses\n\nThe gross margin after logistics expenses corresponds to net sales  (excluding  duties  and  taxes),  less  cost  of  sales  and logistics expenses.  The  contribution  after  advertising  and promotion  expenses  includes  the  gross  margin  after  logistics expenses and advertising and promotion expenses. The Group applies  Recommendation  2013-R03  of  the  French  accounting standards-setter  ( Autorit\u00e9  des  normes  comptables -  ANC), notably  as  regards  the  definition  of  profit  from  recurring operations. Profit from recurring operations is the contribution after  advertising  and  promotion  expenses  less  trading  costs and  overheads.  This  is  the  indicator  used  internally  to measure  the  Group's  operational  performance.  It  excludes other operating income and expenses, such as those related to  restructuring,  capital  gains  and  losses  on  disposals, impairment  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangible assets, and other non-recurring operating income  and expenses.  These  other  operating  income  and  expenses  are excluded  from  profit  from  recurring  operations  given  their unusual, abnormal and infrequent nature, which would distort the  understanding  of  the  Group's  performance.  They  are described  in  detail  in  Note  3.1  Other  operating  income/ (expenses) .\n\nIncome statement and balance sheet items are allocated among the  segments  on  the  basis  of  either  the  destination  of  sales  or profits. Operating segments follow the same accounting policies as  those  used  for  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial statements.  Inter-segment  transfers  are  transacted  at  market prices.\n\n| 30.06.2023 \u20ac millions                                 | Americas   | Asia/Rest  of the World   | Europe   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Income statement items                                |            |                           |          |         |\n| Segment net sales                                     | 4,076      | 6,371                     | 9,297    | 19,744  |\n| o/w inter-segment sales                               | 595        | 1,179                     | 5,832    | 7,606   |\n| Net sales (excluding Group)                           | 3,481      | 5,191                     | 3,465    | 12,137  |\n| Gross margin after logistics expenses                 | 2,220      | 2,969                     | 2,057    | 7,246   |\n| Contribution after advertising and promotion expenses | 1,534      | 2,229                     | 1,544    | 5,307   |\n| Profit from recurring operations                      | 965        | 1,516                     | 867      | 3,348   |\n| Other information                                     |            |                           |          |         |\n| Current investments                                   | 185        | 163                       | 486      | 834     |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and impairment, net        | (73)       | (104)                     | (289)    | (467)   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the purposes of determining earnings per share, the average number of outstanding shares is equal to the weighted average number of outstanding shares less the weighted average number of treasury shares.\n\nThe calculation of diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential impact of the exercise of all dilutive instruments (such  as  stock  options,  convertible  bonds,  etc.)  on  the  theoretical  number  of  shares.  When  funds  are  obtained  at  the  date  of exercise of the dilutive instruments, the 'treasury stock' method is used to determine the theoretical number of shares to be taken into account.\n\n| Numerator (\u20ac millions)                         | 30.06.2023   | 30.06.2024   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Group share of net profit                      | 2,262        | 1,476        |\n| Denominator (number of shares)                 |              |              |\n| Average number of outstanding shares           | 256,048,280  | 252,595,588  |\n| Dilutive effect of performance share grants    | 701,248      | 545,642      |\n| Dilutive effect of stock options               | 128,725      | 47,076       |\n| Average number of outstanding shares - diluted | 256,878,253  | 253,188,307  |\n| Earnings per share (\u20ac)                         |              |              |\n| Earnings per share - basic                     | 8.84         | 5.84         |\n| Earnings per share - diluted                   | 8.81         | 5.83         |\n\n## Note 3.5 Expenses by type\n\nOperating profit notably includes depreciation, amortisation and impairment expenses as well as employee benefits expense as follows:\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                                        | 30.06.2023   | 30.06.2024   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| TOTAL DEPRECIATION, AMORTISATION AND IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE                           | (466)        | (936)        |\n| Salaries and payroll costs                                                        | (1,565)      | (1,664)      |\n| Pensions, medical expenses and other similar benefits under defined-benefit plans | (34)         | (28)         |\n| Share-based payments                                                              | (44)         | (45)         |\n| TOTAL EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE                                                   | (1,643)      | (1,737)      |",

With the exception of assets with indefinite useful lives, they are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which is generally less than five years, and are impaired when their recoverable  amount  is  less  than  their  carrying  amount. Amortisation of intangible assets is recognised within operating items in the income statement.\n\nIn the context of the Group's activities, and in accordance with IAS  38  'Intangible  Assets',  research  and  development  costs are recognised as expenses in the financial year during which they are incurred, except for certain development costs which meet the capitalisation criteria described by the standard.\n\n## Movements during the period\n\n| \u20ac millions              | 30.06.2022   | Acquisitions   | Additions and  reversals   | Disposals   | Translation  adjustments   | Other  movements   | 30.06.2023   |\n|-------------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| Goodwill                | 6,284        | 827            | -

To perform these tests, goodwill is allocated by geographical area on the basis of asset groups at the date of each  business  combination.  These  asset  groups correspond  to  groups  of  assets  which  jointly  generate identifiable  cash  flows  that  are  largely  independent.  If impairment is identified, an impairment loss is recognised in profit and loss for the financial year.\n\nGoodwill mainly stems from the acquisitions of Allied Domecq in July  2005 and Vin&Sprit in July 2008. The change in the value of goodwill in the period was mainly due to the various acquisitions and disposals carried out since the start of the year, as well as currency fluctuations.\n\n## Trademarks\n\nThe entry value of acquired trademarks is determined using an actuarial calculation of estimated future profits or using the royalty method and corresponds to the fair value of the trademarks  at  the  date  of  acquisition.  As  the  Group's trademarks  are  intangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful lives,  they  are  not  amortised but are rather subject to an impairment test at least once a year or whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Trademarks acquired as a part of acquisitions of foreign entities are denominated in the functional currency of the business acquired.\n\nThe main trademarks recognised on the balance sheet are: Absolut, Ballantine's, Beefeater, Bumbu, Chivas Regal, Kahl\u00faa, Luc Belaire, Malibu and Martell. Most of these were recognised at the time of the  acquisitions  of  Seagram,  Allied  Domecq  and  Vin&Sprit.  The change in the gross value of trademarks in the period was mainly due to the various acquisitions and disposals, as well as currency fluctuations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The CGUs include  assets  related  to  the  Group's  brands  and  are allocated  in  accordance  with  the  three  geographical  areas defined by the Group, on the basis of the sale destination of the products. Impairment tests on CGUs are carried out in the third quarter and are regularly monitored until the reporting date in order to verify the relevance of the business plans and any changes to the market data underlying the discount rates used.\n\nWhen  the  recoverable  amount  of  a  CGU  is  less  than  its carrying  amount,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognised  within operating  items.  The  recoverable  amount  of  the  CGU  is  the higher of its market value and its value in use.\n\nValue in use is measured based on cash flows projected over a 19-year period. This period reflects the characteristics of the Group's  brands  and  their  production  assets,  which  typically have  long  useful  lives.  Discounted  projected  cash  flows  are established based on annual budgets and multi-year business plans, extrapolated to subsequent years by gradually\n\nconverging growth for the last year of the plan for each brand and market towards a perpetual growth rate. The calculation includes a terminal value derived by capitalising the cash flows generated in the last year of the plan. Assumptions applied to sales and advertising and promotion expenses are determined by  management  based  on  previous  results  and  long-term development trends in the markets concerned. The cash flow projection  methodology  takes  into  account,  with  respect  to working  capital  requirement  and  capital  expenditure,  the specific  features  of  white  spirits  and  maturing  alcohols.  The present values of discounted cash flows are sensitive to these assumptions,  as  well  as  to  consumer  trends  and  economic factors.\n\nMarket value is based either on the sale price, net of selling costs, that could be obtained under normal market conditions or earnings multiples observed in recent transactions relating to  comparable  assets.  The  discount  rate  used  for  these calculations is an after-tax rate applied to after-tax cash flows and corresponds to the weighted average cost of capital. This rate  reflects  specific  rates  for  each  market  or  geographical area, depending on the risks that they represent. Assumptions  made  in  terms  of  future  changes  in  net  sales and in terms of terminal values are reasonable and consistent with  market  data  available  for  each  of  the  CGUs.  Additional impairment  tests  are  applied  where  events  or  specific circumstances indicate potential impairment.\n\nIn  addition  to  annual  impairment  tests  applied  to  goodwill  and  trademarks,  specific  impairment  tests  are  applied  where  there  is  an indication that an asset may be impaired.\n\nThe data and assumptions used for the annual impairment tests applied to cash-generating units (CGUs) are as follows:\n\n|                        |                                                    | Net carrying                       | Net carrying                         | Value in use        | Value in use        | Value in use           |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| \u20ac millions             | Method used to  determine the  recoverable  amount | amount of  goodwill at  30.06.2024 | amount of  trademarks at  30.06.2024 | Discount rate  2023 | Discount rate  2024 | Perpetual growth  rate |\n| Europe                 | Value in use                                       | 2,055                              | 4,341                                | 6.85%               | 6.99%               | From -1% to +2.5%      |\n| Americas               | based on the  discounted cash  flow method         | 3,898                              | 7,021                                | 8.12%               | 8.61%               | From -1% to +2.5%      |\n| Asia/Rest of the World |                                                    | 854                                | 688                                  | 8.44%               | 8.59%               | From -1% to +2.5%      |\n\nThe  following  table  shows  the  amount  of  any  additional  impairment  at  30  June  2024  of  assets  making  up  the  brands'  CGUs  or  the associated goodwill, which would result from:\n\n- \u00b7 a 50 basis point (bp) decrease in the growth rate of the contribution after advertising and promotion expenses;\n- \u00b7 a 50 basis point increase in the after-tax discount rate;\n- \u00b7 a 50 basis point decrease in the perpetual growth rate over the duration of the multi-year business plans.\n\n| \u20ac millions             | 50 bp decrease in growth  rate of contribution after  advertising and promotion   | 50 bp increase in  after - tax discount rate   | 50 bp decrease in  perpetual growth rate   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Europe                 | -                                                                                 | (6)                                            | -                                          |\n| Americas               | -                                                                                 | (12)                                           | (5)                                        |\n| Asia/Rest of the World | -                                                                                 | -                                              | -                                          |\n| TOTAL                  | -                                                                                 | (18)                                           | (5)                                        |",

Depreciation  is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life  of  the  assets.  Useful  life  is  reviewed  on  a  regular  basis. The  average  depreciable  lives  for  the  major  categories  of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n| Buildings                    | 15 to 50 years   |\n|------------------------------|------------------|\n| Plant, equipment and tooling | 5 to 15 years    |\n| Other non-current assets     | 3 to 5 years     |\n| Vines                        | 25 to 33 years   |\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment is recognised within operating items in the income statement.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  amendments  to  IAS  41  and  IAS  16, vines  are  valued  at  cost  and  depreciated  over  their  useful lives. In accordance with IAS 41, agricultural produce (harvests) continues to be recognised at fair value on the balance sheet, after  deducting  estimated  selling  costs,  as  from  the  date  at\n\nwhich it is  possible  to  obtain  a  reliable  assessment  of  price, for example by referring to an active market. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement. Land on which biological assets are planted is measured in accordance with IAS 16.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 16, right-of-use assets for leases are recognised  as  property,  plant  and  equipment  in  the  class corresponding to the underlying assets, with the corresponding recognition of a lease liability. Leases mainly concern offices occupied by the Group that are recognised under Buildings. The value of right-of-use assets is determined on the basis of the amount of the lease liability, adjusted for the amount of prepaid rent, initial direct costs, benefits received from lessors and, where applicable, remediation costs. Right-of-use assets relating to leases are depreciated over the term of the lease. The  accounting  principles  for  determining  the  lease  liability are detailed in Note 4.8 Financial liabilities .\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment, including right\u00afof\u00afuse  assets,  are  impaired  when  their  recoverable amount falls below their net carrying amount.\n\n## Movements during the period\n\n| \u20ac millions                                 |         | 30.06.2022 Acquisitions   | Additions  and  reversals   | Disposals   | Translation  adjustments   | Other  movements   | 30.06.2023   | O/w right-of- use assets   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------|----------------------------|\n| Land                                       | 503     | 23                        | -                           | (9)         | (12)                       | 19                 | 524          | 60                         |\n| Buildings                                  | 2,040   | 110                       | -                           | (42)        | (45)                       | 84                 | 2,147        | 505                        |\n| Machinery and equipment                    | 2,509   | 119                       | -                           | (67)        | (63)                       | 68                 | 2,566        | 39                         |\n| Other property,  plant and equipment       | 1,004   | 142                       | -                           | (41)        | (12)                       | 27                 | 1,120        | 82                         |\n| Property, plant and  equipment in progress | 301     | 447                       | -                           | (1)         | (10)                       | (260)              | 477          | -                          |\n| Advances on property,  plant and equipment | 9       | 9                         | -                           | -           | (1)                        | (5)                | 12           | -                          |\n| Gross value                                | 6,366   | 850                       | -                           | (160)       | (143)                      | (67)               | 6,845        | 686                        |\n| Land                                       | (59)    | -                         | (9)                         | -           | 3                          | (7)                | (72)         | (18)                       |\n| Buildings                                  | (807)   | (2)                       | (133)                       | 31          | 21                         | (1)                | (891)        | (210)                      |\n| Machinery and equipment                    | (1,439) | (5)                       | (148)                       | 60          | 34                         | 34                 | (1,464)      | (18)                       |\n| Property, plant and  equipment in progress | (469)   | (1)                       | (80)                        | 34          | 10                         | (10)               | (516)        | (43)                       |\n| Depreciation/impairment                    | (2,775) | (8)                       | (370)                       | 125         | 68                         | 16                 | (2,944)      | (290)                      |\n| PROPERTY, PLANT  AND EQUIPMENT, NET        | 3,591   | 842                       | (370)                       | (35)        | (75)                       | (51)               | 3,901        | 396                        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Fair value adjustments and the disposal  gain  or  loss  are  recognised,  in  accordance  with  the management  intention,  either  (i)  in  the  income  statement under financial income/financial expenses - other non-recurring financial items, or (ii) in consolidated shareholders' equity under other  comprehensive  income  that  will  not  be  reclassified  to profit or loss.\n\nFair value is determined on the basis of the financial criteria most appropriate  to  the  specific  situation  of  each  company. The fair value of financial assets listed on a financial market is their stock market value. The measurement criteria generally used  for  other  investments  in  non-consolidated  entities  are share of shareholders' equity and future profitability.\n\n## Loans, guarantees and deposits\n\nLoans,  guarantees  and  deposits  are  measured  at  amortised cost.\n\n|                                        | 30.06.2023   | 30.06.2023   | 30.06.2024   | 30.06.2024   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| \u20ac millions                             | Current      | Non-current  | Current      | Non-current  |\n| Net financial assets                   |              |              |              |              |\n| Equity instruments                     | -            | 432          | -            | 502          |\n| Net value of IAS 19 plans in surplus   | -            | 230          | -            | 233          |\n| Loans, guarantees and deposits         |              | 186          |              | 192          |\n| Other financial assets                 | -            | 7            | -            | 5            |\n| Total net non-current financial assets | -            | 855          | -            | 932          |\n| Derivative instruments                 | 15           | 5            | 8            | -            |\n| FINANCIAL ASSETS                       | 15           | 860          | 8            | 932          |",

Net realisable value is the selling price less the estimated costs of completion and sale of inventories. Most inventories are valued using the weighted average cost method. The cost of long-cycle inventories is computed using a single method which includes distilling and ageing costs. These inventories are classified in current assets, although a substantial part remains in inventory for more than one year in order to undergo the ageing process used for certain wines and spirits before being sold.\n\nThe inventories and work in progress break down as follow:\n\n|                    | Movements during the period   | Movements during the period   | Movements during the period   | Movements during the period   | Movements during the period   | Movements during the period   |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| \u20ac millions         | 30.06.2022                    | Change in  gross values       | Change in  impairment         | Translation  adjustments      | Other  movements              | 30.06.2023                    |\n| Raw materials      | 228                           | 80                            | -

In  the  event  where  a potential  obligation  as  a  result  of  past  events  exists,  but where  the  occurrence  of  the  outflow  of  resources  is  not probable or where the amount cannot be reliably estimated, a contingent liability is disclosed among the Group's commitments.  The  amounts  provided  for  are  measured  by taking  account  of  the  most  probable  assumptions  or  using statistical methods,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the obligations. Provisions notably include:\n\n- \u00b7 provisions for restructuring;\n- \u00b7 provisions  for  pensions  and  other  long-term  employee benefits;\n- \u00b7 provisions  for  disputes  (tax  other  than  corporate  income tax, legal, employee-related).\n\nDisputes  are  kept  under  regular  review,  on  a  case-by-case basis, by the Legal Department of each affiliate or region or by  the  Group's  Legal  Department,  drawing  on  the  help  of external legal consultants in the most significant or complex cases.  A  provision  is  recognised  when  it  is  probable  that  a present  obligation  arising  as  a  result  of  a  past  event  will require  the  payment  of  an  amount  that  can  be  estimated reliably. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation.\n\n## 1. Breakdown of provisions\n\nProvisions for contingencies and losses at the reporting date break down as follows:\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                    | 30.06.2023   | 30.06.2024   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Non-current provisions                                        |              |              |\n| Provisions for pensions and other long-term employee benefits | 349          | 277          |\n| Other non-current provisions for contingencies and losses     | 294          | 313          |\n| Current provisions                                            |              |              |\n| Provisions for restructuring                                  | 68           | 66           |\n| Other current provisions for contingencies and losses         | 96           | 92           |\n| TOTAL                                                         | 807          | 748          |\n\nThe cost of restructuring measures is fully provisioned in the financial  year,  and  is  recognised  in  profit  and  loss  under 'Other operating income/(expenses)' when it is material and results from a Group obligation to third parties arising from a decision made by the competent corporate body that has been announced to the third parties concerned before the reporting date.  This  cost  mainly  involves  redundancy  payments,  early retirement  payments,  the  cost  of  notice  periods  not  served, training costs of departing individuals and site closure costs. Retirement of property, plant and equipment, and impairment of inventories and other assets, as well as other costs (moving costs, training of transferred individuals, etc.) directly related to the restructuring measures are also recognised in restructuring costs. The amounts provided for correspond to forecast future payments  to  be  made  in  connection  with  restructuring  plans, discounted  to  present  value  when  the  payment  schedule  is such that the effect of the time value of money is significant.",

They  are  also  subject  to  tax  audits, some of which may lead to an adjustment. The main disputes are described in Note 6.5 Disputes .\n\nAt  30  June  2024,  the  provisions  recorded  by  the  Group  for  all disputes  and  risks  in  which  it  is  involved  amounted  to \u20ac405  million,  excluding  uncertain  tax  positions  recognised  in income taxes payable. The Group does not provide details (with exceptions),  as  it  believes  the  disclosure  of  the  amount  of  any provision booked in consideration of each pending dispute would be likely to cause serious harm to the Group.\n\nThe change in other current and non-current provisions during the period reflects the following:\n\n- \u00b7 additions to provisions stem mainly from proceedings brought against  the  Company  and  its  affiliates,  as  part  of  the  normal course of business and the emergence of new risks, including tax risks (other than corporate income tax risks);\n- \u00b7 reversals of provisions are made at the time of corresponding payments or where the risk is considered to be nil. Reversals of surplus  amounts  primarily  concern  the  re-evaluation  or  the statute of limitation of certain risks, including tax risks.\n\n## 3. Provisions for pensions and other long-term employee benefits\n\nIn accordance with applicable national legislation, the Group's employee benefit obligations are composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 long-term  post-employment  benefits  (retirement  bonuses, pensions, medical expenses, etc.);\n- \u00b7 long-term benefits payable during the period of employment.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nContributions are recognised as expenses as they are incurred. As  the  Group  is  not  committed  beyond  the  amount  of  such contributions, no provision is recognised in respect of defined contribution plans.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nFor defined benefit plans, the projected unit credit method is used  to  measure  the  present  value  of  defined  benefit obligations, current service cost and, if applicable, past service cost.  The  measurement  is  made  at  each  reporting  date  and the  personal  data  concerning  employees  is  revised  at  least every  three  years.  The  calculation  requires  the  use  of economic assumptions (inflation rate and discount rate) and other  assumptions  concerning  employees  (mainly  average salary  increase,  employee  turnover  and  life  expectancy).  The assumptions  used  in  FY  2023  and  FY  2024  and  the  methods used for their determination are described below.\n\nA  provision  is  recognised  in  the  balance  sheet  for  the difference  between  the  actuarial  debt  of  related  obligations (actuarial  liabilities)  and  any  assets  dedicated  to  funding  the plans,  measured  at  their  fair  value,  and  includes  past  service costs and actuarial gains and losses.\n\nThe cost of defined benefit plans has three components, which are accounted for as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the  service  cost  is  recognised  in  operating  income  and expenses. It includes:\n- \u00b7 the  cost  of  services  rendered  during  the  period  (current service cost),\n- \u00b7 the cost of past services resulting from the amendment or curtailment of a plan, recognised in full in profit and loss for the period in which the services were performed (past service cost),\n- \u00b7 gains and losses on settlement;\n- \u00b7 the  financial  component,  recorded  in  financial  income  and expenses, comprises the impact of discounting the liabilities, net of the expected return on plan assets, measured using the  same  discount  rate  as  that  used  to  measure  plan obligations;\n- \u00b7 revaluations  of  liabilities  (assets)  are  recognised  in  other comprehensive  income  not  reclassifiable  to  profit  or  loss, and consist mainly of actuarial gains and losses, namely the change  in  plan  obligations  and  assets  due  to  changes  in assumptions  and  to  experience  gains  or  losses,  the  latter representing the difference between the expected impact of some  actuarial  assumptions  applied  to  previous  valuations and the actual impact.  Depending  on  the  type  of  plan  and the governing legislation in certain regions, if the plan assets exceed the obligations recognised in the financial statements, any assets generated may be limited to the present value of future  refunds  from  the  plan  and  expected  reductions  in future contributions (asset ceiling).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Defined benefit plans are subject to an annual actuarial valuation\n\non the basis of assumptions depending on the country. Under these pension and other benefit plan agreements, employees receive at the date of retirement either a capital lump sum payment or an annuity.  These  amounts  depend  on  the  number  of  years  of employment, final salary and the position held by the employee. At 30 June 2024, fully or partly funded benefit obligations totalled \u20ac3,254 million, equivalent to 95% of the total benefit obligations.\n\nCertain  affiliates,  mainly  those  located  in  North  America,  also provide  their  employees  with  post-employment  medical  cover. These  benefit  obligations  are  unfunded.  They  are  measured using  the  same  assumptions  as  those  used  for  the  pension obligations in the countries in question.\n\nSeveral affiliates, mainly in Europe, also provide their employees with other long-term benefits.

        "page_content": "## Note 4.8 Financial liabilities\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 9, IAS 32 and IFRS 7. Borrowings and other financial liabilities are recognised, on the basis of their effective interest rates, in accordance with the amortised cost method. The effective interest rate includes all costs, commissions and  fees  payable  under  the  contract  between  the  parties. Under this method, costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability are recognised in profit and loss on the basis of the effective interest rate.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows', cash and cash  equivalents  presented  in  assets  and  liabilities  in  the balance  sheet  and  shown  in  the  consolidated  cash  flow statements  include  items  that  are  immediately  available  as cash or are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and  which  are  subject  to  an  insignificant  risk  of  changes  in value.  Cash  is  composed  of  cash  at  bank  and  on  hand, short\u00afterm deposits with an initial maturity of less than three months and money market mutual funds that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash equivalents are short-term  investments  with  a  maturity  of  less  than  three months. Bank overdrafts, which are considered to be equivalent to financing, are excluded from cash and cash equivalents.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS  16,  the  Group  assesses  whether  a contract  is,  or  contains,  a  lease  if  the  contract  conveys,  at inception, the right to control the use of an identified asset for a set period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nThe lease liability is initially calculated at the present value of the  future  lease  payments.  The  discount  rates  are  based  on the Group's borrowing rate plus a spread to take into account country-specific  economic  environments.  They  are  estimated in  each  currency  using  available  market  data.  They  take  into account the term of the leases. Lease payments may include fixed  or  variable  payments  that  depend  on  a  rate  or  index known at the commencement date of the lease.\n\nNet financial debt, as defined and used by the Group, corresponds to total gross financial debt (translated at the closing exchange rate), including  lease  liabilities  and  derivatives  designated  as  fair  value  hedges  and  net  foreign  currency  asset  hedges  (hedging  of  net investments and similar), less cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe period used to calculate the lease liability corresponds to the non-cancellable term of the contract, unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise a renewal option beyond this period. The probability of exercising an option is determined on a lease-by-lease basis, taking into account management's intentions.  This  liability  is  then  calculated  at  amortised  cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\nLeases  are  recognised  in  the  balance  sheet  from  the commencement date. They are presented in 'Lease liabilities' with a corresponding entry in 'Property, plant and equipment', depending on the nature of the underlying asset (see Note 4.2 -Property,  plant  and  equipment ).  Lease  liabilities  comprise  a current and non-current portion on the basis of the expected future payments.\n\nIn the income statement, depreciation expenses are recognised on  the  basis  of  the  use  of  the  underlying  asset  and  interest expenses are presented in financial income and expenses.\n\nIn the cash flow statement, repayments of lease liabilities are reported under 'Repayment of lease liabilities' in cash flows from financing activities, while interest payments are reported under 'Interest paid' in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nThe  Group  has  chosen  not  to  apply  IFRS  16  to  leases corresponding to assets with a low unit replacement value or to  short-term  leases.  These  leases  are  recognised  directly  in expenses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nThe table below shows the amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities before and after offsetting.\n\nThe amounts offset in the balance sheet were established in accordance with IAS 32. Accordingly, financial assets and financial liabilities are  offset  and  the  net  amount  is  shown  in  the  balance  sheet  if  and  only  if  the  Group  has  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  set  off  the recognised amounts, and if it intends to settle on a net basis. The assets and liabilities offset stem from the multi-currency cash pooling arrangement implemented within the Group.\n\n| At 30 June 2023 \u20ac millions   | Gross financial  assets and  liabilities   | Amounts  offset in the  balance  sheet   | Net amounts  in the  balance  sheet   | Impact of master  netting and  similar  arrangements   | Financial  instruments  received as  collateral   | Net amounts  under IFRS 7   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| ASSETS                       |                                            |                                          |                                       |                                                        |                                                   |                             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents    | 1,882                                      | (273)                                    | 1,609                                 | -                                                      | -                                                 | -                           |\n| LIABILITIES                  |                                            |                                          |                                       |                                                        |                                                   |                             |\n| Bank borrowings and debt     | 601                                        | (273)                                    | 328                                   | -                                                      | -                                                 | -                           |\n\n| At 30 June 2024 \u20ac millions   | Gross financial  assets and  liabilities   | Amounts  offset in the  balance  sheet   | Net amounts  in the  balance  sheet   | Impact of master  netting and  similar  arrangements   | Financial  instruments  received as  collateral   | Net amounts  under IFRS 7   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| ASSETS                       |                                            |                                          |                                       |                                                        |                                                   |                             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents    | 3,123                                      | (441)                                    | 2,683                                 | -                                                      | -                                                 | -                           |\n| LIABILITIES                  |                                            |                                          |                                       |                                                        |                                                   |                             |\n| Bank borrowings and debt     | 729                                        | (441)                                    | 288                                   | -                                                      | -                                                 | -                           |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

        "page_content": "The methods used are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 debt: the fair value of the debt is determined for each loan by discounting future cash flows on the basis of market rates at balance  sheet  date,  adjusted  for  the  Group's  credit  risk.  For floating-rate  bank  debt  and  bank  overdrafts,  fair  value  is approximately equal to the carrying amount;\n- \u00b7 bonds: market liquidity enabled the bonds to be valued at their fair value using the quoted prices;\n- \u00b7 other  long-term  financial  liabilities:  the  fair  value  of  other long\u00afterm  financial  liabilities  is  calculated  for  each  loan  by discounting future cash flows using an interest rate taking into account the Group's credit risk at the balance sheet date;\n- \u00b7 derivatives: the market value of instruments recognised in the financial statements at the balance sheet date was calculated on  the  basis  of  available  market  data,  using  current  valuation models.\n\nThe hierarchical levels of the fair value hierarchy below are in line with the definitions in the amended version of IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures':\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: fair value based on quoted prices in active markets;\n\n## 2. Risk management\n\nManagement and monitoring of financial risks  is  performed  by the  Financing  and  Treasury  Department.  Reporting  to  the  Group Finance  Department,  it  oversees  all  financial  exposures  and processes  or  validates  all  financing,  investment  and  hedging transactions,  as  part  of  a  programme  approved  by  General Management.\n\nAll financial instruments  hedge  existing  or  forecast  hedge transactions  or  investments.  They  are  contracted  with  a  limited number of counterparties that have a first-class rating.\n\n## Management of liquidity risk\n\nAt 30 June 2024, the Group's cash and cash equivalents totalled \u20ac2,683 million (compared with \u20ac1,609 million at 30 June 2023). An additional  \u20ac2,860  million  of  medium-term  revolving  credit facilities with  banks  was  confirmed  and  undrawn.  Group financing is provided in the form of long-term debt (bank loans, bonds, etc.)  and  short-term  borrowings  (commercial  paper  and bank  overdrafts) as well as factoring and  securitisation programmes,  which  provide  adequate  financial  resources  to ensure  business  continuity.  The  Group  also  set  up  a  \u20ac7  billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme in May 2020, updated on 11 October 2021, 24 October 2022 and 24 October 2023. The Group's short-term financial debt after hedging was \u20ac2,136 million at 30 June 2024 (compared to \u20ac1,536 million at 30 June 2023).\n\nWhile  the  Group  has  not  identified  any  other  material  cash requirement, it cannot be fully guaranteed that it will be able to continue  to  access  the  funding  and  refinancing  needed  for  its day-to-day  operations  and  capital  expenditure  on  satisfactory terms, given the uncertain economic environment.\n\nThe credit ratings sought by Pernod Ricard from rating agencies on its long-term and short-term debt are Baa1/P2 from Moody's and BBB+/A2 from Standard & Poor's, respectively.\n\nThe  Group's  bank  and  bond  debt  contracts  include  covenants that, if breached, could trigger accelerated repayment clauses.\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n- \u00b7 Level 2: fair value measured based on observable market data (other than quoted prices included in Level 1);\n- \u00b7 Level 3: fair value measured using valuation techniques based on unobservable market data.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS  13,  derivatives  were  measured  taking into account the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and the Debt Valuation  Adjustment  (DVA).  The  measurement  is  based  on historical  data  (rating  of  counterparty  banks  and  probability  of default). At 30 June 2024, the impact was not significant.\n\nEquity instruments mainly consist of minority stakes in innovative companies in the conviviality sector that are mostly unlisted and have been acquired by Convivialit\u00e9 Ventures, the Group's private equity arm. Their fair value has been measured at level 3 of the hierarchy, based on valuations used in their most recent funding rounds. In the absence of recent transactions, acquisition cost is considered to be the best possible estimate of fair value, except where  underperformance  versus  the  budget  or  other  events occur giving rise to the recognition of an impairment loss. These investments are not individually material.\n\nFurthermore, while the vast majority of the Group's cash surplus is  placed  with  affiliates  of  global  banks  enjoying  the  highest agency  ratings,  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  that  these  Group investments may lose some of their liquidity and/or value.\n\nThe  currency  controls  in  place  in  certain  countries  limit  the Group's ability  to  use  cash  (prohibition  on  investment  with  the Group)  and,  in  some  cases,  delay  the  possibility  of  paying dividends (authorisation is required from the relevant authorities, notably in Cuba). At 30 June 2024, cash with delayed availability  amounted  to  \u20ac229  million,  including  \u20ac226  million relating to Cuba.\n\nSpecific  terms  of  financing  agreements  and  the  schedule  of financial liability maturity are respectively disclosed in the 'Material contracts' subsection of the management report and in Note 4.8 -Financial liabilities to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Management of currency risk\n\nAs the Group consolidates its financial statements in euros, it is exposed  to  fluctuations  against  the  euro  by  the  currencies  in which its assets and liabilities are denominated (asset risk) or in which  transactions  are  carried  out  (transaction  and  translation risks).\n\nWhile  some  hedging  strategies  limit  exposure,  there  is  no absolute protection against exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nIn  terms  of  asset  risk,  financing  foreign  currency-denominated assets  acquired  by  the  Group  with  debt  in  the  same  currency provides  natural  hedging.  This  principle  was  applied  for  the acquisition  of  Seagram,  Allied  Domecq  and  Vin&Sprit,  with  part of  the  debt  being  denominated  in  US  dollars,  reflecting  the importance  of  cash  flows  generated  in  dollars  or  linked currencies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Exposure  to currency  risk  on  intra-Group  invoicing  between  producer  and distributor affiliates is managed  via  a  monthly  payment centralisation  procedure  involving  most  countries  with  freely convertible  and  transferable  currencies  and  whose  internal legislation  allows  this  participation.  This  system  hedges  against net exposure using forward exchange contracts.\n\nIn addition, the Group may use firm or optional hedges with the aim  of  reducing  the  impact  of  currency  fluctuations  on  its operating  activities in some  Brand  Companies  that  make significant  purchases  in  currencies  other  than  the  euro  especially USD, GBP or SEK - or in order to secure the payment of dividends back to the parent.\n\n## Management of interest rate risk\n\nAt  30  June  2024,  the  Pernod  Ricard  Group's  debt  comprised floating-rate  debt  (mainly  commercial  paper  and  other  bank borrowings) and fixed-rate debt (mainly bonds), in addition to a hedging portfolio including USD swaps.\n\nThe  Group  cannot  guarantee  that  these  hedges  will  prove sufficient, or that it will be able to maintain them on acceptable terms.\n\nResidual risk is partially hedged by financial derivatives (forward purchases, forward sales or options) intended to hedge certain or highly probable non-Group receivables and payables.\n\n## SCHEDULE OF DEBT AND FLOATING-RATE EUR HEDGES (NOTIONAL VALUE, IN \u20ac MILLIONS)\n\n| At 30 June 2024 \u20ac millions            | <1 year   | >1 year and  <5 years   | >5 years   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|------------|---------|\n| Total assets (cash)                   | 1,463     | -                       | -          | 1,463   |\n| Total floating-rate liabilities       | (179)     | 4                       | (13)       | (189)   |\n| Net floating-rate debt before hedging | 1,283     | 4                       | (13)       | 1,274   |\n| Derivatives                           | 662       | -                       | -          | 662     |\n| NET FLOATING-RATE DEBT AFTER HEDGING  | 1,946     | 4                       | (13)       | 1,936   |\n\n## SCHEDULE OF DEBT AND FLOATING-RATE USD HEDGES (NOTIONAL VALUE, IN USD MILLIONS)\n\n| At 30 June 2024 $ millions            | <1 year   | >1 year and  <5 years   | >5 years   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|------------|---------|\n| Total assets (cash)                   | 276       | -                       | -          | 276     |\n| Total floating-rate liabilities       | -         | (40)                    | -          | (40)    |\n| Net floating-rate debt before hedging | 276       | (40)                    | -          | 235     |\n| Derivatives                           | (713)     | (197)                   | -          | (910)   |\n| NET FLOATING-RATE DEBT AFTER HEDGING  | (437)     | (237)                   | -          | (674)   |\n\n## Analysis of the sensitivity of financial instruments to interest rate risk (impact on the income statement)\n\nA  rise  or  fall  of  50  basis  points  in  interest  rates  (USD  and  EUR) would result in an increase or decrease of \u20ac4 million in the cost of net debt.\n\n## Analysis of the sensitivity of financial instruments to interest rate risk (impact on shareholders' equity)\n\nA  relative  change  of  plus  or  minus  50  basis  points  in  interest rates  (USD  and  EUR)  would  not  generate  any  gain  or  loss  on shareholders' equity.\n\nAnalysis of the sensitivity of financial instruments used to hedge risks related to agricultural raw materials (impact on shareholders' equity)\n\nAt 30 June 2024, the sensitivity of the portfolio was not significant.\n\n## Counterparty risk in financial transactions\n\nThe Group could be exposed to counterparty default via its cash investments, hedging instruments or the availability of committed  but  undrawn  financing  lines.  In  order  to  limit  this exposure, the Group rigorously selects counterparties based on several  criteria,  including  credit  ratings,  and  on  repayment schedules.\n\nHowever,  no  assurance  can  be  given  that  this  careful  selection will  be  enough  to  protect  the  Group  against  risks  of  this  type, particularly in the current economic environment.",

If  the  derivative  has  been  designated  as  a  cash  flow hedge, the change in value of the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income. It is recognised in profit and loss when the hedged item is itself recognised in profit and loss.\n\nHowever, the change in value of the ineffective component of the  derivative  is  recognised  directly  in  profit  and  loss.  If  the derivative is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the change in value of the effective portion of  the  hedge  is  recognised  in  shareholders'  equity  and  the change  in  value  of  the  ineffective  portion  is  recognised  in profit and loss.\n\n## Hedging instruments (by risk category and hedge type)\n\n|                                                                  |                                            | Notional amount of contracts   | Notional amount of contracts   | Notional amount of contracts   | Fair value   | Fair value   | Fair value   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Hedge type at 30 June 2023  \u20ac millions                           | Description of financial  instrument       | <1 year                        | >1 year  and  <5 years         | >5 years                       | Total        | Assets       | Liabilities  |\n| Fair value hedges                                                |                                            |                                |                                |                                |              | -

Following this transaction, the share capital was reduced to \u20ac392,659,559.40, divided into 253,328,748 shares with a par value of \u20ac1.55 per share:\n\n|                               | Number of shares   |   Amount  (\u20ac millions) |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Share capital at 30 June 2023 | 255,631,733        |                    396 |\n| Share capital at 30 June 2024 | 253,328,748        |                    393 |\n\nAll Pernod Ricard shares are issued and fully paid for a par value of \u20ac1.55. Only one type of Pernod Ricard shares exists. These shares obtain double voting rights if they have been registered for an uninterrupted period of ten years.\n\n## 2. Treasury shares\n\nTreasury  shares  are  recognised  on  acquisition  as  a deduction from equity. Subsequent changes in the value of treasury shares are not recognised. When treasury shares are sold, any difference between the acquisition cost and the  fair  value  of  the  shares  at  the  date  of  disposal  is recognised as a change in shareholders' equity and has no impact on profit and loss for the year.\n\nAt  30  June  2024,  Pernod  Ricard  and  its  controlled  affiliates  held 2,068,400 Pernod Ricard shares for a value of \u20ac311 million. These treasury  shares  are  reported,  at  cost,  as  a  deduction  from shareholders' equity.\n\nAs  part  of  its  stock  option  and  free  share  grant  plans,  Pernod Ricard SA holds shares either directly (treasury shares) or indirectly (calls  or  repurchase  options).  These  shares  may  be  allocated  if options are exercised under the stock option plans or, in the case of free shares, if performance targets are met.\n\n## 3. Interim dividend\n\nIn  April  2024,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  pay  an  interim dividend  of  \u20ac2.35  per  share  for  FY  2024,  i.e.,  a  total  payout  of \u20ac591 million. The interim dividend was paid on 19 July 2024 and recognised under \"Other current liabilities\" in the balance sheet at 30 June 2024.\n\n## Note 6.2 Share-based payments\n\nThe  Group  applies  IFRS  2  'Share-based  Payments'  to transactions whose award and settlement are share-based.\n\nPursuant  to  this  standard,  stock  options  and  performance shares granted to employees are measured at fair value. The amount  of  such  fair  value  is  recognised  in  the  income statement  over  the  vesting  period  of  the  rights  with  a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity.\n\n## 4. Capital management\n\nThe Group manages its share capital in such a way as to optimise its  cost  of  capital  and  profitability  for  its  shareholders,  provide security  for  all  its  counterparties  and  maintain  a  high  credit rating.  In  this  context,  the  Group  may  adjust  its  payment  of dividends  to  shareholders,  redeem  part  of  its  share  capital,  buy back  its  treasury  shares  and  authorise  share-based  payment plans.\n\n## 5. Liquidity agreement\n\nOn 24 May 2012, Pernod Ricard SA put in place a 12-month liquidity agreement, effective from 1 June 2012, through Rothschild & Cie Banque.  The  agreement  is  tacitly  renewable  for  successive periods of 12 months. It complies with the French Financial Markets Association  ( Association  Fran\u00e7aise  des  March\u00e9s  Financiers -  AMAFI) Code of Ethics, which was approved by the AMF in its decision of 21 March 2011.\n\nThe  sum  of  \u20ac5  million  was  allocated  for  the  implementation  of the liquidity agreement.\n\nThis fair value is calculated using valuation models taking into account the characteristics of the plan and market data at the date  of  grant  and  on  the  basis  of  Group  management's assumptions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As of the grant on 10 November 2021, these plans are granted through  shares,  whether  or  not  subject  to  internal  or  external performance  conditions;  the  stock  option  mechanism  is  no longer  used  for  new  grants.  In  addition,  for  all  plans  granted since  10  November  2021,  the  presence  condition  has  been revised to three years instead of four years previously.\n\nIn the course of FY 2024, two share grant plans were set up on 10 November 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 a performance share plan including:\n- \u00b7 a  performance  condition  based  on  the  positioning  of  the overall  performance  of  the  Pernod  Ricard  share  (TSR (1) ) compared to the overall performance of a panel of 12 peers over  the  period  from  10  November  2023  to  10  November 2026 inclusive (three years),\n- \u00b7 a performance condition based on the average achievement of the profit from recurring operations target (actual versus annual objectives) measured over three consecutive financial years, including that in which the shares were granted,\n- \u00b7 a  condition  relating  to  the  achievement  of  corporate  social responsibility (CSR) targets measured over three consecutive financial  years,  including  that  in  which  the  shares  were granted;\n- \u00b7 a performance share plan including:\n- \u00b7 a performance condition based on the average achievement of  the  consolidated  profit  from  recurring  operations  target (actual  versus  annual  objectives)  measured  over  three consecutive  financial  years,  including  that  in  which  the shares were granted,\n- \u00b7 a  condition  relating  to  the  achievement  of  corporate  social responsibility (CSR) targets measured over three consecutive financial  years,  including  that  in  which  the  shares  were granted.\n\nThe expense recognised for options/shares vested or in the process of being vested during the financial year (period from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024) is described below:\n\n| Stock options          | Type of  options   | With/without  performance  conditions   |   Number of  beneficiaries | Commencement  date for exercise  of options   | Expiry date   | Subscription  or purchase  price (\u20ac)   | Outstanding  options at  30 June 2024   |   Stock option  expense for  FY 2024  (\u20ac thousands) |\n|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Plan dated  08.11.2019 | Purchase           | With  conditions                        |                         14 | 9/11/2023                                     | 8/11/2027     | \u20ac162.79                                | 82,884                                  |                                                 273 |\n| Plan dated  27.11.2020 | Purchase           | With  conditions                        |                         14 | 28/11/2024                                    | 27/11/2028    | \u20ac154.11                                | 113,469                                 |                                                 806 |\n\n| Performance shares    | Type of  shares   | With/without  performance  conditions   | Number of  beneficiaries      | Shares  vested  from   | Shares  available  from   | Outstanding  shares at  30 June 2024   | Share  expense for  FY 2024  (\u20ac thousands)   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Plan dated 08.11.2019 | Free              | conditions                              | With  820                     | 9/11/2023              | 9/11/2023                 | -

For this reason, only the values relating to  the  plans  granted  during  FY  2024  are  presented  above (information  on  previous  plans  is  available  in  the  prior-year universal registration documents).\n\nFrom 2012 onwards, the volatility assumption used for the plans is based on a multi-criteria approach taking into consideration:\n\n- \u00b7 historic  volatility  over  a  period  equal  to  the  duration  of  the options;\n- \u00b7 implied volatility calculated on the basis of options available in financial markets.\n\nTwo share plans were granted on 10 November 2023.\n\nFor  one  of  the  plans,  part  of  the  grant  is  contingent  on  the positioning  of  the  overall  performance  of  the  Pernod  Ricard share (TSR (2) ) compared to the overall performance of a panel of 12 peers: the shares will pre-vest provided that the positioning of the  overall  performance  of  the  Pernod  Ricard  share  (TSR (2) )  is equal to or greater than seventh position out of 13 (the number will be determined in bands according to the level of performance\n\nachieved).  The  other  part  of  the  grant  is  subject  to  an  internal performance condition, the achievement of which will depend on the  average  achievement  of  the  Group's  annual  profit  from recurring  operations  target  for  the  financial  years  ended 30  June  2024,  30  June  2025  and  30  June  2026,  at  constant exchange  rates  and  scope.  The  fair  value  of  these  plans corresponds to the market price of the share on the grant date, less the loss of dividends expected during the vesting period (i.e., three  years  for  all  beneficiaries)  and  includes  the  likelihood  of achieving the TSR performance condition. The IFRS 2 accounting expense for the plan in relation to this condition will be adjusted at the end of the vesting period at the latest.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  the  other  plan  (with  internal  performance conditions) corresponds to the market price of the share at the grant date, less the loss of dividends expected during the vesting period (i.e., three years for all beneficiaries).\n\nFor  all  these  plans,  vesting  is  contingent  on  the  presence condition being met on 11 November 2026.\n\n## Note 6.3 Off-balance sheet commitments\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                              | Total   | <1 year   | >1 year and  <5 years   | >5 years   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|-------------------------|------------|\n| COMMITMENTS GIVEN AT 30.06.2023                                         | 3,682   | 1,413     | 1,768                   | 501        |\n| Commitments given in connection with the Group's scope of consolidation | 237     | 237       | -                       | -          |\n| Investment commitments                                                  | 20      | 20        | -                       | -          |\n| Commitments given as part of specific transactions                      | -       | -         | -                       | -          |\n| Other                                                                   | 217     | 217       | -                       | -          |\n| Commitments given in connection with the financing of the Company       | 19      | 14        | 1                       | 5          |\n| Financial guarantees given                                              | 19      | 14        | 1                       | 5          |\n| Other                                                                   | -       | -         | -                       | -          |\n| Commitments relating to the issuer's operating activities               | 3,426   | 1,163     | 1,767                   | 496        |\n| Firm and irrevocable commitments to purchase raw materials              | 3,008   | 847       | 1,715                   | 446        |\n| Tax commitments (customs and other guarantees)                          | 195     | 130       | 17                      | 48         |\n| Operating lease agreements                                              | 7       | 3         | 3                       | 1          |\n| Other                                                                   | 216     | 183       | 32                      | 1          |\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                                                    | Total   | <1 year   | >1 year and  <5 years   | >5 years   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|-------------------------|------------|\n| COMMITMENTS RECEIVED AT 30.06.2023                                                            | 3,033   | 356       | 2,619                   | 58         |\n| Commitments received in connection with the Group's scope of consolidation                    | -       | -         | -                       | -          |\n| Commitments received as part of specific transactions in relation  to competition and markets | -       | -         | -                       | -          |\n| Other                                                                                         | -       | -         | -                       | -          |\n| Commitments received in connection with the financing of the Company                          | 2,969   | 351       | 2,618                   | -          |\n| Lines of credit received and not used                                                         | 2,868   | 260       | 2,608                   | -          |\n| Financial guarantees received                                                                 | 101     | 91        | 10                      | -          |\n| Other                                                                                         | -       | -         | -                       | -          |\n| Commitments relating to the issuer's operating activities                                     | 65      | 5         | 2                       | 58         |\n| Contractual commitments relating to business activity and development                         | 63      | 5         | 1                       | 57         |\n| Other                                                                                         | 2       | -         | 1                       | 1          |",

This special audit covered other various topics for a total amount of 1,343 million Indian rupees (equivalent to \u20ac15 million).\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  the  level  and  amount  of  this  risk pertaining  to  promotion  and  advertising  expenses  have  been gradually and significantly reduced in recent years and that the Company obtained two court rulings in its favour in 2020 for the period  from  2007  to  2014.  These  court  decisions  further strengthen Pernod Ricard India's position on the tax deductibility of  advertising  and  promotion  expenses.  Reassured  by  these decisions and after consulting with its tax advisers, Pernod Ricard India  will  continue  to  dispute  the  merits  of  the  reassessment proposal  and  believes  it  has  a  probable  chance  of  success  in litigation.  Accordingly,  no  provision  has  been  booked  for  this matter.\n\n## Note 6.5 Disputes\n\nIn the normal course of business, Pernod Ricard is involved in a number  of individual and collective legal, governmental, arbitration and administrative proceedings.\n\nA provision for such proceedings is only recognised under 'Other provisions  for  contingencies  and  losses'  (see  Note  4.7  Provisions ) when it is probable that a present obligation arising as a  result  of  a  past  event  will  require  the  payment  of  an  amount that can be estimated reliably. In the latter case, the provisioned amount  corresponds  to  the  best  estimate  of  the  risk.  The provisioned amount recorded is based on the assessment of the level  of  risk  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  it  being  specified  that  any events  arising  during  the  proceedings  may  at  any  time  require that risk to be reassessed.\n\nThe provisions recorded by Pernod Ricard at 30 June 2024 for all disputes and risks in which it is involved amounted to negative \u20ac405 million, versus \u20ac390 million at 30 June 2023 (see Note 4.7 Provisions ), excluding  uncertain  tax  positions  recognised  in income taxes payable. Pernod Ricard provides no further details (other  than  in  exceptional  circumstances),  as  disclosing  the amount of any provision for  ongoing  litigation  could  cause  the Group serious harm.\n\nTo  the  best  of  the  Company's  knowledge,  there  are  no  other legal,  arbitration  or  governmental  proceedings  or  exceptional events  (including  any  proceedings  of  which  the  Company  is aware that is pending or threatened) that may have or have had over the last 12 months a material impact on the profitability of the  Company  and/or  the  Group,  other  than  those  described below.\n\n## Contingent liabilities related to the change in the legal framework applicable to the Delhi Route to Market\n\nIn  November  2021,  the  new  Excise  Policy  applicable  in  the National Capital Territory of Delhi changed  the  alcohol distribution system, from government-run corporation model to private distributors and retailers.\n\nThe context of the change in route to market is currently under investigation by two government agencies. These investigations relate  to  accusations  that  irregularities  were  committed  by certain Delhi officials, as well as distributors and retailers, in the development and implementation of this excise policy.\n\nIn  that  context,  on  2  February  2023,  a  Delhi  District  Court  took cognisance  of  a  charge  sheet  filed  by  the  Enforcement Directorate of India, claiming that, among others, Pernod Ricard India and one of its employees might have benefited from undue gains under the new Excise Policy, allegedly in breach of certain provisions  of  the  Indian  Prevention  against  Money  Laundering Act.\n\nThe investigation by the authorities is  still  ongoing.  There  have been no significant developments as regards Pernod Ricard India since it began and neither the exact exposure nor its likelihood of occurrence can be assessed at this stage.\n\nAs  a  responsible  corporate  citizen,  Pernod  Ricard  India  is committed  to  comply  with  the  laws  of  the  country  and  will vigorously defend all allegations made against it.\n\n## Disputes relating to trademarks\n\n## Havana Club\n\nThe Havana Club trademark is owned by a joint venture, Havana Club Holding SA (HCH), which is 50%-held by Pernod Ricard. The brand has been registered by HCH in more than 200 countries. In the United States, this trademark has been owned since 1976 by 'Cubaexport',  an  affiliate  of  Pernod  Ricard's  Cuban  partner  in the  Havana  Club  joint  venture.  The  intellectual  property  rights over the American trademark are currently being challenged in the United States courts by a Pernod Ricard competitor (Bacardi).\n\n- 1. Havana  Club  US  trademark  dispute  before  the  District Court for the District of Columbia (DC Case)\n- \u00b7 In  1995,  Bacardi  petitioned  the  Trademark  Trial  and  Appeal Board (TTAB), which is the judicial body of the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), to cancel Cubaexport's registration of the Havana Club trademark in the United States.\n- \u00b7 In January 2004, the TTAB denied the petition, thereby refusing to cancel the registration. Bacardi appealed the decision to the US District  Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia  (DC  Court).  The DC  Court  proceedings  were  suspended  after  the  USPTO refused  to  renew  the  trademark  in  2006,  but  resumed  in January  2016  after  renewal  was  granted.  Bacardi  then  filed additional claims to challenge the 2016 renewal. In response, Cubaexport filed two motions in August 2016: one to dismiss all  actions  launched  by  Bacardi  regarding  the  merits  of  the case and one to expedite proceedings on certain aspects.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 On 6 March 2023, the DC Court granted in part and denied in part  Cubaexport's  motions,  sending  the  case  back  for  an analysis to be conducted on the merits of the arguments in the denied motions.\n- \u00b7 On  19  April  2023,  Cubaexport  responded  to  Bacardi's  initial claims  and  submitted  a  counterclaim  for  infringement  of  its Havana Club trademark in the United States.\n- \u00b7 The  parties  are  still  awaiting  the  DC  Court's  decision  on Cubaexport's counterclaim while discovery proceedings on the merits of the claims are underway.\n- 2. 'Section 211' and the 'No Stolen Trademarks Honored in America Act'\n- \u00b7 In 1998, the United States Congress adopted Section 211 (also known as the \"Bacardi Act\" because it was adopted further to intense lobbying by Bacardi representatives). The Bacardi Act has two main effects on the Havana Club trademark registered by Cubaexport: 1) it prohibits US courts from recognising and enforcing  the  rights  of  Cuban  companies  over  trademarks associated with assets nationalised by the Cuban government; and  2)  it  makes  the  renewal  of  these  trademarks  by  their legitimate owners subject to obtaining a specific licence from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which has discretionary power to grant such a licence.\n- \u00b7 Consequently, since coming into force, Section 211 has impacted Cubaexport in two ways:\n- \u00b7 Cubaexport has been deprived of any legal recourse against the  illegal  use  of  its  trademark  in  the  United  States  by Bacardi,  which  has  distributed  rum  there  since  1996  under the trademark \"Havana Club\", produced in Puerto Rico.\n- \u00b7 In order to renew its trademark registration with the USPTO, Cubaexport  must  apply  for  and  obtain  specific  prior authorisation from the OFAC every ten years.\n- \u00b7 In  2002,  the  Dispute  Settlement  Body  of  the  World  Trade Organisation  (WTO)  condemned  Section  211  on  the  grounds that  it  was  incompatible  with  the  TRIPS  Agreement  and,  in particular,  with  national  treatment  and  most-favoured  nation obligations.  To  date,  the  United  States  has  not  adopted  any measures  to  comply  with  this  decision  (i.e.,  amending  or repealing Section 211).\n- \u00b7 In  November  2023,  a  bill  for  the  No  Stolen  Trademarks Honored  in  America  Act  (NST)  passed  the  House  of Representatives and is now before the Senate. The NST aims to reinforce  the  effects  of  Section  211  by  extending  the prohibition on courts to all US federal agencies, including the USPTO and OFAC, which would technically make it impossible for Cubaexport to renew its trademark. The bill is currently on stand-by pending analysis by the Senate.\n- 3. Renewal  of  the  Havana  Club  trademark  in  the  United States\n- \u00b7 In  1976,  Cubaexport  registered  the  Havana  Club  trademark with the USPTO in the United States for 20 years.\n- \u00b7 In  1996,  Cubaexport  applied  to  the  USPTO  to  renew  its trademark for ten years.\n- \u00b7 In  2006,  Cubaexport  applied  to  the  USPTO  to  renew  its trademark  but,  based  on  the  contents  of  Section  211  as adopted in 1998, the USPTO refused to grant the trademark's renewal  without  an  OFAC  licence.  Cubaexport  therefore applied for a licence from the OFAC but was denied. It filed an appeal against the OFAC's decision with the US District Court for  the  District  of  Columbia,  but  the  case  was  dismissed  in 2009. Cubaexport then appealed this decision with the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which in 2011 upheld the decision of the court of first instance. Cubaexport subsequently took the case to the US Supreme Court with the support of the French  government,  the  National  Foreign  Trade  Council  and the Washington Legal Foundation. In 2012, the Supreme Court refused  to  hear  the  case,  putting  an  end  to  Cubaexport's dispute with the OFAC.\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n- \u00b7 Between 2012 and 2015, Cubaexport's Havana Club trademark was \"frozen\" with the USPTO.\n- \u00b7 In  2015,  Cubaexport  once  again  applied  to  the  OFAC  for  a licence  to  renew  its  trademark  and  was  successful.  On  this ground, Cubaexport applied to the USPTO in 2016 to renew its trademark retroactively from 2006 to 2016 and for a further ten years until 2026.\n- \u00b7 In 2025, Cubaexport will once again have to apply for a licence from  the  OFAC  to  renew  its  trademark  with  the  USPTO  in January 2026 for another ten-year period.\n- 4. Trademark renewal dispute before the US District Court for the District of Virginia (USPTO Case)\n- \u00b7 In 2021, Bacardi filed a motion against the USPTO with the US District Court for the District of Virginia to cancel the trademark renewal granted in 2016 on the grounds that the USPTO lacked jurisdiction to renew the trademark. Cubaexport is not a party to this dispute.\n- \u00b7 In  2022,  the  US  District  Court  of  Virgina  dismissed  Bacardi's claims. Bacardi appealed the decision.\n- \u00b7 In June 2024, the Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the US District Court of Virginia and decided to send the case back for analysis on the merits.\n- \u00b7 If,  at  the  end  of  these  proceedings,  the  US  Discrit  Court  of Virginia were to grant Bacardi's request and conclude that the USPTO  had  acted  beyond  its  jurisdiction  in  granting  the renewal, Cubaexport's  trademark  registration  would  be considered to have expired as of 2006.\n\nA  finding  in  the  Group's  favour  would  enable  the  Havana  Club joint  venture  to  distribute  its  Cuban  rum  in  the  United  States under the Havana Club trademark on the lifting of the embargo.\n\n## Tax disputes\n\nThe  Group's  companies  are  regularly  audited  by  the  tax authorities in the countries in which they are registered.\n\nThe assessment of the risk related to each tax dispute is regularly reviewed by the affiliate or region concerned and by the Group's Tax Department, with the assistance of external counsel for the most  material  or  complex  cases.  Provisions  are  recognised  if necessary. Pernod Ricard provides no further details (other than in  exceptional  circumstances),  as  disclosing  the  amount  of  any provision for ongoing tax litigation could cause the Group serious harm.\n\n## India\n\nPernod  Ricard  India  (P)  Ltd  has  an  ongoing  dispute  with  the Indian customs authorities over the declared transaction value of concentrates  of  alcoholic  beverages  (CAB)  imported  into  India. Customs  are  challenging  the  transaction  values,  arguing  that some competitors used different values for the import of similar goods.  This  matter  was  ruled  on  by  the  Supreme  Court,  which issued an order in July 2010, setting out the principles applicable for the determination of values that should be taken into account for  the  calculation  of  duty.  Pernod  Ricard  India  (P)  Ltd  has already  paid  the  corresponding  amounts  up  to  2001.  For  the period  between  2001  and  December  2010,  Pernod  Ricard  India (P) Ltd has paid almost the entire differential duty as determined by  customs  in  Delhi  following  the  initial  adjustment  notice received in 2011. A second notice received in 2013 and confirmed by  a  court  on  14  August  2017  has  been  suspended  by  the Supreme  Court.  As  regards  the  Company's  CAB  imports  since 2011,  Indian  authorities  have  issued  reports  challenging  the transaction  values  as  well  as  three  show  cause  notices  dated 2022,  but  failed  to  disclose  all  the  data  underlying  their allegations.  The  Group  has  filed  court  requests  to  obtain  such data  and  continues  to  actively  work  with  the  authorities  and courts to resolve pending issues. In addition, pending resolution of  the  dispute,  the  customs  authorities  have  demanded  bank guarantees  for  the  additional  adjusted  duties.  The  company challenged this request before the Supreme Court and obtained\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore,  a  Common Adjudicating Authority (CAA) has been appointed in New Delhi to adjudicate upon the case.  On 16 April 2024, Pernod Ricard India filed a common reply to all three show cause notices before the CAA.\n\nPernod  Ricard  India  (P)  is  also  involved  in  a  debate  with  the Indian  customs  authorities  over  the  transaction  value  of international  products  imported  into  India.  Discussions  are ongoing with the relevant authorities and courts.\n\nMoreover, Pernod Ricard India (P) received several notices of tax adjustment  for  2007  to  2018  relating  to  the  tax  deductibility  of advertising  and  promotion  expenses  (see  Note  6.4  Contingent liabilities ).  In  2020,  Pernod  Ricard  India  (P)  obtained  two  court rulings  in  its  favour  for  the  period  from  2007  to  2014, strengthening its position on the tax deductibility of advertising and promotion expenses.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  a  provision  for  the  above-mentioned disputes is only recognised, as appropriate in other provisions for risks and charges (see Note 4.7 - Provisions) or in income taxes payable  (see  Note  3.3  -  Corporate  income  tax),  when  it  is probable  that  a  present  obligation  arising  as  a  result  of  a  past event  will  require  the  payment  of  an  amount  that  can  be estimated  reliably.  The  amount  of  the  provision  is  the  best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the liability.\n\n## Commercial disputes\n\n## Colombia\n\nTwo separate complaints were filed jointly before the Colombian Competition  Agency  ( Superintendencia  de  Industria  y  Comercio ) on 14 November 2017 by the department of Cundinamarca and its  wholly  owned  distilling  company  Empresa  de  Licores  de Cundinamarca  against Pernod Ricard SA, Pernod Ricard Colombia SA and a competitor company. In late December 2020, Pernod  Ricard  Colombia  received  notice  of  a  similar  complaint, initially  filed  in  September 2019 by the departments of Valle and Antioquia  (as  well  as  wholly  owned  distillation  companies).  The complaint alleges that the defendants have committed violations of  the  Colombian  Unfair  Competition  Act  and,  in  particular, Articles 7 and 18 thereof, through the illegal import of spirits into Colombia. The complaints allege that the companies have gained an  unfair  market  advantage  over  local  producers  through  such activity. The plaintiffs seek damages corresponding to the loss of profits and taxes over the period 2013 to 2017 (2019 in the case of Valle and Antioquia).\n\nPernod  Ricard  intends  to  vigorously  defend  itself  against  such allegations. These complaints contain allegations that are similar to  those  made  in  prior  legal  proceedings  before  the  New  York courts brought by Cundinamarca, the Republic of Colombia and several  other  Colombian  departments  in  2004.  The  New  York proceedings were voluntarily discontinued by the parties in 2012.\n\n## Note 6.6 Related parties\n\nTransactions with associates and joint ventures were immaterial in the financial year ended 30 June 2024.\n\nThe compensation paid to Corporate Officers and Executive Committee members in return for their services to the Group is detailed below:\n\n| \u20ac  millions                            | 30.06.2023   | 30.06.2024   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Board of Directors (1)                 | 1            | 1            |\n| Executive Committee                    |              |              |\n| \u00b7 Short-term benefits                  | 17           | 11           |\n| \u00b7 Post-employment benefits             | 4            | 3            |\n| \u00b7 Share-based compensation (2)         | 11           | 12           |\n| TOTAL EXPENSES RECOGNISED FOR THE YEAR | 33           | 27           |\n\nIn  addition,  the  Executive  Corporate  Officer  (Chairman  and  CEO)  is  eligible  for  the  following  severance  payments  (the  subject  of  a related-party agreement approved by the Shareholders' Meeting of 17 November 2016):\n\n- \u00b7 one-year non-compete clause, together with a payment corresponding to 12 months' compensation;\n- \u00b7 forced  departure  clause  subject  to  performance  conditions,  together  with  a  maximum  payment  corresponding  to  12  months' compensation.\n\nThese clauses were not implemented in the course of the past financial year.",

the period under review, this refers to services provided and recognised in the income statement during a financial year.\n- (2) The issuer is understood to be the Parent Company.\n- (3) Including the services of independent experts or members of the Statutory Auditors' network employed to audit the financial statements.\n- (4) This section sets out the non-audit services provided to the issuer or its affiliates by the Statutory Auditors or the members of their networks. They may be required by law or by the provisions stipulated at the request of the Group or its affiliates and comply with independence requirements.\n\n## NOTE 7 Consolidation scope\n\nThe  annual  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  financial  statements  of  the  Parent  Company,  Pernod  Ricard  SA,  and those of entities controlled by the Parent Company ('the affiliates'). Control is the power to influence the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities, irrespective of the percentage held in the entity. Non-controlling interests  in  the  net  assets  of  consolidated  affiliates  are  presented  separately  from  Parent  Company  shareholders'  equity. Non -controlling interests include both the interests of minority shareholders at the date of the original business combination and minority interests in any subsequent changes to shareholders' equity.\n\nIntragroup transactions and internal profits and losses relating to consolidated companies are eliminated.\n\nCompanies over which the Group exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method.\n\n## Note 7.1 Consolidation scope\n\nThe main changes to the Group's scope of consolidation in FY 2024 are presented in Note 1.2 Significant events during the financial year .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Shareholders' Meeting,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Shareholders' Meetings, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Pernod Ricard S.A. for the year ended 30 June 2024.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2024 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur  responsibilities  under  those  standards  are  further  described  in  the  'Statutory  Auditors'  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  engagement  in  compliance  with  independence  requirements  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  ( Code  de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors for the period from 1 July 2023 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 821-53 and R. 821-180 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to the  justification  of  our  assessments,  we  inform  you  of  the  key  audit  matters  relating  to  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n## Brands' valuation\n\n(Notes 1.1.4 and 4.1 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\nAs of 30 June 2024, indefinite-life brands were recorded in the balance sheet  for  a  net  carrying  amount  of  \u20ac12,050  million,  i.e.  31%  of  total assets.\n\nCash  Generating  Units  (\"CGUs\")  are  defined  as  the  brand  and  all assets required to generate the cash flows associated with the brand. An  impairment  loss  is  recorded  when  their  net  carrying  amount exceeds  their  recoverable  amount.  Their  recoverable  amount  is determined as part of mandatory annual impairment tests given their indefinite  life  and/or  specific  tests  required  in  the  event  of  an indication  of  a  loss  in  value.  Recoverable  amounts  are  generally determined  based  on  discounted  future  cash  flow  calculations  and involve significant management judgements of components such as price  and  volume  growth  rates,  the  timing  of  future  operating expenses and discount and long-term growth rates.\n\nBased on its annual impairment test results, the Company recorded a net  reversal  of  impairment  before  tax  of  \u20ac199  million  for  the  year ended  30  June  2024,  as  disclosed  in  Note    4.1  to  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\nFurthermore,  the  sensitivity  of  CGUs'  recoverable  amounts  to assumptions  was  analysed  by  management  and  presented  in  Note 4.1.  Changes  in  these  assumptions  could  give  rise  to  further impairment losses.\n\nConsidering  the  weight  of  brands  on  the  balance  sheet,  the complexity of the models used and their sensitivity to changes in the data and assumptions underlying the estimates, particularly cash flow forecasts  and  discount  rates  used,  we  considered  the  recoverable amount  of  brands  to  be  a  key  audit  matter  presenting  a  risk  of material misstatement.\n\n## Tax risks\n\n(Notes 1.1.4, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, 6.4 and 6.5 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\nThe Group operates in numerous different tax jurisdictions. The tax\n\nauthorities of the countries in which the Group companies operate regularly have queries on issues relating to their everyday activities. Tax audits can therefore give rise to tax reassessments and litigation with these tax authorities. The assessment of the risk related to each tax  litigation  is  regularly  reviewed  by  each  concerned  affiliate  or region and by the Group's tax department, with the support of its external  counsels  for  the  most  significant  and  complex  litigations. Part  of  the  amount  of  provisions  for  contingences  for  all  legal disputes or risks involving the Group relate to tax risks and litigation. More  particularly,  the  Indian  affiliate  is  involved  in  disputes  with customs  and  tax  authorities  over,  among  others,  the  declared transaction  value  of  imported  products  into  India  and  the  tax deductibility of promotional and advertising expenses. As indicated in the Note 6.5 'Disputes', the reassessment proposals are only the subject  of  provisions  or  income  tax  payables  where  appropriate, when it is likely that a current liability resulting from a past event will require an outflow of resources which can be reliably estimated.\n\nGiven the Group's exposure to tax issues, which are in part specific to its business sector, and the high level of management judgement in  estimating  the  risks  and  amounts  recorded,  we  considered  tax risks  to  be  a  key  audit  matter  and  the  understatement  of  the corresponding  provisions  to  be  a  possible  source  of  material misstatement in the financial statements.\n\nOur procedures mainly consisted in:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing  the  principles  and  methods  of  calculating  CGUs' accounting and recoverable amounts;\n- \u00b7 testing the operation of Group controls covering the calculation of CGUs' recoverable amounts;\n- \u00b7 for  CGUs  with  a  recoverable  amount  close  to  their  carrying amount ('sensitive brands' CGUs'), confirming the results of the valuation  model  used  by  management  by  comparing  them  with the results of our models;\n- \u00b7 corroborating the reasonableness of the main data and assumptions underlying the estimates (such as the discount rates and  long-term  growth  rates),  primarily  for  'sensitive  brands' CGUs', especially with regard to available market analyses and in relation to economic environments where the Group operates;\n- \u00b7 being informed of the commercial outlook of the brands based on interviews  with  management  and  comparing  the  accounting estimates of prior period cash flow projections with corresponding actual values to assess reliability;\n- \u00b7 testing  the  arithmetical  accuracy  of  the  valuations  used  by  the Company on a sample basis;\n- \u00b7 assessing  management's  sensitivity  analysis  on  recoverable amounts to changes in main assumptions.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in Notes 1.1.4 and  4.1  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  verified  the arithmetical accuracy of the presented sensitivity analysis.\n\nBased on discussions with management, we have been informed of the procedures implemented by the Group to identify uncertain tax positions and, where necessary, provide for tax risks or income tax payables.\n\nIn  addition, we assessed the judgements made by management in evaluating  the  probability  of  taxes  being  payable,  the  amount  of potential exposure and the reasonableness of the estimates adopted for  provisions  for  tax  risks  or  income  tax  payables.  We  particularly focused  on  the  impact  of  changes  in  local  tax  regulations  and ongoing audits conducted by local tax authorities.\n\nTo assess whether the tax liabilities were appropriately recognised, and with the assistance of our tax experts, we:\n\n- \u00b7 conducted interviews with the Group's tax department and regional and local management teams in order to assess the current state of the investigations and reassessments made by tax authorities and monitor the development of ongoing tax disputes;\n- \u00b7 consulted the recent Group company decisions and correspondence  with  local  tax  authorities,  and  reviewed  the correspondence between the relevant companies and their lawyers, where necessary;\n- \u00b7 analysed lawyers' responses to our information requests;\n- \u00b7 performed a critical review of the estimates and positions adopted by management;\n- \u00b7 assessed  whether  the  latest  developments  were  taken  into account in the provisions recorded in the balance sheet.\n\nWe also assessed the disclosures in Notes 1.1.4, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, 6.4 and 6.5 to the consolidated financial statements.",

As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent to the block-tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to the European single electronic format, the content of certain tags of the notes may not be rendered identically to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Pernod Ricard by the Shareholders' Meeting held on 13 May 2003 for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and on 17 November 2016 for KPMG SA.\n\nAs at 30 June 2024, Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and KPMG SA were in the 21 st year and 8 th year of total uninterrupted engagement, respectively.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease its operations.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  financial  reporting  process  and  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  and  risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgement throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  statutory  auditor  is  responsible  for  the  direction,  supervision  and performance  of  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  for  the  opinion  expressed  on  these  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur  report  to  the  Audit  Committee  includes  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgement,  were  of  most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters, that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe  also  provide  the  Audit  Committee  with  the  declaration  provided  for  in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  537/2014,  confirming  our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.821-27 to L.821-34 of the French  Commercial  Code  ( Code  de  commerce )  and  in  the  French  Code  of    Ethics  ( Code  de  d\u00e9ontologie )  for  statutory  auditors.  Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, 18 September 2024 The Statutory Auditors, French original signed by\n\n## KPMG SA\n\n## Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nCaroline Bruno-Diaz\n\nAdrien Johner\n\nMarc de Villartay\n\nLoris Strappazzon\n\nPartner\n\nPartner\n\nPartner\n\nPartner",

Pernod Ricard SA's financial relations with its affiliates mainly involve the billing of royalties for the use of trademarks owned by Pernod Ricard SA, other miscellaneous billings and the receipt of dividends.\n\n## 7.4.2 Income statement and balance sheet for the financial year ended 30 June 2024\n\n## Analysis of the income statement for the financial year ended 30 June 2024\n\nOperating income totalled \u20ac474 million for FY 2024, down \u20ac4 million on the prior year.\n\nOperating expenses were \u20ac655 million for FY 2024, up \u20ac43 million versus \u20ac612 million one year ago.\n\nThe net operating loss was \u20ac182 million for FY 2024, representing a deterioration of \u20ac48 million versus the prior year.\n\nNet  financial  income  amounted  to  \u20ac1,891  million  for  FY  2024, down \u20ac143 million versus income of \u20ac2,034 million one year ago (see Note 18).\n\nNon-recurring income and expenses represented a net expense of \u20ac94 million for FY 2024.\n\nLastly, corporate income tax represented a benefit of \u20ac143 million for  FY  2024,  in  connection  with  the  effects  of  tax  consolidation during the year.\n\nAs a result, profit for the year came out at \u20ac1,759 million.\n\n## Analysis of the balance sheet at 30 June 2024\n\n## Assets\n\nTotal net non-current assets stood at \u20ac13,140 million at 30 June 2024, versus \u20ac13,561 million at the previous year-end, i.e., a decrease of \u20ac421  million,  mainly  attributable  to  a  \u20ac417  million  decline  in non -current financial assets (see Note 3).\n\nCurrent  assets  amounted  to  \u20ac5,559  million  at  30  June  2024,  an increase of \u20ac2,985 million compared with 30 June 2023.\n\nAccrued assets, amounting to \u20ac230 million, consist of unrealised foreign exchange losses and bond redemption premiums.\n\n## Liabilities and shareholders' equity\n\nShareholders' equity amounted to \u20ac6,517 million at 30 June 2024, versus  \u20ac6,467  million  at  30  June  2023.  The  main  movements during the period were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 profit for the year of \u20ac1,759 million;\n- \u00b7 the  payment  of  the  balance  of  the  dividend  for  FY  2024  for \u20ac667 million;\n- \u00b7 the  payment  of  an  interim  dividend  of  \u20ac2.35  per  share  in respect of FY 2024, amounting to \u20ac591 million, on 19 July 2024;\n- \u00b7 the  continuation  of  the  share  buyback  programme,  with  the cancellation  of  shares  bought  back  for  a  total  amount  of \u20ac451 million.\n\nProvisions for contingencies and losses amounted to \u20ac572 million, an increase of \u20ac92 million year on year.\n\nDuring the period, borrowings and debt increased by \u20ac2,399 million, mainly due to:\n\n- \u00b7 the  issue  of  four  bonds  for  \u20ac600  million,  \u20ac750  million, \u20ac700 million and \u20ac800 million, and the redemption of a bond for \u20ac500 million;\n- \u00b7 an increase in accrued interest, for \u20ac48 million;\n- \u00b7 the impact of foreign exchange on borrowings denominated in US dollars, for \u20ac20 million.\n\nOperating  payables  amounted  to  \u20ac888  million,  an  increase  of \u20ac35 million, mainly due to:\n\n- \u00b7 a reduction in trade payables, for \u20ac15 million;\n- \u00b7 an increase in miscellaneous payables, including a \u20ac14 million decrease in the tax current accounts and a \u20ac69 million increase in dividends payable.\n\nAccrued  liabilities  amounting  to  \u20ac10  million  at  30  June  2024, comprise unrealised foreign exchange gains, which increased by \u20ac5 million compared with 30 June 2023.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the Pernod Ricard SA parent company financial statements\n\n## NOTE 1 Accounting policies\n\nThe annual financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the French General Chart of Accounts ( Plan comptable g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ), which apply under Regulation 2014-03 of the French accounting standards-setter ( Autorit\u00e9 des normes comptables -ANC) of 5 June 2014 and all subsequently amended rules. General accounting  rules  have  been  applied,  in  accordance  with  the principle of prudence, pursuant to the following basic assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 going concern;\n- \u00b7 consistency  of  accounting  policies  from  one  financial  year  to the next;\n- \u00b7 accruals basis of accounting;\n- \u00b7 in  accordance  with  the  general  rules  of  preparing  and presenting annual financial statements.\n\nThe  standard  method  used  to  measure  items  recorded  in  the balance sheet is the historical cost method.\n\n## 1.1 Intangible assets\n\nThe trademarks acquired from the merger of Pernod and Ricard in 1975 and from subsequent mergers are the Company's main intangible assets.\n\nIntangible  assets  are  initially  measured  at  cost.  Amortisation  is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets.\n\nAs  part  of  its  digital  transformation,  Pernod  Ricard  SA  has developed  tools  to  leverage  data  generated  by  the  Group's various activities. The production of these algorithms falls within the scope of the accounting regulations for internally-generated intangible assets. Development  costs are recognised as intangible  assets  from  the  date  on  which  technical  feasibility  is demonstrated and the related human and material resources are sufficient.\n\n## 1.2 Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  is  initially  measured  at  cost (purchase price plus ancillary costs but excluding acquisition -related  fees).  Depreciation  is  calculated  using  the straight-line or declining-balance  methods,  based  on  the estimated useful lives of the assets:\n\n- \u00b7 buildings: between 20 and 50 years (straight-line);\n- \u00b7 building fixtures and fittings: 10 years (straight-line);\n- \u00b7 equipment: 5 years (straight-line);\n- \u00b7 furniture, office equipment: 10 years (straight-line) or 4 years (declining-balance).\n\n## 1.3 Non-current financial assets\n\nThe gross value of investments comprises their acquisition cost, excluding ancillary costs.\n\nIf  the value in use of investments is lower than their acquisition cost,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognised  in  financial  income  and expenses for the amount of the difference.\n\nPernod Ricard SA mainly uses two methods to estimate the value in use of its equity investments:\n\n- \u00b7 the  enterprise  value  of  the  main  investments  is  estimated based on the most recent estimate of the net asset value, by identifying in particular unrealised capital gains on assets held by  the  affiliates,  such  as  trademarks.  Net  asset  value  is estimated based on methods such as the discounted cash flow method.  The  term  of  the  cash  flow  projections  reflects  the characteristics  of  the  Group's  brands  and  their  production assets. Discounted projected cash flows are established based on annual budgets and multi-year business plans, extrapolated to  subsequent  years  by  gradually  converging  growth  for  the last  year  of  the  plan  for  each  brand  and  market  towards  a perpetuity  growth  rate.  The  calculation  includes  a  terminal value  determined  by  capitalising  the  cash  flows  generated  in the last year of the plan;\n- \u00b7 for  other  equity  investments, value in use is estimated based on  the  share  of  the  affiliate's  equity  represented  by  the investment.\n\n## 1.4 Receivables\n\nReceivables are recognised at their nominal value. An impairment  loss  is  recognised  if  their  recoverable  amount  falls below their carrying amount.\n\n## 1.5 Marketable securities\n\nMarketable  securities  include  treasury  shares  acquired  in connection with stock option and performance share plans and earmarked for that purpose at the time of acquisition.\n\nA liability is recognised when it becomes probable that the rights to receive the marketable securities concerned by the plans will be exercised. For other marketable securities, an impairment loss is recognised when the cost price exceeds the market price.\n\n## 1.6 Bonds\n\nRedemption  premiums  are  amortised  over  the  term  of  the bonds.\n\n## 1.7 Provisions for contingencies and losses\n\nProvisions  for  contingencies  and  losses  are  recognised  in accordance  with  Accounting  Regulation  2000-06  on  liabilities, issued on 7 December 2000 by the French accounting regulatory committee ( Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9glementation comptable - CRC).\n\nThis  regulation  provides  that  a  liability  be  recognised  when  an entity has a present obligation towards a third party and that it is probable or certain that it will result in an outflow of resources to the third party without equivalent consideration being received. A  present  obligation  must  exist  at  the  reporting  date  for  a provision to be recognised.",

        "page_content": "## 1.8 Pensions and other long -term employee benefits\n\nSince  the  financial  year  ended  30  June  2014,  the  Company  has opted  to  recognise  the  full  liability  for  pensions  and  other long -term employee benefits in the balance sheet, as provided by ANC Recommendation 2013-02. At 30 June 2024, the provision for pensions and other long-term employee benefits was \u20ac39 million.\n\nFollowing  the  decision  published  by  the  IFRIC  in  April  2021  on IAS 19 'Employee Benefits', covering the attribution of benefits to  periods  of  service  and  clarifying  the  periods  over  which employee  benefits  should  be  attributed  when  allocating  the IAS  19  expense,  the  Company  has  chosen,  since  FY  2022,  in accordance  with  the  update  of  17  November  2021  to  ANC Recommendation 2013-02 of 7 November 2013 on the rules for measuring  and  recognising  pension  commitments  and  similar benefits,  to  apply  this  accounting  method  for  its  financial statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  French  accounting principles.\n\n## 1.9 Translation of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currency\n\nPayables, receivables and cash balances denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 translation  of  all  payables,  receivables  and  cash  balances denominated  in  foreign  currencies  at  period-end  exchange rates;\n- \u00b7 recognition of a provision for currency risk for any unrealised currency  losses,  after  taking  into  account  the  effect  of  any offsetting foreign exchange hedging transactions.\n\nPernod Ricard SA has several hedging relationships and generates an  overall  foreign  currency  position  for  economic  hedging instruments  and  hedged  items  that  do  not  form  a  hedging relationship in order to calculate the currency risk provision.\n\n## 1.10  Forward financial instruments\n\nDifferences  arising  from  changes  in  the  value  of  financial instruments used as hedges are recognised in profit or loss in a manner  symmetrical  to  that  of  the  underlying  income  and expenses.\n\n## 1.11 Corporate income tax\n\nPernod  Ricard  SA  is  subject  to  the  French  tax  consolidation system defined by the law of 31 December 1987. Under certain conditions, this system allows income taxes payable by profitable companies  to  be  offset  against  tax  losses  of  other  companies. The system is governed by Articles 223-A et seq . of the French Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ).\n\nEach  company  in  the  tax  group  calculates  and  recognises  its income tax expense as if it were taxed as a stand-alone entity.\n\nThe  effects  of  tax  consolidation  are  recognised  in  the  Pernod Ricard SA financial statements.\n\n## 1.12  Related parties\n\nThe majority of transactions with related parties are carried out with directly or indirectly held affiliates.",

The  calculation  is performed  at  each  reporting  date  and  the  personal  data concerning employees is revised at least every three years. The calculation  requires  the  use  of  economic  assumptions  (inflation rate  and  discount  rate)  and  other  assumptions  concerning employees  (mainly  average  salary  increase,  employee  turnover and life expectancy).\n\nAt 30 June 2024, the total amount of employee benefit obligations was  \u20ac39  million.  Provisions  have  been  recognised  for  the  full amount of the obligations.\n\nFor information, the inflation rate used for the measurement at 30 June 2024 was 2.00% and the discount rate was 3.30%.\n\nPlan assets are measured at their market value at each reporting date.\n\n## NOTE 10  Deferred income and other accrued liabilities\n\n| \u20ac thousands                                                        | 30.06.2023   | Increases   | Decreases   | 30.06.2024   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Deferred income                                                    | 13,608       | -           | (2,693)     | 10,915       |\n| Unrealised foreign exchange gains (1)  (see breakdown in Note 1.9) | 5,232        | 5,030       | -           | 10,262       |\n| TOTAL                                                              | 18,840       | 5,030       | (2,693)     | 21,177       |\n\n## Accounting for actuarial gains and losses\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  arise  primarily  when  estimates  differ from actual outcomes, or when there are changes in long-term actuarial assumptions (e.g., discount rate, salary increases, etc.).\n\nSince  the  financial  year  ended  30  June  2014,  the  Company  has opted to recognise the full liability for pensions, as provided by ANC Recommendation 2013-02.\n\n## Components of the expense recognised for the financial year\n\nThe  expense  recognised  in  respect  of  the  benefit  obligations described above includes:\n\n- \u00b7 expenses corresponding to the vesting of an additional year's entitlement;\n- \u00b7 interest  expense  arising  on  the  unwinding  of  the  discount applied to vested rights at the start of the year (as a result of the passage of time);\n- \u00b7 income corresponding to the expected return on plan assets measured  using  the  discount  rate  used  to  measure  plan obligations;\n- \u00b7 income or expense corresponding to actuarial gains or losses;\n- \u00b7 income or expense related to amendments to existing plans or the creation of new plans;\n- \u00b7 income  or  expense  related  to  any  plan  curtailments  or settlements.",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements' section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  engagement  in  compliance  with  independence  requirements  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  ( Code  de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for Statutory Auditors for the period from 1 July 2023 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L.821-53 and R.821-180 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to the  justification  of  our  assessments,  we  inform  you  of  the  key  audit  matters  relating  to  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nResponses as part of our audit\n\n## Valuation of investments\n\n(Notes 1.3 and 3 to the financial statements)\n\nAs at 30 June 2024, consolidated and non-consolidated investments are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  at  a  net  carrying  amount  of \u20ac12,769 million and represent 67% of total assets. They are initially recognised at acquisition cost, excluding ancillary costs.\n\nIf  the  value  in  use  of  investments  is  lower  than  their  net  carrying amount,  a  provision  for  impairment  is  recognised  in  financial income/(expense)  in  the  amount  of  the  difference.  As  disclosed  in Note  1.3  to  the  financial  statements,  value  in  use  is  determined based on two methodologies:\n\n- \u00b7 The  enterprise  value  of  the  main  investments  is  based  on  the most  recent  estimate  of  the  adjusted  net  asset  value,  by identifying  unrealised  capital  gains  on  assets  owned  by  the affiliates, such as brands. The adjusted net asset value is assessed based on methods such as the discounted cash flows method.\n- \u00b7 For  other  investments,  value  in  use  is  estimated  based  on  the share of the affiliate's equity represented by the investment.\n\nEstimates  of  the  value  in  use  of  these  investments  are  based  on complex  valuation  models  for  affiliates  which  in  turn  own  several affiliates and require management to exercise significant judgment (particularly  regarding  cash  flow  assumptions  and  taking  into consideration asset revaluations).\n\nGiven the weight of investments in the balance sheet, the complexity of the models used and their sensitivity to changes in the data and assumptions underlying estimates, we considered the determination of the value in use of investments to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe familiarised ourselves with the Company's controls covering the process for determining the value in use of investments. Our other procedures mainly consisted in:\n\n- \u00b7 verifying,  based  on  information  communicated  to  us,  that  the values  in  use  for  investments  estimated  by  management  are supported by appropriate documentation of the valuation method and amounts used;\n- \u00b7 obtaining and  analysing the valuation report on certain investments  produced  by  the  Company's  external  valuation advisors;\n- \u00b7 comparing data used in investment impairment tests with source documents by entity and the results of our audit procedures on these affiliates;\n- \u00b7 sample testing the arithmetical accuracy of values in use adopted by the Company.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of disclosures in the Notes 1.3 and 3 to the financial statements.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  will  always  detect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.821-55 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor  exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies  and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains  audit  evidence  considered  to  be  sufficient  and  appropriate  to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses  the  appropriateness  of  management's  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the  Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However,  future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Company  to  cease  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  If  the  statutory  auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements  represent  the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our  audit.  We  also  report,  if  any,  significant  deficiencies  in  internal  control  regarding  the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur  report  to  the  Audit  Committee  includes  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also  provide  the  Audit  Committee  with  the  declaration  provided  for  in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  N\u00b0  537/2014,  confirming  our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.821-27 to L.821-34 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate,  we  discuss  with  the  Audit  Committee  the  risks  that  may  reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our  independence,  and  the related safeguards.\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, 18 September 2024 The Statutory Auditors,\n\nKPMG SA\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nCaroline Bruno-Diaz\n\nAdrien Johner\n\nMarc de Villartay\n\nLoris Strappazzon\n\nPartner\n\nPartner\n\nPartner\n\nPartner",

The transactions carried  out  under  this  authorisation  are  described  in  Chapter  2 'Corporate governance', subsection 2.3 'Share buyback programme' of  the  2023-2024  Universal  Registration  Document.

The total amount allocated to the share buyback programme may not exceed \u20ac6,333,218,700.\n\nThis authorisation would enable the Board of Directors to purchase Company  shares  representing a  maximum  of  10%  of  the Company's share capital , particularly in order to:\n\n- \u00b7 grant  or  sell  the  shares  to  employees  and/or  Executive Corporate Officers of the Company and/or its current or future affiliates under the terms and conditions provided for by law, in particular by granting stock options or as part of employee profit-sharing plans; or\n- \u00b7 retain  and  subsequently  tender  the  shares  (in  exchange,  as payment  or  otherwise)  in  connection  with  external  growth transactions,  within  the  limit  of  5%  of  the  number  of  shares comprising the share capital;\n- \u00b7 deliver  the  shares  upon  the  exercise  of  rights  attached  to securities granting access to the share capital;\n- \u00b7 cancel the shares;\n- \u00b7 make  a  market  for  the  shares  in  accordance  with  liquidity agreements; and\n- \u00b7 trade in Company shares for any other authorised or compliant purpose  or  any  purpose  that  may  be  authorised  or  become compliant with the applicable regulations in the future or that may be permitted as a market practice by the French financial markets authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF) in the future.  The  Company  will  inform  the  shareholders  in  a  press release prior to carrying out any such transactions.\n\nThe  above  transactions  would  be  carried  out  during  periods considered  appropriate  by  the  Board  of  Directors.  However, during a public offer, buybacks may only be carried out provided that they:\n\n- \u00b7 enable the Company to meet commitments made prior to the launch of the public offer; and\n- \u00b7 are undertaken to pursue a share buyback programme already in progress; and\n- \u00b7 cannot cause the offer to fail; and\n- \u00b7 fall within the scope of one of the following objectives:\n- \u00b7 delivery to the beneficiaries of free and/or performance shares;\n- \u00b7 fulfilment  of  the  Company's  commitments  under  financial contracts or options with cash payments; or\n- \u00b7 the  granting  of  free  shares  to  employees  and/or  Executive Corporate  Officers  of  the  Company  and/or  its  current  or future affiliates.\n\n## Fifteenth and sixteenth resolutions\n\nResolutions relating to the grant of shares free of charge, with and without performance conditions\n\n15 th resolution: this authorisation would be valid for a period of 38  months from the date of the Shareholders' Meeting. During this period, it would permit the allocation of performance shares representing a maximum of 1.5% of the Company's share capital at  the  date  of  the  Board  of  Directors'  decision  to  allocate  such shares.  The  number  of  performance  shares  allocated  to  the Company's Executive Corporate Officers shall not exceed 0.08% of  the  Company's  share  capital  at  the  date  of  the  Board  of Directors'  decision  to  allocate  such  shares,  and  would  be deducted  from  the  aforementioned  ceiling  of  1.5%  of  the Company's share capital.\n\nThe  free  shares  would  vest  subject  to  the  achievement  of conditions  set  at  the  allocation  date,  notably  a  presence condition, over a vesting period of at least three years.\n\nIf  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  approves  this  resolution,  any  free share allocations will be decided by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee.\n\nSince the 10 November 2021 plan, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, has included non-financial  (CSR)  performance  criteria  in  addition  to  the financial  performance  criteria  in  the  long-term  compensation plans, to bring them in line with Pernod Ricard's strategy.\n\nThe  performance  conditions  of  the  plan  that  could  be implemented in 2024 would be as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 an  internal  financial  performance  condition  linked  to  the average  achievement  of  the  annual  targets  for  Group  Profit from Recurring Operations (PRO): the shares would vest if the average  achievement  of  the  annual  targets  for  Group  profit from  recurring  operations  over  three  consecutive  financial years is greater than 95% of the annual targets for Group profit from  recurring  operations.  The  final  number  of  shares allocated  is  determined  by  applying  a  percentage  between 0 and 100, using linear progression; and\n- \u00b7 a  non-financial  performance  condition  related  to  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) based on four sub-criteria:\n- \u00b7 Carbon: Implementation of the roadmap to reduce direct CO 2 emissions generated by our sites in order to achieve net zero emissions by 2030;",

In  the  interests  of  continuity and  comparability,  the  Board  intends  to  apply  the  same performance  criteria  in  the  future.  However,  in  the  event  that these criteria were to no longer be relevant, the Board may make adjustments or choose other equivalent criteria.\n\n16 th resolution: this authorisation by the Shareholders' Meeting would be valid for  a  period  of  38  months  from  the  date  of  the Shareholders'  Meeting.  During  this  period,  it  would  permit  the allocation of free shares representing a maximum of 0.5% of the Company's share capital  at  the  date  of  the  Board  of  Directors' decision to allocate such shares.\n\nThe  vesting  of  the  free  shares  would  be  subject  to  a  presence condition over a vesting period of at least three years, but may not be subject to any performance conditions.\n\nThis  is  because  the  Board  of  Directors  would  like  to  have  a scheme  to  retain  Group  talent  by  involving  them  in  the Company's  share  performance,  and  to  attract  new  talent. Consequently, these allocations would  be  made:  (i) on recruitment  as  part  of  the  Group's  policy  on  attracting  new talent, but also (ii) to reward and retain certain employees.\n\nThe  Company's  Executive  Corporate  Officers  would  not  benefit from  any  allocations  under  this  authorisation.  The  members  of the  Company's  Executive  Committee  would  also  be  excluded from receiving allocations under this authorisation, except at the time of their recruitment, in accordance with the Group's policy on attracting new talent.\n\n## Seventeenth resolution\n\nPowers to carry out the necessary legal formalities\n\nIn the 17 th resolution ,  you  are  asked to authorise the Board of Directors to carry out any required legal formalities.\n\n<!-- image -->",
