The Board of Directors in turn entrusted the position of Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer to Flavio Ca/t\\_t.ligaaneo.\n\nThe extraordinary events that have impacted the global geopolitical and macroeconomic environment have generated unprecedented volatility in the energy system and wrought structural changes in the energy market. In this context, our new management has delineated the new strategy underpinning the Group's 20242026 Business Plan, which envisages: (i) the rigorous allocation of resources to boost the return on capital employed, together with the balancing of risk and return in investment decisions and models; (ii) greater e/ffi.ligaciency and e/ff.ligaectiveness in processes and organizational structure, seeking to increase accountability and free up /fi.liganancial resources to drive the industrial development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Flavio Ca/t\\_t.ligaaneo\n\nChief Executive O/ffi.ligacer and General Manager\n\nof the Group; and (iii) /fi.liganancial and environmental sustainability, con/fi.ligarming our commitments to the energy transition and the electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption, while ensuring a more balanced and sustainable /fi.liganancial structure.\n\nIn 2023, Enel con/fi.ligarmed its position as the largest private renewable power generator in the world, with 63 GW of managed capacity (including our growing and necessary ba/t\\_t.ligaery energy storage capacity) and the largest private electricity distribution company at the global level, with over 70 million end users served by grids that will have to deliver increasing levels of resilience and digitalization to suppo/r\\_t.liga the electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, we have the largest customer base among private companies, with some 61 million electricity and gas customers.\n\nThe Group's leadership in sustainability has once again been recognized worldwide, underscored by its constant presence in various major sustainability rankings and indices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## The macroeconomic environment\n\nIn 2023, global growth proved more resilient than expected at the beginning of the year, thanks to a faster-than-expected reduction in in/fl.ligaation in many economies, suppo/r\\_t.ligaed  by  the  gradual  normalization  of  energy  commodity prices and the gradual easing of supply chain bo/t\\_t.ligalenecks. Many governments' energy suppo/r\\_t.liga programs also helped mitigate the impacts of the turbulence on household incomes and suppo/r\\_t.liga productive activity in many economies.\n\nHowever,  the  results  di/ff.ligaered  among  countries:  growth was solid in the United States, sustained by the recovery in public and private spending, and in Latin America, where in/fl.ligaation slowed and political and labor market conditions improved. Conversely, much of the euro area experienced an abrupt economic slowdown, re/fl.ligaecting both the restrictive monetary policy stance adopted by the European Central Bank in order to counter in/fl.ligaationary pressures and weak foreign demand, also accompanied by challenging geopolitical developments in the Middle East.\n\nWith regard to the energy industry, in 2023, the European gas market displayed a signi/fi.ligacant downward trend in prices, thanks to high levels of storage and declining demand, with the average reduction in TTF (Title Transfer Facility) prices exceeding 65% compared with 2022, reaching about \u20ac35/MWh in the last qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2023. Coal-/fi.ligared generation also declined, primarily discouraged by the rise in CO2 prices within the ETS (Emissions Trading System), despite coal prices plunging by 55.5% to an average of $129/ton.\n\nCompared with 2022, electricity prices in Italy and Spain fell  sharply,  re/fl.ligaecting  the  decline  in  energy  commodity  prices  and,  in  pa/r\\_t.liga,  growing  renewables  generation. More speci/fi.ligacally, electricity prices in Italy decreased by 58% compared with the previous year, while in Spain they dropped by 48%.\n\nIn the metals sector, economic weakness adversely impacted the prices of aluminum and copper, with declines of 16.6% and 3.8% respectively compared with 2022. Metals associated with renewable energy technologies, such as lithium and polysilicon, experienced an even steeper slide in prices as demand contracted.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnd users\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenewables capacity managed\n\n## Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance\n\nThanks to management actions and our focus on the core business, the Group closed the 2023 /fi.liganancial year having achieved our full-year targets as revised upwards in the 3rd Qua/r\\_t.ligaer and announced to the market, with ordinary EBITDA of \u20ac22.0 billion and an ordinary net pro/fi.ligat of \u20ac6.5 billion, up 12% and about 21%, respectively, compared with the previous year. The dividend that will be proposed to shareholders for 2023 amounts to \u20ac0.43 per share, 7.5% higher than that for 2022. In terms of cash generation, FFO in 2023 amounted to about \u20ac14.8 billion, up more than 60% compared with 2022. Net debt is equal to \u20ac60.2 billion, with the net debt to ordinary EBITDA ratio improving from 3.1x to 2.7x. This last indicator does not yet re/fl.ligaect the e/ff.ligaects of the proceeds generated by divestments, already announced to investors and subject to binding agreements between the pa/r\\_t.ligaies, carried out in 2023 as pa/r\\_t.liga of the extraordinary plan to reduce the Group's /fi.liganancial debt. Recall that the Plan approved in 2022 to restore a sustainable and balanced Group /fi.liganancial structure provided for the sale of Group investments and other assets of over \u20ac12 billion in 2023 alone.\n\n## Main events\n\nIn 2023, the Group con/fi.ligarmed its hard-won technological leadership in renewables generation and distribution grids.\n\nOn the power generation front, in 2023 Enel built out about 5.3 GW of new renewables capacity (including 934 MW of ba/t\\_t.ligaery storage), reaching a total of approximately 63 GW of installed capacity and a volume of renewables generation of 140 TWh/year. The capacity we operate is also suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by a pipeline of projects in the advanced development phase of up to 160 GW.\n\nIn the power distribution segment, our strong commitment  to  modernizing  and  digitalizing  electricity  grids continues, both to increase their resilience to increasingly extreme and frequent climate events and to make them ready to play the role of enablers of the energy transition: during the year, Enel Grids activated almost 540,000 new",

        "page_content": "producer  and  prosumer (1) connections  globally,  adding about 8 GW of distributed renewables capacity connected to our grids, reaching a total of some 68 GW of capacity from approximately 2 million producer and prosumer connections.\n\nThe development of a po/r\\_t.ligafolio of products dedicated to residential consumers, businesses and municipalities also con/fi.ligarmed the Group's leading role in fostering the energy transition and the electri/fi.ligacation of consumption.\n\nIn 2023, Enel X Global Retail operated at full capacity with a new, more tightly integrated structure to reap the bene/fi.ligats of bundled packages of electricity, gas, electric mobility, energy e/ffi.ligaciency and ultra-fast connectivity services. An example of this is the 'Formidabile' o/ff.ligaer, launched in Italy at the end of October 2023 and in Spain at the beginning of 2024. Our commitment to improving the customer experience also continues: in 2023 commercial complaints decreased by 12% (2) compared with the previous year, and in February the German Institute for Quality and Finance awarded Enel Energia its 'Nr. 1 in Service' quality seal based on customer satisfaction in the electricity and gas sector, with a score of 74.2%, well above the category average of 55.9%.\n\nThe new Enel Global Service Function, which groups together Global Information & Communication Technologies,  Global  Procurement,  Global  Customer  Operations and the newly established Workforce Evolution, continued the Group's digital transformation path, focusing on solutions  and  advanced  technologies,  such  as  a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence and quantum computing solutions. Thanks in pa/r\\_t.liga to the key skills we have developed internally, to date we have over 500 traditional and generative a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence applications in operation or in the development phase, mainly to suppo/r\\_t.liga the Generation, Distribution and Retail businesses. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the Workforce Evolution unit will promote the evolution of employee skills consistent with these new technological tools and with the strategic repositioning of the Group, in order to foster greater internal control over higher value activities and guarantee our distinctive positioning in the markets and sectors in which the Group is present.\n\nThe Group continues to follow the decarbonization roadmap in line with limiting global warming to below 1.5 \u00baC. In 2023, absolute direct and indirect greenhouse gas emis-\n\nions along the Group's entire value chain, equal to 94.3 MtCO2eq, declined by 26.3% compared with 2022, and remain in line with the targets for 2030 and 2040 ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\nThe /fi.liganancial instruments employed by the Group are also closely  linked  to  sustainability  objectives.  In  2023,  Enel Finance International NV issued euro-denominated sustainability-linked bonds in the amount of \u20ac1.5 billion, using multiple key pe/r\\_f.ligaormance indicators (KPIs) to fu/r\\_t.ligaher strengthen Enel's commitment in accelerating the energy transition. For the /fi.ligarst time, in fact, a tranche of a publicly placed bond involved the combination of a KPI linked to the EU taxonomy with a KPI linked to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while the other tranche of the bond was linked to two KPIs associated with the Group's full decarbonization trajectory through the reduction of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThese bond issues have enabled us to achieve a ratio between  the  sources  of  sustainable  /fi.liganancing  and  the Group's total gross debt of approximately 64%, a level that will rise fu/r\\_t.ligaher over the period of the Plan.\n\nIn parallel, in order to reduce debt and strengthen the Group's /fi.liganancial structure, our new management team has revised the divestment plan referred to earlier with a view to po/r\\_t.ligafolio rotation focused on maximizing the value of assets. In this context, the Argentine thermal generation companies Enel Generaci\u00f3n Costanera SA and Inversora Dock Sud SA were sold during the year, and agreements were signed for the disposal of the Peruvian electricity distribution and supply company Enel Distribuci\u00f3n Per\u00fa SAA, the advanced energy services company Enel X Per\u00fa SAC and the electricity generator Enel Generaci\u00f3n Per\u00fa SAA. The divestment of all the investments held by the Group in Romania was also completed. Asset rotation transactions were also completed, including the sale of a po/r\\_t.ligafolio of photovoltaic plants in Chile (416 MW) and the entire geothermal po/r\\_t.ligafolio in the United States, as well as several small solar plants in that country. Finally, in line with the strategy presented to investors on our stewardship approach in non-core countries, acting through the subsidiary Enel Green Power SpA we completed the sale of 50% of the two companies that own all of the Group's renewables operations in Australia to INPEX Corporation, while the sale of 50% of Enel Green Power Hellas to Macquarie Asset Management was /fi.liganalized.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Strategy and forecasts for 2024-2026\n\nSho/r\\_t.liga-term  global  unce/r\\_t.ligaainties  have  forced  electricity companies to increase their /fl.ligaexibility and improve the visibility and predictability of prospective returns.\n\nIn this context, over the 2024-2026 Plan period the Enel Group plans to focus on:\n\n- \u00b7 pro/fi.ligatability, /fl.ligaexibility and resilience through selective capital allocation aimed at optimizing the Group's risk/ return pro/fi.ligale;\n- \u00b7 e/ffi.ligaciency and e/ff.ligaectiveness as drivers of the Group's operations, based on process simpli/fi.ligacation, a leaner organization with de/fi.liganed responsibilities and a focus on core geographies in which the Group has an integrated position (Italy, Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and the United States), as well as boosting operational e/ffi.ligaciency in order to maximize cash generation and o/ff.ligaset in/fl.ligaationary pressures and the higher cost of capital;\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial and environmental sustainability to pursue value creation with a balance and solid /fi.liganancial structure, addressing the challenges of climate change.\n\nIn this scenario, regulated businesses will be at the center of the Group's strategy, with a concentration of investment in geographical areas with a clear and predictable regulatory framework as well as stable macroeconomic environments.  Investment  decisions  on  renewables  will be more selective, seeking to achieve a positioning that maximizes returns and mitigates risks at the same time. Finally, the Group plans to optimize its customer po/r\\_t.ligafolio and end-to-end processes, enhancing e/ffi.ligaciency in customer acquisition and management, improving customer loyalty through bundled o/ff.ligaers and promoting the electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption. The generation and retail businesses will be managed in a more integrated manner, with a /fl.ligaexible approach to sourcing strategies in order to maximize pro/fi.ligatability along the entire value chain.\n\nIn the 2024-2026 period, the Group's gross investments will amount to \u20ac35.8 billion, of which \u20ac18.6 billion will be allocated to Grids, \u20ac12.1 billion to Renewables and \u20ac3 billion to Customers.\n\nThanks  to  the  implementation  of  a  less  capital-  and risk-intensive  business  model,  investments  will  have  a smaller cash requirement, with expected net investments of about \u20ac26.2 billion thanks to access to European grants and /fi.liganancing (up to \u20ac3.5 billion) and the use of a diversi/fi.ligaed co-investment model for renewables projects (a total of about \u20ac6.1 billion).\n\nInvestments  in  distribution  grids  will  increase  their  ef/fi.ligaciency, /fl.ligaexibility and resilience: more than half will be\n\nallocated to grid strengthening, remote operation, automation and digitalization projects in order to deliver high standards of service quality and reduce power losses. In addition to managing assets, the remainder will be allocated to expanding hosting capacity (3) to meet customer demand for new connections and encourage the integration of distributed generation from renewable resources, all to suppo/r\\_t.liga the energy transition and the electri/fi.ligacation of /fi.liganal energy consumption.\n\nInvestments in renewables will add 13.4 GW of new capacity, bringing the Group's total to 73 GW (including energy storage systems) by 2026, with the share of zero-emissions generation growing from 75% to about 86%.\n\nThe push for innovation will continue to be a strategic driver:  in  generation,  it  will  improve  plant  pe/r\\_f.ligaormance through the introduction of new technologies along the entire value chain. The use of repowering (4) and automation is also expected to increase the e/ffi.ligaciency of plants and processes, as will testing of new ba/t\\_t.ligaery technologies and energy storage systems, whose role will be increasingly impo/r\\_t.ligaant in ensuring the /fl.ligaexibility of electrical systems. In grids, digitalization, new automation models and the introduction of new technologies will enable new approaches to remuneration.\n\nFinally, the Group will continue to pursue the evolution of new technologies that will mature over the medium and long term, such as hydrogen and new small and modular nuclear /fi.ligassion reactors or fusion power.\n\nOn the environmental sustainability front, the Group intends to continue reducing its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions by achieving the zero-emissions target for all Scopes by 2040, in line with the Paris Agreement and with the 1.5 \u00baC scenario, as ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed by the SBTi.\n\nGroup ordinary EBITDA is expected to increase to between \u20ac23.6 and 24.3 billion in 2026, with a CAGR (Compound Average Growth Rate) of approximately 5%, while our ambition for Group ordinary pro/fi.ligat is a rise to between \u20ac7.1 and 7.3 billion in 2026, with a CAGR of about 6% compared with 2023, net of di/ff.ligaerences in scope.\n\nThe organic and structural path of reducing the Group's net debt will enable us to achieve a ratio of net debt to EBITDA of about 2.3 by 2026, down from over 3 at the end of 2022.\n\nFinally, as regards shareholder remuneration, the Group has decided to adopt a simple and a/t\\_t.ligaractive dividend policy with a minimum /fi.ligaxed DPS (dividend per share) of \u20ac0.43 for the 2024-2026 period, with a potential increase up to a payout of 70% of ordinary pro/fi.ligat if cash neutrality is achieved.",

In addition to the concept of materiality, the qualitative and quantitative /fi.liganancial and sustainability information repo/r\\_t.ligaed in the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations have been prepared and presented in such a way as to ensure their completeness, accuracy, neutrality and comprehensibility.\n\nThe information contained in the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations is also consistent with the previous year.\n\nAccordingly, the Group applies the same methodologies from year to year, unless otherwise speci/fi.ligaed, in compliance with international best practices for integrated repo/r\\_t.ligaing and sustainability repo/r\\_t.ligaing.\n\nFor the purposes of preparing sustainability information, especially quantitative information, the Group mainly applies the provisions of the Global Repo/r\\_t.ligaing Initiative (GRI) standards, in line with the Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.liga, and the 'Aspects' of the GRI supplement dedicated to the Electric Utilities sector ('Electric Utilities Sector Disclosures'). Consideration was also given to the indicators proposed in the white paper 'Toward Common Metrics and Consistent Repo/r\\_t.ligaing of Sustainable Value Creation' of the World Economic Forum (WEF), the details of which are highlighted in the section on the WEF and in the 'Group Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance' chapter of this repo/r\\_t.liga.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also underscores the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities of the business model within the current energy transition scenario\n\nrecommendations emphasize that climate-related risk must be considered in management's assumptions used in the exercise of its judgment in measuring items in the /fi.liganancial statements.\n\nIn order to ensure the connectivity of information and to communicate the way in which the progress achieved in sustainability contributes to enhancing current and future /fi.liganancial pe/r\\_f.ligaormance, clear and consistent relationships between key /fi.liganancial and sustainability information have been identi/fi.ligaed and presented in the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations for each of the four sections indicated above.\n\nIn addition, Enel's Integrated Annual Repo/r\\_t.liga has been published in the 'Investors' section of the Enel website (www. enel.com).",

        "page_content": "## Business model\n\nEnel's business model is conceived to maximize long-term value creation for all stakeholders through the achievement of Group growth, development and e/ffi.ligaciency objectives while at the same time minimizing business risks.\n\nThe Enel business model is structured along the entire value chain through global business lines for generation (Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation), commodity po/r\\_t.ligafolio management (Global Energy and Commodity Management),  distribution  (Enel  Grids  and  Innovability) and customer sales (Enel X Global Retail), suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by the Global Service Function and Sta/ff.liga Functions.\n\nThe current mission of each global business line can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Enel  Green  Power  and  Thermal  Generation  is  engaged in the generation of electricity from renewables (through Enel Green Power) and conventional sources, seeking to accelerate the energy transition and managing the path of decarbonization;\n- \u00b7 Global Energy and Commodity Management operates in wholesale physical and /fi.liganancial markets for energy commodities (electricity, gas, emissions, oil and many others) and manages the Group's integrated po/r\\_t.ligafolio through hedging with complex products in order to mitigate the risks of international commodity trading;\n- \u00b7 Enel Grids and Innovability is a world leader in electricity distribution, ensures the supply of electricity through increasingly e/ffi.ligacient grids that are ever more resilient and secure against extreme and adverse events and more /fl.ligaexible thanks to enabling new business models for DSOs (distribution system operators).\n- In line with these objectives, Enel Grids' innovation e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga has focused on resilience, operational excellence and security, seeking advanced solutions that can guarantee and improve an increasingly safe environment for workers and generate a positive and sustainable impact on the business;\n- \u00b7 Enel X Global Retail operates in the supply of electricity, energy management services and public and private electric mobility, with a po/r\\_t.ligafolio of value-added products and services to encourage more independent and sustainable use of energy.\n- Enel X Global Retail o/ff.ligaers innovative solutions to improve people's lives, focusing on residential consumers,\n\ncompanies and government entities with modular and integrated o/ff.ligaers built around customer needs, promoting the digitalization and electri/fi.ligacation of energy use and transpo/r\\_t.liga as drivers to create new value.\n\nBy exploiting the synergies between the di/ff.ligaerent business areas and implementing actions through the lever of innovation, the Enel Group seeks to develop solutions to drive sustainable progress, reduce environmental impact, meet the needs of customers and the local communities in which it operates and ensure high safety standards for employees and suppliers.\n\nIn order to fully bene/fi.ligat from all the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities emerging in the market environment in which it operates, the Group has identi/fi.ligaed three di/ff.ligaerent business models (Ownership, Pa/r\\_t.liganership and Stewardship) it can deploy depending on the geographical area and expected return:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Ownership  business  model,  in  which  the  Group makes  direct  investments  in  renewables,  grids  and customers, bene/fi.liga/t\\_t.ligaing from the /fi.liganancial pe/r\\_f.ligaormance generated by the continuous use of the assets involved. This model is mainly employed in countries where the entire value chain can already be leveraged, from generation to relationships with end users, especially where expected returns are the highest;\n- \u00b7 the Pa/r\\_t.liganership business model, in which the Group makes investments with a pa/r\\_t.liganer in order to lower its exposure to the risks associated with the assets involved, while maintaining control and maximizing the productivity and /fl.ligaexibility of the capital employed;\n- \u00b7 the Stewardship business model, in which the Group invests in existing or new joint ventures and acquires or maintains minority stakes, bene/fi.liga/t\\_t.ligaing from the development of the assets. This model will fu/r\\_t.ligaher enhance /fi.liganancial /fl.ligaexibility while signi/fi.ligacantly reducing the risk exposure  of  capital,  increasing  returns.  Three  geographical areas (Italy, Iberia and Rest of the World) are incorporated into this approach, each of which operates in its area in a matrix relationship with the broader and more global business lines, managing activities such as relations with local communities, regulation and local communication, while ensuring the integration of the business lines present in the country involved.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Various induction initiatives were therefore held during 2023, focusing on the corporate governance system of the Company and the Group, the electrical system and power generation, as well as closer analyses of ce/r\\_t.ligaain business lines and the People and Organization Sta/ff.liga Function.\n- \u00b7 At the end of 2023 and during the /fi.ligarst two months of 2024, the Board of Directors carried out, with the assistance of a specialized independent advisor, an assessment of the size, composition and functioning of the Board and its commi/t\\_t.ligaees (the 'board review'), in line with the most advanced corporate governance practices accepted at the international level and incorporated within the Corporate Governance Code. The board review was also carried out using a 'peer review' approach, i.e. evaluating not only the operation of the body as a whole, but also the style and substance of the contribution made by each of its members, and it was extended to include the Board of Statutory Auditors. Among other issues, the board review also speci/fi.ligacally sought to verify the directors' perception of (i) the e/ff.ligaectiveness of induction activities and (ii) the Board's involvement with sustainability issues and their integration into corporate strategy, including climate change issues. The /fi.ligandings of the board review are repo/r\\_t.ligaed in Enel's Repo/r\\_t.liga on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure.\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors have approved, each within their own sphere of competence, speci/fi.ligac diversity policies that set out the characteristics considered optimal for the members of these bodies, so that each can exercise their duties most e/ff.ligaectively, taking decisions that can e/ff.ligaectively draw on the contribution of a plurality of quali/fi.ligaed points of view, able to examine the issues under discussion from di/ff.ligaerent perspectives. The policy approved by the Board of Directors establishes that with regard to the types of diversity and the associated objectives:\n- -the optimal composition of Board members should provide for a majority of independent directors;\n- -even when the regulatory provisions on gender balance expire, it is impo/r\\_t.ligaant to continue to ensure that at least one-third of the Board of Directors, both at the time of appointment and during its term of o/ffi.ligace, shall be made up of directors of the least represented gender;\n- -the international scope of the Group's activities should be taken into consideration, ensuring that at least one-third of directors should have adequate experience in the international arena, which is also considered useful for preventing the standardization of opinions and the emergence of 'group thought';\n- -in order to achieve a balance between the need for continuity and renewal in management, it would be necessary to ensure a balanced combination of people of di/ff.ligaering seniority - and age - within the Board of Directors;\n- -non-executive directors should have a management and/or professional and/or academic and/ or institutional background such as to create a diverse and complementary set of skills and experience;\n- -in view of the di/ff.ligaerences in their roles, the Chairman and the CEO should have the appropriate skills (speci/fi.ligacally indicated in the policy) for the e/ff.ligaective pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of their respective duties.",

Among other issues, these recommendations concern the composition of the management body, with regard to which it is also suggested to integrate a diversity of professional and management experience and skills, combined, where possible, with a diversity of gender, age and seniority, without prejudice to the provisions of applicable local legislation.\n- \u00b7 In order to regulate the procedures for the Company's engagement with institutional investors and with its shareholders and bondholders as a whole, in March 2021 the Board of Directors adopted, acting on a proposal from the Chairman formulated in agreement with the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer, a speci/fi.ligac policy in this area (the 'Engagement Policy'). It largely incorporates the practices already followed by Enel to ensure that this dialogue is based on principles of fairness and transparency and takes place in compliance with EU and national regulations concerning market abuse, as well as in line with international best practices. In drawing up the Engagement Policy, which was consistently applied during 2023, the best practices adopted in this /fi.ligaeld by institutional investors and re/fl.ligaected in 'Stewardship' codes were taken into account.\n\nFor more detailed information on the corporate governance system, please see the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure of Enel, which has been\n\npublished  on  the  Company's  website  (h/t\\_t.ligap://www.enel. com, in the 'Governance' section).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The system is based on speci/fi.ligac compliance programs, in-\n\ncluding: the Code of Ethics, the Compliance Model under Legislative Decree 231/2001, the Enel Global Compliance Program,  the  'Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption'  Plan,  the Human Rights Policy, and any other national compliance models adopted by Group companies in accordance with local laws and regulations.\n\n## Code of Ethics\n\nIn 2002, Enel adopted a Code of Ethics, (11) which expresses the Company's ethical responsibilities and commitments in conducting its a/ff.ligaairs and operations, governing and standardizing corporate conduct on the basis of standards aimed to ensure the maximum transparency and fairness with all stakeholders. The Code of Ethics is valid for the whole Group, taking due account of the cultural, social and economic diversity of the various countries in which Enel operates. Enel also requires that all suppliers\n\nand pa/r\\_t.liganers adopt conduct that is in line with the general principles set out in the Code.

Enel's business model is based on the generation of sustainable value, together with its internal and external stakeholders, on continuous innovation, the pursuit of excellence and respect for human rights throughout the value chain. This translates into the rejection of practices such as modern slavery, forced labor and human tra/ffi.ligacking, and the promotion of diversity, inclusion, equal oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity and ensuring that people are treated with dignity and valued for their uniqueness, whether they work within the Company or elsewhere along the value chain in which the Group operates. The main international standards inspiring Enel's commitment are the\n\nUnited  Nations  framework  'Protect,  Respect,  Remedy', outlined in the guiding principles on business and human rights, and the guidelines for multinational companies of the OECD. This commitment is clearly re/fl.ligaected in the human rights policy drawn up and adopted back in 2013. In 2021, this document was updated to take account of the evolution of international reference frameworks and the operational, organizational and management processes of the Group. The document strengthens and expands the commitments already present in other codes of conduct adopted by Enel such as the Code of Ethics, the 'Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption' Plan and global compliance models.

It enables us to identify oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities for improvement and develop speci/fi.ligac action plans. Thanks to this process, 100% of policies and operational procedures adopted are evaluated to identify any direct or indirect risks in the management of our operations, covering the entire value chain and the establishment of new business relationships (for example, acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, etc.). A new cycle of the process was begun in 2023.\n\nWith regard to the sustainability of the supply chain, Enel's purchasing processes are based on fairness, transparency and collaboration, and for this reason the Group's suppliers are required not only to guarantee the necessary quality standards but also to commit to adopting best practices for human rights and the impact of their activity on the environment. These include those concerning working conditions, health and safety, appropriate working hours, rejection of forced or child labor, respect for personal dignity, non-discrimination and the inclusion of diversity, freedom of association and collective bargaining and respect for privacy by design and by default. All of this is delineated by a clear framework of codes of conduct, including, in addition to the Human Rights Policy, the Code of Ethics, the 'Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption' Plan and global compliance programs. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, speci/fi.ligac clauses are included in all contracts for works, services and supplies, updated periodically to take account of the regulatory developments and ensure alignment with international best practices.

        "page_content": "## REFERENCE SCENARIO\n\n## The geopolitical environment\n\nGlobal economic developments can have a signi/fi.ligacant impact on the Group's operations due to their direct e/ff.ligaects on GDP growth rates, in/fl.ligaation rates and exchange rates in the countries in which Enel operates. In recent years, the stability of the euro area has been shaken by a number of adverse events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the more recent military con/fl.ligaict between Russia and Ukraine. Since the euro-area economies are among the most exposed to the war due to their geographical proximity to the con/fl.ligaict area and their strong dependence on gas impo/r\\_t.ligas from Russia, they have been severely impacted both in terms of slower GDP growth and higher in/fl.ligaation. The la/t\\_t.ligaer was initially triggered by the exponential increase in energy and commodity prices. Subsequently, the repercussions of the increase in the cost of /fi.ligarm's production factors on the prices of non-energy industrial goods fueled a persistent in/fl.ligaationary environment, one that still represents a risk factor requiring careful monitoring. The increase  in  in/fl.ligaation  has  eroded  household  purchasing power and has weighed on industrial production, pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly in more energy-intensive sectors. The easing of in/fl.ligaationary pressures in the second half of the year in the euro area - similarly to developments in the United States - prompted the European Central Bank to interrupt its series of interest rate increases after September. The greater persistence of core in/fl.ligaation (which excludes the most volatile goods) compared with general in/fl.ligaation, however, represents a source of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty concerning the future path of monetary policy, which if kept restrictive for a longer period time could impact economic activity and monetary policy in the euro area.\n\nThe year 2024 will again be marked by geopolitical developments on a global scale. The continuation of the con/fl.ligaict between Russia and Ukraine, the more recent tensions that have emerged in the Middle East, the elections scheduled for 2024 in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, India, Taiwan, Iran and many other countries, could all have a signi/fi.ligacant impact on the domestic and foreign policies of major global players.\n\nOn the budgetary policy front, in December 2023 the /fi.liganance ministers of the European Union reached an agreement for the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. The\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnew /fi.ligascal rules are characterized by greater simplicity and an emphasis on more readily observable variables, with the aim of improving the e/ff.ligaectiveness and credibility of the rules.\n\nOn the international trade front, systems of sanctions also remain in place, which can in/fl.ligauence trade agreements between countries and industrial policies in various regions. Any introduction of new customs duties or expo/r\\_t.liga restrictions could fu/r\\_t.ligaher aggravate current macroeconomic conditions and make the geopolitical situation even more unce/r\\_t.ligaain.\n\nThe main risks a/ff.ligaecting energy commodities lie in the fragility of the natural gas market in Europe. Although commodity prices have fallen well below the highs recorded in 2022, market equilibria are very tenuous, and disruptions along the value chain, such as the loss of a supply route via the Suez Canal, could drive prices up. This would also have a sharp impact on coal and electricity prices, as these variables are strongly correlated with developments in gas prices. These considerations also hold for the oil market, whose /fl.ligaows also pass through countries close to the con/fl.ligaict areas and are strongly in/fl.ligauenced by relations between the United States and the Middle East.\n\nThe  current  geopolitical  and  macroeconomic  context, both in the West and in China, will also continue to in/fl.ligauence demand in the industrial metals sector, which was a/ff.ligaected last year by the slowdown in global economic growth and prolonged political and military tensions. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, in China - the global leader in metals markets - the recovery in demand in 2023 was weaker than analysts and expe/r\\_t.ligas had forecast, and future developments continue to depend heavily on the impact of government stimuli, which have not been as e/ff.ligaective as expected so far, and on the recovery of demand in Western countries. As regards the metals most closely involved in renewable energy technologies, such as lithium and polysilicon, the recent environment of rapidly and sharply falling prices, undermined by disappointing demand for 'green' solutions and a very large increase in the supply of both materials, is eroding the margins of producers, who are struggling to sustain investment in near-term price scenario that does not o/ff.ligaer much room for growth.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Macroeconomic environment\n\nThe  global  macroeconomic  environment  in  2023  was characterized by a general slowdown in the real economy, continuing a downward trend that had already begun in the previous year. After a slowdown in global GDP growth to 3.1% on an annual basis in 2022, following the excellent pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of 6.4% growth recorded in 2021, real growth is expected to be even slower in 2023, at 3%. This decline re/fl.ligaects the lagged and continuing e/ff.ligaects of the restrictive monetary policy stances adopted by central banks to counteract high in/fl.ligaationary pressures, the loss of consumer purchasing power, the deterioration in /fi.liganancial and credit conditions, and the decline in trade and investment at a global level. Additionally, the protracted military con/fl.ligaict between Russia and Ukraine, the more recent con/fl.ligaict in the Middle East, volatile US-China relations and the resulting global unce/r\\_t.ligaainty have continued to adversely impact energy, commodity and food markets, slowing the normalization of in/fl.ligaationary pressures on a global scale. In the United States, the economy pe/r\\_f.ligaormed well above market expectations in the 4th Qua/r\\_t.ligaer, with GDP expanding by 3.1% on an annual basis, compared with 2.9% in the\n\n4th Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2022.\n\nPrivate consumption spending began to realign with real incomes during the year, as excess savings accumulated during the pandemic continued to decline, especially among low-income households. However, a general easing in the in/fl.ligaationary pressures created by the surge in energy commodity prices in the previous year, a very resilient labor market and strong domestic demand buoyed GDP, which is expected to have grown by 2.5% on an annual basis, up from 1.9% the previous year.\n\nIn the euro area, macroeconomic conditions experienced a period of stagnation, dragged down by the restrictive monetary policy stance, the impact of high in/fl.ligaation on consumers' real incomes, weak external demand and industrial weakness. The real economy is expected to have entered a technical recession in the 4th Qua/r\\_t.ligaer, with a contraction of 0.1% on a qua/r\\_t.ligaerly basis in the last three months of the year con/fi.ligarming that already recorded in the previous period. With regard to in/fl.ligaationary pressures, /fi.liganal consumer good prices began to slow in the last qua/r\\_t.ligaer of the year thanks to the restrictive monetary policy stance implemented by the European Central Bank, weak domestic demand and falling energy prices, with in/fl.ligaation at 5.5% year-on-year, down from a peak of 8.4% in 2022.\n\nIn Italy, economic activity displayed clear signs of /fl.ligaagging, with GDP expected to grow by 0.7% on an annual basis after the strong rise of 3.9% recorded the previous year. Private consumption has been hit by high in/fl.ligaation, while tighter /fi.liganancial conditions have dragged down investment. Subdued external demand also a/ff.ligaected expo/r\\_t.ligas. By contrast, consumer prices recorded positive signs, with in/fl.ligaation falling sharply in the last qua/r\\_t.ligaer thanks to signi/fi.liga-\n\ncant base e/ff.ligaects resulting from the moderation of energy prices.\n\nIn Spain, the economy pe/r\\_f.ligaormed be/t\\_t.ligaer than the European average thanks to a strong contribution from services, with GDP expected to grow by 2.4%. After a substantial decline in in/fl.ligaationary pressures in the /fi.ligarst half of the year driven by the normalization of energy prices, the second half of the year was characterized by rebound, with average annual in/fl.ligaation standing at 3.4% in 2023, compared with 8.3% in 2022.\n\nIn Latin America, in/fl.ligaation slowed in 2023, although the decline di/ff.ligaered depending on the country. In Brazil, the economy registered faster-than-expected GDP growth in 2023, expanding by an estimated 2.9% on an annual basis. In the /fi.ligarst half of the year, growth was driven by the extraordinary pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of the agricultural sector and by robust domestic demand driven by private consumption. The economy was resilient in the second half, sustained by an increase in expo/r\\_t.ligas and modest growth in household consumption, which bene/fi.ligated from more moderate in/fl.ligaation and an improvement in the labor market. In/fl.ligaation decelerated sharply compared with 2022 (the annual in/fl.ligaation rate came to 4.6% in 2023), re/fl.ligaecting a restrictive monetary policy stance and a decline in energy and service prices.\n\nIn Chile, zero growth is expected for GDP in 2023, after the 2.5% growth recorded in 2022. In the /fi.ligarst half of the year, the tightening of /fi.liganancial conditions due to the restrictive policy stance adopted by the central bank and the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty connected with the constitutional reform process slowed economic activity. In the second half, however, growth was buoyed by the weakness of global demand and rapid disin/fl.ligaation (the annual in/fl.ligaation rate was 7.7% in 2023, compared with 11.6% in 2022), which prompted the Chilean central bank to cut interest rates by 300 basis points.\n\nIn Colombia, economic activity slowed sharply in 2023 compared with the previous year, with GDP growing by an estimated 1.0% on an annual basis, a sharp decline from the 7.3% registered in 2022. Persistent in/fl.ligaation, combined with high interest rates for a prolonged period, adversely impacted demand, accompanied by a slowdown in investment and a decline in expo/r\\_t.ligas. In/fl.ligaation slipped below 10% only in December, posting an annual average of 11.8%. The slow process of disin/fl.ligaation enabled the central bank to reduce interest rates by only 25 basis points at the end of the year.\n\nPeru saw the economy contract by an estimated 0.5% in 2023, after posting growth of 2.7% in 2022. Political and social  instability,  greater-than-expected  climate  anomalies associated with El Ni\u00f1o and high food prices due to lower agricultural production generated an especially sharp contraction in economic activity in the /fi.ligarst half of",

GDP  contracted  by\n\nan estimated 1.2% on an annual basis, while in/fl.ligaation rose to 127.9%.

On average, the TTF benchmark price decreased by more than 65% compared with the previous year, due to the easing of the supply risks that emerged in 2022, the year in which gas /fl.ligaows ceased from Russia, the main supplier to the European market.\n\nHowever, the gas market remained highly volatile and very sensitive to the upward shocks recorded during the year, re/fl.ligaecting the fragility of the balance between supply and demand, although prices never touched the levels reached in 2022. Price volatility was moderated by the achievement of a high percentage of /fi.ligalled storage (above 90%) before the sta/r\\_t.liga of the winter season, which combined with mild temperatures in November and December led to a sharp reduction in gas prices in Europe in the /fi.liganal months of 2023, falling below \u20ac35/MWh.\n\nThe developments in gas prices, together with high levels of storage, in turn drove a decrease in coal prices, which in 2023 averaged $129/ton (-55.5% on the previous year). The dynamics of the gas market have also made coal-/fi.ligared generation less a/t\\_t.ligaractive, discouraging its consumption and encouraging accumulation of the commodity.\n\nIn the /fi.ligarst half of 2023, oil prices declined in response to the normalization of supply and expectations of a weak recovery in demand. During the second half, however, prices jumped considerably, reaching a peak in September, re/fl.ligaecting the impact of additional cuts in supply combined with growing demand. In the last qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2023 the price trend reversed again, with Brent prices falling below $75 a barrel. In 2023, the European benchmark price averaged $82 a barrel, 17% lower than the previous year.\n\n|                   |          | 2023   | 2022   | Change   |\n|-------------------|----------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Brent             | $/barrel | 82     | 99     | -17. 2 % |\n| API2              | $/ton    | 129    | 290    | -55.5%   |\n| TTF               | \u20ac/MWh    | 41     | 120    | -65.8%   |\n| CO 2              | \u20ac/ton    | 84     | 81     | 3.7%     |\n| Copper            | $/ton    | 8,495  | 8,831  | -3.8%    |\n| Aluminum          | $/ton    | 2,256  | 2,706  | -16.6%   |\n| Lithium carbonate | $/ton    | 36,762 | 71,640 | -48.7%   |\n| Polysilicon       | $/ton    | 16,441 | 35,589 | -53.8%   |",

Less marked but still signi/fi.ligacant was the decrease recorded in industry (-3.4%).\n\n## Competitive and transition environment\n\nAssessing the evolution of the energy transition process is a fundamental input in the de/fi.liganition of Enel's strategy. This assessment is pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly critical in the current environment, characterized, as discussed in earlier sections, by growing geopolitical tensions, high interest and in/fl.ligaation rates and supply chain di/ffi.ligaculties. At the same time, the objectives of the Paris Agreement require an acceleration of the energy transition, in order to limit the increase in average global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C compared with pre-industrial levels. The recent COP 28 on climate change held in Dubai established the objective of gradually transitioning away from fossil fuels by 2050 and tripling renewables capacity by 2030 (11 TW vs 3.6 TW in 2022), in line with the International Energy Agency (IEA) Net Zero (12) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) 1.5 (13) scenarios.\n\nThe transition is shifting gears at the global level, as demonstrated in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular by the increase in renewables capacity, which saw over 500 GW of capacity installed in 2023 alone. (14) According to the IEA, the decline in all fossil fuels will begin within this decade under current policy scenarios. (15) Nonetheless, a broad gap persists between today's ambitions and holding the temperature increase to below 1.5 \u00b0C, as well as local di/ff.ligaerences in the pace of progress towards the goals that each country has set itself. This gap is largely connected with the need to introduce measures to implement the long-term objectives, with a view to increasing both the development of renewables and the rate of electri/fi.ligacation of consumption in the sho/r\\_t.liga term. More\n\nspeci/fi.ligacally, in the IEA's announced pledges scenario (APS), capacity reaches a total of almost 10 TW, and is therefore still not consistent with the latest agreements.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, while on the one hand we are witnessing a convergence of calls for energy security, accessibility and sustainability, which is guiding everyone - political decision-makers, citizens and companies - towards an acceleration of the clean electri/fi.ligacation process, in reality the energy transition is proceeding along a path of disorderly policies ('disorderly transition ' (16) ) compared with expectations. In some geographical areas, the speed of the transition is not as rapid as expected, as measured by sales of electric cars and heat pumps - the main drivers of the increase in electricity demand. Although they are expanding steadily, they do not yet have a signi/fi.ligacant impact on global energy consumption.\n\nIn a year characterized by high interest rates, in/fl.ligaation and supply chain di/ffi.ligaculties, the utilities sector, and integrated utilities in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, has demonstrated resilience to external developments, thanks in pa/r\\_t.liga to the normalization of commodity prices, as well as the balance achieved between industry, with investments to expand renewable generation capacity and strengthen grid infrastructure, which lower risk. This positioning rea/ffi.ligarms the crucial role of utilities in the context of the transition and manifests the commitment to energy security.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "With the evolution of markets, the electricity generation and sales sector, together with related services and products, is experiencing an increase in competition, often a re/fl.ligaection of the strategic repositioning of companies in related sectors. Although this is producing a potentially more challeng-\n\ning competitive environment due to the presence of multiple operators, it also opens the way to new business oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, the identi/fi.ligacation of new areas of value, the creation of synergies and the development of potential pa/r\\_t.liganerships.\n\n## Climate change and long-term scenarios\n\nEnel promotes transparency in its climate-change impact disclosures and works to demonstrate to its stakeholders that it is tackling climate change with diligence and determination, consistent with the guidelines and requirements set out in the most recent disclosure standards. The Group was one of the /fi.ligarst utilities to take on board the 'Guidelines on repo/r\\_t.ligaing climate-related information' published by the European Commission in June 2019, which, together with sustainability repo/r\\_t.ligaing standards such as the GRI Standards, represent a benchmark for the Group's repo/r\\_t.ligaing on climate change issues.\n\n## Scenario analysis and planning\n\nThe Group develops sho/r\\_t.liga-, medium- and long-term scenarios for macroeconomic, /fi.liganancial, energy and climate developments in order to suppo/r\\_t.liga planning, capital allocation, strategic positioning and the assessment of the risks and resilience of the strategy. Scenario-based planning involves de/fi.liganing alternative scenarios developed on the basis of a number of key unce/r\\_t.ligaainty variables, such as achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. The development of scenarios allows companies to explore and model plausible alternative futures, designing various paths forward with di/ff.ligaerent timing and options, and ultimately to suppo/r\\_t.liga strategic decision-making with a view to maximizing oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities and mitigating risks.\n\nTo suppo/r\\_t.liga analysis of scenarios and the evolution of the external context, the Group identi/fi.ligaes and analyzes sho/r\\_t.liga-, medium- and long-term trends to develop an overview of how the structural forces and macro-trends are in/fl.ligauencing the speed of the transition and of the expected impacts in the energy sector, especially in the businesses in which Enel operates. This mapping of trends provides a reference foundation for developing actions to orient the positioning of the business, seizing the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities o/ff.ligaered by the context.\n\n## Scenario benchmarking\n\nBenchmarking of external energy scenarios is a key sta/r\\_t.ligaing point in order to build robust internal scenarios. There are many global, regional and national energy transition scenarios published by various providers and designed for a wide range of purposes, from government planning and policy-\n\nmaking to the suppo/r\\_t.liga of enterprise decision-making processes. Benchmarking entails analyzing external transition scenarios in order to compare results in terms of the energy mixes, trends in emissions, and technology decisions and to identify the main drivers of the energy transition for each.\n\nEnel's benchmarking of external energy transition scenarios comprises the following steps.\n\n- 1.  Analysis of the context of global and national scenarios for the countries in which we operate. The analysis of scenarios, as well as the study of repo/r\\_t.ligas and datasets, is suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by constant dialogue with the analysts of the main scenario providers. Global energy scenarios are typically grouped by family based on the degree of climate ambition, as follows:\n- \u00b7 Stated-policies scenarios : based on current policies, or Business-as-usual ;\n- \u00b7 Paris-Aligned scenarios : these are aligned with the Paris Agreement, i.e. are compatible with the goal of limiting the increase in average global temperatures to 'well below 2 \u00b0C' above pre-industrial levels;\n- \u00b7 Paris-Ambitious/Net Zero scenarios : global energy scenarios that take a path towards net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, i.e. to keep the average increase in global temperatures to 1.5 \u00b0C, albeit with various probability intervals.\n- 2.  Data collection, data analysis and identi/fi.ligacation of scenario  and  energy  transition  drivers. The  data  regards all the main metrics of the energy system, including, for example: primary energy, total and sectoral /fi.liganal energy, electrical capacity by technology, electricity generation by  technology,  hydrogen  production,  electric  vehicle /fl.ligaeet, etc. The data analysis gives each provider an understanding of the key elements of the Business-as-usual/ Stated-policies scenarios and leads to the identi/fi.ligacation of the drivers for accelerating the energy transition in the Paris-Aligned and Paris-Ambitious scenarios.\n- 3.  Preparation of a summary of the data analysis and digital representation of the main metrics of external scenarios , to provide suppo/r\\_t.liga for management in the decision-making process for the Group's scenario framework. This activity is an integral pa/r\\_t.liga of internal planning processes.",

This corresponds to a ce/r\\_t.ligaain trend in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a climate scenario and, therefore, a ce/r\\_t.ligaain increase in temperature by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial levels. It should be noted that the resulting climate scenario is not deterministic with respect to carbon dioxide emissions. For each climate scenario, the IPCC also always provides both the median value for global warming in 2100 and the very likely range (i.e. the interval between the 5th and 95th percentiles).\n\nThe main assumptions considered in developing the Enel energy transition scenarios concern the macroeconomic and energy context, local policies and regulatory measures, the evolution, costs and adoption of energy production, conversion and consumption technologies.\n\nThe Reference scenario for planning is a Paris-Aligned scenario, calling for achievement of the objectives of the Paris Agreement, i.e. keeping the increase in the global average temperature below 2 \u00b0C compared with pre-industrial levels, with a level of climate ambition that is higher\n\nthan Business-as-usual , but without necessarily assuming the global achievement of the Net Zero 2050 target, given the current global level of cumulative ambition and the deceleration of the energy transition caused by the impact on ce/r\\_t.ligaain transition variables of current macroeconomic and energy conditions at the local level.\n\nIn order to assess the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities inherent in the energy transition, alternative scenarios to the reference framework have been de/fi.liganed on the basis of the degree of climate ambition assumed at the global and local level. These comprise: a Slower Transition scenario, characterized by an energy transition in which the near-term slowdown in the transition in ce/r\\_t.ligaain areas has a greater overall impact in the medium term, and an Accelerated Transition scenario, with greater ambition compared with the Reference scenario, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular as regards ce/r\\_t.ligaain variables.\n\nThe assumptions for trends in commodities prices underlying the Reference scenario are consistent with the external scenarios that achieve the objectives of the Paris  Agreement.  More  speci/fi.ligacally,  we  assume  sustained growth in the price of CO 2 through 2030, caused by a gradual reduction in the supply of allowances as demand\n\n<!-- image -->",

The values of the scenario variables of relevance to the activities of the Group were then calculated using those models with a view to minimizing costs for the system, imposing a constraint on long-term CO 2 emissions consistent with the achievement of the Paris Agreement objectives and interim constraints dictated by policies in existence or being adopted in each country, taking due account of sho/r\\_t.liga-term market dynamics and the di/ff.ligausion of technologies pa/r\\_t.ligaicular to each of those countries;\n- \u00b7 for the rest of the countries involved, the main scenario variables were determined by applying statistical analysis to internal and consensus data in relation to external scenarios aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement as provided by national and international accredited bodies.\n\nThe de/fi.liganition of internal transition scenarios was prompted by the need for greater modeling /fl.ligaexibility and greater geographical and operational granularity for the main variables that impact Enel's di/ff.ligaerent businesses compared with the scenarios that the main external providers can provide. The la/t\\_t.ligaer are typically produced and published at a global or regional level, with some exceptions for pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly large countries, which only rarely correspond to the countries in which the Group is present or has an interest.\n\n## Italy\n\nFor Italy, the Reference scenario takes account of the recent developments in European climate and energy legislation. The results at 2030 are therefore comparable with those contained in the draft National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (NIECP), published in June 2023, with ce/r\\_t.ligaain elements added to ensure greater /fi.ligat with current market dynamics. The Slower Transition scenario has been constructed assuming a slower energy transition, with less rapid development of renewables capacity, electric mobility and green hydrogen production. The Accelerated Tran-\n\nence Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Enel has set a goal for 2040 to achieve zero direct emissions (Scope 1), with totally renewable electricity generation and zero emissions connected with retail energy sales (Scope 3).\n\nsition scenario assumes a quicker reform of authorization processes and suppo/r\\_t.liga mechanisms for renewable energy plants, which accelerates installation, and lower costs for green hydrogen production technologies.\n\n## Spain\n\nFor Spain, the Reference scenario also envisages a level of climate ambition and objectives for renewables and energy e/ffi.ligaciency that take account of recent developments in European climate and energy legislation and is therefore comparable with the draft NIECP published in June 2023. The scenario envisages rapid growth in renewables, pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly solar, in the next few years. It di/ff.ligaers from the NIECP draft at 2030 in its assumption of slower development of green hydrogen.\n\nThe alternative Slower Transition scenario assumes a lag in  the  penetration  of  renewables,  green  hydrogen  and electric technologies, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular with regard to private automobiles  and  the  electri/fi.ligacation  of  domestic  consumption. The Accelerated Transition scenario envisages a more rapid implementation of authorization procedures for renewables, increasing annual installation levels, and a development of green hydrogen consistent with the draft NIECP, as well as a fu/r\\_t.ligaher e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga to achieve energy savings in buildings.\n\n## Brazil\n\nFor Brazil, the Reference scenario envisages an increase in electri/fi.ligacation at 2030, with a growing level of renewables generation, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular solar and wind, and the sta/r\\_t.liga of green hydrogen production after 2027, with a more ambitious view compared with the most recent energy plan. (19) In the transpo/r\\_t.liga sector, it takes account of biofuel incentive policies and assumes an increase in electri/fi.ligacation. The Slower Transition scenario is constructed on the assumption of a less optimistic macroeconomic environment than the Reference scenario, especially in the years up to 2030, with slower expansion of renewables capacity and a consequent slower trend line in emissions reduction. The Accelerated Transition scenario goes beyond the ambition of the Reference scenario regarding the speed of decarbonization, mainly after 2030, assuming an acceleration in the penetration of renewables, green hydrogen and storage.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Slower Transition scenario takes a more measured approach, using more conservative macroeconomic growth assumptions with no additional energy or climate policies beyond those already in place. The Accelerated Transition scenario achieves net-zero emissions by 2050 and, compared with the Reference scenario, provides for more ambitious goals for the expo/r\\_t.liga of green hydrogen, an acceleration in the electri/fi.ligacation of the residential and industrial sectors, and the phase-out of coal by 2030.\n\n## Colombia\n\nAs for Colombia, the Reference scenario envisages reducing emissions by 40% by 2030 compared with 2021, a moderately less ambitious target than the National Determined Contribution (NDC) objective, (20) and close to zero emissions in the electricity sector by 2050. In the Reference scenario, renewables capacity increases considerably by 2030, and envisages fu/r\\_t.ligaher growth connected with green hydrogen after 2030, albeit more conservatively compared with the expectations set out in the national strategy. (21) The Slower Transition scenario is characterized by emissions trends consistent with the Actualizaci\u00f3n scenario in the government strategy document, (22) which assumes more conservative macroeconomic growth and no additional energy or climate policies beyond those already in place. The Accelerated Transition scenario envisages an acceleration of the electri/fi.ligacation process in the residential and industrial sectors, together with greater growth expectations for the use of renewable sources.\n\n## The physical climate scenario for adaptation actions\n\nWithin the framework delineated above, each scenario narrative has been developed so as to ensure consistency between the energy transition scenarios and the climate scenarios.\n\nUnder the scenarios, the role of climate change is always the most impo/r\\_t.ligaant and generates e/ff.ligaects both in terms of transitioning the economy towards net-zero emissions and in terms of physical impacts, which may be:\n\n- \u00b7 acute phenomena, namely sho/r\\_t.liga-lived but intense phenomena, such as /fl.ligaooding, hurricanes etc. with potential impacts on assets (e.g., physical losses and business interruptions);\n- \u00b7 chronic phenomena related to structural changes in the climate, such as the rising trend in temperatures, rising sea levels etc., which may cause persistent changes in the output of generation plants and in electricity consumption pro/fi.ligales in the residential and commercial sectors.\n\nThe projected future behavior of these phenomena is analyzed by selecting the best data available from the output data of climate models at di/ff.ligaerent resolution levels and historical data.\n\nThe Group has selected three of the global climate pathways developed by the IPCC, which are in line with those of the IPCC's sixth Assessment Repo/r\\_t.liga (AR6). These scenarios are associated with emission pa/t\\_t.ligaerns linked to a level of\n\nthe Representative Concentration Pathway, each of which is connected to one of the /fi.ligave scenarios de/fi.liganed by the scienti/fi.ligac community as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The SSP scenarios include general assumptions concerning population, urbanization, etc. The three physical scenarios analyzed by the Group are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 SSP1-RCP 2.6: compatible with a range of global warming below 2 \u00b0C from pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) by 2100 (the IPCC forecasts an average of about +1.8 \u00b0C from 1850-1900). In the analyses that consider both physical and transition variables, the Group associates the SSP1-RCP 2.6 scenario with the Reference and Accelerated Transition scenarios.\n- \u00b7 SSP2-RCP 4.5: compatible with an intermediate scenario that calls for an average temperature increase of about 2.7 \u00b0C by 2100 from pre-industrial levels. The RCP 4.5 scenario is the one that is most representative of the world's current climate and political landscape and  correlated  transition  assumptions.  This  scenario forecasts global warming in line with the estimates of temperature increases that consider current policy around the world. (23) In the analyses that consider both physical and transition variables, the Group associates the SSP2-RCP 4.5 scenario with the Slower Transition scenario.\n- \u00b7 SSP5-RCP 8.5: compatible with a scenario where no pa/r\\_t.ligaicular measures to combat climate change are im-",

This scenario forecasts an increase in global temperatures of about 4.4 \u00b0C from pre-industrial levels by 2100.\n\nThe Group considers RCP 8.5 to be a worst-case climate scenario used to assess the e/ff.ligaects of physical phenomena in a context of pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly signi/fi.ligacant climate change, but it is currently deemed not very likely. This RCP 2.6 scenario is used both to assess physical phenomena and pe/r\\_f.ligaorm analyses that consider an energy transition consistent with most ambitious mitigation objectives.\n\nThe analyses carried out for the physical scenarios considered both chronic and acute phenomena. For the description of speci/fi.ligac, complex events, the Group considers data and analyses of public bodies, universities, and private-sector entities.\n\nThe climate scenarios are global and must be analyzed at the local level in order to determine their impact in the areas of relevance to the Group. Among active pa/r\\_t.liganerships, collaboration is under way with the Ea/r\\_t.ligah Sciences Depa/r\\_t.ligament of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste. As pa/r\\_t.liga of this collaboration, the ICTP provides projections for the major climate variables with a grid resolution of varying from about 12 km to 100 km and a forecast horizon running from 2020 to 2050. (24) The main variables are temperature, rain and snowfall, and solar radiation. Compared with past analyses, current studies are based on the use of multiple regional climate models: the one of the ICTP along with other simulations, which have been selected as being representative of the set of climate models currently available in the literature. (25) The output of this set is representative of the average of the various climate models. This technique is usually used in the scienti/fi.ligac community to obtain a more robust and bias-free analysis, mediating the di/ff.ligaerent assumptions that could characterize the individual model.\n\nFor ce/r\\_t.ligaain speci/fi.ligac climatic variables, such as wind gusts, the Group also uses other providers specialized in that pa/r\\_t.ligaicular phenomenon.\n\nIn this phase of the study, future projections have been analyzed for Italy, Spain and all countries of interest to the\n\nGroup in South America, Central America, No/r\\_t.ligah America and Africa, obtaining - thanks to the use of the set of models - a more highly de/fi.liganed representation of the physical scenario. Similarly, the Group is also analyzing data related to climate projections for Africa, Southern Asia and Southeast Asia, thereby covering all of the main geographical areas in which the Group is present at the global level.\n\nThe ICTP is also providing science suppo/r\\_t.liga to interpret all other climate data we gather. We are using climate scenarios for the countries of interest to the Group to allow for a uniform assessment of climate risk.\n\nSome of these phenomena entail high levels of complexity, as they depend not only on climate trends but also on the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of the territory and require fu/r\\_t.ligaher modeling to obtain a high-resolution representation. For this reason, in addition to the climate scenarios provided by ICTP, the Group also uses natural hazard maps. This tool makes it possible to obtain, with a high spatial resolution, recurrence intervals for a series of events, such as storms, hurricanes and /fl.ligaoods. As described in the section 'Risks and strategic oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with climate change', these maps are widely used within the Group, which already uses historical data to optimize insurance strategies. In addition, work is under way to be able to take advantage of this information developed in accordance with climate scenario projections.\n\nFinally, the Group has acquired the tools and capabilities needed to autonomously gather and analyze the raw output published by the scienti/fi.ligac community, so as to have a global, high-level view of the long-term trends in the climate variables of interest to us. These sources include the output from the climate and regional models CMIP6 (26) and CORDEX. (27) CMIP6 is the sixth assessment of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), which is a project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and of the Working Group of Coupled Modelling (WGCM), which provides  raw  climate  data  from  global  climate  models. These are used to assess standard global measurements at a resolution of about 100x100 km. The Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) also falls within the scope of the WCRP and generates regional climate forecasts at a higher resolution.\n\n<!-- image -->",

More speci/fi.ligacally, we have adopted a modular approach that will enable us to progressively upgrade our analyses by including new physical phenomena and re/fi.liganing both the data and our methodologies. At present, four climate phenomena are included: two related to extreme temperatures; one related to intense rainfall; and one related to drought. The possibility of introducing other phe-\n\nnomena such as extreme wind and sea level rise is also being evaluated. The phenomena are assigned a numerical index based on the global distribution to a resolution of about 100x100 km and are summarized in a composite index. This has enabled us to include a dimension related to climate change in the Open Country Risk model. This enables the tool to include both the aspects considered by the Open Country Risk models and those aspects related to the physical risks considered in the model as a cause of environmental and economic stress in a given country. The Open Country Risk model is described in greater detail in the section 'Macroeconomic and geopolitical trends'.\n\n## Physical scenario analyses\n\n## Acute phenomena\n\n## Heat waves\n\nExtreme temperatures can be studied using the standard indicator 'Warm Spell Duration Index' (WSDI). This metric considers heat waves characterized by at least six consecutive days with a maximum daily temperature above the 90th percentile of the historical distribution. (28)\n\nIn general, as can be seen in the following /fi.ligagure, in central and southern Europe the number of days of acute heat de/fi.liganed in accordance with the WSDI will increase in all future scenarios in the 2030-2050 period compared with the historical benchmark (1990-2020). In the RCP 2.6 scenario, most of the Italian peninsula will see an increase in the average number of days per year with heat waves (from +10 to +15 days) compared with a historical annual\n\naverage of around 20-25 days. This increase will be larger in the Alpine areas bordering France and Switzerland and in some areas in southern Italy, with a change of +15 to +20 days. The situation in Italy is also worsening in the RCP 8.5 scenario, where the expected increases are up to +30 days compared with the 1990-2020 period. Spain will see similar changes, with heat waves also becoming more widespread geographically and more frequent in the 2030-2050 period. Compared with past years characterized by around 20 warm-spell days, in the RCP 2.6 scenario this phenomenon will increase by between +10 to +15 days in almost all of Spain.\n\nIn the RCP 8.5 scenario, the duration of heat waves will be even longer, especially in the southern pa/r\\_t.liga of the country (mainly from +20 to +25 days, with peaks of up to +37 days in ce/r\\_t.ligaain coastal locations on the Mediterranean).",

In some areas of South America, such as no/r\\_t.ligah and east Brazil, no/r\\_t.ligahern Argentina and central-southern Chile, reductions from the historical trends are projected to occur under the RCP 2.6 scenario. In other areas, however, such as in most of Colombia and other areas of Brazil, intense rainfall is forecast to increase. In almost all of No/r\\_t.ligah America, acute precipitation is expected to increase in the RCP 2.6 scenario compared with the historical average (although the magnitude of these increases varies from area to area). In Mexico, however, the future change varies depending on the area. Finally, under the RCP 2.6 scenario, intense rainfall will decrease in the central and southern areas of Central America. In other areas, rainfall levels will remain unchanged or increase slightly.\n\n## Fire risk\n\nFire risk can be studied using the Fire Weather Index (FWI), an indicator widely used internationally that takes account of temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind in order to calculate an estimate of /fi.ligare risk. Figures provided by the ICTP may be used to describe the trend in /fi.ligare risk in order to suppo/r\\_t.liga the business in properly managing this risk. To give a more complete representation of /fi.ligare risk, we can supplement analysis on this acute phenomenon with a study of vegetation indices, since vegetation can serve as\n\nfuel and increase the probability of a /fi.ligare spreading. (29) In central and southern Europe, the number of days per year experiencing extreme /fi.ligare risk (i.e. those with a FWI value > 45) will tend to increase almost everywhere in the 2030-2050 period compared with the 1990-2020 benchmark. The studies conducted for Italy show that the number of days at high risk increase in all scenarios, especially in the summer. This change will be even more accentuated under the RCP 8.5 scenario and mainly a/ff.ligaect the islands and southern regions of the country. In general, in these areas the increase in the number of days at extreme risk ranges from approximately +6 to +11 days compared with the historical average. The area of Spain that will see the greatest increase in /fi.ligare risk is the central south in all future scenarios. This increase is larger in the RCP 8.5 scenario than in the RCP 2.6 scenario.\n\nIn the Americas, the expected evolution of extreme /fi.ligare risk varies from area to area. In South America, in the RCP 2.6 scenario the number of days at high /fi.ligarst risk increases in most of Brazil and Chile and in the no/r\\_t.ligah-west and south of Argentina. In the remaining areas of the macroregion it remains unchanged or decreases slightly. In No/r\\_t.ligah and Central America, high /fi.ligare risk remains essentially unchanged in most of the macroregion in the RCP 2.6 scenario. Only in the western areas of the United States and Mexico are increases in the number of days at high risk expected, with the increase rising as the scenario become more severe.\n\n## Cold snaps\n\nA number of indicators can be used to measure extreme cold-related events. (30) One of these is the frost days index, i.e. the average number of frost days per year. (31)\n\nComparing the RCP 2.6 scenario (2030-2050) with the historical benchmark (1990-2020), in central and southern Europe the number of frost days will remain unchanged or decrease slightly in all countries. Only in some areas, such as the Alps in Italy and the Pyrenees in Spain, will the number of days of intense cold decrease (from -5 to -10 days compared with the historical benchmark). Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the decrease in frost days is expected to be more geographically extensive. In no/r\\_t.ligahern Italy and in some Apennine areas of the peninsula and in pa/r\\_t.liga of no/r\\_t.ligahern and central Spain, the forecast is for a reduction of up to 15 days of frost per year, again compared with the benchmark period.\n\nIn most of the Americas, the number of frost days will remain unchanged under both RCP scenarios; only in some areas are decreases expected. Latin America will experience a decline in frost days in some central-western and southern areas, and the decrease will be larger under the RCP 8.5 scenario compared with the RCP 2.6. Frost days will decrease in No/r\\_t.ligah America and Central America, especially in the western pa/r\\_t.liga of the macroregion, with larger and more extensive declines under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Note that a decrease in frequency does not exclude an increase in the intensity of these acute events, an issue that the Group is currently investigating.",

These events fall within a pa/t\\_t.ligaern of a signi/fi.ligacant increase in extreme physical phenomena in recent decades. However, it is impo/r\\_t.ligaant to understand how and to what extent these events are connected to climate change driven by human activities. This is not an easy task, but studies of individual events can help. 'Event a/t\\_t.ligaribution' science seeks to do just this, providing explanations based on science and thus avoiding the dissemination of misleading or false information. By studying su/r\\_f.ligaace pressure, temperature variables and past events, it is possible to establish that phenomena such as the long and intense heat wave of July 2023 (Cerberus) are above all a/t\\_t.ligaributable to natural climate variability. By contrast, the anomalous heat wave of August 21-\n\n## Chronic phenomena\n\n## Temperature\n\nChronic temperature changes can be analyzed to obtain information about the potential e/ff.ligaects on the cooling and heating demand of local energy systems. The thermal requirement has been measured using Heating Degree Days (HDDs), i.e. the sum, for all days of the year with a T average \u2264 15 \u00b0C, of the di/ff.ligaerences between the internal temperature (with T internal assumed to be 18 \u00b0C) and the average temperature, and Cooling Degree Days (CDDs), i.e. the sum, for all days of the year with T average \u2265 24 \u00b0C, of the di/ff.ligaerences\n\n23 that hit central and western Europe was a unique event that can largely be a/t\\_t.ligaributed to anthropogenic climate change. (32)\n\nIn general, event a/t\\_t.ligaribution studies indicate that, on average, in Europe:\n\n- \u00b7 a heat wave that in the pre-industrial climate would have occurred 1 time every 10 years is now expected to occur 2.8 times within 10 years and will be 1.2 \u00b0C warmer. With a rise of +2 \u00b0C by 2100, it will occur 5.6 times and be 2.6 \u00b0C warmer;\n- \u00b7 a heat wave that in the pre-industrial climate would have occurred 1 time every 50 years is now expected to occur 4.8 times over 50 years and will be 1.2 \u00b0C warmer. With +2\u00b0 C of global warming, it will occur 13.9 times and be 2.7 \u00b0C warmer.\n\nIt should be emphasized that these numbers refer to moderate heat waves. More extreme events may be up to a hundred times more likely due to climate change.\n\nbetween T average and T internal (assumed to be 21 \u00b0C), respectively, for heating and cooling requirements. The country averages have been calculated as an average over the country, weighting each geographical node by population thanks to the use of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) associated with each RCP scenario. Since CDD is the variable that experiences the greatest change, the /fi.ligagure shows CDDs at high resolution for the historical data and the average variation expected in the RCP 2.6 scenario in the 2030-2050 period for Europe and South America. The distribution of the population used as a weight for the\n\ncalculation at the national level is also shown.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Precipitation\n\nAnother chronic phenomenon of interest is the change in total precipitation due to climate change, which could impact hydroelectric generation. Changes in this phenomenon in the areas of interest for the Group have therefore been analyzed. The analysis of European catchment areas, which compared the 2030-2050 forecast with 1990-2020, points to no signi/fi.ligacant change, with a generalized slightly downward trend in central and southern Italy and Spain under the RCP 2.6 scenario.\n\nAs regards South America, the analyses, which compare the same time intervals, show a downward trend in Ar-\n\ngentina and Colombia. Brazil is projected to experience a slight increase or decrease in total rainfall under the RCP 2.6 scenario depending on the group of catchment areas considered. Finally, as with Argentina and Colombia, the projections for Chile also point to a reduction in total rainfall in the scenario with the lowest emissions, but this may have already manifested itself in recent years (with a real decrease on historic norms).\n\nComparing the various RCPs (2030-2050) and the historical model (1990-2020), expected total annual rainfall tends to decline in Central America, while in No/r\\_t.ligah America it will remain the same or increase depending on the area.\n\n## Overall e/ff.ligaect of the transition and physical scenarios on electricity demand\n\nThe use of integrated energy system models described in the section 'Local transition scenarios' makes it possible to quantify the individual service demand of a country. This makes it possible to discriminate the speci/fi.ligac longterm e/ff.ligaects that a change in temperature can have on energy demand. For this purpose, the Reference , Slower Transition and Accelerated Transition scenarios described above have been expanded to include the e/ff.ligaect that temperature increases have on energy demand (total, not just electricity)  for  residential  and  commercial  heating  and cooling, as measured in terms of Heating Degree Days (HDDs) and Cooling Degree Days (CDDs).\n\nThe de/fi.liganition of a benchmark scenario consistent with achieving the Paris objectives makes it possible to associate HDDs and CDDs consistent with the RCP 2.6 scenario to the Reference scenario and the Accelerated Transition scenario,  which  is  characterized  by  a  faster  decline  in emissions. HDDs and CDDs consistent with RCP 4.5 were instead associated with the Slower Transition scenario, because it corresponds to a slower decline in greenhouse gas emissions. To stress the analyses fu/r\\_t.ligaher, the la/t\\_t.ligaer scenario was also associated with RCP 8.5.\n\n## Italy and Spain\n\nFor Italy, the change in the level of electricity demand between the two extreme scenarios considered ( Slower and Accelerated Transition ) due to transition phenomena is about 18 percentage points on average in the 2031-2050 period.  Excluding  the  e/ff.ligaect  of  electricity  demand  for green hydrogen production, the di/ff.ligaerence in electricity demand falls to 8%.\n\nAs regards Spain, the percentage di/ff.ligaerences due to transition phenomena are smaller than in Italy, since the existing National Energy Plan sets pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly ambitious climate objectives. Consequently, less variability is expected in the evolution of the energy system and therefore electricity demand in the 2031-2050 period. The delta between the two extreme cases considered ( Slower and Accelerated Transition )  is  around  10  percentage  points  on  average in 2031-2050. If we exclude the e/ff.ligaect of electricity demand for hydrogen production, the di/ff.ligaerence narrows to around 2%.\n\nFor both countries, the speed of the energy transition has a much greater impact on the level of electricity demand than the e/ff.ligaects of the increase in temperature deriving from climate change, as the analyses pe/r\\_f.ligaormed show how the la/t\\_t.ligaer causes demand to increase by less than one percentage point for both Italy and Spain.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the Accelerated Transition scenario, the slightly higher ambition in the Reference scenario is achieved via faster electri/fi.ligacation. Accordingly, the electricity demand delta in 2031-2050 averages around a positive 3-4%. Also in this case, the speed of the energy transition has a much greater impact on the level of electricity demand than the negligible e/ff.ligaects of the increase in temperature deriving from climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This di/ff.ligaerence is mainly due to assumptions regarding the achievement of the country's ambitious targets for green hydrogen production after 2030 set out in the document Plani/fi.ligacaci\u00f3n Energ\u00e9tica Nacional de Largo Plazo (PELP). If the e/ff.ligaect of electricity demand for hydrogen production - for which the two scenarios have di/ff.ligaerent levels of ambition in relation  to  the  di/ff.ligaerent  decarbonization  trajectories  -  is omi/t\\_t.ligaed, the di/ff.ligaerence declines to about 6%. In the Accelerated Transition scenario, the greater ambition of the en-\n\ngy transition is achieved through the implementation of more stringent decarbonization policies to achieve greater electri/fi.ligacation, greater penetration of green hydrogen in industry and transpo/r\\_t.liga and increased expo/r\\_t.ligas of that hydrogen. This leads to an average increase of about 11% in electricity demand over the baseline of the Reference scenario in 2031-2050. Excluding the e/ff.ligaect of electricity demand connected with the production of green hydrogen, electricity demand is an average of about 12% higher than in the Reference scenario in the 2031-2050 period. Once again, the speed of the energy transition has a much greater impact on the level of electricity demand than the increase in temperature caused by climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To determine the framework in which we operate, we conduct in-depth scenario planning in order to be prepared to seize oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities and manage future risks and unce/r\\_t.ligaainties in the most robust manner possible.  This analysis of what could happen in the external landscape is key to de/fi.liganing the Group's positioning within that landscape. We then de/fi.ligane our long-term ambitions and design the strategic options that characterize our long-term planning.\n\nIn recent years, the increasing complexity of the rapidly changing context in which we operate has made it so that the process of de/fi.liganing the Group's strategies has also evolved in order to capture as much of this dynamism as possible, so as to make it an enabling factor in the de/fi.liganition of goals.\n\nToday, this process is organized into the following main activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic Dialogue: a continuous process of active dialogue throughout the year and across all Group functions, through which the strategic topics for the evolution and growth of the Group are identi/fi.ligaed, analyzed, discussed and addressed. This dialogue is pa/r\\_t.liga of a strategic design phase, where communication among executives makes a valuable contribution to developing new strategic options, with an emphasis on the need for cultural or organizational change and synergies between businesses.\n- \u00b7 Strategic  Planning:  this  process,  which  is  driven  on an ongoing basis by feedback from the strategic dialogue, transforms the information to be processed into quantitative models in order to establish an overview of the industrial, economic and /fi.liganancial evolution of the Group, supplemented by possible active po/r\\_t.ligafolio management. The evaluation of strategic options over a time horizon extends beyond that used in industrial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nplanning, with (i) the de/fi.liganition and the quantitative and qualitative development of alternative macroeconomic, energy and climate scenarios against which overall strategy can be assessed, and (ii) analyses based on stress testing for various factors, including the evolution of the industrial sector, technology, competitive structure, climate variables and policies.\n\n- \u00b7 Long-term  positioning:  consistent  with  the  analyses and decisions described in the previous points, and basing on our ambitions for environmental and economic-/fi.liganancial sustainability and the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities to be seized on the market, the Group's positioning is de/fi.liganed with regard to the long-term industrial strategy.\n- \u00b7 Analysis of ESG factors and assessment of materiality in the /fi.ligaeld of sustainability: Enel assesses ESG issues in order to identify and evaluate priorities for stakeholders, conducting a double materiality analysis to determine the material issues that suppo/r\\_t.liga the de/fi.liganition of the objectives to be included in the strategic sustainability planning. This analysis takes into consideration the  ESRS  standards  of  the  European  Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.ligaing Directive (CSRD) as well as numerous other international standards (for example, the Global Repo/r\\_t.ligaing Initiative - GRI, SASB, SDG Compass, etc.).\n\nThe strategy of the Enel Group has proven its ability to create sustainable long-term value, fully integrating the themes  of  sustainability  and  close  a/t\\_t.ligaention  to  climate change  issues  while  simultaneously  ensuring  increased pro/fi.ligatability for stakeholders.\n\nThe Group is among the leaders guiding the energy transition through the decarbonization of electricity generation, digitalization of distribution grids and the electri/fi.ligacation of  /fi.liganal  consumption,  which  represent  oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities  to create value and to accelerate achievement of the Paris Agreement objectives and the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United National in the 2030 Agenda. The Group also suppo/r\\_t.ligas the principles of a just transition, as de/fi.liganed in the Just Transition Guidelines of the International Labor Organization (ILO), so that no one is left behind, in light of the social impact that the decarbonization strategy entails, while ensuring respect for human rights throughout the value chain.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Group expects to invest less than 3% of gross 2024-2026 investment in thermal generation, most of which will be dedicated to maintenance of existing plants, while investment in the development of new plants will be substantially limited to the conversion from coal to CCGT of the Fusina power plant, which is expected to be completed by 2024.\n\nMore than 90% of the Group's total investment in 20242026 is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and directly work towards SDGs 7  ('A/ff.ligaordable  and  Clean  Energy'),  9  ('Industry,  Innovation and Infrastructure') and 11 ('Sustainable Cities and Communities'), all of which help to achieve SDG 13 ('Climate Action'). The alignment of investments stated in the Group's Strategic Plan with the objectives of decarbonization and the reduction of greenhouse gases is based on a speci/fi.ligac approach by which investment in renewables and retail power, by their nature, fall under SDG 7, investment in distribution networks fall under SDG 9, and investments by Enel X concern SDG 11.

In 2026, the Group's renewables capacity is expected to increase to approximately 73 GW, from about 62 GW in 2023, with the share of zero-emission generation reaching around 86%, compared with 75% in 2023 (including managed capacity).\n\nIn the Customer segment, the Group has planned gross investments of about \u20ac3 billion between 2024 and 2026. The main driver of the Group strategy in this segment will be the strengthening of customer centricity thanks to a single touchpoint for business-to-consumer (B2C) customers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), key accounts dedicated to the main business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) customers, as well as bundled o/ff.ligaers.\n\nThanks to these initiatives, the ordinary EBITDA of the Integrated Businesses is expected to reach around \u20ac15.5 billion in 2026, with renewables as the main growth factor over the Plan period.\n\n## COMMERCIAL PROPOSITION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In a climate such as this, and as a global player in the energy market, Enel is on the front lines playing an active role in guiding the global energy transition towards zero emissions as a mitigating lever and working to determine the best ways to adapt to the changes that are inevitable to varying degrees of frequency and intensity.\n\nTherefore,  the  work  Enel  is  doing  to  combat  climate change represents one of the pillars of the Group's sho/r\\_t.ligaand long-term strategy.\n\nMitigation e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas include all those initiatives aimed at reducing the impact that the activities of the Group and our stakeholders have on climate change, and /fi.ligarst and foremost those that aim to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.\n\nAdaptations, on the other hand, include all actions that Enel implements to make assets more resilient, to increase our ability to react to extreme weather events, and to con-\n\n## Our zero-emissions ambition\n\nBeing among the /fi.ligarst signatories of the 'Business Ambition for 1.5 \u00b0C' campaign promoted by the United Nations and other organizations, the Enel Group has publicly declared its commitment to developing a business model in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement (COP 21) to limit the average global temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C.\n\nEnel's commitment to combating climate change reached another historical milestone in 2022, with the Group de/fi.liganing a decarbonization roadmap covering both direct and indirect  emissions  throughout  the  Group's  value  chain. This roadmap includes four targets ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to be in line with limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C.\n\nEnel's new ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed targets come on the back of our ambition declared in 2021, when we moved up our commitment to achieving zero emissions by 10 years, from 2050 to 2040.\n\nEnel's  ambition  goes  beyond  the  SBTi  ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed  targets and aims to pave the way to becoming a zero-emission organization  by  2040.  Our  ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed  roadmap  currently calls for reducing all direct and indirect greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by about 99% from 2017 levels by 2040 throughout our value chain, which is well above the overall threshold set by international standards (of 90%). The\n\nceive business models and other strategic options targeting various needs in this constantly changing climate.\n\nIn each of these two areas, the challenges present opportunities that we will seize through Group strategy. Here at Enel, adapting to climate change also means exploring new business oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities to come out of the changing landscape, developing new technologies, and creating value from the capabilities acquired. The mitigation of climate change also involves investing in research into innovative technologies that will enable an economy that is green by design or that, for example, improve pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and circularity.\n\nThe experience we gain and our study of possible climate scenarios that have been seen above also play a crucial role in guiding both areas of action. As we will discuss in the section related to climate change risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, the Group has also established internal policies for the assessment and management of these challenges.\n\nGroup also aims to reduce all emissions by 100% with a view to overcoming, over the sho/r\\_t.liga to medium term, all exogenous factors, such as the development of new technological solutions for the supply chain over a wide scale or the implementation of ce/r\\_t.ligaain market-based and political strategies. Enel actively collaborates with vendors, customers and policymakers to promote solutions and accelerate necessary actions.\n\nEnel's decarbonization roadmap is centered around promoting  electri/fi.ligacation  solutions,  accompanied  by  completing the full phase-out of fossil fuels and accelerating the development of renewables, as well as going digital and upgrading grids. Aware of the social impact that the decarbonization strategy entails, Enel suppo/r\\_t.ligas the principles of a just transition, as de/fi.liganed in the Just Transition Guidelines of the International Labor Organization (ILO), which is expressed in terms of actions involving retraining, professional updating and self-learning for direct and indirect workers, providing suppo/r\\_t.liga with a view to business diversi/fi.ligacation and greater resilience for the supply chain, job oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities for communities in our area of in/fl.ligauence and facilitating access to products and services for customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These adaptation solutions may concern both sho/r\\_t.liga-term actions and long-term decisions, such as planning for investments in response to weather events. Adaptation effo/r\\_t.ligas also include procedures, policies and best practices for resiliency, response and innovation.\n\nFor new investment, we can also take action right from the design and construction phases to reduce the impact of climate risks by design (e.g., by assessing risks and vulnerabilities during the design stage) and to take account of any chronic e/ff.ligaects (e.g., including climate scenarios in long-term estimates for renewable resources).\n\nOnce the weather and climate events have been identi/fi.ligaed, actions to maximize our capacity for adaptation may be categorized as follows.\n\n- \u00b7 Response management - Procedures to prepare the response to extreme events (e.g., acquiring sho/r\\_t.liga-term weather forecasts and training) and procedures to re-\n\nore  normal  operations  as  quickly  as  possible  (e.g., de/fi.liganing operating and organizational procedures to implement in response to critical events).\n\n- \u00b7 Resiliency measures - Actions aimed at increasing asset resiliency, such as assessing the entity of potential acute and chronic risks in order to de/fi.ligane both design requirements and actions to take with regard to existing assets.\n- \u00b7 New business options - Conception of new businesses or products that are adapted to future changes in climate, so as to facilitate adaptation for both the Group and our communities and stakeholders.\n\nIn order to assess the impact of climate change for the purpose of making business and strategy decisions, and thereby aimed at implementing adaptation measures in line with the above, the Group is investing in the development of quantitative models that also make use of climate scenario data in order to assess the impact of climate change on speci/fi.ligac assets or areas of production.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, in addition to the US dollar the most impacting currencies are the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso and the Brazilian real. Italy and Spain represent nearly all of the Group's exposure to the impact of the volatility of energy prices and commodity price /fl.ligauctuations on margins.\n\nExamining the other risk factors, such as those connected with weather and climate events, we can see that geographical diversi/fi.ligacation signi/fi.ligacantly reduces the exposure to the risk associated with renewable resources - a highly positive factor considering the Group's positioning and the steady expansion of renewable generation.

        "page_content": "## Macroeconomic and geopolitical trends\n\nThe considerable internationalization of the Group - which has a presence in many regions, including Europe, South America, No/r\\_t.ligah America and Africa - requires Enel to consider country risk, i.e. risks of a macroeconomic, /fi.liganancial, institutional or social nature and those speci/fi.ligacally associated with the energy sector whose occurrence could have a signi/fi.ligacant adverse impact on both revenue /fl.ligaows and the value of corporate assets. Enel has adopted a quantitative Open Country Risk assessment model capable of moni-\n\ntoring the riskiness of the countries in which it operates. The Open Country Risk model seeks to go beyond the more conventional de/fi.liganition of country risk, which focuses on the ability of a government to repay the debt it has issued, to o/ff.ligaer a broader view of the risk factors that can impact a country. The model is divided into four risk components: economic, institutional and political, social, and energy factors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nENERGY FACTORS\n\nOpen Country Risk is a quantitative model that extends the more conventional de/fi.liga nition of country risk used in the existing literature by providing a more complete analysis of the risks involved, incorporating economic, /fi.liga nancial, political, climate and energy factors.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, the Open Country Risk model has the ambition to measure the economic resilience of individual countries, de/fi.liganed as the balance of their position with respect to the rest of the world, the e/ff.ligaectiveness of internal policies, the vulnerabilities of their banking and corporate system that might po/r\\_t.ligaend systemic crises and their a/t\\_t.ligaractiveness in terms of economic growth, and /fi.liganally a quanti/fi.ligacation of extreme climate events as a cause of stress at the environmental and economic level (economic factors). This is accompanied by an assessment of the robustness of the country's institutions and political context (institutional and political factors), an in-depth analysis of social phenomena, measuring the level of well-being, inclusion and social progress (social factors), and the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the energy system and its positioning within the energy transition process, as these are all essential factors for evaluating the sustainability of investments in the medium to long term (energy factors).\n\nSpeci/fi.ligacally,  the  introduction  of  extreme  climate  events within the Open Country Risk model makes it possible to develop a uniform assessment on the evolution of ce/r\\_t.ligaain climate hazards at the country level on a global scale.\n\nFinally, with regard to the analysis of the energy transition process, the Open Country Risk model also includes risk and  oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity  analyses  designed  for  forecasting  purposes, quantifying the actions and the paths taken by the individual countries. For example, the model incorporates various factors re/fl.ligaecting the weight of renewable sources in energy generation, the electri/fi.ligacation process and the environmental sustainability of the national energy system, which together are crucial characteristics for evaluating the country's potential growth and a/t\\_t.ligaractiveness in the medium to long term.",

The framework has been created with a view to ensuring overall consistency, making it possible to analyze and evaluate the impact of transition phenomena (e.g., energy  context)  and  physical  phenomena  (e.g.,  climate change) within solid alternative scenarios, constructed using a quantitative and modeling approach combined with ongoing dialogue with both internal stakeholders and external authorities.\n\nThe  energy  transition  presents  risks  and  oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities connected both with changes in the regulatory and legal context and trends in technology development and competition, electri/fi.ligacation and customer behavior and the consequent market developments.\n\nPhysical risks are divided in turn between acute (i.e. extreme events) and chronic, with the former linked to extremely intense meteorological conditions and the la/t\\_t.ligaer to more gradual but structural changes in climate conditions.\n\nExtreme events expose the Group to the risk of prolonged unavailability of assets and infrastructure, the cost of restoring service, customer disruptions and so on. Chronic changes in climate conditions expose the Group to other risks or oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities: for example, structural changes in temperature could cause changes in electricity demand and have an impact on output, while alterations in rainfall or wind conditions could impact the Group's business by increasing or decreasing potential electricity generation. In general, adapting to the probable changes that will occur in the future also drives activities in the /fi.ligaeld of innovation and strategic positioning: new businesses and be/t\\_t.ligaer products could be found to live sustainably in the changed context.\n\nThe Enel Group is contributing to realizing the transition and the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities that may arise. As discussed previously, our strategic choices, which are already strongly oriented towards the energy transition, with more than 90% of investments directed at improving a number of the Sustainable Development Goals, enable us to incorporate risk mitigation and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity maximization 'by design', adopting a positioning that takes account of the medium- and long-term phenomena we have identi/fi.ligaed. The strategic choices are accompanied by the operating best practices adopted by the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The framework illustrated above also highlights the relationships that link the physical and transition scenarios with the potential impact on the Group's business.\n\nThese e/ff.ligaects can be assessed from the perspective of three time horizons: the sho/r\\_t.liga term (1-3 years), in which sensitivity analyses based on the Strategic Plan presented to investors in 2023 can be pe/r\\_f.ligaormed; the medium term (until 2027-2034), in which it is possible to assess the effects of the energy transition; and the long term (20352050), in which chronic structural changes in the climate should begin to emerge in addition to the most evident transition e/ff.ligaects.\n\nIn order to facilitate the correct identi/fi.ligacation and management of the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with climate change, a Group policy was adopted in 2021 that describes  the  common  guidelines  for  assessing  these risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities. The 'Climate change risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities' policy de/fi.liganes a harmonized approach for integrating issues relating to climate change and the energy transition into the Group's processes and activities, thus informing industrial and strategic choices to improve business resilience and long-term sustainable value creation, in line with the adaptation and mitigation strategy. The main steps considered in the policy are described bel ow.\n\n- \u00b7 Prioritization  of  phenomena  and  scenario  analysis. These activities include the identi/fi.ligacation of physical and transition phenomena relevant to the Group and the  consequent  preparation  of  the  scenarios  to  be considered, which are developed through the analysis and processing of data from internal and external sources. For the phenomena so identi/fi.ligaed, functions can be developed to connect the scenarios (for example, data on changes in renewable sources) to the operation of the business (for example, changes in expected potential output).\n- \u00b7 Evaluation of impacts. This includes all the analyses and activities needed to quantify the e/ff.ligaects at an operational, economic and /fi.liganancial level, consistent with the processes in which they are integrated (for example, design of new buildings, evaluation of operational performance, etc.).\n- \u00b7 Operational and strategic actions. The information obtained from the previous activities is integrated into processes, informing the decisions of the Group and the business activities. Some examples of activities and processes that bene/fi.ligat from this are capital allocation, such  as  in  the  evaluation  of  investments  in  existing assets or new projects, the development of resilience plans, risk management and /fi.liganancing activities, engineering and business development.\n\nThe main sources of risk and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity from the evolution of transition scenarios and physical variables, the best practices for the operational management of weather and climate phenomena, and the qualitative and quantitative impact assessments pe/r\\_f.ligaormed to date are discussed below. The above activities are pe/r\\_f.ligaormed on the foundation of an ongoing e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga during the year to analyze, assess and manage the information produced. The process of disclosing information on the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities connected with climate change will be gradual and incremental from year to year, in line with the recommendations of the most recent climate-change repo/r\\_t.ligaing standards.\n\n## Enel's resilience to the energy transition and climate change\n\nThe impacts of climate change, technological evolution, the evolution of policies and changes in macroeconomic fundamentals and geopolitical and market conditions make it every more impo/r\\_t.ligaant to develop resilient business strategies,  i.e.  strategies  both  capable  of  withstanding external shocks, and therefore of absorbing the causes of potential crises and thriving even when external conditions change, whether slowly or rapidly, and su/ffi.ligaciently /fl.ligaexible to identify new oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities and transform them into  actions.  Jointly  considering  the  factors  associated with energy transition scenarios and the various climate change scenarios is therefore a prerequisite for long-term planning.\n\nThe set of transition and climatic scenarios plays a role in guiding strategic and industrial decisions, taking account, for example, of the future e/ff.ligaects of temperature on electricity demand, the investments necessary to suppo/r\\_t.liga the process of ever greater electri/fi.ligacation and decarbonization, the evolution of the market environment and of consumer habits. Given that Enel's Strategic Plan concentrates more than 90% of investment on combatting climate change through the progressive expansion of generation from renewable sources and the development of infrastructure and services to guide energy systems and customers towards progressive electri/fi.ligacation, aiming at the same time at signi/fi.ligacantly reducing the use of fossil fuels and increasing quality and e/ffi.ligaciency, the Group's investments and activities delineate, by design, a long-term growth path that is in line with an energy transition consistent with the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe application of long-term climate scenarios enables the construction of adaptation plans for the Group's asset and business po/r\\_t.ligafolio. Climate scenarios are developed sta/r\\_t.ligaing with the identi/fi.ligacation of the most relevant physical phenomena for each business (such as heat waves, extreme rainfall, /fi.ligare risk, etc.), to produce analyses that provide both high-level indicators (such as comparable\n\n<!-- image -->",

This dynamic reduces the risk associated with the progressive increase in the share of renewables in the energy mix, which could trigger a reduction in the price of wholesale electricity. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, revisions of the market design in favor of long-term remuneration would have a positive impact on pro/fi.ligatability.\n\nThe e/ff.ligaects of the Slower Transition and Accelerated Transition on the variables that can most impact the business were then identi/fi.ligaed, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular electricity demand in/fl.ligauenced by developments in the electri/fi.ligacation of consumption - and hence the penetration of electrical technologies - and the power generation mix.\n\nWith regard to the electri/fi.ligacation of consumption, however, the Slower Transition scenario envisages lower penetration rates for the most e/ffi.ligacient electrical technologies, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular electric vehicles and heat pumps, producing a decrease in electricity demand compared with the Reference scenario, which is expected to have a limited impact on the commodity and beyond-commodity retail business. At the same time, the decline in electricity demand would leave less room for growth in renewables, with an impact on the generation business, pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by higher electricity prices than in a scenario with more renewables capacity.\n\nThe Accelerated Transition scenario assumes a more rapid reduction in the costs of green hydrogen production technologies compared with the Reference scenario. This translates into greater penetration for green hydrogen, with a consequent additive e/ff.ligaect on national electricity demand and the installation of renewables capacity compared with the Reference scenario.\n\nAll  of  the  scenarios,  but  especially  the Reference and the Accelerated Transition scenarios , will entail a greater role for grids. In fact, we expect a signi/fi.ligacant increase in distributed generation and storage systems, the greater penetration of charging infrastructure and a growing rate of electri/fi.ligacation of consumption. These developments will lead to the decentralization of power withdrawal/injection points, an increase in electricity demand and the average power required, and strong variability of energy /fl.ligaows, requiring dynamic and /fl.ligaexible management of the grid.",

The following matrix identi/fi.ligaes the chronic climate phenomena to which each of the Group's assets and technologies was found to be most vulnerable, di/ff.ligaerentiating by the priority of the phenomenon.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Group works to e/ff.ligaectively estimate the relationships between the changes in the physical variables repo/r\\_t.ligaed in the matrix and the change in producibility relating to individual plants for the di/ff.ligaerent technologies.\n\n## Analysis of the impact of chronic climate change on renewable generation\n\nTo calculate the impact of the chronic e/ff.ligaects of climate change on the production of our assets, a series of ad hoc functions have been created for each renewable technology (wind, solar and hydroelectric) and plant, which associate, with each change in climatic variables (e.g., temperature, radiation, wind speed, rainfall), probable changes in terms of electrical producibility of the plants in our po/r\\_t.ligafolio.\n\nTo calibrate these 'link' functions, we sta/r\\_t.ligaed from the historical data of the weather-climate variables (33) and from the internal references of the observed producible energy of our plants. In this way, link functions have been obtained which respond to the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of each renewable plant and technology.\n\nIt was therefore possible to study the chronic climate impacts for possible future projections of climate variables (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios).\n\nage structural changes, it is necessary to study the typical volatility of the weather and therefore more sho/r\\_t.liga-term. Both the information derived from the variation ranges of the chronic trends projected by the climatic scenarios and the historical volatilities of the meteorological data were taken as input for the strategic planning, through analysis of the variations in electricity production (TWh) over the last 10 years.\n\nAll /fl.ligauctuations, both weather and climatic, can lead to adjustments, since the production of the plants feeds the sourcing for the sale of energy to customers. In essence, reductions in terms of energy for renewable production can lead to imbalances on the sourcing side which can lead to the purchase of the missing volumes on the market to feed the  commercial  strategy.  Conversely,  greater  renewable production leads to a possible reduction in the purchase of volumes on the market (or possibly higher sales).\n\nChronic structural changes in the recent trends of physical variables will manifest themselves gradually over long time scales. In order to obtain an indicative projection of the potential impacts, and include a possible acceleration of the manifestation of chronic e/ff.ligaects, we can pe/r\\_f.ligaorm a stress test of the Business Plan with regard to the factors potentially in/fl.ligauenced by the physical scenario, taking account of historical weather variability and the climate changes that are expected to emerge in the long term.

        "page_content": "Insurance NV. The Group manages the various phases of assessing the risks connected with natural disasters: from assessment and quanti/fi.ligacation to the corresponding insurance coverage to minimize impacts.\n\nIn all of these types of natural disasters, three independent factors can be identi/fi.ligaed, as brie/fl.ligay described below.\n\n- \u00b7 The event probability (hazard), i.e. the theoretical frequency of the event over a speci/fi.ligac time frame, which can also be expressed as the recurrence interval or return period. A hazard that has a speci/fi.ligac geographical distribution is analyzed in the areas where the Group assets involved are located.\n\nFor this purpose, the Group adopts the hazard map tool, which associates the estimated hazard for the different types of natural disasters with each geographical point. This information, organized in geo-referenced databases, is obtained from global reinsurance companies or developed on the basis of data from weather consulting /fi.ligarms or academic institutions.\n\n- \u00b7 Vulnerability, which indicates in percentage terms how much value would be lost upon the occurrence of a given catastrophic event. In more speci/fi.ligac terms, reference can be made to the damage to material assets,\n\nthe impact on the continuity of electricity generation and/or distribution or the provision of electrical services to end users.\n\nThe Group, especially in the case of damage to its assets,  conducts  and  promotes  speci/fi.ligac  vulnerability analyses for each technology in its po/r\\_t.ligafolio, for example solar, wind and hydroelectric generation plants, transmission and distribution grids, primary and secondary substations, etc.\n\n- \u00b7 Exposure, i.e. the set of economic values present in the Group's po/r\\_t.ligafolio that could be materially impacted in the presence of catastrophic natural events. Again, the dimensions of the analyses are speci/fi.ligac for the di/ff.ligaerent production technologies, distribution assets and services to end users.\n\nThe three factors described above (hazard, vulnerability and exposure) constitute the fundamental elements of any assessment of the risk associated with extreme events. In this sense, the Group, with respect to climate change scenarios, di/ff.ligaerentiates its risk analyses in accordance with the speci/fi.ligacities of the various associated time horizons. The following table summarizes the scheme adopted for the assessment of the impacts deriving from acute physical phenomena.\n\n| Time horizon         | Hazard                                                                                             | Vulnerability                                                                                                          | Exposure                              |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Sho/r\\_t.liga term    | Hazard maps based on historical data  and meteorological models                                    | Vulnerability, being linked to  the type of extreme event, to                                                          | Group values in the sho/r\\_t.liga term |\n| Medium and long term | Hazard maps and speci/fi.ligac studies for  the di/ff.ligaerent RCP climate scenarios  of the IPCC | damage and to the technical  requirements of the technology  in question, is essentially  independent of time horizons | Group values in the long term         |\n\n## Managing the risk of extreme events in the sho/r\\_t.liga term\n\nOver the sho/r\\_t.liga term (1-3 years) the Group, in addition to risk assessment and quanti/fi.ligacation, takes actions to reduce the impacts that the business may su/ff.ligaer following catastrophic extreme events. Two main types of action can be distinguished: obtaining e/ff.ligaective insurance coverage and climate adaptation activities, preventing losses that could be caused by extreme events.\n\nThe general characteristics of these actions are illustrated below and, naturally, in the case of adaptation activities for damage prevention and mitigation, speci/fi.ligac reference will be made to the Group's Generation and Enel Grids Global Business Lines.\n\n## Impact of acute physical events on the Group\n\nThe Enel Group has a well-diversi/fi.ligaed po/r\\_t.ligafolio in terms of its generation technologies, geographical distribution and asset scale and, consequently, the po/r\\_t.ligafolio's exposure to natural risks is also diversi/fi.ligaed. The Group implements various risk mitigation measures, which, as described below, include both insurance coverage and other management and operational arrangements to fu/r\\_t.ligaher lower the Company's risk pro/fi.ligale.\n\nThe empirical evidence indicates negligible repercussions from these risks, as shown by the data for the last /fi.ligave years. Considering the most signi/fi.ligacant events, de/fi.liganed as events with a gross impact of more than \u20ac10 million, the cumulative gross impact amounts to about \u20ac130 million, which represents less than 0.06% of the value of the Group's insured assets as at 2023 (about \u20ac220 billion).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Acute Events Risk Index (AERI)\n\nAs repo/r\\_t.ligaed in previous publications, the Group has developed a climate change index called Acute Events Risk Index (AERI) (35) to provide a high-level indication of changes in risk to renewable generation plants a/t\\_t.ligaributable to climate change for acute phenomena. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the results show the share of installed capacity that, based on climate projections (RCP 2.6), will be located in areas characterized by a risk class that will vary depending on the expected increase in the hazard a/t\\_t.ligaributable to climate change in the 2030-2050 period compared with the historical period.\n\nThe AERI considers the Group's hydroelectric, solar and wind plants (Enel Green Power and Enel X) and in 2023 it was updated to include COD 2022 plants. (36) The index uses climate metrics and the approach followed for the preliminary screening, which will also be described later, in order to identify assets that will be exposed to more intense climate change e/ff.ligaects. The objective of this evaluation is to de/fi.ligane the priorities for the detailed analyses necessary for the identi/fi.ligacation of adaptation actions. This o/ff.ligaers a summary representation of a screening pe/r\\_f.ligaormed for each plant and relevant physical phenomenon, against which priorities will be evaluated for more detailed analyses.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF GROUP CAPACITY (%) BY CLIMATE CHANGE RISK CATEGORY (RCP 2.6 SCENARIO)\n\nRisk class\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHigh\n\nMedium\n\nLow\n\nVery low\n\nAcute Events Risk Index (AERI) at Group level for the RCP 2.6 scenario\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the relevant physical phenomena are considered for each plant, with respect to which the level of future climate change is calculated and a risk class (high, medium, low, very low) is assigned to each asset using an appropriate weighting system. At this point it is possible to aggregate the results and arrive at the Group AERI value broken down by each risk category.\n\nAs shown in the /fi.ligagure below, in the RCP 2.6 scenario, just over 1% of the total analyzed capacity of the Enel Group is located in areas classi/fi.ligaed as at high risk from climate change: for these plants, a detailed analysis is a priority in order to identify possible adaptation measures. By comparison, about 11% will be located in medium-risk areas. This means that the asset situation must be analyzed on a rolling basis to evaluate whether to proceed with more in-depth analyses using higher resolution data in order to determine the need for adaptation with respect to speci/fi.ligac phenomena. Finally, the remaining installed capacity (88%) is associated with a low or very low risk: plants in these categories are not expected to be exposed to substantial climate change impacts in the RCP 2.6 scenario. For these, therefore, the criteria and actions already implemented remain adequate and any detailed studies will have a lower priority. The analyses will in any case be updated and re/fi.liganed on an ongoing basis to ensure monitoring of expected climate change e/ff.ligaects on all plants.",

The two main programs, in terms of coverage and volumes, are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the Prope/r\\_t.ligay Program ('Prope/r\\_t.ligay Damage and Business Interruption Insurance Program') for material damage to assets and the resulting business interruption. Accordingly, in addition to the costs of rebuilding assets (or pa/r\\_t.ligas thereof), the /fi.liganancial losses due to the stoppage of electricity generation and/or distribution are also covered, within the limits and conditions de/fi.liganed in the policies;\n- \u00b7 the Liability Program ('General & Environmental Liability Insurance Program'), which insures against losses caused to third pa/r\\_t.ligaies, including the impact that extreme events may have on the Group's assets and business.\n\nBased on e/ff.ligaective risk assessment, it is possible to specify appropriate limits and insurance conditions within the policies, and this also applies in the case of extreme natural events linked to climate change. In fact, in the la/t\\_t.ligaer case, the impacts on the business can be signi/fi.ligacant but, as has happened in the past in various locations around the world, the Group has demonstrated a high degree of resilience, thanks to the ample insurance coverage limits, thanks in pa/r\\_t.liga to the Group's solid reinsurance capabilities through the captive company.\n\nThe presence of this e/ff.ligaective insurance coverage does not make the actions that the Group takes in the preventive  maintenance  of  its  generation  and  distribution assets any less impo/r\\_t.ligaant. In fact, while on the one hand the e/ff.ligaects of these activities are immediately re/fl.ligaected in the mitigation of the impacts of extreme events, on the other hand they are a necessary prerequisite for optimizing risk /fi.liganancing and minimizing the cost of the Group's global insurance coverage programs, including the risk associated with catastrophic natural events. This adaptive strategy takes the form of management strategies and\n\nactions that go beyond insurance alone and change with the surrounding conditions. For example, the Group has managed to sterilize much of the strong upward trend in premiums on the insurance markets through changes to its risk retention policies for assets, as well as through internal risk transfer policies that reward the business lines that are most vi/r\\_t.ligauous in terms of risk mitigation. From this perspective, the method and the information extracted from the ex-post analysis of events play a crucial role in determining the processes and practices to be deployed in mitigating such events in the future.\n\n## Climate change adaptation in the Enel Group\n\nThe Group implements climate change adaptation solutions using an overall approach that, as described in the 'Climate  change  strategy'  section,  assesses  potential impacts in order to appropriately calibrate the necessary adaptation measures to enhance our ability to respond to adverse events (Response Management) and to enhance the resilience of the business (Resiliency Measures), thereby reducing the risk of future negative impacts of adverse events. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the skills and tools developed to analyze the e/ff.ligaects of climate change can be used to create value, for example through the conception of new business options that o/ff.ligaer solutions to facilitate the adaptation of communities and all stakeholders.\n\nThe adaptation solutions can involve both policy actions and best practices implemented in the sho/r\\_t.liga term, and long-term decisions.\n\nFor new investments, in line with the general approach, it is also possible to take early action in the design and construction phase to reduce the impact of climate risks 'by design', for example by taking account in the design stage of climate scenarios and asset vulnerability analyses for speci/fi.ligac phenomena in order to implement resilient solutions.\n\nThe following table provides a high-level summary of the type of actions that Enel implements to e/ff.ligaectively manage adverse events and to increase resilience to weather phenomena and their evolution under the impetus of climate change. In the following sections, ce/r\\_t.ligaain activities are described in greater detail.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Their implementation will require a cost-bene/fi.ligat analysis. Such structural adaptation interventions can, for example, involve the construction of hydraulic mitigation works (mainly embankments, riverbed repro/fi.ligaling, adaptation of drainage channels, expansion and lamination tanks) or raising of the components at risk with ea/r\\_t.ligah moving works or increasing the length of the suppo/r\\_t.liga structures in the case of photovoltaic panels.\n\n## Heat waves\n\n- \u00b7 The impact of heat waves on photovoltaic systems was studied in depth. This critical event is characterized by the persistence of high temperatures for multiple days with no rainfall.\n- \u00b7 Despite the increase in the frequency and intensity of this climate phenomenon, no signi/fi.ligacant impacts were registered on this asset, with just a reduction in the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of the inve/r\\_t.ligaer due to derating in ce/r\\_t.ligaain periods of the year in speci/fi.ligac locations.\n\n## Windstorms\n\n- \u00b7 With regard to windstorm risk, despite scenarios showing an increase in such events, the impact\n\n## Grid resilience lies at the hea/r\\_t.liga of Enel's strategy\n\nThe Enel Grids Business Line, following the Group policies mentioned above ('Climate change risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities'), has issued a speci/fi.ligac policy (Climate Change Risk Assessment) that provides general criteria, methodological tools and requirements for identifying, analyzing and assessing climate change risks in respect of the assets managed and the activities conducted, in order to monitor the risk and the actions to be implemented to mitigate its impacts.\n\nIn the Enel Grids Business Line the Enel Group has adopted an approach in recent years called '4R' to cope with extreme climate events. A speci/fi.ligac policy (which seeks to implement an innovative strategy to ensure the resilience of the distribution grid) has been developed to de/fi.ligane the measures to be taken both in preparation for an emergency within the network and for the prompt restoration of service once climate events have caused damage to assets and/or outages. The 4R strategy is divided into four phases:\n\n- analysis shows a high level of resilience by design, especially for the wind farms analyzed.\n- \u00b7 The implementation of any adaptation measures will require speci/fi.ligac site assessments based on a costbene/fi.ligat analysis, considering the limited impact of the phenomenon on Enel Green Power plants.\n\n## Wild/fi.ligares\n\n- \u00b7 With regard to /fi.ligare risk, the business line conducted a study to identify the areas at greatest risk. In order to prevent /fi.ligares outright and/or reduce response times, a number of possible adaptation measures were identi/fi.ligaed for adoption in the design or operational phase of plants. These include additional removal of vegetation around the project area, the creation of /fi.ligarebreaks, additional coordination with local authorities on how to respond in the event of a /fi.liga re.\n\nThe methodologies developed will be progressively re/fi.liganed with the aim of also applying them to the design and development of new Enel Green Power plants. The application of these assessments in the design stage will help fu/r\\_t.ligaher boost resilience, forecasting the risks and preserving the value of new projects.\n\nThese studies will make it possible to quantify the need for adaptation in terms of Risk Prevention (for example, the adoption of an adaptive design) and Event Management and management of residual risk.\n\n- 1. Risk prevention: this includes actions that make it possible to reduce the probability of losing network components because of an event and/or to minimize its e/ff.ligaects, i.e. interventions aimed both at increasing the robustness of the infrastructure and maintenance interventions. The choice of technical solutions to enhance resilience is guided by a catalogue that identi/fi.ligaes the most appropriate response for each climate event and geographical area.\n- 2. Readiness: this includes all measures aimed at increasing the speed with which a potentially critical event can be identi/fi.ligaed, ensuring coordination with Civil Protection authorities and local institutions and preparing the necessary resources once a grid disruption has occurred.\n- 3. Response: this represents the phase in which the operational capacity to cope with an emergency upon the occurrence of an extreme event is assessed. It is directly related to the ability to mobilize operational resources in the /fi.ligaeld and the capacity to remotely restore power supply through resilient backup systems.",

Pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly impo/r\\_t.ligaant in this regard are advance agreements for the mobilization of extraordinary resources to respond to emergencies, comprising both internal personnel and contractors. For example, in Italy, in addition to having installed and placed in operation three experimental stations to observe and investigate ice formation on MV lines, IoT sensor trials were launched to monitor on above-ground lines in areas that are highly exposed to snow and wind (Project Newman).\n\nEnel Grids is making a signi/fi.ligacant contribution to the drafting of the initial industry publications on the impo/r\\_t.ligaance of resilience and adaptation to climate change and possible actions, including the repo/r\\_t.liga issued by Eurelectric-EPRI (37)\n\nin December 2022 entitled 'The Coming Storm: building electricity resilience to extreme weather'.\n\nWith a view to ensuring continuous improvement, Enel Grids also pe/r\\_f.ligaorms scouting activities, directly contact-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing this approach, the business line has prepared various policies for speci/fi.ligac actions to address the various aspects and risks associated with climate change.

In this manner, actions are selected that, when implemented, will minimize the impact on the grid of pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly critical extreme events in a given area/region. The policy therefore covers the /fi.ligarst two phases of the 4R approach, suggesting measures regarding risk prevention and readiness.\n\nIn Italy, this policy has been translated into the Resilience Plan that e-distribuzione has prepared each year since 2017, which represents an addendum to the Development Plan for ad hoc investments over a 3-year time horizon to reduce the impact of extreme events in ce/r\\_t.ligaain critical areas, namely heat waves, icing and windstorms (with the associated risk of falling trees). In 2017-2021, some \u20ac672 million were invested and about \u20ac262 million will be invested in the following three-year period, as speci/fi.ligaed in the addendum to the 2022-2024 Plan. To address these risks, investments include the targeted replacement of uninsulated lines with insulated conductors, the undergrounding of cables in some cases or solutions involving routes to restore power that are not vulnerable to the above phenomena.\n\nAs in Italy, similar issues are being explored in other countries, both in Europe and South America, in order to prepare an ad ho c investment planning process to enhance the resilience of grids to extreme events, taking due account of the distinctive characteristics of each territory.",

During the year, the risks recorded by Enel were below the limits set for 2023, which were contained thanks to careful and timely management and mitigation measures, the geographical diversi/fi.ligacation of our business and supply channels in order to reduce dependence on Russian gas. Finally, the adoption of global and local strategies, such as /fl.ligaexibility in contractual clauses and proxy hedging techniques (in the event that hedging derivatives are not available on the market or are not su/ffi.ligaciently liquid), has made it possible to optimize results even in a highly dynamic market context.\n\nIn view of their geographical diversi/fi.ligacation, access to international markets for the issuance of debt instruments and transactions in commodities, Group companies are exposed to the risk that changes in exchange rates between the presentation currency and other currencies could generate unexpected changes in the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and /fi.liganancial aggregates in their respective /fi.liganancial statements.\n\nGiven the current structure of Enel, the exposure to currency risk is mainly linked to the US dollar and is a/t\\_t.ligaributable to:\n\n- \u00b7 cash /fl.ligaows in respect of the purchase or sale of fuel or electricity;\n- \u00b7 cash /fl.ligaows in respect of investments, dividends from foreign subsidiaries or the purchase or sale of equity investments;\n- \u00b7 cash /fl.ligaows connected with commercial relationships;\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe possible impacts of exchange rate risk are re/fl.ligaected in:\n\n- \u00b7 costs and revenue denominated in foreign currencies with respect to the time at which pricing conditions were de/fi.liganed or the investment decision was made (economic risk);\n- \u00b7 revaluations or adjustments to fair value of /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities sensitive to exchange rates (transaction risk);\n- \u00b7 the consolidation of subsidiaries with di/ff.ligaerent currencies of account (translation risk).\n\nThe currency risk management policy is based on systematically hedging the exposures of the Group companies, with the exception of translation risk.\n\nAppropriate operational processes ensure the de/fi.liganition and implementation of appropriate hedging strategies, which typically employ /fi.liganancial derivatives obtained on OTC markets.\n\nRisk control through speci/fi.ligac processes and indicators enables us to limit possible adverse /fi.liganancial impacts and, at the same time, to optimize the management of cash /fl.ligaows on the managed po/r\\_t.ligafolios.

At the same time, this approach preserves the necessary /fl.ligaexibility to optimize po/r\\_t.ligafolio management.\n\nIn addition, the Group unde/r\\_t.ligaakes transactions to factor receivables without recourse, which results in the complete derecognition of the corresponding assets involved in the factoring.\n\nFinally, with regard to /fi.liganancial and commodity transactions, risk mitigation is pursued through the diversi/fi.ligacation of the po/r\\_t.ligafolio (giving preference to counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies with a high credit rating) and the adoption of speci/fi.ligac standardized contractual frameworks that contain risk mitigation clauses (e.g., ne/t\\_t.ligaing arrangements) and possibly the exchange of cash collateral.\n\nDuring the year, after a temporary deterioration in the collection status of ce/r\\_t.ligaain customer segments, the situation was restored to the conditions registered the previous year. The Group's po/r\\_t.ligafolio has so far demonstrated resilience to the macroeconomic context and current price scenario. This re/fl.ligaects the expansion of digital collection channels and a solid diversi/fi.ligacation of the customer base.\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group, while solvent, would not be able to discharge its obligations in a timely manner or would only be able to do so on unfavorable terms or in the presence of constraints on disinvestment from assets with consequent capital losses, owing to situations of tension or systemic crises (credit crunches, sovereign debt crises, etc.) or changes in the perception of Group riskiness by the market.\n\nEnel's liquidity risk management policy is designed to maintain su/ffi.ligacient liquidity to meet expected commitments over a given time horizon without reso/r\\_t.ligaing to additional sources of /fi.liganancing, also retaining a prudential liquidity reserve, su/ffi.ligacient to meet any unexpected commitments. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in order to meet its medium- and long-term commitments, Enel pursues a borrowing strategy that provides for a diversi/fi.ligaed structure of funding sources, which it uses to meet its /fi.liganancial needs, and a balanced maturity pro/fi.ligale.\n\nAmong the factors that de/fi.ligane the risk perceived by the market, the credit rating assigned to Enel by rating agencies plays a decisive role, since it in/fl.ligauences its ability to access sources of /fi.liganancing and the related /fi.liganancial terms of that /fi.liganancing. A deterioration in the credit rating could therefore restrict access to the capital market and/or increase the cost of funding, with consequent negative e/ff.ligaects on the /fi.liganancial position, /fi.liganancial pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and cash /fl.ligaows of the Group.\n\nIn 2023, Enel's risk pro/fi.ligale changed compared with December 2022 for Standard & Poor's, whose rating went from 'BBB+' with a stable outlook to 'BBB' with a stable outlook, and for Moody's, whose rating went from 'Baa1' with a stable outlook to 'Baa1' with a negative outlook. Fitch maintained its rating at 'BBB+' with a stable outlook.\n\nIn order to manage liquidity e/ffi.ligaciently, treasury activities have largely been centralized at the holding company level, meeting liquidity requirements primarily by drawing on the cash generated by ordinary operations and managing any cash surpluses appropriately.\n\nWith regard to the increase in gas prices in 2022 following the Russia-Ukraine con/fl.ligaict and the associated sanctions imposed by the European Union on Russia, which had a major impact on the margins on commodity derivatives, in 2023, liquidity used for margin requirements decreased considerably despite the continuation of the war and the sanctions. At the end of the year, the liquidity risk index monitored for the Group was well within the limits set for 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cyber-a/t\\_t.ligaacks have evolved dramatically in recent years: their number has grown exponentially, as has their complexity and impact. In the case of the Enel Group, this exposure re/fl.ligaects the many environments in which it operates (data, industry and people), a circumstance that accompanies the intrinsic complexity and interconnection of the digital resources that over the years have been increasingly integrated into the Group's daily operating processes. In this context, it is clear that cyber risk must be managed promptly and in an integrated manner. In sho/r\\_t.liga, technological transformation could not exist without paying great a/t\\_t.ligaention to cyber security.\n\nTo manage cyber risk, the Group has developed a Cyber Security operating model and a related framework of processes. Speci/fi.ligacally, the operating model de/fi.liganes roles and responsibilities for the implementation of the framework processes, establishing an ad hoc unit headed by the CISO (Chief Information Security O/ffi.ligacer) and integrated into the Group's business areas. In addition, the Group has designed and adopted a framework of holistic processes to manage cyber-security issues that is applied to all the sectors of IT (Information Technology), OT (Operational Technology) and IoT (Internet of Things). The framework sets out a governance model based on the commitment of top management, on global strategic management, on the involvement of all business areas as well as of the units involved in the implementation of our IT, OT and IoT systems, constituting a solid foundation for the full merger of technologies, processes and people. The framework is based on two essential pillars: a 'risk-based approach' and 'cyber security by design'. The former establishes that risk assessment is the prerequisite for strategic decisions and the development and safe maintenance of all assets within the organization; the la/t\\_t.ligaer ensures the adoption of cyber security principles from the beginning and throughout the entire life cycle of solutions, services and infrastructures in all areas, i.e. IT, OT and IoT. In applying the framework, a cyber risk management approach has been de/fi.liganed, applicable to all IT, OT and IoT environments. It comprises all the phases necessary to pe/r\\_f.ligaorm risk analysis and de/fi.ligane related mitigation plans, consistent with the established cyber-security objectives. To balance the advantages of using IT/OT/IoT systems against the risk that they may engender, well-informed risk-based decisions are essential.\n\nEnel has also created its own Cyber Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) in order to proactively respond to any IT security incidents.\n\nIn order to measure the possible /fi.liganancial impact of cyber risks and manage them more e/ff.ligaectively, Enel has developed a Cyber Value-at-Risk ('Cyber V@R Enel Group \u00a9 ') methodology, which is being evolved as a metric to calculate Value-at-Risk in various a/t\\_t.ligaack scenarios.\n\n## Cyber security\n\n<!-- image -->",

A consequence of this digital transformation is that the Group is increasingly exposed to risks related to the functioning of the IT systems, which are integrated across the Company with impacts on processes and operations, which could expose IT and OT systems to service interruptions or data losses.\n\nThese risks are managed using a series of internal measures developed by the Group to guide the digital transformation. It has set up an internal control system that introduces control points along the entire IT value chain, enabling us to prevent the emergence of risks engendered by such issues as the creation of services that do not meet business needs, the failure to adopt adequate security measures and service interruptions. The internal control system oversees both the activities pe/r\\_f.ligaormed in-house and those outsourced to external associates and service providers.

These risks may vary or even change depending on economic and social trends, as well as the introduction of digitalization into operational processes and activities. Another type of health and safety risk is connected with non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This can impact on health and safety and lead to administrative or judicial penalties, and thus produce /fi.liganancial and reputational impacts on the Enel Group.\n\nFor this reason, each Group business line had adopted its own Health and Safety Management System compli-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Health and safety\n- \u00b7 Environment\n- \u00b7 Procurement, logistics and supply chain\n- \u00b7 People and organization\n\nant with the international UNI ISO 45001 standard, which also considers the rigor employed in the selection and management of contractors and suppliers. The management system is based on the identi/fi.ligacation of threats, the qualitative and quantitative assessment of risks, including /fi.liganancial and reputational risks, the planning and implementation  of  prevention  and  protection  measures,  the veri/fi.ligacation of the e/ff.ligaectiveness of such measures and any corrective actions. These systems make it possible to ensure regulatory compliance, to verify the e/ff.ligaectiveness of processes and related remedial actions and, /fi.liganally, to ensure the dissemination of a 'risk-based' approach as well as a robust organizational and individual culture in health and safety issues. The key documentation of these systems is represented by the Group's Health and Safety Policy, developed in cooperation with the Board of Directors and signed by the CEO. It sets out the guiding principles, strategic objectives, approach and action lines and priorities for continuous improvement of workplace health and safety pe/r\\_f.ligaormance.\n\nFrom an operational standpoint, health and safety risks are assessed speci/fi.ligacally for each site or asset on the basis of\n\n<!-- image -->",

This assessment enables us to identify prevention and protection measures for safety in the workplace and to plan their implementation, improvement and control in order to verify their e/ff.ligaectiveness and e/ffi.ligaciency. At Group level, an analysis of events in the last three years shows that, in terms of probability of occurrence, mechanical incidents (falls, collisions, crushing and cuts) are the most common, while the most severe in terms of potential associated impact are electrical incidents, which may involve fatalities, life changing accidents or high-potential incidents, the la/t\\_t.ligaer of which di/ff.ligaer from fatal and life changing events only in their outcome for the worker but not their dynamics.\n\nEnel uses an inspection process to conduct the continuous monitoring of behavior and compliance with procedures and work methods in the /fi.ligaeld to ensure the effective management of risks to the workplace health and safety of both internal sta/ff.liga and external contractors. The process is managed both by internal sta/ff.liga and ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed third-pa/r\\_t.ligay companies and is designed to identify risk situations (non-compliance) and the related plans containing remedial actions, including training courses, coaching and dissemination of the safety culture.\n\nAs regards contractors speci/fi.ligacally, Enel's approach is to consider them as pa/r\\_t.liganers in embracing the key principles of health and safety for its workers, who are therefore considered on a par with internal employees in the application of these principles and in their a/t\\_t.ligaention to workplace health and safety issues. Therefore, safety is integrated into the procurement process, and contractor pe/r\\_f.ligaormance is monitored both in the preliminary phase, using the quali/fi.ligacation system, and in the contract execution phase, through numerous control processes and tools  such  as  the  Contractor  Assessment  (analyses  of\n\n## Environment\n\nOver the past few years, society has acquired a growing awareness of the risks deriving from development models that generate impacts on the environment and ecosystems, with a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular emphasis on global warming and ever-increasing  exploitation  and  degradation  of  water resources. These impacts have triggered increased concern for environmental quality and ecosystem health, with greater awareness of the associated risks.\n\nAn analysis of environmental risks connected with Enel's activities was conducted using an integrated and multifunctional approach, based on the results of the materiality analysis for impacts and dependencies. The assessment helped identify the main operational and /fi.liganancial risks associated with the environmental and social impacts of the\n\ncontractors in the quali/fi.ligacation phase or in cases where critical issues or low scores emerge in the evaluation of the indicators) or the Evaluation Groups (periodic interfunctional  meetings  conducted  across  all  global  business lines and geographical areas in order to evaluate the safety pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of suppliers and decide consequence management actions).\n\nIn addition to procedural and operational aspects, another impo/r\\_t.ligaant driver in the correct management of health and safety risks is linked to training, awareness and information activities. To encourage the growth of technical skills and a safety culture, suppo/r\\_t.ligaing change processes and responding in a timely manner to the needs that emerge from the business, the Enel Group has developed a structured training management process, which is designed to transform knowledge into skills and therefore into behavior.\n\nEnel also fosters the systematic dissemination of information and awareness among personnel through a variety of company channels, such as news on the intranet, information emails, newsle/t\\_t.ligaers and magazines.

Enel has also unde/r\\_t.ligaaken a multitude of actions to achieve challenging environmental improvement objectives, such as those regarding atmospheric emissions, waste production and water consumption, especially in areas with high water stress, and impacts on natural habitats and species. The impact on areas of high water stress is directly mitigated by Enel's development strategy, which is based on the growth of generation from renewable sources that are essentially not dependent on the availability of water for\n\ntheir operation, as well as the adoption of advanced solutions to reduce consumption in traditional thermal plants. As regards ecosystems, Enel adopts measures to protect and conserve biodiversity and natural habitats, following the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimize, restore and o/ff.ligaset) and monitoring the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the actions.

These principles have been incorporated into the organizational processes and controls that Enel has voluntarily decided to adopt in order to establish relationships of trust with all its stakeholders, as well as de/fi.ligane stable and constructive relationships that are not based exclusively on ensuring /fi.liganancial competitiveness but also take account of best practices in essential areas for the Group, such as the avoidance of child labor, occupational health and safety and environmental responsibility. Thanks to the greater interaction and integration with the outside world and with the di/ff.ligaerent pa/r\\_t.ligas of the corporate organization, the procurement process has assumed an increasingly central role in the creation of value.\n\nGlobal Procurement contributes to create a resilient and sustainable supply chain, calling on all of us to think from a circular economy perspective and fostering innovation, sharing the Group's values and objectives with suppliers who  thereby  become  enablers  of  the  achievement  of Enel's targets. More speci/fi.ligacally, tenders can incorporate incentives or mandatory requirements to produce vi/r\\_t.ligauous behavior on the pa/r\\_t.liga of our suppliers. These include: 1) incentives connected with the measurement and reduction of the carbon footprint of suppliers, which encourage them to unde/r\\_t.ligaake improvements; 2) incentives connected with social aspects, such as the training and employment of people belonging to local communities and ac-\n\ntions aimed at respecting gender diversity; 3) mandatory requirements  concerning  human  rights,  which  involves mapping the potential supply chain involved in the supply of strategic product categories.\n\nFrom the point of view of the procurement process, the various units adopt the tender mechanism, thus ensuring maximum competition and equal access oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities for all operators who are in possession of the technical, economic//fi.liganancial and environmental requirements, security, human, legal and ethical rights.

These reclassi/fi.ligaed schedules contain di/ff.ligaerent pe/r\\_f.ligaormance measures from those obtained directly from the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, in line with the ESMA Guidelines on Alternative Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Measures (ESMA/2015/1415) published on October 5, 2015. Management believes that these measures are useful in monitoring the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of the Group and representative of the /fi.liganancial pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and position of our business, ensuring greater comparability over time.\n\nWith regard to those measures, on April 29, 2021, CONSOB issued warning notice no. 5/2021, which gives force to the Guidelines issued on March 4, 2021, by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on disclosure requirements under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the Prospectus Regulation), which took e/ff.ligaect on May 5, 2021 and replace the references to the CESR Recommendations and those contained in Communication no.

        "page_content": "In 2023, total direct and indirect emissions (i.e. Scopes 1, 2 and 3) amounted to 94.3 MtCO 2eq , an all-time low, reversing the rising trend seen in 2021 and 2022 following the global energy crisis. More speci/fi.ligacally, total emissions decreased by 26.3% compared with 2022 (127.9 MtCO 2eq ). This was mainly due to an overall improvement in the main operational pe/r\\_f.ligaormance measures, which have helped to reduce direct and indirect emissions throughout the entire value chain, including a 38% reduction in thermal generation due to lower coal and CCGT generation in Italy and Iberia and the sale of thermal plants in Russia in 2022 and in Argentina in 2023, the 19% volume reduction in natural gas sold to end users, and the 24% reduction in the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to supply chain spending compared with 2022. In addition, the digitalization and automation of electricity grids have also helped to reduce grid losses and enable the development of renewables, thereby playing a key role in the Group's decarbonization e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas, as well as in the decarbonization of the energy systems in which the Group operates.\n\nScope 1 GHG emissions amounted to 34.51 MtCO 2eq in 2023, representing 36.6% of total GHG emissions, down 35% compared with the 53.07 MtCO 2eq of 2022. Of the total, 94.9% of these emissions are linked to the process of burning fuels for electricity generation, which has bene/fi.ligated from the reduction in thermal generation and the increase in generation from renewable sources.\n\nElectricity generated by Enel in 2023 from zero-emission sources amounted to 73.2% of total generation, increasing considerably from the 61.0% registered in 2022 due mainly to an increase in the contribution of hydroelectric and solar generation.\n\nOur constant commitment to improving air quality in the areas where Enel operates is underscored by the a/t\\_t.ligaention paid to reducing emissions of the main air pollutants associated with thermal generation, namely sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), and pa/r\\_t.ligaiculates.\n\nIn 2023, there was a decrease in NO x emissions compared with 2022, in both absolute and speci/fi.ligac terms, linked to the concomitant lower overall generation by gas and CCGT plants in Italy and Iberia and to the sale of plants in Argentina. SO 2 and pa/r\\_t.ligaiculate emissions, on the other hand, have increased compared with last year as a consequence of the increased coal generation in Latin America (Colombia), which is normally inactive, due to speci/fi.ligac generation needs resulting from intense drought associated with the e/ff.ligaects of El Ni\u00f1o, which caused a signi/fi.ligacant alteration of the balance of rainfall. More speci/fi.ligacally, speci/fi.ligac emissions of SO 2 were equal to 0.09 g/kWh eq (+28.6% compared with the 2022 value of 0.07 g/kWh eq ), with NO x at 0.26 g/kWh eq (-18.8% compared with the 2022 value of 0.32 g/kWh eq ) and pa/r\\_t.ligaiculates at 0.006 g/kWh eq (+20.0% compared with the 2022 value of 0.005 g/kWh eq ).\n\n## Protection and development of natural capital\n\nThe protection of natural capital and combating climate change are strategic factors that are integrated into planning and in business management and development, so as to promote the sustainable economic development of the communities in which the Group operates, and are deciding factors in consolidating the Enel's leadership in energy markets.\n\nAs an energy company, our operations depend on natural resources but, at the same time, have an impact on those\n\nresources. This is why Enel integrates assessments of risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities into Group governance and into our decision-making processes in line with international frameworks by se/t\\_t.ligaing speci/fi.ligac targets over time.\n\nThe decarbonization of our energy mix, along with our objectives to reduce our impact on nature, to reclaim habitats, and to share the bene/fi.ligats of ecosystem services with our communities, are cornerstones of Enel's sustainability strategy.",

In 2023, there was a signi/fi.ligacant reduction in total water withdrawals (-27.6% from 76 million cubic meters in 2022 to 55 million cubic meters in 2023) due to lower thermal generation in Italy, Iberia and Latin America and nuclear generation in Spain, which corresponds to a 13% reduction in total speci/fi.ligac withdrawals of fresh water\n\n## Enel's commitment to biodiversity\n\nEnel has extensive experience managing and preserving biodiversity in and around our production sites in an ever-increasing number of countries. In 2019, Enel adopted Group guidelines that establish the principles and procedures for managing our impact on biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES) throughout the entire life cycle of our plants, from development and operations to decommissioning.\n\nThe identi/fi.ligacation of potential impacts on biodiversity and nature is essential in order to de/fi.ligane the most e/ff.ligaective strategies to avoid, minimize, remedy or compensate for the associated e/ff.ligaects, through application of the Mitigation Hierarchy. In the same way, identifying all that depends\n\n(0.20 l/kWh eq in 2023 compared with 0.23 l/kWh eq in 2022). This decrease was also seen for withdrawals of fresh water in water-stressed areas, (38) from 12.4 x10 3 million liters in 2022 to 10.3 x10 3 million liters (-17%), although less severe than the reduction recorded in total withdrawals, with an increase in the relative percentage of water withdrawn from water-stressed areas out of the total (+20.7%, from 19.3% in 2022 to 23.3% in 2023).\n\nAbout  11.6%  of  total  electricity  generated  by  the  Enel Group used fresh water in water-stressed areas, deriving mainly from thermal and nuclear plants.\n\non biodiversity and natural capital enables us to identify the best strategies to reduce any consequent risks.\n\nIn 2023, we pursued 183 projects to safeguard species and natural habitats in and around operational plants, 57 of which were developed in pa/r\\_t.liganership with government, non-governmental organizations, and universities, for a total investment of \u20ac10.8 million. These projects were carried out throughout the world.\n\nAlso in 2023, we carried out a fu/r\\_t.ligaher 60 projects related to plants under construction, mainly in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Italy and Spain, aimed at protecting and monitoring the indigenous species a/ff.ligaected, for a total investment of over \u20ac9 million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Electricity - free market, which consists of:\n- -Integrated  energy  business:  including  electricity\n- business on the free market and generation from renewable and thermal sources;\n- -Enel X: including all services provided to customers;\n- -Mobility: encompassing the activities of innovation, development and commercialization of electric mobility solutions.\n- 2.

This factor was only pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by changes in consolidation scope between the two periods and by the reduction in the generation margin. With regard to generation, the increase in\n\nrenewable energy (+14.5 TWh), mainly from hydroelectric sources in Italy, Chile, Colombia and Spain, together with the di/ff.ligaerent sales price in trading activities, pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset the e/ff.ligaects of lower amounts of electricity generated from conventional sources and the recognition of regulatory measures related to the clawback in Italy in the amount of \u20ac357 million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These e/ff.ligaects are pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by favorable exchange rate developments (\u20ac42 million).\n\nEquity-accounted  investments increased  mainly  due  to the consolidation at equity of joint ventures in Greece and Australia following the pa/r\\_t.ligaial sale, with loss of control, of the related companies and the impairment loss on Slovak Power Holding. These impacts were pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by the e/ff.ligaects deriving from the sale of Rusenergosbyt.\n\nNet working capital increased, compared with December 31, 2022, by \u20ac243 million, mainly due to an increase in trade receivables and a decrease in trade payables. These impacts were pa/r\\_t.ligaly o/ff.ligaset by an increase in payables to institutional electricity market operators, mainly in Italy due to the gradual restoration, in 2023, of the charges related to the suppo/r\\_t.liga of renewable energy and cogeneration, and in Spain for other components payable to market operators.\n\nNet assets held for sale increased mainly as a result of the classi/fi.ligacation among the net assets held for the sale of generation and distribution companies in Peru, net of the divestments during the year. For a more detailed breakdown of the aggregate and related changes, please see note 36 of the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements.\n\nNet  capital  employed at  December  31,  2023  came  to \u20ac105,272 million (\u20ac102,743 million at December 31, 2022) and was covered by \u20ac45,109 million in equity a/t\\_t.ligaributable to owners of the Parent and non-controlling interests and \u20ac60,163 million in net /fi.liganancial debt.

These borrowings increased by \u20ac341 million compared with the previous year due mainly to the use of new /fi.liganancing that was only pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by repayments made during the period.

The new sustainability-linked bond issues, together with all the sustainable /fi.liganancing arranged in the last year, made it possible to reach a 64% ratio of sustainable sources of /fi.liganancing to the Group's total gross debt at the end of 2023, with a goal of reaching around 70% in 2026.\n\n## Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework\n\nIn 2020, Enel was the world's /fi.ligarst company to include a mechanism in its funding agreements that links the cost of /fi.liganancing to achieving one or more of the sustainability targets speci/fi.ligaed in the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework,  a  document  that  extends  the  sustainability-linked approach to all instruments of /fi.liganancial debt. The Sustainability-Linked  Financing  Framework  is  updated\n\nannually in line with the objectives de/fi.liganed in the Group's Strategic Plan.\n\nThe latest version published in January 2024 updated the Sustainability Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Targets (SPT) of the /fi.ligave key performance indicators (KPIs) included in the framework, which contribute to achievement of SDG 7 ('Clean and Accessible Energy') and SDG 13 ('Climate Action') and the European Environmental Objective of Climate Change Mitigation:\n\n- 1.

Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore,  the  Group  also  reduced  the  intensity  of Scope 1 GHG emissions related to power generation by\n\n(39) SPT with cumulative observation period of 2023-2025. (40) SPT with cumulative observation period of 2024-2026.\n\nover 30.6%, going from 229 gCO 2eq /kWh in 2022 to 160 gCO 2eq /kWh in 2023. This reduction re/fl.ligaected a 12.9% increase in consolidated renewables generation and a 37.5% reduction in consolidated thermal generation compared with 2022, a consequence of the Group's strategy to shift its generation mix towards renewables and to advance the decarbonization process.\n\nHowever, the war in Ukraine and the resulting restrictions on gas impo/r\\_t.ligas from Russia into the EU, which caused a decrease in gas supplies accompanied by a surge in wholesale electricity and gas prices, with serious e/ff.ligaects for  households  and  businesses,  prompted  EU  governments to implement a series of policy responses to mitigate the impact of rising costs and ensure the stability of the energy system.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Italian government responded with a national plan to contain natural gas consumption, including measures  to  maximize  thermal  generation  using  fuels other than gas. This was implemented with Decree Law 14/2022, which required the national transmission system operator (TSO) to develop a program to maximize electricity production from coal-/fi.ligared power plants until the end of September 2023. Consequently, the TSO identi/fi.ligaed Enel's coal plants as essential and required them to maximize such output.\n\nIn Spain, the government authorization for the closure of the As Pontes coal plant, requested by Enel's Endesa subsidiary in December 2019 for June 2021, was postponed to the end of 2023 as the plant was identi/fi.ligaed as essential by the transmission system operator.\n\nDue to the unprecedented crisis faced by the European energy system in 2022 and 2023, the Group's emissions reduction in 2023 was not su/ffi.ligacient to achieve the Scope 1 GHG emissions intensity target related to electricity generation set for 2023 as announced on the occasion of the Capital Markets Day held in November 2020 for the launch of the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan. As a result of the energy crisis, the intensity value was slightly higher than the target of 148 gCO 2eq /kWh. In the absence of these factors, Enel would have been able to reach an emissions intensity level well below the target of 148 gCO 2eq /kWh.\n\nAs a result, the Group's sustainability-linked instruments that set the Scope 1 emissions intensity target for electricity generation at 148 gCO 2eq /kWh for 2023 will be subject to an increase in the relative step-up, and Enel will comply with its obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the legal documentation of these sustainability-linked transactions.\n\nDespite these unprecedented circumstances, the Group's emissions intensity in 2023 remained aligned with the 1.5 \u00baC pathway: the sector's decarbonization approach envisaged by the SBTi initiative had established a maximum threshold of 246 gCO 2eq /kWh for 2023, well above Enel's actual pe/r\\_f.ligaormance.\n\nUltimately, Enel's commitment to decarbonization remains con/fi.ligarmed for both the sho/r\\_t.liga, medium and long term, as envisaged in the new 2024-2026 Strategic Plan, which establishes a new sho/r\\_t.liga-term target for 2026 of 125 gCO 2eq / kWh. This new target, which is incorporated in the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework as updated in January 2024 and linked to the /fi.ligarst issue of sustainability-linked bonds in 2024, con/fi.ligarms Enel's commitment to the energy transition and contributes to the environmental and /fi.liganancial sustainability of the Group's development strategy. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, we are still commi/t\\_t.ligaed to the 2030 target of\n\nan 80% reduction in the intensity of Scope 1 GHG emissions related to power generation compared with the 2017 baseline and the /fi.liganal 2040 target of a 100% reduction in these emissions without reso/r\\_t.liga to any type of o/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing or carbon removal mechanisms.\n\nIn 2023, the Group, acting through its /fi.liganancial subsidiary Enel Finance International NV (EFI), issued a bond in February on the European market in the amount of \u20ac1,500 million, combining, in the eight-year tranche, a KPI linked to the EU taxonomy with a KPI linked to the United Nations SDGs. The second tranche of the 20-year bond, on the other hand, was linked to two KPIs associated with the Group's focus on complete decarbonization through the reduction of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn November 2023, Enel SpA obtained a three-year sustainability-linked revolving credit facility wo/r\\_t.ligah \u20ac1,500 million and linked to SDG 13.\n\nIn  March  2023,  Enel  Finance  International  renewed  its \u20ac8,000 million commercial paper program, linking it to the KPI 'Intensity of Scope 1 GHG emissions related to power generation (gCO 2eq /kWh)' and the KPI 'Percentage of capital expenditure aligned with the EU taxonomy (%)'.\n\n## Enel's role in the Recovery Plan\n\nEnel acts as a strategic pa/r\\_t.liganer in the Recovery Plan with the aim of driving sustainable, rapid and e/ff.ligaective growth through the implementation of projects in line with the missions of the individual Recovery and Resilience Plans at the national level. In this regard, in 2023, the decrees relating to the projects Sma/r\\_t.liga Grids and Resilience in Italy were signed, for a total of \u20ac3,500 million. In addition to Recovery, the Enel Group has submi/t\\_t.ligaed project proposals for other oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities o/ff.ligaered at European level, such as the Innovation Fund where the grant agreement for the Catania Gigafactory was signed, the Impo/r\\_t.ligaant Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) where projects for the development of green hydrogen were presented, and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for the development of electric charging infrastructures.\n\n## International development /fi.liganance\n\nThe Group is leading an innovation process aimed at accelerating the mobilization of capital to suppo/r\\_t.liga sustainable growth through the use of sustainability-linked /fi.liganancial instruments.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, in 2023, the Group obtained incentivized loans for a total of \u20ac1,800 million, which include sustainability-linked mechanisms tied to SDG 13. The main operations include sustainability-linked /fi.liganancing for a total of $800 million by Enel Finance America and EKF (Danish expo/r\\_t.liga credit agency), which is the EKF's /fi.ligarst sustainability-linked /fi.liganancing agreement.",

The decrease in other revenue\n\nwas due to the recognition, in 2022, of the gains on the sale of the 1.1% investment in U/fi.liganet by Enel X International (\u20ac220 million) and on the sale of ce/r\\_t.ligaain assets by Enel Srl to Mooney (\u20ac67 million).

Total dividends distributed in 2023 amounted to \u20ac0.40 per share, more than 5% higher than the \u20ac0.38 per share distributed in 2022.\n\nOn January 24,  2024 an interim dividend of \u20ac0.215 per share was paid in respect of ordinary pro/fi.ligat for 2023, while the balance of the dividend is scheduled for payment on July 24, 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's innovation strategy exploits various tools that enable it to develop innovative and sustainable solutions, such as the online crowdsourcing platform openinnovability.com and a global network of Innovation Hubs and Labs, which forms the foundation of the collaboration model with sta/r\\_t.ligaups and SMEs. While the la/t\\_t.ligaer o/ff.ligaer innovative projects and new business models, Enel provides its expe/r\\_t.ligaise, facilities for the technical and /fi.liganancial validation of the proposed solutions in an industrial environment, and a global network of pa/r\\_t.liganers to suppo/r\\_t.liga their development and possible scale-up. The Innovation Hubs, located in the most relevant innovation ecosystems for the Group, such as Europe and the United States, manage relationships with all the players involved in their respective areas and constitute the main source of scouting for sta/r\\_t.ligaups and SMEs, responding to the innovation needs manifested by the business lines.\n\nCollaboration with external players is thus a key element of the Group's innovation strategy. In fact, the Company has active pa/r\\_t.liganership agreements which cover both the most strategic areas for the Group and those addressing major frontier issues (for example, the promotion of space applications in the energy sector, green hydrogen, and fou/r\\_t.ligah generation nuclear). Through co-development with suppliers, the Group also seeks to implement innovative solutions quickly and e/ff.ligaectively at the pre-commercial development level and leverages existing skills and the customization and transfer of solutions already adopted in other productive sectors.\n\nIn 2022, we voluntarily adopted the ISO 56002 standard\n\n## 113\n\nProofs of Concept launched to test innovative solutions in 2023\n\n46\n\nsolutions in scale-up phase in the business in 2023\n\nfor innovation management. The standard covers all aspects of innovation management, from the bi/r\\_t.ligah of an idea to its implementation on a global scale. During 2023, the UNI/PdR 155 practice 'Management of sustainable innovation - Guidelines for the management of sustainable innovation processes in companies through open innovation' was developed in collaboration with UNI. The practice was published on the UNI website in December 2023. The document, of a pre-regulatory nature, is intended to o/ff.ligaer practical suppo/r\\_t.liga for any organization that wants to pursue the organizational and production changes necessary to implement an e/ff.ligaective internal process of sustainable innovation management.\n\n2023 saw the continuation of the activities of the innovation communities, multidisciplinary working groups created to innovatively address the most relevant new-technology issues for the business in order to create value for the Group (energy storage, blockchain, drones, metaverse, robotics, sensors, 3D printing, quantum computing, wearables, additive manufacturing, a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence, materials and hydrogen). The communities also continuously monitor technological improvements and share new business models, value-added services or use cases for types of technology that could be potentially implemented in di/ff.ligaerent areas of the Enel Group.\n\nDuring 2023, 113 Proofs of Concepts were launched to test  new  solutions,  while  46  innovative  solutions  were identi/fi.ligaed by the business for large-scale implementation. Overall, \u20ac60 million (including personnel expenses) were invested in innovation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## The circular economy\n\nFor the Group, the circular economy is a strategic lever to suppo/r\\_t.liga our decarbonization roadmap. It involves a steady expansion of energy production from renewable sources and the consequent abandonment of fossil fuels, o/ff.ligaering a path towards a fair and inclusive transition. Achieving these objectives requires a profound transformation of the energy system and, at the same time, entails a different and growing need for raw materials and new approaches to managing assets, such as the distribution grid and generation plants.\n\nThe circular economy model adopted by the Group seeks to redesign the entire value chain of the goods used, not only to reduce consumption of raw materials but also to\n\nlimit the associated environmental, social, economic and geopolitical impacts and risks: in other words, to make the business model more sustainable and competitive. The Group's vision encompasses all the di/ff.ligaerent life phases of a product and is based on /fi.ligave pillars: circular inputs (inputs from renewables, recycling, reuse), extension of useful life (through modular design, facilitated repairability and maintenance predictive), product as a service (the Company provides the customer with a service and retains ownership of the product, maximizing its use factor and useful life), shared platforms (shared use of an asset among multiple users), new life cycles (recovery of the value of goods and materials, for example through reuse and recycling).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The Group's initiatives focus mainly on three of the /fi.ligave pillars, namely circular inputs, useful life extension and new life cycles.\n\nWith regard to circular inputs, during the tender phase suppliers of core components (43) are asked to specify the quantities of each material used in the production processes, indicating the share of recycled and recyclable material to suppo/r\\_t.liga assessments in the selection phase. One example of the reduction in the use of input resources is the 3SUN Gigafactory project in Catania, which is intended to ensure greater independence for the photovoltaic supply chain, not only by bringing the production of cells and panels onto European soil, but also by using innovation to reduce the intensity of silicon use and building a diversi/fi.ligaed and sustainable supply chain. In 2023 3SUN worked on the development of the new production site and, from 2024, a new type of high-e/ffi.ligaciency panel with HJT technology will optimize the quantity of silicon used, using layers of the material with a 15% smaller thickness.\n\nWith regard to extending useful life, in addition to using predictive repair and maintenance in the global management of power distribution and generation assets, the Group is also working on innovative solutions. For example, the Pioneer project in Italy involves Enel collaborating with ADR - Aeropo/r\\_t.ligai di Roma on the development of a storage system that reuses end-of-life ba/t\\_t.ligaeries from electric vehicles. During 2023, the detailed design of the plant was completed: with a storage capacity of 10 MWh, it involves the reuse of 786 second-life ba/t\\_t.ligaeries.\n\nWith regard to the new life cycle pillar, initiatives are also under way in all the countries in which the Group operates to ensure the systematic reuse, both internally and through sale, of obsolete or unused generation equipment that still retains a useful residual life, or the recycling of materials recovered from maintenance activities on the distribution grid. Speci/fi.ligacally, the Equipment New Life Program, which is active around the world for all generation technologies, seeks to give new life to components held in power plant inventories, to the equipment of decommissioned power plants and to plants undergoing repowering. In 2023, the project generated approximately \u20ac23 million in economic value, of which approximately \u20ac13.8 million in the form of costs avoided through the internal reuse of spare pa/r\\_t.ligas and equipment in all plants and \u20ac9.2 million from sales.\n\nIn order to identify areas requiring a/t\\_t.ligaention and related priorities concerning materials, and to consequently update the po/r\\_t.ligafolio of projects and initiatives, an internal working group has been operating since 2020 with the pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation of all the relevant areas of the Group. The working group's activities begin with a systematic analysis of raw material requirements for generation and distribution assets, solutions for customers and digital assets. Environmental, social, economic and geopolitical impacts and risks are then assessed, mainly with respect to the extraction and production phases of raw materials. Intervention priorities are then identi/fi.ligaed and a mitigation plan is developed, leveraging circular economy projects that reduce the consumption of raw materials, pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly critical materials.\n\n(43) The core categories are those strategic for the business, including wind turbines, inve/r\\_t.ligaers, sma/r\\_t.liga meters, photovoltaics, switches, panels, cables, transformers, charging stations, street lighting, sma/r\\_t.liga home solutions and storage systems.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For this reason, ongoing employee training and strategies of upskilling (training and empowerment programs to improve pe/r\\_f.ligaormance within a given role) and reskilling (learning new skills and capabilities that enable people to /fi.ligall new positions) are of increasing impo/r\\_t.ligaance. In 2023, in suppo/r\\_t.liga of these strategies, we provided a total of about 3.1 million hours of training, an average of about 48 hours per employee, exceeding the target of an av-\n\nerage of 45.5 hours per employee. Of these, 44.8% were dedicated to up/reskilling, an increase on the previous year (42% in 2022). Total training costs came to about \u20ac27 million in 2023.\n\nThis was made possible by the upgrading of digital tools and the E-Ducation platform, which gives broad access, including remotely, to training content concerning conduct, technical issues, safety and reskilling, working in cooperation with academic pa/r\\_t.liganers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The process is conducted on a half-yearly cycle and assesses 'Generosity', meaning a propensity for interacting with others; and 'Action', i.e. the ability to achieve professional objectives, as assessed by superiors.\n\nWith a view to fostering and developing the individual, 2023 say an increase in the use of tools such as job shadowing, mentoring and coaching.\n\n## Listening and enhancing wellness\n\nIn 2023, listening activities were carried out through the /fi.ligarst Global  Inclusive  Survey  exploring  people's  general perception of inclusion in the working environment at all organizational levels. 48% of eligible people responded (over 61,000). The /fi.ligandings of the survey underscore the good level of perceived general inclusion of people: the average respondent assessment of this aspect was equal to 4.5 out of 6, and 87% of people had either a positive or very positive evaluation.\n\nSince 2021, Enel has developed a global Well-being model using a co-creation approach based on eight pillars: emotional, physical, social, ethical, /fi.liganancial and cultural well-being, a sense of protection and work-life harmony. Following the analysis of the results of the Well-being & Motivation survey, which was launched in 2022 in order to gain an understanding of the evolution of organizational well-being and to re/fi.ligane initiatives designed to improve it, meetings were held to share the /fi.ligandings, using webinars coordinated by management in the various countries. At the global level, projects were developed in 2023 to enhance the well-being of people, teams and managers in the organization. The general well-being index measured by the survey in 2022 was 60% globally.

Together with other con/fi.ligarmed selection criteria for the identi/fi.ligacation of successors, gender criteria take account of the commitments made by the Enel Group regarding diversity and inclusion, fu/r\\_t.ligaher enhancing these aspects.\n\nSuccession  planning  has  also  been  extended  to  key non-management positions, involving new position holders (heads of organizational positions).

The program is associated with an incentive mechanism that rewards the vi/r\\_t.ligauous behavior of those who pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in the program every six months. During 2023, over 26,000 employees (43% of Enel's people) actively pa/r\\_t.ligaicipated, while over 4,000 rewards were distributed globally to people who used all the content of the program.\n\nThe pilot project 'Well-being leaders, Happy teams' tested a new intervention method to suppo/r\\_t.liga teams with lower perceived well-being, using the Well-being Index as the selection criterion. In addition, by listening to the managers of teams with a very high perceived well-being, the project identi/fi.ligaed distinctive characteristics and vi/r\\_t.ligauous behaviors to be disseminated within the Company in order to reinforce well-being-oriented leadership.\n\nTo facilitate the di/ff.ligausion of a culture of well-being and identify  situations  calling  for  improvement,  the  /fi.ligarst",

The approach to diversity and inclusion is based on the principles of non-discrimination, equal oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, personal dignity, inclusion regardless of any form of diversity, and work-life balance. This approach is embodied in a comprehensive set of actions that promote an a/t\\_t.ligaention to and expression of individuality, a culture of inclusiveness without prejudice, and a coherent mix of talents, qualities and experience, all of which creates value for our people and for our business, which is transitioning towards a decarbonized economy, acknowledged globally as a /fl.ligaywheel for guiding various forms of diversity towards the world of work.\n\nThe approach has been rati/fi.ligaed in our Cha/r\\_t.ligaer for the Individual, a protocol of intent that Enel signed on March 29, 2022, underscoring the impo/r\\_t.ligaance of personal well-being and integrity in an environment in which well-being, productivity, continuous learning and security can reinforce each other, contributing to the greatest ful/fi.ligallment of the person and the achievement of results.\n\nThe principles expressed in the Cha/r\\_t.ligaer for the Individual with regard to the pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation, well-being, inclusion and security of each worker inspired the renewal in 2023 of the Global Framework Agreement (GFA) - originally signed in 2013 - with the Italian industry federations and the global federations IndustriALL and Public Services International. Industrial relations are addressed at Group level in accordance with the model envisaged in the GFA, which is recognized as a reference best practice for European and non-European multinationals. The agreement is based on international principles for human rights and business and is inspired by the best and most advanced transnational industrial relations systems used in multinational groups and key institutions at the international level.\n\nThe milestones that have brought us to today began back in 2013 with publication of our Human Rights Policy (updat-\n\nable at the local level. Free or subsidized psychological suppo/r\\_t.liga services are available for more than 98% of Enel's people, while physical well-being services are available for over 90%. The CReW - Enel Cycle, Run & Walk Challenge project is also active globally: it promotes the physical well-being associated with sustainable mobility, involving over 3,500 Enel pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants in 2023.\n\ned in 2021). This was followed in 2015 by Enel's adoption of the seven Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs) promoted by the UN Global Compact and UN Women and the parallel publication of the Diversity and Inclusion Policy, which de/fi.liganes the principles of non-discrimination, equal oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, dignity, work-life balance, and inclusiveness regardless of any form of diversity. In 2019, our Workplace Harassment  Policy (44) introduced the issues of individual respect, integrity and dignity in the workplace into the prevention of all types of harassment. These principles were shared in 2020 in the Statement Against Harassment in the workplace. (45) We also created a Digital Accessibility section on the Enel intranet. It is designed to ensure equal oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities in access to digital systems and information.\n\nIn recent years, intensive awareness-raising e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas have enabled the dissemination and strengthening of a culture of inclusion at all levels and in all se/t\\_t.ligaings within the organization by way of communication campaigns and local and global events. The most impo/r\\_t.ligaant initiatives unde/r\\_t.ligaaken in 2023 include the expansion of local Employee Resources Groups, impo/r\\_t.ligaant networks and/or communities that fuel conversations within the Group on a variety of issues concerning inclusion and diversity and o/ff.ligaer an oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity to sharing views on female empowerment, parenting, caregiving,  disability,  intergenerational  and  intercultural relations and the LGBTQ+ community. The delivery of Beyond Bias training courses continued throughout the Group, enabling the identi/fi.ligacation of the main prejudices that may be encountered in the workplace. Adopting an ironic and surreal tone, the course suggests how to prevent these biases by o/ff.ligaering interesting food for thought. The  Workplace  Harassment  training  course  describes forms of harassment and discrimination related to age, disability, LGBTQ+ status and sexual orientation. To spread the principles of inclusive design, the training activity 'Accessibility and Design for all Awareness' was also o/ff.ligaered globally. It represents a design approach whose fundamental objective is the conception and creation of spaces, products and services that are themselves accessible to\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "all. The course aims to raise awareness and train people in an increasingly inclusive culture, spreading awareness of the application Design for All principles.\n\nPromoting a culture of inclusiveness at Enel also involves target se/t\\_t.ligaing and measurement. It is an approach that is encapsulated in a comprehensive plan of actions measured using a broad set of KPIs for which commitments approved by the corporate bodies have been made. These commitments include: balancing the percentage of women in hiring processes; increasing the representation of women in senior and middle management and in succession plans; increasing the number of female students involved in awareness initiatives in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) /fi.ligaelds; promoting projects for the inclusion of employees with disabilities at all stages of the employee journey; and fostering the dissemination of a bias-free culture sensitive to intercultural diversity.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, our strategy for gender equality is organized into various lines of action. We are working to increase the presence of women in hiring processes, with a positive trend being registered in 2023 as well (52%), con/fi.ligarming the Group's commitment to achieving this goal. In terms of women in management positions, we have seen both the number and the percentage of female managers continue to climb, increasing by 1.3 percentage points in 2023 (from 24.9% in 2022 to 26.2% in 2023). The percentage of women middle managers also increased (from 32.6% in 2022 to 33.1% in 2023). Actions to value the contribution of women throughout the organization, and not just in senior positions, have also continued, and the effects of these e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas will be be/t\\_t.ligaer seen over the medium to long term, due in pa/r\\_t.liga to generational dynamics. Among the actions taken globally, the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance target for 'the percentage  of  women  in  top  management  succession plans at the end of 2025' has been con/fi.ligarmed in the 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan with a weighting of 10% of the total in order to strengthen and lend greater continuity to a policy to establish a suitable platform for management appointments into the coming years.\n\nOver the years, we have also increased our commitment to promote the presence of women in STEM training and careers in collaboration with schools and government, so as to overcome gender stereotypes and promote the impo/r\\_t.ligaance of STEM and its integration with the humanities.\n\nThese STEM awareness and orientation initiatives involved more  than  7,800  female  secondary-school  students  in 2023 and more than 37,000 female students over the last seven years. (46)\n\nOn the issue of disabilities, Enel provides equipment, services, working methods and other initiatives to create an inclusive climate for work and relationships for all that provides full autonomy at work regardless of the disability. Worldwide, we have more than 2,000 employees with disabilities. The issue is pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly relevant in Italy (with more than 1,500 employees with disabilities, more than 73% of the Group total).\n\nSince Enel's pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation in the global Valuable 500 initiative in 2019, initiatives involving disability issues have been grouped within the Value for Disability project, aimed at seizing potential business and promoting inclusion among employees and customers with disabilities by designing speci/fi.ligac global and local plans of action. The project has engendered widespread commitment to the issue and given rise to initiatives in all countries, with an impact on the inclusion of people with disabilities in relation to the di/ff.ligaerent aspects of their experience in the organization and on cultural change.\n\nEach country with at least one employee with a disability has a focal point for hearing and responding to speci/fi.ligac needs and designing dedicated actions, as provided for in the Diversity and Inclusion Policy.\n\nMany  countries  have  also  organized  initiatives  focused on intercultural and intergenerational issues and on the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nFinally, to promote parenthood and caring for all people who /fi.ligand themselves in circumstances that have an impact on work, the Parental Program suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the parenting experience has continued, as has the expansion of the MaCro@Work Caring Program for employees with chronic disorders and vulnerabilities in the various countries.\n\nThe table below shows Enel's commitment to diversity and inclusion, including the percentage of employees with disabilities, the number of women in senior and middle management, and the ratio of the average salaries of women to those of men.",

For this reason, we are commi/t\\_t.ligaed to developing processes and creating increasingly healthier and safer workspaces, both for employees and for anyone who works with Enel, promoting dedicated training courses in this arena.\n\nTo make this commitment clear and evident to all Group employees as well as external stakeholders, Enel has developed  and  disseminated  a  Health  and  Safety  Policy, which sets out the guiding principles, strategic objectives, approach and action guidelines for the continuous improvement of health and safety pe/r\\_f.ligaormance. The areas in which Enel is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to achieving its targets are also speci/fi.ligaed: /fi.ligarst and foremost, we /fi.ligand people, understood both as internal employees and contractors working with the Group, followed by processes and innovative technologies suppo/r\\_t.ligaing accident prevention. Consistent with the\n\nvalues expressed and assumed in the Health and Safety Policy, a Stop Work Policy has also been issued. It seeks to make Enel employees and contractor companies responsible for managing potential risk situations regarding health, safety and the environment. In fact, all workers can stop any activity deemed risky for health, safety and environmental protection, following a 'no blaming' approach. (47)\n\nEnel also promotes, implements and continuously updates its Health and Safety Management Systems, in compliance with the internal policies referred to earlier as well as with the international ISO 45001 standard. Enel SpA's Management System provides guidance and a uniform approach for all Group companies: the business lines and the countries then have the task of implementing that system at the local level, based on the speci/fi.ligac features of their regulatory and business environment, and verifying its correct implementation in the /fi.ligaeld.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reduction is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the employees of contractors (-32%), while there was a slight increase in events involving Enel personnel (+15%). The Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRI FR) followed the same trend, with a decrease of 16.4% (1.88 in 2023 compared with 2.25 in 2022), representing approximately 2 accident events\n\nper million hours worked. With regards to hours worked, there was a signi/fi.ligacant reduction during 2023 compared with the previous year (approximately -10%), mainly linked to the sale of a number of operations, such as Enel Goi\u00e1s in Brazil at the end of 2022. The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate with days lost (LTI FR) showed an increase of 22% compared with the previous year (0.61 in 2023 compared with 0.50 in 2022) among both Enel personnel and contractors.\n\nThis increase is mainly due to an increase in minor injuries associated with only minimal impacts on worker safety.

        "page_content": "fact, the sum of the most serious injuries, i.e. those with the greatest actual or potential impact such as fatal injuries, life changing injuries (those which produce permanent changes in the life of the injured person) and high-potential incidents (which di/ff.ligaer from the former only in the extent of the consequences for the worker but not in the dynamics of the event), was unchanged on 2022 (39 events) and 25% lower than the average for the three previous years. However, the distribution of injuries among the di/ff.ligaerent categories did change, as fatalities increased (11 in 2023 compared with 6 in 2022), while life changing injuries (1 in 2023 and 2 in 2022) and high-potential incidents (27 in 2023 and 31 in 2022) declined. Of the 11 fatal injuries in 2023, 9 were associated with electrical risk and 2 with mechanical risk. Three fatal injuries involved Enel personnel (2 employees of Enel Grids in Romania and 1 employee of Enel Grids in Argentina) and 8 contractor personnel (3 in Brazil, 2 in Italy and 1 in Spain who worked for Enel Grids, 1 in Brazil who worked for Enel Green Power Brazil and 1 in Brazil who worked for\n\nEnel Servizi).\n\nAs regards activities in 2023, Policy no. 106, which provides  guidelines  for  the  entire  Group  concerning  the communication, analysis and classi/fi.ligacation of accidents, was updated in order to strengthen the near miss and safety observation repo/r\\_t.ligaing process, (48) increase the attention paid to HiPo events and more e/ff.ligaectively trace the root causes of each event to ensure greater e/ff.ligaectiveness in action plans and improved health and safety pe/r\\_f.ligaormance.\n\nThe inspection process for verifying conduct and compliance with procedures and working methods in the /fi.ligaeld has also been revised in order to enhance e/ff.ligaectiveness. In  pa/r\\_t.ligaicular,  a  data-driven  approach  has  been  implemented, based on IT tools and analytical dashboards. It can use evidence from the monitoring and control system to enable evaluation of the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of organizational units and suppliers, the identi/fi.ligacation of areas at greatest risk of fatal and life changing accidents and subsequent management methods.\n\nIn 2023, there were 101 cases of Extra Checking on Site (ECoS) involving high-risk areas. This process consists in internal environment and safety assessments designed to verify the adequacy of the organization and processes in a speci/fi.ligac area of Group operations, identify any adverse issues and develop corrective actions. These checks are conducted by specialist HSEQ personnel from outside\n\nthe units being assessed, assisted by technicians specialized in the speci/fi.ligac business.\n\nAnother area of great a/t\\_t.ligaention for the entire Enel Group is the protection of health, a fundamental value for the care and development of our people, not only at work but also in daily life. For this reason, the Enel Group has adopted a structured health management system based on prevention and protection measures and is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to developing a corporate culture oriented towards the promotion of mental and physical health and organizational well-being and personal work-life balance: to this end Policy no. 179 'Health and Well-being' was updated at the end of July 2023.\n\nThe objective of safeguarding workplace safety and the mental and physical integrity of all the people of the Enel Group is the main driver of training, awareness and information activities. To foster the growth of technical skills and a safety culture, suppo/r\\_t.liga change processes and respond in a timely manner to the needs that emerge from the business, the Group has a structured training management process, designed to transform knowledge into skills and then into behaviors. Overall, in 2023, 1,452 hours of training were provided to Enel sta/ff.liga on workplace health and safety issues.\n\nThe Enel Group's approach to contractors is to consider each to be a pa/r\\_t.liganer with which we share our essential workplace safety and environmental protection rules. As such, safety is integrated into the tender process, and supplier pe/r\\_f.ligaormance is assessed both as pa/r\\_t.liga of the quali/fi.ligacation process and when executing the contract by way of numerous controls and other mechanisms, including: the Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Terms, the Supplier Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Management (SPM) process, the Contractor Assessment (CA) process and Evaluation Groups (EGs). (49) In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the supplier quali/fi.ligacation system provides for a speci/fi.ligac evaluation of H&S issues based on the level of H&S risk of the activities associated with the different product groups. As regards workplace and environmental safety checks of contractors, in 2023 we continued to pe/r\\_f.ligaorm CAs at their premises, their construction sites or remotely if an on-site visit was not possible. Speci/fi.ligacally, 1,215 CAs were pe/r\\_f.ligaormed across all business lines and countries in which Enel is present.\n\nEnel also recognizes technological innovation as a valid tool for improving health and safety processes.

        "page_content": "teria with which the development priorities of innovative projects are de/fi.liganed are based on a 'risk management' logic, seeking primarily to eliminate or reduce the probability of an event occurring depending on feasibility. An example is the Remote Trimming project, developed within\n\nEnel Grids, which consists in the use of a robot for pruning vegetation near electricity grids, allowing operators to interact with the device remotely, remaining outside the most dangerous areas and e/ff.ligaectively eliminating the risks.\n\n## Responsible relations with communities\n\nListening to the communities in the territories in which Enel operates and promoting inclusive economic and social development to ensure an energy transition that is as fair as possible represent a fundamental pillar of Enel's strategy both in the daily management of business operations and in the planning of new infrastructures. Establishing solid and long-lasting relationships with local communities is essential to guaranteeing the implementation of a sustainable business, while boosting its competitiveness and inclusiveness.\n\nAware that the Group's activities can have a direct and indirect in/fl.ligauence on the communities in which it operates, Enel has adopted a sustainable business approach along the entire value chain, integrating social as well as environmental sustainability criteria into the various processes from very earliest stages of development. This model is consistent with  the  main  international  standards  in  this  area  (such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises), which underpin Enel's commitment to human rights in business practices.\n\nThe Group's sustainable business approach is based on careful analysis of the contexts in which we operate. Thanks to proactive dialogue and community engagement initiatives, potential risks, impacts and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities are identi/fi.ligaed in order to implement prevention and mitigation interventions. This approach also includes the principle of 'Sustainability by design' to take account of the needs of local communities from the early stages of asset design. The approach also envisages emergency management plans\n\nwith sustainability actions to be implemented in response to sudden and unexpected events and serious damage, such as critical events impacting Group assets, projects or products as a result of natural disasters or social/community unrest.\n\nThis approach has prompted Enel to innovate both the way it manages the business and develops energy products and services. It also leverages the awareness that the activation of vi/r\\_t.ligauous ecosystems, such as pa/r\\_t.liganerships, represents an indispensable factor in facilitating and promoting the identi/fi.ligacation and implementation of innovative social solutions as pa/r\\_t.liga of the transition towards a decarbonized economy.\n\nIn 2023, Enel's contribution to the development and social and economic growth of the territories and communities with whom it operates translated into sustainability projects in the various countries in which it operates, involving over 3.9 million bene/fi.ligaciaries, in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), of which over 70% regard projects and initiatives associated with the three SDGs to which the Group has made a commitment (SDG 4, SDG 7, SDG 8).\n\nIn line with the SDGs, Enel makes an e/ff.ligaective contribution to the progress of local territories, creating value for both communities and our business through professional education and training projects and providing access to reliable and sustainable energy, both through rural and suburban electri/fi.ligacation initiatives and by promoting social inclusion for the most vulnerable categories of the population (from a physical, social and economic point of view).\n\nFor fu/r\\_t.ligaher information on the activities pe/r\\_f.ligaormed, please see the Group's 2023 Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.liga.\n\n## Sustainable supply chain\n\n|                                                                                                                               |     | 2023    | 2022    | Change   | Change   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|---------|---------|----------|----------|\n| Active suppliers                                                                                                              | no. | 14,001  | 20,434  | (6,433)  | -31.5%   |\n| Suppliers (FTE)                                                                                                               | no. | 150,820 | 172,854 | (22,034) | -12.7%   |\n| Quali/fi.ligaed suppliers assessed for ESG issues                                                                             | %   | 100     | 99      | 1,0      | 1.0%     |\n| Quali/fi.ligaed suppliers assessed for social issues (including human  rights and health and safety) for all goods categories | %   | 100     | 99      | 1,0      | 1.0%     |\n| Quali/fi.ligaed suppliers assessed for environmental issues for all goods  categories                                         | %   | 100     | 99      | 1,0      | 1.0%     |",

For this reason, the selection of pa/r\\_t.liganers and the execution of contracts undergo analysis and monitoring throughout the entire procurement process. This is pursued on the basis of clear guidelines, namely codes of conduct, including the Human Rights Policy, the Code of Ethics, the 'Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption' Plan and global compliance programs.\n\n## Speci/fi.ligacally:\n\n- \u00b7 Enel's global vendor quali/fi.ligacation system conducts an analysis of compliance with technical, /fi.liganancial, legal, environmental,  human  (including  health  and  safety), ethical rights and integrity requirements of the /fi.ligarms that intend to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in tenders. At December 31, 2023, quali/fi.ligaed suppliers totaled 19,692 (of which 100% assessed on the basis of ESG criteria) and of these 8,300 had an active contract during the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period;\n- \u00b7 the tendering and bargaining process adopts a structured process for de/fi.liganing 'sustainability requirements and rewarding factors (K)' which can be used by the various purchasing and monitoring units throughout the period of execution of the contract. The process involves the use of two 'libraries', which catalog all the sustainability requirements and Ks grouped into social, environmental and circularity ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacation macro-categories. At December 31, 2023, 66% of supply contracts provided for the submission of carbon footprint ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacations from the contracted vendors.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore,  speci/fi.ligac  contractual  clauses  have  been de/fi.liganed, which are included in all works, service and supply contracts and updated periodically to ensure alignment with international best practices. The General Terms of Contract establish that Enel's suppliers, in-\n\ncluding subcontractors, sub-suppliers, third pa/r\\_t.ligaies and in general the entire supply chain shall comply with current regulations on pay, contributions, insurance and taxation for all workers employed in any capacity in the execution of the contract. In addition, explicit reference is made to the principles referred to in the relevant ILO Conventions  and  provisions  of  law  concerning  child labor, female labor, equality of treatment, prohibition of discrimination, abuse and harassment; trade union freedom,  association  and  representation;  refusal  of forced labor; safety and environmental protection and sanitation conditions. In the event of con/fl.ligaict between regulatory sources, the more restrictive shall prevail.\n\nThe clauses (50) also provide that suppliers, subcontractors, sub-suppliers, third pa/r\\_t.ligaies and in general the entire supply chain shall unde/r\\_t.ligaake to prevent any and all forms of corruption.\n\nThe number of FTEs (51) working at Enel worksites at December 31, 2023 totaled 150,820;\n\n- \u00b7 analysis and monitoring are conducted throughout the entire  procurement  process,  making  use  of  speci/fi.ligac systems such as, during pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of the contract, the Supplier Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Management (SPM), whose objective within our collaboration with vendors is not only to unde/r\\_t.ligaake any corrective actions in the contract execution phase, but also to encourage a process of improvement using actions that reward the adoption of best practices. The process is based on an objective and systematic collection of data and information relating to the execution of the service covered by the contract. These data are used to produce speci/fi.ligac indicators, also called categories (e.g., Health, Safety and Environment, Human Rights & Correctness, and Quality and Punctuality).\n\nMeetings with suppliers continued in 2023 with a focus on decarbonization issues, circularity and human rights, with a view to jointly developing practices and common approaches and spur vendors to achieve the sustainability standards demanded by the international community.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, meetings were organized with the main suppliers in strategic product categories to provide them with  technical  information  on  the  new  tender  requirements  regarding  human  rights  and  other  contractual clauses.

        "page_content": "## Statement on the alignment of Enel's business to the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\n## Process for calculating the /fi.liganancial metrics\n\nThe Enel Group calculates the /fi.liganancial metrics associated with each economic activity (classi/fi.ligaed into the categories eligible aligned, eligible non-aligned, non-eligible) using a speci/fi.ligac process adopting the following criteria and considerations:\n\n- \u00b7 the three /fi.liganancial metrics required by the EU Taxonomy Regulation (turnover, capital expenditure - capex - and operating expenditure - opex) were calculated according to the eligibility analysis described in this 'European Union taxonomy' section;\n- \u00b7 although not expressly required, Enel also pe/r\\_f.ligaormed an assessment in terms of the ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat (EBITDA) believing that this metric represents the actual /fi.liganancial pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of integrated utilities such as Enel;\n- \u00b7 the /fi.liganancial information was gathered from the digital accounting system used by the Enel Group, or from the management systems in use by the Company's business lines. However, a number of derogations were adopted to provide a more detailed representation of the /fi.ligagures or to exclude speci/fi.ligac activities from the overall calculation of eligible alignment (such as non-aligned hydroelectric power generation or infrastructure considered  eligible  but  non-aligned  among  eligible  and aligned distribution network systems). For example, the following derogations were used:\n- -hydroelectric: eligible non-aligned  hydroelectric power  plants  were  excluded  by  considering  their output multiplied by the average turnover per unit in the years 2022 and 2023. This approach was also extended to capex, opex and EBITDA;\n- -infrastructure and networks: concerning capex, new connections  between  a  substation  or  grid  and  a power plant with a greenhouse gas intensity above the  threshold  of  100  gCO 2eq /kWh  were  excluded considering their capacity (in MW) multiplied by the average capex per unit (k\u20ac/MW) for the years 2022 and 2023. This approach was also extended to turnover based on the on the assets' lifespan;\n- \u00b7 aggregate /fi.liganancial data in the repo/r\\_t.liga refer to the 'sector' level and include items related to third pa/r\\_t.ligaies and inter sectorial exchanges;\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial metrics were represented by considering all electricity and gas sales as 'non-eligible';\n- \u00b7 revenue classi/fi.ligaed as eligible aligned also include intercompany revenue related to the sale of renewable electricity produced by the Group's generation companies and sold to the Group's retail companies for marketing to end customers, according to the Group's integrated position;\n- \u00b7 capex: this also includes increases in assets from leases (recognized pursuant to IFRS 16, paragraph 53, point (h)), as requested by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178;\n- \u00b7 absolute  turnover/capex/opex/ordinary  EBITDA  correspond  to  the  turnover/capex/opex/ordinary  EBITDA (measured in euros) of each speci/fi.ligac activity. The share of individual KPIs corresponds to each individual economic activity in the total turnover/capex/ordinary EBITDA of the Group (except for ordinary opex, as the total of which refers only to the type of costs required by the taxonomy);\n- \u00b7 no ordinary capex and opex /fi.ligagures that may correspond to adaptation solutions - in accordance with Article 11 (1)(a) of EU Taxonomy Regulation - in business activities that already contribute to climate mitigation have been allocated to climate adaptation objective, thus avoiding any potential double counting with the /fi.ligagures provided on climate mitigation objective. Furthermore, no revenue was considered eligible for climate adaptation objective as Enel does not provide adaptation solutions in accordance with A/r\\_t.ligaicle 11 (1)(b) of EU Taxonomy Regulation;\n- \u00b7 for those minor activities that are eligible for either the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem or the circular economy objective a rounded /fi.ligagure of '0' has been repo/r\\_t.ligaed due to its insigni/fi.ligacant weight out of overall /fi.liganancial /fi.ligagures.",

At the same time, there is a decrease in the ordinary EBITDA of the eligible non-aligned activities mainly due to the thermoelectric power generation business from combined cycles, which produced lower energy volumes in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nIn 2023, 33.8% of revenue are related to business activities aligned to the EU taxonomy, compared to 21.4% in 2022.\n\nRevenue decreased in absolute terms by \u20ac44.8 billion compared to 2022. The change is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the lower volumes of electricity produced, the lower quantities of energy sold in the wholesale and retail markets, as well as the decrease in average selling prices of commodities, thus impacting non-eligible and non-aligned activities.\n\nAt the same time, revenue related to the production of energy from renewable sources increased in 2023, resulting in an increase in absolute terms of revenue in aligned activities from \u20ac30.6 billion in 2022 to \u20ac33.1 billion in 2023.\n\nThese phenomena contributed to the increase in the percentage weight of revenue from EU taxonomy-aligned activities by 12% year-on-year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2023 the European institutions continued discussions over the various dossiers in the 'Fit for 55' package' and its adaptation to the changes introduced by REPowerEU.\n\n## Renewable energy and energy e/ffi.ligaciency\n\nIn October 2023 the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive was published in the O/ffi.ligacial Journal of the European Union . Member States have 18 months to transpose it into national law. The Directive raises the share of renewable energy in the European Union's overall energy consumption to 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative top-up to allow the target of 45% to be achieved. All Member States will have to contribute to achieving more ambitious  sector-speci/fi.ligac  targets  in  transpo/r\\_t.liga,  industry and buildings. Moreover, the Directive provides for an acceleration in permit procedures for renewable energy projects. Member States shall design renewables acceleration areas where renewable energy projects will undergo simpli/fi.ligaed and fast permit-granting processes. Renewable energy deployment will also be presumed to be of 'overriding public interest', which will limit the grounds of legal objections to new installations.\n\nEU institutions have also reached an agreement to raise to 11.7% the EU energy e/ffi.ligaciency target by 2030, from the initial 9% of the 'Fit for 55' package, including an increase in the Member State's annual energy saving obligation, which should gradually increase from 2024 to 2030. Moreover, in 2023 European institutions reached an agreement on the European Energy Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). The new provisions include signi/fi.ligacant innovations in reducing the use of fossil fuels in buildings, developing charging infrastructure for electric mobility, increasing the\n\nrate of renovation and e/ffi.ligaciency of the building stock, as well as integrating solar systems into buildings.\n\n## Mobility\n\nIn October 2023, the new Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) was published in the O/ffi.ligacial Journal of the European Union , establishing - for the /fi.ligarst time in the EU - mandatory targets for the development of charging infrastructure for light and heavy vehicles and for the infrastructure  to  supply  electricity  to  vessels  moored  in po/r\\_t.ligas in the di/ff.ligaerent Member States. Again in 2023, the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime Regulations, targeted at reducing greenhouse gas emissions for aviation and  maritime  transpo/r\\_t.liga,  se/t\\_t.ligaing  increasingly  stringent emission limits for ships and planes, and envisaging measures to promote renewable fuels, including hydrogen and renewable or low-carbon electricity, were published in the O/ffi.ligacial Journal of the European Union . At the end of 2023, the European Parliament and Council reached an agreement on a proposal for the revision of the Trans-European Transpo/r\\_t.liga Network (TEN-T) Regulation, which seeks to close regional, economic and social gaps through the development of interconnected air transpo/r\\_t.liga, roadway, railway and maritime network infrastructures, directly connected with the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), which de/fi.liganes projects of common interest (PCIs) eligible for CEF funding.\n\nThe revision of CO 2 standards for new cars and light commercial vehicles, published in the O/ffi.ligacial Journal of the European Union in the 1st Half of 2023, increase emission reduction targets for 2030 and requires that all new light vehicles sold from 2035 be zero-emission vehicles. In this respect, a fu/r\\_t.ligaher revision is expected, which should allow internal combustion vehicles powered only by synthetic fuels to be placed on the market even after 2035.",

The GBER de/fi.liganes speci/fi.ligac categories of State aid that, under ce/r\\_t.ligaain conditions, are compatible with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and exempts these categories from the obligation of prior noti/fi.ligacation to the Commission and its approval. Major changes were made to the sections relating to climate, environmental protection and energy, including an update of the noti/fi.ligacation thresholds, in response to the energy crisis. The revised GBER expands the scope for Member States to /fi.liganance di/ff.ligaerent types of green projects, such as those to reduce CO 2 emissions, sustainable mobility and charging infrastructure; the introduction of new green conditions that large energy-intensive businesses must meet to receive aid in the form of reduced tax rates or exemptions from payment of system charges; energy e/ffi.ligaciency and storage, including ba/t\\_t.ligaeries; sustainable hydrogen and renewable energy communities. Finally, the de/fi.liganition of energy infrastructure has been extended to hydrogen and CO 2 as long as it is accessible to third pa/r\\_t.ligaies. The scope has also been extended geographically to the entire territory and no longer just to areas receiving assistance.\n\nThe State aid COVID Temporary Framework (TF COVID) concerning solvency and investments for economic development for sustainable growth expired on December 31, 2023. That date marked the end of the phasing out period which sta/r\\_t.ligaed during 2022. We have worked within the Temporary Framework to disburse aid for national measures intended to boost employment even in disadvantaged areas.\n\nThe Temporary Crisis Framework (TCF) was most recently revised on March 9, 2023. The new framework was renamed Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF) in order to underline the nature of the revision, aimed at fostering suppo/r\\_t.liga measures in sectors which are key for the transition to a zero-emission economy, in line with the Green Deal Industrial Plan. The TCTF will also allow the disbursement of aid until December 31, 2025. In addition to direct aid to meet the additional costs associated with the rise in the price of gas and electricity, the system also\n\nprovides for schemes for accelerating the rollout of renewable energy and energy storage. More speci/fi.ligacally, the investment suppo/r\\_t.liga can cover up to 100% of total costs if it is granted through a tender procedure. This also includes aid  for  decarbonization  through  electri/fi.ligacation  and  the use of renewable and electrolytic hydrogen. The main new aspect regards investment suppo/r\\_t.liga for the mass manufacture of ba/t\\_t.ligaeries, solar panels, wind turbines, heat-pumps, electrolyzers and carbon capture usage and storage as well as for production of key components. Their amount varies according to the region in which the investment is to be made, ranging from 15% of costs and a maximum of \u20ac150 million per company in the richest regions, to 35% of costs and a maximum of \u20ac350 million per company in disadvantaged regions. The most relevant aspect of this type of aid is the so-called 'matching aid': an EU Member State could - under ce/r\\_t.ligaain conditions - match the suppo/r\\_t.liga offered to a company in a non-EU state.\n\nOn  November  20,  the  Commission  prolonged  by  six months, until June 30, 2024, a limited number of sections of the TCTF. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, it put o/ff.liga the phasing out of the provisions enabling Member States to grant limited amounts of aid (section 2.1) with an increase in aid ceilings to compensate for high energy prices (section 2.4) to cover the winter heating period. The other provisions of the TCTF, among which liquidity suppo/r\\_t.liga in the form of State guarantees or in the form of subsidized loans and measures aimed at suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the reduction of electricity consumption, were not a/ff.ligaected and expired on December 31, 2023. Sections aimed at accelerating the green transition and reducing dependence on fuels remain in force until December 31, 2025.\n\nMoreover, the European Commission extended until December 31, 2025 the possibility of granting State aid for rescuing and restructuring non-/fi.liganancial unde/r\\_t.ligaakings in di/ffi.ligaculty according to the related guidelines of 2014. The rest of the guidelines remain applicable without fu/r\\_t.ligaher changes and their extension is necessary to avoid a legal vacuum after December 31, 2023.\n\nOn June 2, 2023, the European Commission published a communication in the O/ffi.ligacial Journal of the European Union which establishes the rules for any changes to regional aid maps.

In return for meeting availability and market supply requirements, these plants receive speci/fi.ligac remuneration determined by the Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment (hereinafter 'ARERA' or the 'Authority').  The  obligations  and  speci/fi.ligac  remuneration  granted are determined each year on the basis of a procedure for identifying, for each plant, the speci/fi.ligac regulatory regime among those provided for in the rules governing essential plants, namely:\n\n- \u00b7 alternative contracts pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 65bis of Annex A to ARERA Resolution no. 111/2006, which provides for the payment of a /fi.ligaxed premium based on the power identi/fi.ligaed as essential for the management of the electricity system against the obligation to o/ff.ligaer that power on the ASM (Ancillary Services Market) within maximum/ minimum price limits for increasing/decreasing quantities and in the hours de/fi.liganed ex-ante by ARERA. The decision to opt for this contract is left to the operator in the phase preceding the publication of the list of essential systems and entails exclusion from the other regimes indicated below for the contracted capacity;\n- \u00b7 ordinary regime pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 64 of the aforementioned  Resolution,  which  establishes  requirements  to\n\nsupply the DAM (Day-Ahead Market) and the IM (Intraday Market) solely for quantities of power requested by Terna, against payment of the higher speci/fi.ligac variable costs of the units involved. Outside the hours and quantities speci/fi.ligaed by Terna, supply on the DAM and IM is free of constraints. Finally, all supply on the ASM is subject to an obligation to o/ff.ligaer quantities at the speci/fi.ligac variable cost calculated for the production unit;\n\n- \u00b7 the cost reimbursement regime pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 65 of the aforementioned Resolution, which, in return for meeting supply obligations for the entire power of the plant and at all hours of the year, provides for payment of /fi.ligaxed costs, including a return on invested capital and variable costs, net of revenue generated. Pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation in this regime is subject to an ARERA decision upon application of the operator. The reimbursement is se/t\\_t.ligaled by ARERA in the form of payments on account and payment of a /fi.liganal balance, based on requests submi/t\\_t.ligaed by the operator.\n\nWith Resolution no. 532/2022/R/eel ARERA set the invested capital remuneration rate for essential plants eligible for reimbursement of costs for 2023 at 11.9%.

The decree law also contains measures for the competent institutions to cooperate on issuing environmental waivers that may be necessary for the operation of plants whose output is to be maximized and ask ARERA to establish the supply rules for those plants and the reimbursement of costs incurred following the activation of the measure.\n\nWith its Guidelines of September 1, 2022, the MiTE (now MASE) asked Terna to draw up and implement a gas-alternative production maximization plan for the September 19, 2022 - March 31, 2023 period to enable a savings of 1.8 billion cubic meters of gas, minimizing recourse to environmental waivers.\n\nTerna has identi/fi.ligaed the plants that will take pa/r\\_t.liga and, on September  19,  launched  the  production  maximization plan. Enel's Sulcis, Fusina, Torrevaldaliga Nord, and Brindisi plants are included.\n\nWith  its  Resolution  no.  430/2022/R/eel,  ARERA  established that:\n\n- \u00b7 for plants that are already deemed essential plants eligible for the cost reimbursement scheme (Sulcis plant), the existing supply and production cost reimbursement rules will continue to apply;\n- \u00b7 for other plants, the operator is required to present bids relating to the maximization plan announced by Terna at the minimum technical price on the energy markets and at the recognized variable cost (RVC) for each unit of generation in the ASM. Terna pays to the operator any positive di/ff.ligaerence between the energy market price and the RVC; while Terna pays to operators whose bids are accepted for sale on the ASM the day-ahead market zonal prices, if higher than the RCV. If revenue is not su/ffi.ligacient to cover even the /fi.ligaxed costs incurred during the maximization period, the operator can request that ARERA reimburse these costs, exclud-\n\ng the remuneration and amo/r\\_t.ligaization of the capital invested in the plant prior to the sta/r\\_t.liga of the maximization procedure.\n\nWith its Guidelines of April 1, 2023, the MASE asked Terna to continue the maximization plan until September 30, 2023. Terna con/fi.ligarmed the inclusion of Enel plants and de/fi.liganed a production maximization plan for the May 15 September 30, 2023 period.\n\nWith its Resolution no. 258/2023/R/eel ARERA approved Enel Produzione's petition to review the criteria for determining the variable cost recognized that is applicable to the plants of Brindisi Sud, Fusina and Torrevaldaliga Nord. The updated parameters after the issue of the resolution will be used in the determination of income items for the entire period covered by the maximization plan, that is from September 19, 2022 until completion of the plan, on September 30, 2023.\n\n## Capacity remuneration mechanism\n\nOn June 28, 2019, the Minister for Economic Development issued a decree approving the de/fi.liganitive rules governing the capacity remuneration mechanism (the capacity market). On November 6 and November 28, 2019 two auctions were held with delivery in 2022 and 2023 respectively: Enel was awarded capacity for both years. A number of operators and a sectoral trade association contested the decree and the results of the two auctions before the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga.\n\nTwo operators also challenged the European Commission decision approving the Italian mechanism before the EU Cou/r\\_t.liga. In two decisions dated 7 September 2022, the European General Cou/r\\_t.liga dismissed the actions and the two applicant companies decided to not appeal the decisions before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice of the European Union, thereby concluding the disputes.\n\nThe disputes are, however, still pending before the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga, which had suspended its proceedings in April 2021 pending the rulings of the EU Cou/r\\_t.liga, having identi/fi.ligaed an issue for which a preliminary ruling was called for with respect to these proceedings.\n\nWith the Decree of the MiTE of October 28, 2021, the new capacity market regulation was approved. It will apply to auctions with delivery from 2024. In execution of the decree, Terna launched the auction procedures for 2024, which took place on February 21, 2022. Enel was awarded annual contracts for approximately 10.4 GW of existing capacity with delivery in 2024, and contracts for approximately 1.5 GW of new capacity with a duration of 15 years from 2024 to 2038. Pursuant to the decree, the results of the 2024 auction will be used as the basis for assessing whether to hold an auction for the 2025 delivery year. In December 2021, two operators /fi.ligaled two appeals with the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga against the MiTE Ministerial Decree of 28 October 2021, Terna's 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

The new methodology replaced the previous formulas, which provided for an indexation of the strike price on a monthly basis, and was con/fi.ligarmed by ARERA with Resolution no. 583/2023/R/eel for 2024. With a notice of September 18, 2023, Terna published the new version of the technical provisions for the functioning of the capacity market valid for 2023 and 2024, which establish a new method for verifying the energy availability requirements for the storage facilities pa/r\\_t.ligaicipating in the capacity market on the basis of which these systems are remunerated.\n\nOn December 20, 2023 Terna announced the sta/r\\_t.liga of the consultation on the updating of the capacity market regulations containing the new rules for the award of contracts through new auctions from 2025.\n\n## Renewable energy communities\n\nAt the end of November 2021, Legislative Decree 199/2021 implementing Directive 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources was published in the Gazze/t\\_t.ligaa U/ffi.ligaciale . The decree also contains provisions on self-consumption arrangements and renewable energy communities, which are already governed in Italy by the experimental regulations introduced with Law 8/2020 (ratifying Decree Law 162/2019, the 'Milleproroghe' omnibus extension act) and subsequent implementation measures (ARERA Resolution no. 318/2020/R/eel and Ministerial Decree of September 16, 2020 of the Ministry for Economic Development).\n\nIn December 2022, in implementation of Legislative Decree 199/2021, ARERA approved the Consolidated Distributed Self-Consumption Code (TIAD) which sets out the new regulatory framework for energy communities and self-consumption arrangements. In November 2023, the European Commission approved the draft decree proposed by the MASE, which de/fi.liganes new incentive mechanisms for these communities and arrangements. Following approval by the European Commission, on January 23, 2024 the MASE published the new decree, with full implementation commencing on January 24, 2024. The Decree of September 16, 2020 will be repealed sta/r\\_t.ligaing from the\n\nsixtieth day following the date of adoption of the operational rules, which will be determined by the ESO (Energy Services Operator).\n\n## Iberia\n\nRoyal Decree Law 6/2022 of March 29 adopting urgent measures as pa/r\\_t.liga of the Plan for the National Response to the economic and social consequences of the war in Ukraine, Royal Decree Law 11/2022 of June 25 adopting and extending ce/r\\_t.ligaain measures to respond to the economic and social consequences of the war in Ukraine, address situations of social and economic vulnerability and the economic and social recovery of the island of La Palma\n\nOn March 30, 2022, Royal Decree Law 6/2022 of March 29 was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal, approving ce/r\\_t.ligaain measures as pa/r\\_t.liga of the Plan for the National Response to the consequences of the war in Ukraine. The legislation contains various measures for the energy sector, some of which were extended until December 31, 2022 with Royal Decree Law 11/2022 of June 25 and until December 31, 2023 with Royal Decree Law 18/2022 of October 18 and Royal Decree Law 20/2022 of December 27. Some of the most signi/fi.ligacant measures were the following:\n\n- \u00b7 extension until December 31, 2022 of the payment obligation that Royal Decree Law 17/2021 of September 14 established for non-emi/t\\_t.ligaing generation plants in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the presumed higher revenue that those plants would have earned following the incorporation into wholesale electricity prices of the value of the price of natural gas. Power hedged with /fi.ligaxed-price forward contracts before March 31, 2022 will be exempt from the  application  of  the  mechanism.  Hedging  instruments with a duration equal to or greater than one year and a /fi.ligaxed price after March 31, 2022 will be excluded if the /fi.ligaxed price is equal to or less than \u20ac67/MWh. In the case of bilateral contracts between generators and retailers in the same business group, the hedge price will be the price that sellers pass on to /fi.liganal consumers and, in this case, the exempt /fi.ligaxed price will be determined by increasing the value by \u20ac67/MWh in the average marketing margin of the sector;\n- \u00b7 the reduction in the remuneration of generation from intramarginal plants was subsequently not extended, meaning  the  mechanism  expired  on  December  31, 2023.  Exceptionally,  within  two  months  of  the  entry into force of the royal decree law, a ministerial order will update the remuneration parameters for renewable sources, cogeneration and waste plants, taking account of forward prices for the 2nd Half of 2021 for market prices and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ).

It establishes a temporary mechanism for adjusting generation costs to reduce the wholesale price of electricity. The measure establishes a mechanism for adjusting the generation costs of marginal fossil fuel technologies, with the aim of obtaining an equivalent reduction in the clearing price of the wholesale market until May 31, 2023.\n\nUnder this mechanism, the adjustment is based on the di/ff.ligaerence between a benchmark price for the gas consumed by thermal generation plants (\u20ac40/MWh for six months, subsequently increasing by \u20ac5/MWh per month, up to \u20ac70/MWh) and the spot price of gas on the Spanish organized gas market (MIBGAS). This mechanism will be applicable to combined-cycle, coal and cogeneration plants not covered by any regulated remuneration framework. The amount of the adjustment will be distributed among the po/r\\_t.ligaion of Iberian demand that directly bene/fi.ligats, either because it buys energy at a price directly related to the wholesale market value or because it has signed or renewed a contract that already takes account of the\n\nbene/fi.ligacial  e/ff.ligaect  of  the  wholesale  pricing  mechanism. With regard to the la/t\\_t.ligaer aspect, the storage supply units, whether ba/t\\_t.ligaeries or pumping systems, as well as supply units for auxiliary generation services, are exempt from payment of the cost of the mechanism.\n\nThe entry into force of the mechanism was subject to the authorization  of  the  European  Commission,  which  was granted on June 8, 2022, following which the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO) approved order TED/517/2022 of June 8, which established June 14, 2022 as the sta/r\\_t.liga date for application of the mechanism (for the June 15 market day). In addition, this Royal Decree Law includes the following:\n\n- \u00b7 a mandate has been established to introduce a reference to forward market prices, incorporating a price component  based  on  a  basket  of  products  (annual, qua/r\\_t.ligaerly and monthly) and a daily and intraday market price component, so that the new voluntary price for small consumers (PVPC) energy costing formula can begin to be applied in early 2023. Therefore, the MITECO began hearings on the drafting of a royal decree to modify the PVPC energy costing formula to incorporate a forward basket of products in addition to the daily and intraday market price component. Moreover, the cost of funding the Bono Social by the operators of the reference market is incorporated in the PVPC. The draft royal decree also modi/fi.ligaes the scope of application of the PVPC, which would apply to residential customer and micro-enterprises with a contractual capacity of no more than 10 kW. Finally, changes were made to the rules for non-peninsular territories;\n- \u00b7 the regime for the installation of renewable, cogeneration and waste facilities has been modi/fi.ligaed to reintroduce the adjustment mechanism for deviations from the market price and to incorporate a basket of prices in the price forecast, which will include both the daily market and forward benchmarks (annual, qua/r\\_t.ligaerly and monthly), with di/ff.ligaerent weights.\n\n## Royal Decree Law 17/2022 of September 20 adopting urgent measures in the /fi.ligaeld of energy, in application of the remuneration system for cogeneration plants and temporarily reducing the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate applicable to intra-EU delivery, impo/r\\_t.liga and acquisition of ce/r\\_t.ligaain fuels\n\nOn September 21, 2022, Royal Decree Law 17/2022 of September 20 was published, containing several urgent measures in the energy /fi.ligaeld, some of which were subsequently extended by Royal Decree Law 20/2022 of December 27.

The royal decree law modi/fi.ligaes and completes, until the end of 2023, the evolution of the benchmark price for natural gas for the purpose of activating the mechanism, ranging between \u20ac45/MWh in January 2023to \u20ac65/MWh in December 2023.\n\nThe mechanism was not extended and expired on December 31, 2023.\n\n## Royal Decree Law 5/2023 of June 28, adopting and extending ce/r\\_t.ligaain measures to respond to the economic and social consequences of the war in Ukraine and to suppo/r\\_t.liga the reconstruction of the island of La Palma and other situations of vulnerability\n\nOn June 29, 2023, Royal Decree Law 5/2023 of June 28 was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal. Among other things, it includes a new package of measures to respond to the economic and social impact of the war in Ukraine on\n\nSpain, also with the extension of measures already adopted in the past. Its main features concerning energy are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the deadline for renewable projects with access permits from January 1, 2018 in the process of obtaining administrative authorization for construction has been extended by six months. In any case, the /fi.ligave-year term from the sta/r\\_t.liga of work for commissioning has been retained;\n- \u00b7 the price references for electricity and fuels to be used for calculating the remuneration for the operation of renewable energy, cogeneration and waste plants have been modi/fi.ligaed to use values more in line with current market levels. Order TED/741/2023 of June 30 updates remuneration parameters for 2023-2025, incorporating among other things the provisions of Royal Decree Law 5/2023 of June 28;\n- \u00b7 in line with European legislation, energy communities formed of members of the public are introduced as a new /fi.ligagure in the sector. Among other rights, such communities may own distribution networks and act as consumer representatives to engage in collective self-consumption activities;\n- \u00b7 all charging stations with a capacity exceeding 3 MW are declared to be public utility, with corresponding authorization from the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge. Accordingly, plants with an output of less than 3 MW are exempt from the requirement to obtain administrative authorization.\n\n## Royal Decree Law 8/2023 of December 27, adopting ce/r\\_t.ligaain measures to respond to the economic and social consequences of the war in Ukraine and the Middle East and to alleviate the impact of drought\n\nOn December 28, 2023, Royal Decree Law 8/2023 of December 27 was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal. It extends the energy protection measures implemented in response to the war in Ukraine, promotes renewable energy and contains measures to reduce the impact of drought. The key aspects concerning energy are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 VAT:  VAT  on  electricity  increases  from  5%  to  10% throughout 2024 (provided that the average daily market price of the previous month is above \u20ac45/MWh). For natural gas, VAT rises from 5% to 10% until March 31, 2024;\n- \u00b7 value of production tax (7%): 3.5% will be applied in the 1st Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2024, 5.25% in the 2nd Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2024 and 7% thereafter. The electricity system will be compensated for the decline in receipts within the limit of the amount necessary to achieve balance between revenue and expenditure in respect of those charges;\n- \u00b7 excise tax on electricity: this will rise from 0.5% to 2.5% in the 1st Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2020 and to 3.8% by the 2nd Quarter of 2020, before increasing to 5% thereafter;\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is possible to incorporate qualitative criteria into renewables auctions that recognize the social and environmental added value of European industry;\n- \u00b7 self-consumption: to ensure the clearance of surpluses by self-consumption plants, a reserve of 10% of the capacity of all nodes of the electricity transmission network has been reserved for access tenders;\n- \u00b7 network  capacity:  to  avoid  the  hoarding  of  network access permits for large-scale consumption, two measures have been introduced:\n- -guarantees  for  large-scale  consumption  projects that connect to \u226536 kV grids equal to \u20ac40/kW and \u20ac20/kW for storage in demand mode, in addition to the \u20ac40/kW required in generation mode.\n- The guarantees also apply to permits already granted, which have six months to present the guarantees to the competent body and another six months to send the accreditation receipt to the grid operator;\n- -automatic fo/r\\_f.ligaeiture of access and connection permits, with connection point in a \u226536 kV grid, if within 5 years of obtaining those permits an access contract is not signed for a contractual capacity in the P1 period equal to at least 50% of the access capacity granted in the permit;\n- \u00b7 demand tenders: the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge may organize demand tenders on transmission grid nodes where the total volume of new applications for demand access capacity is so great that it is impossible to satisfy them all;\n- \u00b7 hydroelectric storage: storage is included among the uses of water, ranking third in the established order of preference after the supply of civil use populations and agricultural use and ahead of electricity generation and other industrial uses. Pumping concessions are adapted to be considered hydraulic energy storage facilities and their repowering is encouraged.\n\n## Renewable energy auctions\n\nBased on the provisions of Order TED/1161/2020 of December 4, which sets out the rules for the /fi.ligarst auction held under the economic regime for renewable energy and sets the indicative timetable for 2020-2025, the Resolution of July 18, 2022, published on July 28, 2022, announced the third auction under the economic regime for renewable energy. A total of 380 MW was allocated for the\n\nauction, which was held on October 25, 2022. Similarly, the Resolution of August 2, 2022, published on August 5, 2022, announced a fou/r\\_t.ligah auction, with 3,300 MW allocated for award, which was held on November 22, 2022.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in 2022 various ministerial orders where approved, updating the remuneration of some of the compensation parameters of the structures, and work has begun on updating the parameters for the 6-month regulatory period beginning in 2023.\n\n## Tenders for access capacity at ce/r\\_t.ligaain nodes of the transmission grid\n\nOn June 10, 2022, the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge began preparation of a proposal for an Order for a tender for the access capacity at ce/r\\_t.ligaain nodes of the transmission network, in compliance with the provisions of Royal Decree 1183/2020 of December 29 concerning access and connection to the electricity transmission and distribution grids, for a total capacity of 5,844 MW.\n\nIn addition, on August 9, 2022, the Resolution of the Secretary of State for Energy of August 3, 2022 was published, containing the decision to hold another tender for access capacity at ce/r\\_t.ligaain nodes of the transmission grid.\n\n## Fuel Order for non-peninsular territories\n\nOn December 30, 2022, Order TED/1315/2022 was published, implementing Decision 1337/2021 of November 16, 2021 of the Spanish Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga, concerning the need to regulate auctions for the supply of fuel in the non-peninsular territories and other technical issues.\n\nThe Order sets out the procedure for conducting fuel auctions, which will be held every two years and will be for the product used in the plant (or the raw material in the case of gas from the Balearic Islands). The auctions will be reverse auctions based on sta/r\\_t.ligaing prices obtained by increasing the benchmark prices by 10% (3% in the case of natural gas), which will be those applied until the auctions are held or the auctions do not take place or are canceled. As from January 27, 2022, the benchmark price for natural gas will be the price on the Iberian Gas Market (MIBGAS), while for other fuels it is determined on the basis of a number of international indices, to which a premium is added, where appropriate. The Order also grants the logistics costs of delivering the product to the plant, which can be revised every three years.\n\nIn addition, the Order also provides for the use of natural gas in the Canary Islands and in Melilla, as well as LPG in the Canary Islands, together with other less polluting fuels. Following  the  publication  of  Order  TED/1315/2022,  on February 3, 2023 the resolution of January 24, 2023 of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mining was published. It establishes product prices and special taxes applicable to coal, fuel oil and diesel for the 2nd Half of 2021, to be applied in the se/t\\_t.ligalement of this period for gener-",

Consequently, the fuel prices were determined by applying the references referred to in the third transitional provision of Royal Decree 738/2015 of July 31, as the aforementioned Directorate  General  is  aware  of  the  fact  that  Decision 1337/2021 of November 16 of the Spanish Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga was declared contrary to the law and is not applicable to the determination of fuel prices.\n\n## Proposal for a resolution of the tender procedure for new investment and extension of the useful lives of existing units in nonpeninsular territories\n\nIn implementation of Royal Decree 738/2015 of July 31, the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge in January began hearings on the proposed resolution of the Secretariat of State for Energy calling the competitive procedure for the granting of favorable compatibility resolutions for the purposes of payment of the additional remuneration regime. The purpose of the procedure is to grant compatibility resolutions, among other things, for actions that enable coverage of additional electricity demand emerging from the coverage analyses conducted by the System Operator. On November 6, 2023 a new version of this proposed resolution was again opened to the public. It updates the power requirements with the latest information provided by the System Operator and introduces other elements, such as new criteria and scales for evaluating the applications submi/t\\_t.ligaed.\n\n## Regulatory amendments in non-peninsular territories\n\nRoyal Decree 446/2023 of June 13 amending the calculation method for determining the voluntary price for small consumers (PVPC), modi/fi.ligaed ce/r\\_t.ligaain regulatory aspects of generation in non-peninsular territories, including:\n\n- \u00b7 elimination of the adjustment factor for fuel bills e/ff.ligaective as of January 1, 2023;\n- \u00b7 introduction of a correlation factor in the calculation of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions allowances e/ff.ligaective as of July 1, 2023 to consider actual emissions of plants;\n- \u00b7 in view of the /fi.liganancial impact of the extraordinary measures taken to ensure security of supply, it grants compensation for the /fi.liganancial cost of the lag between the completion of se/t\\_t.ligalement of regulated electricity sector activities for the year in which the measures are approved and the date of approval of the /fi.liganal se/t\\_t.ligalement for that year, based on the one-year Euribor rate plus 50 basis points.\n\n## Approval of /fi.liganal generation costs for generation units in non-peninsular territories\n\nIn July 2023, the resolutions approving the de/fi.liganitive generation costs in non-peninsular territories for 2018 and 2019  were  published,  while  in  September  the  work  of\n\ndrafting an equivalent proposed resolution for 2020 was begun.\n\n## Rest of the World\n\n## Latin America\n\n## Chile\n\nRate revision - Introduction of temporary electricity price stabilization mechanisms\n\nOn November 2, 2019, Law 21.185 of the Ministry of Energy was published, introducing a temporary electricity price stabilization mechanism for customers subject to rate regulation. Consequently, the prices to be applied to regulated customers in the 2nd Half of 2019 were lowered to those applied in the 1st Half of 2019 (Decree 20T/2018) and were de/fi.liganed as 'stabilized prices for regulated customers' (PEC).\n\nBetween January 1, 2021 and the expiry of this mechanism, the prices to be applied will be those set every six months on the basis of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 158 of the Electricity Law and may not exceed the level of the PECs noted above adjusted for consumer price in/fl.ligaation.\n\nAny di/ff.ligaerences between the amount invoiced by applying the stabilization mechanism and the theoretical amount that could be invoiced considering the price that would have  been  applied  in  accordance  with  the  contractual terms and conditions agreed with the various electricity distribution companies will be accounted for as receivables for invoices to be issued to generation companies up to a maximum of $1,350 million until 2023. These differences will be recognized in US dollars and will not accrue interest until the end of 2025. Any imbalances in favor of the generation companies must be recovered no later than December 31, 2027. It should be noted that the fund limit was reached in January 2022.\n\nOn August 2, 2022, the Ministry of Energy published Law 21.472, which establishes a rate stabilization fund and a new mechanism for the temporary stabilization of electricity prices for customers subject to rate regulation. This law establishes a Transitional Customer Protection Mechanism (TCPM) which will stabilize energy prices, complementing that provided for by Law no. 21.185, for customers subject to regulation of prices supplied by concession holders of the public distribution service governed by the General Law of Electricity Services. The purpose of the TCPM will be to pay the di/ff.ligaerences that occur between the invoicing of distribution companies to end customers for the energy and power component, and the amount that corresponds to the payment of the supply of electricity to generation companies. The resources appropriated for the operation of the TCPM cannot exceed $1,800\n\n<!-- image -->",

In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, expected procedures are:\n\n- \u00b7 Dutch auctions for plants with a capacity of more than 1 MW;\n- \u00b7 registers for plants with a capacity of less than 1 MW. Unlike previous decrees, the Ministerial Decree of July 4, 2019 provides for a new method for suppo/r\\_t.ligaing renewable sources through two-way contracts for di/ff.ligaerences under which the successful tenderer returns any positive di/ff.ligaerences between the zonal price and the auction price. The successful tenderer for renewables capacity will bene/fi.ligat from the incentive mechanism for the entire useful life of the plant (20, 25 or 30 years, according to the technology).\n\nOn November 30, 2021, Legislative Decree 199 of November 8, 2021 transposing Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (the RED II Decree) was published in the Gazze/t\\_t.ligaa U/ffi.ligaciale . The decree provides that capacity not assigned in the auction procedures referred to in the Ministerial Decree of July 4, 2019 shall be put up for auction in subsequent procedures in 2022, until the publication of the new auction schedule for the next /fi.ligave years. Pending the new planning, an additional three auctions were called in 2023.\n\nIn addition, the measure con/fi.ligarmed the same Dutch auction mechanisms for plants with a capacity greater than 1 MW, providing for an exception for plants with a capacity greater than 10 MW, which will be able to use the mechanism even though they have not completed the authorization process.\n\nPlants with a capacity of less than 1 MW, on the other hand, will have direct access to incentives, with the exception of innovative technology plants, which will be able to access the subsidies through speci/fi.ligac tenders.\n\nThe incentive mechanisms are being updated by the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security (MASE) with a speci/fi.ligac implementing decree.\n\n## The clawback mechanism\n\nDecree Law 4 of January 27, 2022 (the Third Suppo/r\\_t.liga Decree), rati/fi.ligaed with Law 25 of March 28, 2022, introduced, for the period February 2022 - December 2022 a twoway refund mechanism for plants powered by renewable\n\nsources receiving incentives through the energy account and for all plants powered by renewable sources that are not receiving incentives and that entered service by January 2010. Producers must return the di/ff.ligaerence between the market price, or the contracted price for forward sales, and a reference price identi/fi.ligaed in the same decree for each market zone (an average of \u20ac60/MWh). Decree Law 115 of August 9, 2022 (the Second Aid Decree), rati/fi.ligaed with Law 142 of September 21, 2022, introduced a number of amendments to the Third Suppo/r\\_t.liga Decree by extending the period of application of the clawback mechanism until June 2023, specifying that, for ve/r\\_t.ligaically integrated groups, only contracts signed by group companies (including non-generators) with other natural or legal persons outside the group are eligible. The implementation procedures for this mechanism were speci/fi.ligaed by ARERA with Resolution no. 266/2022/R/eel (for the period February 1, 2022 - December 31, 2022) and with Resolution no. 143/2023/R/eel (for the period January 1, 2023 - June 30, 2023).\n\nFinally, the 2023 Budget Act (Law 197 of December 29, 2022), transposing Regulation (EU) 1854/2022, extended the reimbursement scheme to plants not covered by Decree Law 4 of January 27, 2022, establishing a cap of \u20ac180/ MWh.\n\nARERA Resolution no. 266/2022/R/eel, together with other technical standards with which the Energy Services Operator (ESO) required the generators concerned to repay the amounts due, was the subject of an appeal before the Lombardy Administrative Regional Cou/r\\_t.liga (TAR). The TAR granted  the  appeals  /fi.ligaled  by  several  operators,  voiding the resolution and the consequential measures. ARERA lodged a precautionary appeal of the voidance ruling before the Council of State, which met on March 21, 2023. On March 22, 2023, with precautionary orders no. 1124/2023, 1126/2023 and 1127/2023, the Council of State granted the precautionary petition /fi.ligaled by ARERA, se/t\\_t.ligaing a hearing for discussion on December 2023, which was subsequently postponed to another date to be determined. At  the  same  time,  another  operator  appealed  ARERA Resolution no. 266/2022/R/eel as well as the second resolution no.143/2023/R/eel. As pa/r\\_t.liga of this judgment, the Lombardy TAR referred the assessment of the compliance of the mechanism envisaged in the Third Suppo/r\\_t.liga Decree with respect the EU regulatory framework to the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice of the European Union, suspending the proceed-\n\ning until the Cou/r\\_t.liga's decision.",

The deadline for ce/r\\_t.ligaifying the Environmental Impact Statement and the prior administrative authorization expired in the 1st Half of 2023. Nationwide, more than 50 GW of power from wind and solar projects successfully achieved these two milestones.\n\nIn the case of Enel Green Power-Endesa, most of the power in the pipeline also achieved these requirements (more than 4 GW).\n\nAs in 2022, the achievement of these goals monopolizes a considerable po/r\\_t.ligaion of the activity of the central administration, of the Autonomous Communities and, obviously, of the promoters of renewable generation.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Spanish government published a resolution for the grant of aid, under competitive tendering, for the repowering of wind farms, as well as aid for the development of recycling facilities for decommissioned wind turbine components. Enel Green Power-Endesa has submi/t\\_t.ligaed applications for a grant of aid both for the repowering of wind farms and, together with its pa/r\\_t.liganers, for the recycling of wind turbine blades. In November 2023 the de/fi.liganitive allocation of aid for the repowering of wind projects with the funds of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan was published. Enel Green Power was awarded \u20ac17.6 million contributing to the repowering of six projects for a total of 100.3 MW.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Spanish government also published a call for tenders for hybrid storage projects. In case of award, applicants receive a grant to /fi.liganance investment in and development of the projects. Enel Green Power-Endesa submi/t\\_t.ligaed various projects and obtained grants in the amount of \u20ac9.2 million in December 2023.\n\nOn December 28, 2023, the Royal Decree Law 8/2023 was published. It includes various measures related to renewable generation. It does not extend the reduction in generation remuneration governed by Royal Decree Law 17/2021, due to an excess price of \u20ac67/MWh. The measure expired therefore on December 31, 2023. The period of application of the 'Iberian derogation', governed by Royal Decree Law 10/2022, was also not extended and therefore expired on December 31, 2023.\n\nFor generation projects with access and connection permits after December 31, 2017 and before this Royal Decree Law, the deadline for accreditation of the administrative construction permit has been moved from January 25, 2024 to July 25, 2024. Additionally, for those projects, an extension of the terms may be requested to obtain the de/fi.liganitive exploitation permit within a period of three months, up to a maximum of eight years (until July 25, 2028) indicating the half-year of commissioning. This enables the be/t\\_t.ligaer organization of projects to be carried out between 2024 and 2028.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the royal decree provides for measures to progressively restore the energy taxation in force before the sta/r\\_t.liga of the energy crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine.\n\n## Rest of the World\n\n## No/r\\_t.ligah America\n\n## United States\n\nForced labor in the solar supply chain\n\nIn  June  2021,  US  customs  authorities  responded  to  repo/r\\_t.ligas by  issuing  a  'Withhold  Release  Order'  (WRO)  on silicon-based  products  manufactured  by  the  company Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd (Hoshine) and its subsidiaries, since they have been accused of exploiting their workforce. The WRO restricts the impo/r\\_t.liga into the United States of polysilicon products made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd.\n\nThe e/ff.ligaect on the US solar industry was the halting of shipments of photovoltaic modules by US customs, resulting in a delay in the delivery of solar equipment to end users, including Enel.\n\nAll photovoltaic equipment manufacturers had to produce clear documentation of their supply chain to meet US customs requirements. The documentation had to prove the speci/fi.ligac origin of metallurgical grade silicon in impo/r\\_t.ligaed photovoltaic products and demonstrate the absence of any Hoshine product in any pa/r\\_t.liga of the mining or manufacturing process.\n\nEnel's Code of Ethics and corporate procedures do not permit the exploitation of workers by any Group supplier or subcontractor. Neve/r\\_t.ligaheless, Enel is strengthening its controls, reviewing its supply chain and monitoring the implementation of the WRO by customs o/ffi.ligacials.\n\nIn a separate but connected development, in December 2021, President Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). UFLPA requires US customs authorities to apply a presumption that goods 'mined, produced, or manufactured in whole or in pa/r\\_t.liga' in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are made with forced labor and, therefore, are prohibited from being impo/r\\_t.ligaed into the United States.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Implementation of the law will be guided by an administrative regulation process under way since February 2022,\n\nwhich is expected to be completed by June 2022.\n\nA key element of the UFLPA came into force on June 21, 2022: rebu/t\\_t.ligaable presumption. From now on, any impo/r\\_t.liga of goods mined, produced or manufactured in whole or in pa/r\\_t.liga in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR), or from entities identi/fi.ligaed in a new UFLPA entity list, will be assumed to have been made with forced labor and will be barred from entering the United States. To prevent US customs from blocking the delivery of goods, impo/r\\_t.ligaers will need to demonstrate whether the goods to be impo/r\\_t.ligaed (or their components) were extracted, produced or manufactured in the XUAR and/or whether the goods to be impo/r\\_t.ligaed were purchased from a supplier identi/fi.ligaed in the UFLPA entity list.\n\nUFLPA compliance by impo/r\\_t.ligaers should ensure compliance  with  the  current  Withhold  Release  Order  (WRO), which blocks the impo/r\\_t.liga of any solar equipment containing metallurgical grade silicon manufactured by Hoshine.\n\nThe private nature of the blockade imposed by US customs makes it di/ffi.ligacult to monitor the application of the UFLPA.\n\nImpo/r\\_t.ligaers with solar module  products  using  Chinese-sourced polysilicon continue to be detained due to di/ffi.ligaculties in providing complete traceability documentation. In December 2023, US customs apparently released detained  products  that  used  Chinese  polysilicon  not sourced from Xinjiang.\n\nSeparately, ROTH Capitol repo/r\\_t.ligaed that Astroenergy also obtained US customs clearance for products made from Chinese polysilicon (Ordos and Asia Silicon) that 'appear' to be made from Chinese qua/r\\_t.ligaz and MGS.\n\n## US duties on impo/r\\_t.ligaed solar equipment\n\nIn February 2022, the Biden administration announced its decision to extend the duties applicable to impo/r\\_t.ligaed solar panels. The decision extends the collection of duties for another four years, while adopting a very marginal annual tari/ff.liga reduction: the duty on impo/r\\_t.ligaed solar panels will de-\n\ncline by 0.25% each year. It is impo/r\\_t.ligaant to note that the Biden  administration's  decision  also  con/fi.ligarms  the  tari/ff.liga exemption for bifacial solar modules, which are the main type of solar panels used by Enel for its utility-scale projects in the United States. The Biden administration is currently carrying out an intermediate review of the duty. A /fi.liganal repo/r\\_t.liga is due to be sent to the President during 2024, after which the President could make changes to the duty or leave the corrective measures as they are.\n\nAlso in February 2022, California-based PV manufacturer Auxin Solar /fi.ligaled a petition for a circumvention enquiry with the US Depa/r\\_t.ligament of Commerce (DOC), asking the DOC to launch an investigation into whether crystalline silicon PV cells and modules (CSPV) from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia were 'circumventing' anti-dumping and countervailing duties. The DOC then launched an investigation and in August 2023 the DOC o/ffi.ligacially ended the 'Auxin' circumvention investigation, concluding that the AD/CVD applicable to Chinese solar cells and modules will be extended to cells and modules from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nPresident Biden issued an emergency declaration on June 6, 2022, giving the DOC the authority to waive the collection of AD/CVD duties and, above all, deposits for duties on CSPV cells and modules expo/r\\_t.ligaed from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia for 24 months, sta/r\\_t.ligaing from the date of the announcement. The DOC is making use of this new authority and has issued regulations to implement the 24-month emergency declaration, protecting a/ff.ligaected impo/r\\_t.ligas from Auxin-related duties until June 2024.\n\nThe US Depa/r\\_t.ligament of Commerce (DOC) also clari/fi.ligaed that impo/r\\_t.ligas of solar cells and modules form Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam will not be subject to suspension of se/t\\_t.ligalement or cash deposit requirements if accompanied by a ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacation that they are not circumventing AD/ CVD orders.\n\nUS duties on impo/r\\_t.ligaed Chinese products\n\nIn 2018, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) conducted a Section 301 investigation and found that China's acts, policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay and innovation were unreasonable and discriminatory.\n\nAs a result, it published /fi.ligave lists (List 1, 2, 3, 4A and 4B), each of which identi/fi.ligaes di/ff.ligaerent Chinese products subject to di/ff.ligaerent duties. To Enel, the list of greatest interest is that including Chinese components used for wind and solar projects and ba/t\\_t.ligaeries.\n\nIn September 2022, the USTR announced that it was seeking public comments regarding the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the Section 301 duties in order to understand the e/ff.ligaects of these on the economy and on US consumers in order to",

The new law also contains provisions to boost the expansion of the country's electricity grid and suppo/r\\_t.liga existing and new clean energy technologies. It also contains provisions to suppo/r\\_t.liga existing nuclear power plants and hydroelectric plants, clean up orphaned wells and abandoned mining lands and facilitate access to critical minerals needed for clean energy production. Of potential interest to Enel, the following programs were announced:\n\n- \u00b7 clean hydrogen: the Depa/r\\_t.ligament of Energy (DOE) has received $7 billion to develop between 6 and 10 'Clean Hydrogen  Hubs'  in  the  United  States.  Each  hub  will consist of a network of clean hydrogen producers, potential consumers and connecting infrastructure located in close proximity. The DOE received applications, which had to be completed and sent by April 2023, and selected seven regional programs in October 2023. Negotiations to /fi.liganalize proposals are under way;\n- \u00b7 the  National  Electric  Vehicle  Infrastructure  Formula Program (NEVI) has made $5 billion in funding available over /fi.ligave years and distributed across all 50 states. The plan aims to promote the development of ba/t\\_t.ligaery-powered cars, ensuring that motorists always have somewhere to charge their vehicles. The funding covers the cost of EV charging stations and the related infrastructure (including solar power and storage systems), as well as operation and maintenance costs for /fi.ligave years;\n- \u00b7 electric vehicle charging infrastructure: the US Depa/r\\_t.ligament of Energy (DOE) and the US Depa/r\\_t.ligament of Transpo/r\\_t.ligaation (DOT), acting through the Federal Highway Administration, have presented a plan to create a network of public electric vehicle chargers along interstate highways wo/r\\_t.ligah $5 billion. The money will be distributed over /fi.ligave years across all 50 states. The plan aims to promote the development of ba/t\\_t.ligaery-powered cars, ensuring that motorists always have somewhere to charge their vehicles. Separately, the DOT, acting through the Federal Transit Administration, has announced a plan to distribute $5.3 billion in grants to state and local transit agencies for the 'Low or No Emission Vehicle Program'. The 'Low or No Emission Vehicle Program' suppo/r\\_t.ligas transpo/r\\_t.liga agencies in purchasing or leasing low or no emission buses and other transpo/r\\_t.liga vehicles that use technologies such as electric ba/t\\_t.ligaeries;\n- \u00b7 strengthening the power grid and expanding transmission: this program of $2.5 billion in government subsidies over /fi.ligave years was introduced to strategically distribute publicly available EV charging infrastructure and other infrastructure to be located along alternative fuel corridors. At least 50% of this funding must be used for projects that expand access to EV recharging and alternative fuel infrastructures in rural areas, low- and moderate-income sections and communities with li/t\\_t.ligale private parking;\n- \u00b7 electric school buses: $5 billion over /fi.ligave years has been allocated to replace existing diesel-powered school buses with clean, zero-emission buses. Half of the funding will be spent on electric zero-emission buses, while the other half will be used on zero-emission buses powered with alternative fuels. Grants can cover up to 100% of the costs of replacing existing schools and installing charging and refueling stations. The IIJA will replace over 1,000  transpo/r\\_t.liga  vehicles,  including  buses,  with  clean electric vehicles, thanks to an additional appropriation for the US DOT of $5.75 billion over the next /fi.ligave years, 5% of which will be dedicated to training the transpo/r\\_t.ligaation labor force on maintaining and managing the /fl.ligaeets.\n\n## In/fl.ligaation Reduction Act of 2022\n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the In/fl.ligaation Reduction Act (IRA), which sets aside about $415 billion over the next 10 years in the form of grants, tax credits and investments  to  suppo/r\\_t.liga  new  clean  energy  technologies projects, renewable energy generation, the electri/fi.ligacation of transpo/r\\_t.liga systems and climate-sma/r\\_t.liga agriculture. It is expected that the measures will reduce carbon emissions by almost 40% in the United States by 2030 and will raise US GDP by 0.2% in 2031. The funding will be distributed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 energy  (to  extend,  and  in  some  cases  increase,  tax credits; $263 billion);\n- \u00b7 climate (to accelerate the reduction in emissions and suppo/r\\_t.liga low-income communities; $48 billion);\n- \u00b7 generation (to encourage the domestic production of solar panels, wind turbines and ba/t\\_t.ligaeries; $48 billion);\n- \u00b7 environment  (to  create  environmental  quality  incentives; $27 billion);\n- \u00b7 transpo/r\\_t.ligaation (through o/ff.ligaering tax credits to consumers; $24 billion);\n- \u00b7 water (through a drought-relief program; $5 billion).\n\nThe US Depa/r\\_t.ligament of Treasury is currently working on the guidance needed for a new set of tax credits. The various tax credits will be phased down sta/r\\_t.ligaing the la/t\\_t.ligaer of:\n\n- \u00b7 December 31, 2032; or\n- \u00b7 the year in which the US's greenhouse gas emissions from  electricity  generation  will  be  25%  below  2022 emission levels.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Depending on that status of the infrastructure to be built, tax credits may be available beyond 2032. The following are the IRA provisions that are of greatest interest to Enel.\n\nExtension and expansion of federal tax credits for clean energy: the IRA extends the production tax credit (PTC) ($26.5/MWh for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2021) and introduces a new technology-neutral clean electricity tax credit commencing in 2025. It also extends the investment tax credit (ITC) (30% for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2021) and launches a new technology-neutral clean electricity ITC beginning in 2025. Solar power developers may now request PTC instead of ITC. However, to be eligible for the full credit, projects must meet the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements for the entire period of construction (and perhaps also for some of the maintenance activities); project owners that fail to comply will have to pay a penalty or see their tax credit reduced to 20% ($5/ MWh PTC or 6% ITC). The IRA also adds stand-alone energy storage projects, in line with the conditions for solar power, and microgrid controllers, speci/fi.ligacally for systems of between 4 kW and 20 MW, to the technology eligible for ITC.\n\nThe IRA creates a bonus tax credit if domestic content requirements or energy community requirements are met. Another new bonus tax credit is available for solar and wind facilities (and connected storage systems) located in low-income communities.\n\nA new 10-year clean hydrogen PTC of $3 per kilogram is available for hydrogen produced after December 31, 2022. For a project to be eligible, construction must begin before January 1, 2033.\n\nExtension and expansion of federal tax credits and loans for electric vehicles: in order to encourage the electri/fi.ligacation of the transpo/r\\_t.ligaation sector, the IRA extends various tax credits for new and previously owned electric vehicles and commercial electric vehicles, including buses, and expands the tax credit to cover the purchase of EV charging equipment.\n\nThe IRA allocates $1 billion for replacing heavy-duty Class 6 and 7 commercial vehicles with zero-emission vehicles (for  example,  school  buses,  public  transpo/r\\_t.ligaation  bus, garbage trucks) and $3 billion for the US Postal Service to purchase new electric delivery vehicles and charging stations.\n\nNew advanced manufacturing production tax credits: the IRA creates a new PTC for the production of components for wind, solar and ba/t\\_t.ligaery projects, such as solar PV cells, PV wafers, PV modules, wind turbines, nacelles, inve/r\\_t.ligaers, ba/t\\_t.ligaery  cells  and  modules,  and  many  others.  Tax  credit amounts vary by component, production cost and ce/r\\_t.ligaain capacity factors. To be eligible, the component must be\n\nproduced by the taxpayer in the United States Credits are available on an annual basis for components sold beginning in 2023 until 2032 (gradually reduced sta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2030).\n\nNew  direct  payment  of  applicable  tax  credits  and  the transferability of some tax credits: the IRA creates the option for some sector operators to choose between direct pay or transferability of the tax credit, which means that we will see changes in the ways projects are developed and an expansion in the number of industries that develop projects. Enel is pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly interested in the direct pay option for new advanced PTC and for new clean hydrogen PTC.\n\nUS Depa/r\\_t.ligament of the Treasury solicits public input and /fi.liganalizes IRA tax credit guidelines\n\nThe US Depa/r\\_t.ligament of the Treasury spent much of 2023 issuing preliminary guidance and soliciting public input before issuing /fi.liganal guidance. Although preliminary guidelines have been published for most of the tax credits of pa/r\\_t.ligaicular interest to Enel to encourage investment, Enel is still awaiting the publication of /fi.liganal guidelines. The Depa/r\\_t.ligament of the Treasury does not expect to /fi.liganalize all tax credit guidance related to the In/fl.ligaation Reduction Act before 2024.\n\nDevelopment of renewable energy on federal/public lands\n\nThe Biden administration set the goal of authorizing 25 GW of renewable energy on public lands by 2025. In order to reach this goal, the administration has ordered federal agencies to accelerate reviews of clean energy projects for production on public lands by establishing /fi.ligave new renewable energy coordination o/ffi.ligaces and has cut rents and fees for solar and wind projects on public lands by more than 50%.\n\n## Climate information\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission is /fi.liganalizing the rules on what climate-related information registrants need to disclose in their /fi.ligalings and annual repo/r\\_t.ligas. Such information will include data on greenhouse gas emissions, ce/r\\_t.ligaain climate-related /fi.liganancial metrics, and material climate risk. The rules had been scheduled to be issued by the end of 2022, but the release date has been postponed several times.\n\n## Individual state policy actions\n\nTexas Governor Abbo/t\\_t.liga signs pro-fossil/anti-renewables legislation:  the  legislation  promotes  state-sponsored low-interest loans for 'dispatchable' generation, which is seen largely as a boon to the natural gas industry. The law also creates a new ancillary service that can only be satis/fi.ligaed by 'dispatchable' generation, the conditions of which will make it di/ffi.ligacult for energy storage to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate.

        "page_content": "new funding mechanism for dispatchable assets, capped at $1 billion per year (net), will require assets to demonstrate their availability to the market during times of grid stress. Interconnection charges will be awarded to the new generation that exceeds an average interconnection charge, determined by the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUCT). The basic interconnection cost thresholds adopted by the PUCT are acceptable according to the renewables industry. The allowance for renewable energy systems interconnecting to lines of 138 kV or less is $12 million; for systems interconnecting to lines greater than 138 kV, the allowance is $22,5 million.\n\nNew  resources  interconnecting  after  2027  will  have  to demonstrate that they are able to meet an average level of production per season, based on their activity class, both by having on-site resources and through power purchase agreements.  Ba/t\\_t.ligaeries  can  meet  this  requirement.  Many of these elements, including cost allocation, will be implemented by PUCT or the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).\n\nCalifornia appropriates signi/fi.ligacant funds for clean energy initiatives: at the end of 2022, California had an almost $100 billion budget surplus and so allocated signi/fi.ligacant funding for various programs, including clean energy. Among these, it allocated a $550 million lump sum to suppo/r\\_t.liga distributed backup electricity assets (DEBA) for zero or low-emission resources to suppo/r\\_t.liga the grid when necessary, and a onetime $200 million appropriation for demand-side grid suppo/r\\_t.liga (DSGS) to reduce the load on the grid during periods of extreme stress.\n\nIn 2023, California will have a budget de/fi.ligacit of $31.5 billion, but no reduction of funds has been approved in the year. Since the budget de/fi.ligacit is expected to be even higher in 2024, proposals to reduce funds to DEBA and to DSGS have been submi/t\\_t.ligaed.\n\nIllinois adopts renewable energy siting reform: in January 2023, the Illinois legislation shifted renewable energy location decisions away from local communities and adopted pro-renewable energy siting standards that apply throughout the state, which all communities must adopt when approving new projects. The legislation requires counties with an existing zoning ordinance that con/fl.ligaicts with provisions of the new law to amend their zoning ordinance to comply with state law by May 30, 2023. The new law speci/fi.ligaes setback requirements, restrictions on the height of the blade tips, acoustic limitations and other restrictions. Most importantly, the law requires the county to make a decision on a project within 30 days of the conclusion of the public hearing, to avoid years of project delay and millions of dollars in additional costs locally.\n\nMaryland approves major energy storage law: in April 2023, for the /fi.ligarst time in state history, the Maryland General As-\n\nsembly established a goal of 3,000 MW of energy storage and created the Maryland Energy Storage Program. The new law requires the Public Service Commission to establish a competitive procurement program by July 1, 2024. The program will include energy storage credits and market-based incentives. The law is expected to lead to $100 million in energy cost savings for Marylanders and help reduce energy sector emissions by 90%.\n\nMichigan adopts renewable energy siting reform and clean energy  legislation:  in  2023  the  Michigan  legislature  approved two impo/r\\_t.ligaant bills, signed by the governor. The /fi.ligarst bill established state siting standards for renewable energy and ba/t\\_t.ligaery energy storage that cannot be made more burdensome by local governments. Disputes between state law and local authorities will be resolved by the Public Service Commission. The second bill establishes a renewable energy standard for Michigan of 50% by 2030, 60% by 2035 and 100% of clean energy by 2040. This bill increases the cap for distributed generation and creates a mandate for 2,500 MW of ba/t\\_t.ligaery energy storage.\n\nIncrease utility ownership of generation: because the In/fl.ligaation Reduction Act allows utilities to claim tax credits at the time of production, rather than depreciate them over the life of a project, a number of utilities have proposed legislation to codify a preference for development of new renewable energy and energy storage projects by utilities. Nevada has passed legislation that will allow NVEnergy to build most new renewable energy and energy storage projects. Puget Sound Energy in the state of Washington has pushed for legislation requiring 50% of all new generation to be assigned to the utility. The bill failed to be approved this year. In its plans for electric resources, the Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) had decided that more than 60% of next generation projects would be owned by PSCo. The Colorado Public Service Commission reduced the utility's ownership of such projects to just over 50%.\n\n## Canada\n\nOn March 28, 2023, the Canadian government unveiled a budget that reinforces its ongoing commitment to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The budget contains a series of measures suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the development of  renewable  energy  plants,  clean  hydrogen  plants  and electric vehicle charging equipment and has replenished existing  funds  to  suppo/r\\_t.liga  investments.  The  budget  was passed on June 11, 2023.\n\nMain developments:\n\n- \u00b7 Clean Hydrogen Investment Tax Credit (Hydrogen Credit): 15-40%;\n- \u00b7 Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit (Cleantech ITC): 15%;\n- \u00b7 Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (Electricity Credit): 30%;\n\n<!-- image -->",

These job requirements fall into two categories:\n\n- \u00b7 prevailing wage requirement: requires workers to be paid at a level comparable to the relevant wage, with bene/fi.ligats and pension contributions;\n- \u00b7 apprenticeship  requirement:  requires  at  least  10%  of total working hours to be unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by registered apprentices.\n\nIn November 2023, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance presented a motion to introduce a bill entitled 'An act to implement ce/r\\_t.ligaain provisions of the fall economic statement' tabled in Parliament on November 21, 2023 and ce/r\\_t.ligaain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 28, 2023. With the presentation of the Ways and Means motion and the legislation to implement the fall economic statement (FES), Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit (Cleantech ITC) labor requirements are now in e/ff.ligaect. The Cleantech ITC is one of several amendments to the Income Tax Act (ITA) contained in the FES implementation act. The bill is currently at the reading and examination stage.\n\n## Developments in provincial policies\n\nIn May 2023, Albe/r\\_t.ligaa citizens re-elected the United Conservative Pa/r\\_t.ligay to form a governing majority. As Prime Minister Danielle Smith appoints ministers for relevant po/r\\_t.ligafolios, restructures senior depa/r\\_t.ligament o/ffi.ligacials and reprioritizes her government, the energy industry can expect a continuation of existing policies from the past four years. This includes the continuation of the regulation on technological innovation and the reduction of emissions, the carbon price for primary industry that allows the development of renewable energies, as well as the /fi.liganalization of the phasing out of coal-/fi.ligared power generation.\n\nOn August 2, 2023, Albe/r\\_t.ligaa's Minister of Energy has issued an order to the Albe/r\\_t.ligaa Utilities Commission (AUC or Commission) to block the processing of new permits for the construction of new utility-scale renewable energy generation facilities until the Commission, the Albe/r\\_t.ligaa Electric System Operator (AESO) and the Minister of Energy were able to determine whether the continued development of renewable resources in Albe/r\\_t.ligaa was increasing pressure on electricity rates and compromising the reliability.\n\nMeetings and requests for information took place over the remainder of 2023. The AESO is also reviewing its current market structure for possible changes. The Premier of Albe/r\\_t.ligaa, a conservative, oil-producing province, told the Prime Minister of Canada that Albe/r\\_t.ligaa will not seek to meet the\n\ncountry's clean energy or greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. Work on these issues will continue until 2024.\n\n## Africa, Asia and Oceania\n\n## India\n\nOn December 5, 2022, the Deviation Se/t\\_t.ligalement Mechanism and Related Ma/t\\_t.ligaers Regulation (2022 DSM Regulation) published by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and replacing the 2014 DSM Regulation entered into force.\n\nThe new regulation has a negative impact on Independent Power Producers (IPPs) with wind and solar plants. Basically, over-injection (i.e. injection into the grid in excess of the declared generation) will be compensated:\n\n- \u00b7 for PV/hybrid (wind + solar) plants, at the contractual rate for up to a 10% deviation and at 90% of the contractual rate for an over-injection of between 10% and 15%;\n- \u00b7 for wind plants, at the contractual rate for up to a 15% deviation and at 90% of the contractual rate from 15% to 20%.\n\nNo payment will be made for an over-injection of above 20%. Compared with the previous version, the regulation increases  the  remuneration  percentage,  and  increases the threshold over which no payment is made from 10% to 20%.\n\nTerms also change for under-injections (generation below scheduled levels), with a reduction of the deviation band from the planned amounts, with higher penalties compared with 2014, breaking down as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 for PV/hybrid (wind + solar) plants, with under-injections of up to 15%, the IPP will pay the buyer the contract rate with no fu/r\\_t.ligaher penalty. For under-injections from 10% to 15%, the sho/r\\_t.ligafall will be paid at 110% of the contract rate, while those above 15% will be paid at 150%;\n- \u00b7 for wind plants, for under-injections up to 15%, the IPP will pay the buyer the contract rate with no fu/r\\_t.ligaher penalty. For under-injections from 15% to 20%, the sho/r\\_t.ligafall will be paid at 110% of the contract rate, while those above 20% will be paid at 150%.\n\nThe new DSM Regulation has an impact on revenue due to (i) no payment of over-injections over a 15% deviation for PV/hybrid plants and over 20% for wind plants, (ii) the increase of deviation penalties in case of under-injections.\n\n## Morocco\n\nThe reform of Law 13.09, the key renewable energy law, approved in January 2023, permits entering into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with customers connected to the medium-voltage grid, e/ff.ligaectively opening a new market for Enel Green Power in the country. Until now it was possible to enter into PPAs only with end users connected to the high-voltage and very-high-voltage grids. The secondary legislation that will make Law 13.09 enforceable has yet to be enacted but is expected to pass in 2024.",

This period lasts eight years and is divided into two sub-periods of four years each (NPR1 for 2016-2019 and NPR2 for 20202023).\n\nWith regard to the NPR2 period, ARERA published Resolution no. 568/2019/R/eel, with which it updated rates for transmission, distribution and metering services in force in the 2020-2023 period, publishing the new integrated texts. The method for determining the WACC for the 2022-2027 period was updated with Resolution no. 614/2021/R/com, establishing a value of 5.2% for electricity distribution and metering. The regulation provides for an update of the value for 2025-2027, as well as the possibility of a fu/r\\_t.ligaher annual updating (in 2023 and 2024), should ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial indicators lead to a change in the WACC of at least 50 bps. With Resolution no. 654/2022/R/com, ARERA con/fi.ligarmed the value of WACC at 5.2% in 2023, as the conditions to proceed with the update have not been met, while the value of WACC for 2024 was updated to 6% with Resolution no. 556/2023/R/com.\n\nAs for distribution and metering rates, the Authority approved the de/fi.liganitive reference rates for 2022, calculated by taking into account the updated balance sheet data for 2021 (Resolution no. 154/2023/R/eel) and the provisional reference rates for 2023 on the basis of the preliminary balance sheet data for 2022 (Resolution no. 206/2023/R/eel). The de/fi.liganitive reference rates for 2023 are expected to be published in 2024.\n\nWith Resolution no. 271/2021/R/com, the Authority initiated a procedure to introduce, from 2024, new methods for recognizing the costs of infrastructure services (ROSSbase - Adjustment for Expenditure and Service Objectives). As pa/r\\_t.liga of the ROSS-base mechanism, in 2023 the Authority published Resolution no. 163/2023/R/com, with which it approved the 'Integrated Text of the criteria and general principles of the ROSS regulation' (TIROSS 2024-2031) for infrastructure services in the electricity and gas sectors, as well as Resolution no. 497/2023/R/com, with which it speci/fi.ligaed the application criteria, modifying the TIROSS. Finally, with Resolution no. 616/2023/R/eel it approved distribution and metering rates for the 2024-2027 period, publishing the new integrated texts (TIT - provisions for delivery of transmission and distribution services; TIME - provisions for delivery metering services; and TIC - economic terms for delivery of metering services).\n\nDuring 2023, the Authority, implementing the government's provisions, progressively reintroduced the general system\n\ncharges to be applied to customers (in the 1st Qua/r\\_t.ligaer, they were applied only to users with available power over 16.5 kW; in the subsequent qua/r\\_t.ligaers they were applied to all electricity users). The Authority also took action during 2023 with regard to social allowances, providing for, among other things, an update of the requirements for access to the bene/fi.ligats and speci/fi.ligac strengthening measures to contain the e/ff.ligaects of the increase in energy bills.\n\nWith Resolutions no. 232/2022/R/eel and no. 712/2022/R/ eel, ARERA updated in 2022 the rate regulation for reactive energy providing for the entry into force by April 1, 2023 of charges for reactive energy injected and an update of the charges for reactive energy withdrawn for distributors as well.\n\nAt the end of 2023, ARERA again updated the regulation, providing for a single fee for excessive withdrawals and injections of reactive energy paid by MV and LV customers from 2024. It also modi/fi.ligaed the share of revenue retained by distribution companies, which will be updated annually. ARERA has also introduced a mechanism that incentivizes distribution companies to install compensation systems for reactive energy injections to the National Electricity Transmission Grid.\n\nAs regards service quality, with Resolution no. 646/2015/R/ eel and no. 566/2019/R/eel as amended, the Authority established output-based regulation for electricity distribution and metering services for the 2016-2023 period (TIQE 2016-2023), introducing tools to bridge gaps in quality of service still existing between the various areas of the country and examine ce/r\\_t.ligaain mechanisms concerning the effects of climate change.\n\nAs from January 1, 2024, with Resolutions no. 617/2023/R/ eel and no. 614/2023/R/eel, the Authority updated the output-based incentive regulation of technical and commercial service quality and network resilience.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, with Resolution no. 617/2023/R/eel and the related annexes TIQD and TIQC, ARERA adopted improvements that radically modi/fi.ligaed the twenty-year-old regulatory system, speci/fi.ligacally in terms of continuity of distribution services and introducing an incentive mechanism for development measures.\n\nWith Resolution no. 614/2023/R/eel, ARERA de/fi.liganed the regulation of resilience for the 2019-2024 period, governing the termination of the regulations in place since 2018, modifying the incentive mechanism for resilience interventions in the 2024 plan.\n\nWith regard to relations between distributors and traders, on January 1, 2021 the new version of the Electricity Transpo/r\\_t.liga Grid Code came into force with Resolution no. 261/2020/R/eel, which, due to the reduction in the time\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consequently, the value of guarantees that all sellers must give to distributors to cover the transpo/r\\_t.liga service provided was reduced (passing from a level of coverage ranging from 3 to 5 months of the trader's turnover to a new range between 2 and 4 months).\n\nWith  Resolution  no.  119/2022/R/eel,  ARERA  introduced a single mechanism for distribution companies for the reimbursement of system general charges and network charges not collected by defaulting sellers in order to unify and streamline the pre-existing mechanisms.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, the resolution con/fi.ligarms the application of two deductibles for the recognition of credits relating to network charges. On the one hand, this is to serve as an incentive for an e/ffi.ligacient management of the credit by the distributor and, on the other, to remove what has already been  compensated  by  the  rate  system.  The  resolution provides for requests for reimbursement to be made on an annual basis and liquidated in the same year.\n\n## Energy e/ffi.ligaciency - White ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates\n\nThe decree of the Ministry for the Ecological Transition of May 21, 2021 amended the ministerial decree of January 11, 2017 as already amended by the decree of the Ministry for Economic Development of May 10, 2018. The measure set the national quantitative targets for electricity and gas distribution companies for the years 2021-2024. The decree also updated the methods for distribution companies to meet the obligation and for reimbursing the related costs.\n\n## Iberia\n\n## 2023 electricity rates\n\nOn December 22, 2022, the National Commission for Markets and Competition (CNMC) Resolution of December 15, 2022 was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal, establishing the access charges for electricity transmission and distribution networks to be applied sta/r\\_t.ligaing from January 1, 2023, providing for an average reduction of 1.0% compared with January 1, 2022.\n\nOn December 29, 2022, Order TED/1312/2022 of December 23, 2022 was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal. It establishes electricity system charges applicable from January 1, 2023 and sets the various regulated costs of the electricity system for 2023. The new rates for 2023 represent an average reduction of about 40.0% compared with the charges approved on January 1, 2022.\n\n## Natural gas rates for 2023\n\nOn December 28, 2022, the Resolution of December 22, 2022  of  the  Directorate  General  for  Energy  Policy  and Mines was published. It establishes the rate of last reso/r\\_t.liga\n\n(TUR) for natural gas to be applied as of January 1, 2023, and,  taking  account  of  the  provisions  of  Royal  Decree Law 17/2021 of September 14, provides for approximate increases of 7.7%, 9.0% and 9.5% (excluding taxes) respectively for TUR 1, TUR 2, and TUR 3. Meanwhile, the TURs applicable  to  homeowners'  associations,  introduced  by Royal Decree Law 18/2022 of October 18, were reduced by around 2.0% (excluding taxes).\n\nOn March 30, 2023, the Resolution of March 28, 2023 of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines was published. It establishes the rate of last reso/r\\_t.liga (TUR) for natural gas to be applied as of April 1, 2023, with a reduction of about 27.1%, 31% and 32.7%, respectively (excluding taxes), for TUR 1, TUR 2, and TUR 3. Meanwhile, the TURs applicable  to  homeowners'  associations,  introduced  by Royal Decree Law 18/2022 of October 18, were reduced by around 45.7% to 56.3% (excluding taxes).\n\nOn June 29, 2023 the Resolution of June 27, 2023 of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines was published.

It regulates the conditions and requirements for closed electricity distribution grids and their owners, as well as the administrative authorization procedure and the circumstances for revocation of that authorization. The industrial owners of the closed grid will have to build it or buy it from a distribution company, and will be responsible for managing it, investing in its maintenance and billing rates, charges and other costs to the consumers connected to it, while the traders selling electricity to the members of the closed grid will only bill for the power consumed.\n\n## Rest of the World\n\n## Latin America\n\n## Chile\n\nThe Chilean electricity sector is governed by the General Electricity Service Act 20.018, contained in Decree 1 of 1982 issued by the Ministry of Mines, subsequently updated by the Ministry of Economy with Decree 4 of 2006 as amended ('Ley El\u00e9ctrica') and its corresponding implementing regulation, contained in Decree 327 of 1998.\n\n## Distribution rates for 2020-2024\n\nThe process of determining rates for the 2020-2024 period is still under way.

The Peruvian electricity system consists of the National Interconnected Electricity System (SEIN), as well as some isolated electricity systems.\n\n## End-user Markets\n\n## Italy\n\n## Elimination of price protection\n\nThe current regulatory framework governing the process of eliminating regulated prices in the electricity sector (Law 124/2017 - the Competition Act - as most recently amended by Decree Law 152/2021 implementing the NRRP, rati/fi.ligaed with Law 233/2021) provides for a staggered postponement of the removal of price protection: to January 1, 2021 for small businesses, to January 1, 2023 for micro-enterprises and to January 2024 for domestic customer auctions.\n\nThe  ministerial  decrees  implementing  the  Competition Act and ARERA Resolutions no. 491/2020/R/eel and no. 208/2022/R/eel  have  implemented  the  elimination  of price  protection  for  small  businesses  and  micro-businesses (and non-residential customers with a commi/t\\_t.ligaed capacity of less than 15 kW), making provision for the activation of speci/fi.ligac last reso/r\\_t.liga services ('graduated safeguard services') provided by operators awarded the concession in a tender for customers who do not have chosen a free-market supplier.\n\nThe  graduated  safeguard  service  for  small  businesses lasts three years, will expire on June 30, 2024 and will be reassigned with new auctions.\n\nFor micro-enterprises, the service will be provided until March 31, 2027. At the end of the /fi.ligarst service period, supplies still served under graduated protection will switch to the most economically advantageous free-market o/ff.ligaer of the same operator.\n\nFor  non-residential  micro-enterprise  customers  with  a commi/t\\_t.ligaed capacity of less than 15 kW, ARERA, due to the postponement to April 1, 2023 for technical reasons of the sta/r\\_t.liga date of the last reso/r\\_t.liga service dedicated to them, established that the /fi.liganancial terms and conditions of the enhanced protection service will continue to apply until March 31, 2023 for customers already served.\n\nWith  regard  to  residential  customers,  Legislative  Decree  210/2021  has  identi/fi.ligaed  two  categories  for  which the elimination of price protections will involve di/ff.ligaerent\n\nIn  Peru,  the  process  for  determining  distribution  rates takes place every four years and is referred to as the 'Distribution Value Added Fixing' (VAD). The last approved rate cycle is valid for the 2022-2026 period, with new VAD in force as from November 1, 2022.\n\ntimeframes and methods: 'vulnerable' customers (such as customers over 75 years of age, recipients of a social allowance due to economic or physical hardship, individuals with disabilities pursuant to Law 104/1992, users located in emergency homes following natural disasters) and 'non-vulnerable' customers.\n\nDecree 169 of May 18, 2023 of the MASE regulated the assignment through competitive procedures carried out on a territorial basis for the graduated safeguard service for non-vulnerable residential customers, se/t\\_t.ligaing the market share awardable to each operator at 30%. The same decree established that, upon expiry of the service assignment period scheduled for 31 March 2027, supplies will switch to the most economically advantageous free-market o/ff.ligaer with the same operator.\n\nARERA Resolution no. 580/2023/R/eel, implementing the Decree Law 181/2023 (the 'Energy Decree'), scheduled the tenders for January 10, 2024. With the earlier Resolution no. 362/2023/R/eel as amended, ARERA regulated the methods for the award and delivery of graduated safeguard services in which customers identi/fi.ligaed as non-vulnerable will be supplied with residential supplies. Pursuant to Resolution no. 600/2023/R/eel, due to the postponement of the auctions provided for in the Energy Decree, the service will be provided sta/r\\_t.ligaing from July 1, 2024 by the sellers awarded the tender. The /fi.liganal award is expected by February 6, 2024. Until July 1, 2024, non-vulnerable residential customers will continue to be served by the operator of the enhanced protection service.\n\nAs regards vulnerable domestic customers, the Energy Decree refers to a provision of the Authority the de/fi.liganition of the methods for the exit of customers from the greater protection through the assignment of a 'vulnerability service' by tender. Pending this provision, vulnerable customers will continue to be served by the current operator of the enhanced protection service.\n\nAs regards the gas sector, the elimination of price protections sta/r\\_t.ligaing from January 2024 is governed by ARERA Resolution no. 100/2023/R/gas, which establishes that non-vulnerable residential customers and condominiums\n\n<!-- image -->",

Customers  identi/fi.ligaed  as  vulnerable pursuant to Decree Law 115/2022 (the Second Aid Decree) will continue to be served under the economic and contractual conditions speci/fi.ligaed by ARERA for the vulnerability protection service.\n\nWith regard to the elimination of price safeguards for small /fi.ligarms in the electricity sector, in March 2021, Enel Energia and Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale (together with Enel Italia) appealed the decree of the Ministry for Economic Development  implementing  the  Competition  Act  before  the Lazio Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga, contesting the imposition of the antitrust cap at 35% and the lack of provisions for the reimbursement of the residual costs of Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale following the loss of customers. With regard to the la/t\\_t.ligaer point, in March 2021, Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale and Enel Italia had also challenged Resolution no. 491/2020/R/eel with an appeal before the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga. At the moment, no hearing has yet been set for these appeals.\n\nIn July 2022, Enel Energia and Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale, basing their challenges on the same grounds, appealed Resolution no. 208/2022/R/eel, relating to micro-enterprises and non-residential customers with a commi/t\\_t.ligaed capacity of less than 15 kW, before the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga; in November 2022, they also appealed before the Lazio Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga the decree of the Ministry of the Ecological Transition se/t\\_t.ligaing out how graduated safeguard services for micro-enterprises are to be implemented.\n\nWith Resolutions no. 136/2023/R/eel and no. 151/2023/R/ eel, ARERA established, for 2023, the procedures for accessing  the  customer  exit  compensation  mechanism pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 20 of the Integrated Provisions Governing Last-Reso/r\\_t.liga Services (TIV). With an appeal /fi.ligaled on May 29, 2023, Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale and Enel Italia challenged these provisions before the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga through an appeal with additional evidence to the main proceedings already brought against Resolution no. 208/2022/R/eel.\n\nWith regard to the elimination of price safeguards for non-vulnerable residential customers, in July 2023, Enel Energia  and  Servizio  Ele/t\\_t.ligarico  Nazionale  (together  with Enel Italia) appealed the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security (MASE) Decree 169 of May 18, 2023 before the Lazio Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga, contesting the imposition of the antitrust cap at 30% and the lack of provisions for the reimbursement of the residual costs of Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale following the loss of customers. Likewise, in October 2023, the two companies (together with Enel Italia) appealed ARERA Resolution no.\n\n362/2023/R/eel of August 3, 2023, concerning the regulation of the graduated safeguard services for non-vulnerable domestic customers, before the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga, raising the objections already formulated against the MASE ministerial decree.\n\nIn addition, with an appeal /fi.ligaled in January 2024, Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale (together with Enel Italia) challenged ARERA Resolutions no. 549/2023/R/eel, no. 580/2023/R/ eel and no. 600/2023/R/eel completing the regulation referred to in Resolution no. 362/2023/R/eel, again contesting the failure to reimburse the residual costs following the loss of customers.\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of the bill ratifying Decree Law 181/2023 (the 'Energy Decree'), which was approved on January 31, 2024, a provision allowing operators of the enhanced protection service to recover otherwise non-recoverable costs directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the service incurred since April 1, 2023 has been introduced. ARERA shall issue a resolution to be adopted within 90 days from the date of entry into force of the law ratifying the decree to govern the time limits and methods for submi/t\\_t.ligaing the repo/r\\_t.liga necessary to ce/r\\_t.ligaify the aforementioned costs.\n\n## Electricity\n\nWith Resolution no. 146/2022/R/eel, ARERA updated, with e/ff.ligaect from April 1, 2022, the rate component covering the marketing costs of the operators of the enhanced protection service (RCV). The resolution also updates the levels of the fee for covering electricity marketing costs (PCV), which represents the reference price for sellers on the free market. With Resolution no. 136/2023/R/eel, ARERA updated, with e/ff.ligaect from April 1, 2023, the RCV component and the related PCV compensation solely for residential customers enrolled in the enhanced protection service. With Resolution no. 600/2023/R/eel, ARERA provided for the update of the RCV by March 2024 to take account of adjustments to the WACC of infrastructure services. The RCV and PCV for vulnerable customers who will be served by the enhanced safeguard operator will be determined by the end of June 2024.\n\nThe TIV envisages speci/fi.ligac equalization mechanisms for operators of the enhanced protection service, such as a mechanism that makes it possible to regulate any imbalances in the costs incurred by the operator for the supply of electricity.\n\nTo cover the de/fi.ligacit generated by the extraordinary increase in energy provisioning costs in 2022, ARERA Resolution no. 463/2022/R/eel also provided that, by the end of  2022,  the  Energy  and  Environmental  Services  Fund would disburse an advance on 2022 equalization balances to RCV operators.

The levels were subsequently updated, with e/ff.ligaect from April 1, 2023, with Resolution no. 137/2023/R/gas. They have been determined so as to take account of the effects associated with the duration - less than a year - of the period remaining at the end of the termination of the protection service, which is expected to sta/r\\_t.liga from January 2024. This component, to be applied as from January 2024 to vulnerable customers, will be subsequently updated (for at least the /fi.ligarst year of application) with similar but simpli/fi.ligaed criteria compared with the current system by the end of March of each year for the following 12 months, pending the acquisition of detailed data on the cost of sales associated with vulnerable customers.\n\nWith regard to reimbursement mechanisms for end users in arrears in the gas sector, in A/r\\_t.ligaicles 31quinquies and 37.1 le/t\\_t.ligaer b) of the TIVG (Integrated Retail Gas Sales Code), ARERA regulates speci/fi.ligac mechanisms for the reimbursement of arrears for providers of the last reso/r\\_t.liga service and the default service on distribution grids.\n\n## Iberia\n\n## Energy e/ffi.ligaciency\n\nLaw 18/2014 of October 15 containing urgent measures for growth, competitiveness and e/ffi.ligaciency created the National Energy E/ffi.ligaciency Fund to achieve energy e/ffi.ligaciency objectives.\n\nOn March 30, 2023, Order TED/296/2023 of March 27 was published, establishing the contribution to the National\n\nEnergy E/ffi.ligaciency Fund for 2023, amounting to \u20ac49 million for Endesa.\n\nEndesa is expected to provide a contribution to the National Energy E/ffi.ligaciency Fund in the amount of \u20ac99 million in 2024, of which it must contribute at least \u20ac35 million (35.0% of the amount). It can satisfy the rest of its obligation by submi/t\\_t.ligaing energy e/ffi.ligaciency ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates (EEC).\n\n## Consumer protection measures: Bono Social\n\nFollowing the publication of Royal Decree Law 8/2023 of December 27, in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal, adopting measures for the economic and social consequences of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and to alleviate the impact of drought, several measures to protect vulnerable consumers already extended by Royal Decree Law 20/2022 of December 27 were fu/r\\_t.ligaher extended until June 30, 2024, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the increase in the discounts of the electricity social bonus from 25% to 65% for vulnerable consumers, and from 40% to 80% for severely vulnerable consumers;\n- \u00b7 a discount of 40% for the same period, for working households covered by the voluntary price for small consumers  (PVPC)  with  income  between  1.5  and  2 times the Public Index of Multiple Purpose Income (IPREM), increased by 0.3 for each additional adult member and 0.5 for each additional minor member.\n\nOn January 21, 2023, the Order TED/81/2023 of January 27 was published, approving the distribution of the amounts to be /fi.ligananced for the Bono Social allowance for 2023. The order establishes the di/ff.ligaerent unit values that must be paid by those obliged to /fi.liganance these costs.\n\n## Consumer protection measures: guarantee of electricity services\n\nRoyal Decree Law 8/2023 of December 28, fu/r\\_t.ligaher extends the prohibition of suspending electricity, water and gas supplies to vulnerable consumers, severely vulnerable consumers and customers at risk of social exclusion until June 30, 2024. The Minimum Viable Supply regime will then come into force, whereby a vulnerable customer cannot be excluded for non-payment during the four-month payment period and an additional six-month grace period.\n\n## Consumer protection measures: tax measures\n\nRoyal Decree Law 8/2023 of December 28, has changed tax rates: it increases VAT from 5% to 10% for all of 2024 for consumers whose contracted power supply is less than or equal to 10 kW (if the average daily market price of the previous month is less than \u20ac45/MWh, the 'normal' VAT of 21% is applied) or who are bene/fi.ligaciaries of the Bono Social as severely vulnerable consumers.\n\nLikewise, the special tax on electricity will rise from the previous 0.5% to 2.5% in the 1st Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2024, and 3.8% in the 2nd Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2024.

The remaining po/r\\_t.ligaion will be determined by the spot price. The forward market po/r\\_t.ligaion will be divided between the monthly (10%), qua/r\\_t.ligaerly (36%) and annual (54%) products;\n- \u00b7 the reference supplier will be reimbursed, as a component of the PVPC, the cost of /fi.liganancing the Bono Social scheme established annually in the corresponding order, together with an additional payment for the recovery of amounts incurred under Royal Decree Law 6/2022 of March 29.\n\nThis royal decree also modi/fi.ligaes ce/r\\_t.ligaain regulatory aspects of generation in non-peninsular territories.\n\n## Consumer protection measures: electricityintensive customers\n\nRoyal Decree 444/2023 of June 13, published on June 14, 2023, amends the Cha/r\\_t.ligaer of Electricity-Intensive Consumers approved in 2020. The amendment expands the catalogue  of  eligible  activities  and  reduces  ce/r\\_t.ligaain  re-\n\nquirements, thereby expanding the number of bene/fi.ligaciaries. It also updates the maximum amount of aid to o/ff.ligaset the cost associated with the speci/fi.ligac remuneration regime for renewable energy and the cost of non-mainland electricity systems included in charges, from 85% for all activities to: 85% for sectors at signi/fi.ligacant risk; 75% for sectors at risk (and up to 85% if they can demonstrate that 50% of consumption comes from fossil fuel sources and have entered into forward contracts for 10% of consumption or 5% of consumption with self-consumption from renewable sources); or a higher percentage for especially vulnerable plants (i.e., when the cost of electricity exceeds ce/r\\_t.ligaain gross value added thresholds).

Accounting policies\n\n## 2.1 Use of estimates and management judgment\n\nPreparing the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements under IFRS-EU requires management to take decisions and make estimates and assumptions that may impact the carrying amount of revenue, costs, assets and liabilities and the related disclosures concerning the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and management's judgments are based on previous experience and other factors considered reasonable in the circumstances. They are formulated when the carrying amount of assets and liabilities is not easily determined from other sources. The actual results may therefore di/ff.ligaer from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions are periodically revised and the e/ff.ligaects of any changes are re/fl.ligaected through pro/fi.ligat or loss if they only involve that period. If the revision involves both the current and future periods, the change is recognized in the period in which the revision is made and in the related future periods.\n\nIn order to enhance understanding of the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, the following sections examine the main items a/ff.ligaected by the use of estimates and the cases that re/fl.ligaect management judgments to a signi/fi.ligacant degree, underscoring the main assumptions used by management in measuring these items in compliance with the IFRS-EU. The critical element of such valuations is the use of assumptions and professional judgments concerning issues that are by their very nature unce/r\\_t.ligaain.\n\nChanges in the conditions underlying the assumptions and judgments could have a substantial impact on future results.\n\nThe  information  included  in  the  consolidated  /fi.liganancial statements is selected on the basis of a materiality analysis carried out in accordance with the requirements of\n\nwith IFRS, as explained in the measurement bases applied to each individual item, and of non-current assets and disposal groups classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale, which are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nThe  consolidated  /fi.liganancial  statements  are  presented  in euro, the functional currency of the Parent Enel SpA. All /fi.ligagures are shown in millions of euro unless stated otherwise. The consolidated income statement, the statement of /fi.liganancial position and the consolidated statement of cash /fl.ligaows repo/r\\_t.liga transactions with related pa/r\\_t.ligaies, the de/fi.liganition of which is given in note 2.2 'Material accounting policies'. The consolidated /fi.liganancial statements provide comparative information in respect of the previous year.\n\nPractice Statement 2 'Making Materiality Judgments', issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board (IASB).\n\nWith regard to the e/ff.ligaects of climate change issues, the Group believes that climate change represents an implicit element in the application of the methodologies and models used to pe/r\\_f.ligaorm estimates in the valuation and/or measurement  of  ce/r\\_t.ligaain  accounting  items.  Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the Group has also taken account of the impact of climate change in the signi/fi.ligacant judgments made by management. In this regard, the main items included in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements at December 31, 2023 a/ff.ligaected by management's use of estimates and judgments refer to the impairment of non-/fi.liganancial assets and obligations connected with the energy transition, including those for decommissioning and site restoration of ce/r\\_t.ligaain generation plants.

These projections cover the next three years. For subsequent years, account is taken of:\n\n- \u00b7 assumptions  concerning  the  long-term  evolution  of the main variables considered in the calculation of cash /fl.ligaows, as well as the average residual useful life of the assets or the duration of the concessions, based on the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of the businesses;\n- \u00b7 a long-term growth rate equal to the long-term growth of electricity demand and/or in/fl.ligaation (depending on the country and business) that does not in any case exceed the average long-term growth rate of the market involved.\n\nThe recoverable amount is sensitive to the estimates and assumptions used in the calculation of cash /fl.ligaows and the discount rates applied. Neve/r\\_t.ligaheless, possible changes in the underlying assumptions of such amounts could generate di/ff.ligaerent recoverable amounts. The analysis of each group of non-/fi.liganancial assets is unique and requires management to use estimates and assumptions considered prudent and reasonable in the speci/fi.ligac circumstances.\n\nIn line with its business model and in the context of the energy transition process, the Group has also carefully assessed whether climate change issues have a/ff.ligaected the reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable assumption used to estimate expected cash /fl.ligaows. In this regard, where necessary, the Group has also taken account of the long-term impact of\n\nclimate change, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular by considering in the estimation of the terminal value a long-term growth rate in line with the change in electricity demand determined using energy models for each country.\n\nInformation on the main assumptions used to estimate the recoverable amount of assets with reference to the impacts relating to climate change, as well as information on changes in these assumptions, is provided in note 24 'Goodwill'.\n\n## Expected credit losses on /fi.liganancial assets\n\nAt the end of each repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, the Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables and other /fi.liganancial assets measured at amortized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, contract assets and all other assets in scope.\n\nLoss  allowances  for  /fi.liganancial  assets  are  based  on  assumptions about risk of default and on the measurement of expected credit losses. Management uses judgment in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs for the impairment calculation, based on the Group's past experience, current market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each repo/r\\_t.ligaing period.\n\nThe expected credit loss (ECL) - determined considering probability  of  default  (PD),  loss  given  default  (LGD),  and exposure at default (EAD) - is the di/ff.ligaerence between all contractual cash /fl.ligaows that are due in accordance with the contract and all cash /fl.ligaows that are expected to be received (including all sho/r\\_t.ligafalls) discounted at the original e/ff.ligaective interest rate (EIR).\n\nFor additional details on the general simpli/fi.ligaed approach used to determine expected credit losses, please see note 48 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\nBased on the speci/fi.ligac reference market and the regulatory context of the sector, as well as expectations of recovery after 90 days, for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, the Group mainly applies a default de/fi.liganition of 180 days past due to determine expected credit losses, as this is considered an e/ff.ligaective indication of a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk. Accordingly, /fi.liganancial assets that are more than 90 days past due are generally not considered to be in default, except for some speci/fi.ligac regulated markets.\n\nFor trade receivables and contract assets the Group mainly applies a collective approach based on grouping them into speci/fi.ligac clusters, taking into account the speci/fi.ligac regulatory and business context. Only if the trade receivables are deemed to be individually signi/fi.ligacant by management and there is speci/fi.ligac information about any signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk, does the Group apply an analytical approach.\n\nBased  on  speci/fi.ligac  management  evaluations,  the  forward-looking  adjustment  can  be  applied  considering",

The regulations introduce a number of innovations which, if applied to existing concessions, would require a review of the useful lives of certain investments in hydroelectric plants in order to re/fl.ligaect the possibility that, at the end of the concession, some assets could be transferred free of charge to the new concession holder. However, in estimating the useful lives of these plants, management, with the suppo/r\\_t.liga of a legal opinion, considered the foreseeable outcome of the appeals promptly lodged by the Group - and others - and the related constitutionality issues, which have also been raised by industrial associations. Consequently, we believe that the legislation raises serious constitutionality issues that will be e/ff.ligaectively recognized in the appropriate fora. Accordingly, management deemed it appropriate not to re/fl.ligaect  the  changes  introduced  by  the  regulations  and therefore has continued to measure the useful lives of the plants as has been done in previous years under the previous regulatory system, considering this to be the most realistic estimate.\n\nLaw 134 of August 7, 2012 containing 'urgent measures for growth' (published in the Gazze/t\\_t.ligaa U/ffi.ligaciale of August 11, 2012), introduced a sweeping overhaul of the rules governing hydroelectric concessions. Among its various provisions, the law establishes that /fi.ligave years before the expiration of a major hydroelectric water diversion concession and in cases of lapse, relinquishment or revocation, where there is no prevailing public interest for a di/ff.ligaerent use of the water, incompatible with its use for hydroelectric generation, the competent public entity shall organize a public call for tenders for the award for consideration of the concession for a period ranging from 20 to a maximum of 30 years.\n\nIn order to ensure operational continuity, the law also governs the methods of transferring ownership of the business unit necessary to operate the concession, including all legal relationships relating to the concession, from the outgoing concession holder to the new concession holder, in exchange for payment of a price to be determined in negotiations between the depa/r\\_t.ligaing concession holder\n\nand the grantor agency, taking due account of the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 for intake and governing works, penstocks and out/fl.ligaow channels, which under the consolidated law governing waters and electrical plants are to be relinquished free of charge (A/r\\_t.ligaicle 25 of Royal Decree 1775 of December 11, 1933), the revalued cost less government capital grants, also revalued, received by the concession holder for the construction of such works, depreciated for ordinary wear and tear;\n- \u00b7 for other prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, the market value, meaning replacement value, reduced by estimated depreciation for ordinary wear and tear.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the new regulations introduce impo/r\\_t.ligaant changes as to the transfer of ownership of the business unit with regard to the operation of the hydroelectric  concession,  the  practical  application  of  these principles faces di/ffi.ligaculties, given the unce/r\\_t.ligaainties that do not permit the formulation of a reliable estimate of the value that can be recovered at the end of existing concessions (residual value).\n\nAccordingly, management has decided it could not produce a reasonable and reliable estimate of residual value. The fact that the legislation requires the new concession holder to make a payment to the depa/r\\_t.ligaing concession holder prompted management to review the depreciation schedules for assets classi/fi.ligaed as to be relinquished free of charge prior to Law 134/2012 (until the year ended on December 31, 2011, given that the assets were to be relinquished free of charge, the depreciation period was equal to the closest date between the term of the concession and the end of the useful life of the individual asset), calculating depreciation no longer over the term of the concession but, if longer, over the useful life of the individual assets. If additional information becomes available to enable the calculation of residual value, the carrying amounts of the assets involved will be adjusted prospectively.\n\n## Determining the fair value of /fi.liganancial instruments\n\nThe fair value of /fi.liganancial instruments is determined on the basis of prices directly observable in the market, where available, or, for unlisted /fi.liganancial instruments, using speci/fi.ligac valuation techniques (mainly based on present value) that maximize the use of observable market inputs. In rare circumstances where this is not possible, the inputs are estimated by management taking due account of the characteristics of the instruments being measured.\n\nFor more information on /fi.liganancial instruments measured at fair value, please see note 52 'Assets and liabilities measured at fair value'.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 13, the Group includes a measurement of credit risk, both of the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay (Credit Valuation Adjustment or CVA) and its own (Debit Valuation Adjustment or DVA), in order to adjust the fair value\n\n<!-- image -->",

Ce/r\\_t.ligaain employees are also eligible for other post-employment bene/fi.ligat schemes.\n\nThe expenses and liabilities of such plans are calculated on the basis of estimates carried out by consulting actuaries, who use a combination of statistical and actuarial elements in their calculations, including statistical data on past years and forecasts of future costs. Other components of the estimation that are considered include mo/r\\_t.ligaality and retirement rates as well as assumptions concerning future developments in discount rates, the rate of wage increases, the in/fl.ligaation rate and trends in healthcare cost.\n\nThese estimates can di/ff.ligaer signi/fi.ligacantly from actual developments owing to changes in economic and market conditions, increases or decreases in retirement rates and the lifespan of pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants, as well as changes in the e/ff.ligaective cost of healthcare.\n\nSuch  di/ff.ligaerences  can  have  a  substantial  impact  on  the quanti/fi.ligacation of pension costs and other related expenses. For more details on the main actuarial assumptions adopted, please see note 39 'Employee bene/fi.ligats'.\n\n## Provisions for risks and charges\n\nFor more details on provisions for risks and charges, please see note 40 'Provisions for risks and charges'.\n\nNote 57 'Contingent assets and liabilities' also provides information regarding the most signi/fi.ligacant contingent assets and liabilities for the Group at year end.\n\n## Litigation\n\nThe Group is involved in various civil, administrative and tax  disputes  connected  with  the  normal  pursuit  of  its activities that could give rise to signi/fi.ligacant liabilities. It is not always objectively possible to predict the outcome of these disputes. The assessment of the risks associated with this litigation is based on complex factors whose very nature requires recourse to management judgments, even when taking account of the contribution of external advisors assisting the Group, about whether to classify them as contingent liabilities or liabilities.\n\nProvisions have been recognized to cover all signi/fi.ligacant liabilities for cases in which legal counsel feels an adverse outcome is likely and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the expense can be made.\n\nObligations associated with generation plants, including decommissioning and site restoration\n\nGeneration activities may entail obligations for the operator with regard to future interventions that will have to be performed following the end of the operating life of the plant. Such interventions may involve the decommissioning of plants and site restoration, or other obligations linked to the type of generation technology involved. The nature of such obligations may also have a major impact on the accounting treatment used for them.\n\nIn the case of nuclear power plants, where the costs regard both decommissioning and the storage of waste fuel and other radioactive materials, the estimation of the future cost is a critical process, given that the costs will be incurred over a very long span of time, estimated at up to 100 years.\n\nThe obligation, based on /fi.liganancial and engineering assumptions, is calculated by discounting the expected future cash /fl.ligaows that the Group considers it will have to pay to meet the obligations it has assumed.\n\nThe discount rate used to determine the present value of the liability is the pre-tax risk-free rate and is based on the economic parameters of the country in which the plant is located. That liability is quanti/fi.ligaed by management on the basis of the technology existing at the measurement date and is reviewed each year, taking account of developments in storage, decommissioning and site restoration technology, as well as the ongoing evolution of the legislative  framework  governing  health  and  environmental protection.\n\nSubsequently, the value of the obligation is adjusted to re/fl.ligaect the passage of time and any changes in estimates.\n\nFor more information, please see note 40 'Provisions for risks and charges'.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nIn order to identify an onerous contract, the Group estimates the non-discretionary costs necessary to ful/fi.ligal the obligations assumed (including any penalties) under the contract and the economic bene/fi.ligats that are presumed to be obtained from the contract.\n\n## Leases\n\nWhen the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate (IBR) at the lease commencement date to calculate the present value of the lease payments. This is the interest rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the rightofuse asset in a similar economic environment. When no observable inputs are available, the Group estimates the IBR making assumptions to re/fl.ligaect the terms and conditions of the lease and ce/r\\_t.ligaain lessee-speci/fi.ligac estimates.",

        "page_content": "One of the most signi/fi.ligacant judgments for the Group is determining this IBR necessary to calculate the present value of the lease payments required to be paid to the lessor. The Group approach to determine an IBR is based on the assessment of the following three key components:\n\n- \u00b7 the risk-free rate, that consider the currency /fl.ligaows of the lease payments, the economic environment where the lease contract has been negotiated and also the lease term;\n- \u00b7 the credit spread adjustment, in order to calculate an IBR that is speci/fi.ligac for the lessee considering any underlying Parent or other guarantee;\n- \u00b7 the lease related adjustments, in order to re/fl.ligaect into the IBR calculation the fact that the discount rate is directly linked to the type of the underlying asset, rather than being a general incremental borrowing rate. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the risk of default is mitigated for the lessors as they have the right to reclaim the underlying asset itself.\n\nFor more information on lease liabilities, please see note 48 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\n## Income tax\n\nRecovery of deferred tax assets\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements repo/r\\_t.liga deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses or tax credits usable in subsequent years and income components whose deductibility is deferred in an amount whose future recovery is considered by management to be highly probable.\n\nThe recoverability of such assets is subject to the achievement of future pro/fi.ligats su/ffi.ligacient to absorb such tax losses and to use the bene/fi.ligats of the other deferred tax assets. Signi/fi.ligacant management judgment is required to assess the probability of recovering deferred tax assets, considering all negative and positive evidence, and to determine the amount that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable pro/fi.ligats together with future tax planning strategies and the tax rates applicable at the date of reversal. However, where the Group should become aware that it is unable to recover all or pa/r\\_t.liga of recognized tax assets in future years, the consequent adjustment would be taken to pro/fi.ligat or loss in the year in which this circumstance arises.\n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each period. Deferred tax assets not recognized are reassessed at each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date in order to verify the conditions for their recognition.\n\nFor more details on deferred tax assets recognized or not recognized, please see note 25 'Deferred tax assets and liabilities'.\n\n## Management judgment\n\n## Identi/fi.ligacation of operating segments\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8, the Group's operating segments are represented by the business lines, identi/fi.ligaed as components:\n\n- \u00b7 that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenue and incur expenses (including revenue and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity);\n- \u00b7 whose operating results are regularly reviewed by management to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess their pe/r\\_f.ligaormance; and\n- \u00b7 for which discrete /fi.liganancial information is available.\n\n## Identi/fi.ligacation of cash generating units (CGUs)\n\nFor impairment testing, if the recoverable amount cannot be determined for an individual asset, the Group identi/fi.ligaes the smallest group of assets that generate largely independent cash in/fl.ligaows. The smallest group of assets that generates cash in/fl.ligaows that are largely independent of the cash in/fl.ligaows from other assets or group of assets is a CGU. Identifying such CGUs involves management judgments regarding the speci/fi.ligac nature of the assets and the business involved (geographical segment, business segment, regulatory framework, etc.). The assets of each CGU are also identi/fi.ligaed on the basis of the manner in which management manages and monitors those assets, as well as the evidence that the cash in/fl.ligaows of the group of assets are largely independent of those associated with other assets (or groups of assets).\n\nThe assets of each CGU are also identi/fi.ligaed on the basis of the manner in which management manages and monitors those assets. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the number and scope of the CGUs are updated systematically to re/fl.ligaect the impact of new business combinations and reorganizations carried out by the Group.\n\nThe CGUs identi/fi.ligaed by management to which the goodwill recognized in these consolidated /fi.liganancial statements has been allocated are repo/r\\_t.ligaed in note 24 'Goodwill'.\n\n## Determining the useful life of non-/fi.liganancial assets\n\nIn determining the useful life of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment and intangible assets with a /fi.liganite useful life, the Group considers not only the future economic bene/fi.ligats contained in the assets - obtained through their use, but also many other factors, such as physical wear and tear, the technical, commercial or other obsolescence of the product or service produced with the asset, legal or similar limits (e.g., safety, environmental or other restrictions) on the use of the asset, if the useful life of the asset depends on the useful life of other assets.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in estimating the useful lives of the assets\n\n<!-- image -->",

For more information, please see note 19 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment'.\n\n## Determination of the existence of control\n\nUnder the provisions of IFRS 10, control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to a/ff.ligaect those returns through its power over the investee. Power is de/fi.liganed as the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee based on existing substantive rights.\n\nThe existence of control does not depend solely on ownership of a majority investment, but rather it arises from substantive rights that each investor holds over the investee. Consequently, management must use its judgment in assessing whether speci/fi.ligac situations determine substantive rights that give the Group the power to direct the relevant activities of the investee in order to a/ff.ligaect its returns.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing control, management analyzes all facts and circumstances including any agreements with other investors, rights arising from other contractual  arrangements  and  potential  voting  rights  (call options, warrants, put options granted to non-controlling shareholders, etc.). These other facts and circumstances could be especially signi/fi.ligacant in such assessment when the Group holds less than a majority of voting rights, or similar rights, in the investee.\n\nFollowing such analysis of the existence of control, in application of IFRS 10 the Group consolidated ce/r\\_t.ligaain companies on a line-by-line basis even though it did not hold more than half of the voting rights, determining that the requirements for de facto control existed.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, even if it holds more than half of the voting rights in an entity, the Group considers all the relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it controls the investee.\n\nThe Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the elements considered in verifying the existence of control.\n\n## Determination of the existence of joint control and of the type of joint arrangement\n\nUnder the provisions of IFRS 11, a joint arrangement is an agreement where two or more pa/r\\_t.ligaies have joint control. Joint control exists only when the decisions over the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties that share joint control.\n\nA joint arrangement can be con/fi.ligagured as a joint venture or a joint operation. Joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the pa/r\\_t.ligaies that have joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Conversely, joint op-\n\nerations are joint arrangements whereby the pa/r\\_t.ligaies that have joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.\n\nIn order to determine the existence of the joint control and the type of joint arrangement, management must apply judgment and assess its rights and obligations arising from the arrangement. For this purpose, the management considers the structure and legal form of the arrangement, the terms agreed by the pa/r\\_t.ligaies in the contractual arrangement and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances.\n\nFollowing that analysis, the Group has considered its interest in Asociaci\u00f3n Nuclear Asc\u00f3-Vandell\u00f3s II as a joint operation.\n\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it has joint control if facts and circumstances indicate that changes have occurred in one or more of the elements considered in verifying the existence of joint control and the type of the joint arrangement.\n\nFor more information on the Group's investments in joint ventures, please see note 26 'Equity-accounted investments'.\n\n## Determination of the existence of signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence over an associate\n\nAssociates are those in which the Group exercises signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence, i.e. the power to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in the /fi.liganancial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not exercise control or joint control over those policies. In general, it is presumed that the Group has a signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence when it has an ownership interest of 20% or more.\n\nIn order to determine the existence of signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence, management must apply judgment and consider all facts and circumstances.\n\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it has signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the elements considered in verifying the existence of signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence.\n\nFor more information on the Group's equity investments in associates, please see note 26 'Equity-accounted investments'.\n\n## Determination of non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nAn asset is classi/fi.ligaed as 'held for sale' when its sale is highly probable.\n\nTo determine whether a sale is highly probable, the Group considers whether:\n\n- \u00b7 management is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), and an active program to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated;\n- \u00b7 the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of",

More speci/fi.ligacally, management assesses whether 'public-to-private' service concession arrangements are with-\n\nin the scope of IFRIC 12 on the basis of whether:\n\n- \u00b7 the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and\n- \u00b7 the grantor controls - through ownership, bene/fi.ligacial entitlement or otherwise - any signi/fi.ligacant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement.\n\nOn the basis of that analysis, the provisions of IFRIC 12 are applicable to the service concession arrangements of a\n\nnumber of companies that operate primarily in Brazil.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligaher details about service concession arrangements in the scope of IFRIC 12 are provided in note 20 'Infrastructure within the scope of 'IFRIC 12 - Service Concession Arrangements''.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nThe Group carefully analyzes the contractual terms and conditions on a jurisdictional level in order to determine when a contract exists and the terms of that contract's enforceability so as to apply IFRS 15 only to such contracts. When a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, in order to assess if they should be accounted for separately or as a group, the Group considers both the individual characteristics of goods/services (i.e. whether they are distinct or are a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pa/t\\_t.ligaern of transfer to the customer), and the nature of the promise within the context of the contract. To this\n\nend, it is necessary to evaluate all the facts and circumstances relating to the speci/fi.ligac contract under the relevant legal and regulatory framework. To evaluate when a pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation is satis/fi.ligaed, the Group evaluates when the control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer, assessed primarily from the perspective of the customer.\n\nFor each pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation, and in relation to the type of transaction:\n\n- \u00b7 revenue is recognized over time on the basis of the progress  towards  complete  satisfaction  of  the  performance obligation, as in the case of the provision of  services.  The  measurement  of  progress  towards complete satisfaction of a pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation is carried  out  consistently  for  pe/r\\_f.ligaormance  obligations and similar circumstances using an 'output' or 'input' method. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the cost incurred method (costto-cost method) is considered appropriate for measuring progress except when a speci/fi.ligac analysis of the contract counsels the use of an alternative method. If it should prove impossible to reasonably assess progress towards satisfaction of the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation, the Group recognizes revenue only to the extent of the incurred costs that are considered recoverable;\n- \u00b7 if, on the other hand, the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation is satis/fi.ligaed at a given moment, as in the case of the supply of goods, revenue is recognized at the point in time in which the customer obtains the control of the goods, considering all relevant indicators.\n\nThe Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether a contract includes variable consideration (i.e. consideration that may vary or depends upon  the  occurrence  or  non-occurrence  of  a  future event).  In  estimating  variable  consideration,  the  Group uses the method that be/t\\_t.ligaer predicts the consideration to which it will be entitled, applying it consistently throughout the contract and for similar contracts, also considering all available information, and updating such estimates until the unce/r\\_t.ligaainly is resolved. The Group includes the estimated variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a signi/fi.ligacant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty is resolved.\n\nThe Group considers that it is an agent in some contracts in which it is not primarily responsible for ful/fi.ligalling the contract and therefore it does not control goods or services before they are being transferred to customers. For example, the Group acts as an agent in some contracts for electricity/gas network connection services and other related activities depending on local legal and regulatory framework.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "For contracts that have more than one pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation (e.g., 'bundled' sale contracts), the Group generally allocates the transaction price to each pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to its stand-alone selling price. The Group determines stand-alone selling prices considering all information and using observable prices when they are available in the market or, if not, using an estimation method that maximizes the use of observable inputs and applying it consistently to similar arrangements.\n\nIf the Group evaluates that a contract includes an option for additional goods or services (e.g., customer loyalty programs or renewal options) that represents a material right, it allocates the transaction price to this option since the option gives rise to an additional pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation.\n\nThe  Group  assesses recoverability  of  the  incremental costs of obtaining a contract either on a contract-by-contract basis, or for a group of contracts if those costs are associated with the group of contracts.\n\nThe Group suppo/r\\_t.ligas the recoverability of such costs on the basis of its experience with other similar transactions and evaluating  various  factors,  including  potential  renewals, amendments and follow-on contracts with the same customer.\n\nThe Group amo/r\\_t.ligaizes such costs over the average customer term. In order to determine this expected period of bene/fi.ligat from the contract, the Group considers its past experience (e.g., 'churn rate'), the predictive evidence from similar contracts and available information about the market.\n\n## Power Purchase Agreements\n\nPower Purchase Agreements (PPAs), which provide for the physical delivery of energy and which do not comply with the requirements of IFRS 10 for the existence of control or joint control over a company or an asset, and IFRS 16 for the recognition of a lease, but which comply with the de/fi.liganition of a derivative under IFRS 9, are accounted for on the basis of the own use exemption when the relevant conditions are met.\n\nFor more information on Vi/r\\_t.ligaual PPAs complying with the de/fi.liganition of derivative pursuant to IFRS 9, please see note 51 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\n## Classi/fi.ligacation and measurement of /fi.liganancial assets\n\nAt initial recognition, in order to classify /fi.liganancial assets as /fi.liganancial assets at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, management assesses both the contractual cash /fl.ligaow characteristics of the instrument and the business model for managing /fi.liganancial assets in order to generate cash /fl.ligaows.\n\nIn order to evaluate the contractual cash /fl.ligaow characteristics of the instrument, management pe/r\\_f.ligaorms the SPPI test at an instrument level, in order to determine if it gives rise to\n\ncash /fl.ligaows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding, pe/r\\_f.ligaorming speci/fi.ligac assessment on the contractual clauses of the /fi.liganancial instruments, as well as quantitative analysis, if required.\n\nThe business model determines whether cash /fl.ligaows will result from collecting contractual cash /fl.ligaows, selling the /fi.liganancial assets, or both.\n\nFor more details, please see note 48 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nHedge accounting is applied to derivatives in order to re/fl.ligaect into the /fi.liganancial statements the e/ff.ligaect of the Group's risk management strategies.\n\nAccordingly, at the inception of the transaction the Group documents the hedge relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy. The Group also assesses, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, whether hedging instruments are highly e/ff.ligaective in o/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing changes in the fair values or cash /fl.ligaows of hedged items. On the basis of management's judgment, the e/ff.ligaectiveness assessment based on the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, the dominance of credit risk in the changes in fair value and the hedge ratio, as well as the measurement of the ine/ff.ligaectiveness, is evaluated through a qualitative assessment or a quantitative computation, depending on the speci/fi.ligac facts and circumstances and on the characteristics of the hedged items and the hedging instruments.\n\nFor cash /fl.ligaow hedges of forecast transactions designated as hedged items, management assesses and documents that they are highly probable and present an exposure to changes in cash /fl.ligaows that a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nFor additional details on the key assumptions about e/ff.ligaectiveness  assessment  and  ine/ff.ligaectiveness  measurement, please see note 51.1 'Derivatives designated as hedging instruments'.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe complexity of the assessment of the lease contracts, and also their long-term expiring date, requires considerable professional judgments for application of IFRS 16. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, this regards:\n\n- \u00b7 the application of the de/fi.liganition of a lease to the cases typical of the sectors in which the Group operates;\n- \u00b7 the identi/fi.ligacation of the non-lease component into the lease arrangements;\n- \u00b7 the evaluation of any renewable and termination options included in the lease in order to determine the term of leases, also considering the probability of their exercise and any signi/fi.ligacant leasehold improvements on",

Related pa/r\\_t.ligaies also include entities that operate post-employment bene/fi.ligat plans for employees of Enel SpA or its associates (speci/fi.ligacally, the FOPEN and FONDENEL pension funds), as well as the members of the boards of statutory auditors, and their immediate family, and the key management personnel, and their immediate family, of Enel SpA and its subsidiaries. Key management personnel comprise management personnel who have the power and direct or indirect responsibility for the planning, management and control of the activities of the Company. They include directors (whether executive or not).\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nPursuant to IFRS 10, subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. For more information on the de/fi.liganition of control, please see section 'Determination of the existence of control' in note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nThe /fi.liganancial statements of subsidiaries used to prepare the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements were prepared at December 31, 2023 in accordance with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.\n\nIf  a  subsidiary  uses  di/ff.ligaerent  accounting  policies  from those  adopted  in  preparing  the  consolidated  /fi.liganancial statements for similar transactions and facts in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to ensure conformity with Group accounting policies.\n\nThe /fi.ligagures of the subsidiaries are consolidated on a full line-by-line basis as from the date control is acquired until such control ceases.\n\nPro/fi.ligat or loss for the year and the other comprehensive income are a/t\\_t.ligaributed to owners of the Parent and non-controlling interests, even if this results in a loss for non-controlling interests.\n\nAll intercompany assets and liabilities, equity item, revenue, expenses and cash /fl.ligaows relating to transactions between entities of the Group are eliminated in full.\n\nChanges in ownership interest in subsidiaries that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions, with the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests adjusted to re/fl.ligaect changes in their interests in the subsidiary. Any di/ff.ligaerence between the amount to which non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in consolidated equity.\n\nWhen the Group ceases to have control over a subsidiary, any interest retained in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, at the date when control is lost, recognizing any gain or loss from the loss of control through pro/fi.ligat or loss. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of the former subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nIn the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, investments in associated companies and joint arrangements are measured in accordance with the requirements established by 'IAS 28 - Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures' and 'IFRS 11 - Joint Arrangements'.\n\nIn this respect, an associate is an entity over which the Group has signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence, while a joint venture is a joint  arrangement  over  which  the  Group  exercises  joint control and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss on its investment in an associate or joint venture. If there is objective evidence of a loss of value, the entire carrying amount of the investment undergoes impairment testing pursuant to IAS 36 as a single asset. For more information on impairment, please see the section 'Impairment of non-/fi.liganancial assets' in note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nIf the investment ceases to be an associate or a joint venture, the Group recognizes any retained investment at its fair value, through pro/fi.ligat or loss.

This cost was allocated by recognizing the assets, liabilities and identi/fi.ligaable contingent liabilities of the acquired company at their fair values. Any positive di/ff.ligaerence between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net assets acquired a/t\\_t.ligaributable to owners of the Parent was recognized as goodwill. The carrying amount of non-controlling interests was determined in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the interest held by non-controlling shareholders in the net assets. In the case of business combinations achieved in stages, at\n\nthe date of acquisition any adjustment to the fair value of the net assets acquired previously was recognized in equity; the amount of goodwill was determined for each transaction separately based on the fair values of the acquiree's net assets at the date of each exchange transaction;\n\n- \u00b7 the 'acquisition method', for all business combinations carried out as from January 1, 2010 that are recognized on the basis of IFRS 3 (2008), which is referred to as IFRS 3 (Revised) hereafter, where the purchase cost (the consideration transferred) is equal to the fair value at the purchase date of the assets acquired and the liabilities incurred or assumed, as well as any equity instruments issued by the purchaser. The purchase cost includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. The consideration transferred is allocated by recognizing the assets, liabilities and identi/fi.ligaable contingent liabilities of the acquired company at their fair values as at the acquisition date. In this regard, goodwill is de/fi.liganed as the excess of the consideration transferred, measured at fair value as at the acquisition date, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree plus the fair value of any equity interest in the acquiree previously held by the Group (in a business combination achieved in stages) over the net amount of the identi/fi.ligaable assets acquired and the liabilities incurred or assumed measured at fair value. The carrying amount of non-controlling interests is determined either in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the interest held by non-controlling shareholders in the net identi/fi.ligaable assets of the acquiree or at their fair value as at the acquisition date.\n\nIFRS 3 (Revised) requires, among other things, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 costs directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the acquisition are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss;\n- \u00b7 in the case of business combinations achieved in stages, at the date of acquisition of control the previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value and any positive or negative di/ff.ligaerence is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss;\n- \u00b7 any contingent consideration is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration classi/fi.ligaed as an asset or a liability, or as a /fi.liganancial instrument within the scope of IFRS 9, are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IFRS 9, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS-IAS. Contingent consideration that is classi/fi.ligaed as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent se/t\\_t.ligalement is accounted for within equity;\n- \u00b7 if the fair values of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only be calculated on a provisional basis, the  business  combination  is  recognized  using  such provisional values.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated, from the acquisition date, to each CGU or group of CGUs that is expected to bene/fi.ligat from the synergies of the combination.\n\nFor more information, please see the section 'Impairment of non-/fi.liganancial assets' in note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nGoodwill relating to equity investments in associates and joint venture is included in their carrying amount.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nFor all fair value measurements and disclosures of fair value, that are either required or permi/t\\_t.ligaed by IFRS, the Group applies IFRS 13.\n\nFair value is de/fi.liganed as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction, between market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants, at the measurement date (i.e. an exit price).\n\nThe fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability takes place in the principal market, i.e. the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability. In the absence of a principal market, it is assumed that the transaction takes place in the most advantageous market to which the Group has access, i.e. the market that maximizes the amount that would be received to sell the asset or minimizes the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants act in their economic best interest. Market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants are independent, knowledgeable sellers and buyers who are able to enter into a transaction for the asset or the liability and who are motivated but not forced or otherwise compelled to do so.\n\nWhen measuring fair value, the Group considers the characteristics of the asset or liability, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular:\n\n- \u00b7 for  a  non-/fi.liganancial  asset,  a  fair  value  measurement takes  into  account  a  market  pa/r\\_t.ligaicipant's  ability  to generate economic bene/fi.ligats by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipant that would use the asset in its highest and best use;\n- \u00b7 for liabilities and own equity instruments, the fair value re/fl.ligaects the e/ff.ligaect of non-pe/r\\_f.ligaormance risk, i.e. the risk that an entity will not ful/fi.ligall an obligation, including among others the credit risk of the Group itself.\n\nIn measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities, the Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which su/ffi.ligacient data are available, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.\n\n## Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment\n\nPursuant to IAS 16, prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes expenses directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for its intended use.\n\nThe cost is also increased by the present value of the estimate of the costs of decommissioning and restoring the site on which the asset is located where there is a legal or constructive obligation to do so. The corresponding liability is recognized under provisions for risks and charges. For more information on changes in the estimate of these costs, the passage of time and the discount rate, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgement'.\n\nPrope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment transferred from customers to connect them to the electricity distribution network and/or to provide them with other related services is initially recognized at its fair value at the date on which control is obtained.\n\nBorrowing costs that are directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, i.e. an asset that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalized as pa/r\\_t.liga of the cost of the assets themselves. Borrowing costs associated with the purchase/construction of assets that do not meet such requirement are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nCe/r\\_t.ligaain assets that were revalued at the IFRS transition date or in previous periods are recognized at their fair value, which is considered to be their deemed cost at the revaluation date.\n\nWhere individual items of major components of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment have di/ff.ligaerent useful lives, the components are recognized and depreciated separately.\n\nSubsequent costs are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic bene/fi.ligats associated with the cost incurred to replace a pa/r\\_t.liga of the asset will /fl.ligaow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other costs are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss as incurred.\n\nThe cost of replacing pa/r\\_t.liga or all of an asset is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset and is depreciated over its useful life; the carrying amount of the replaced unit is derecognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nPrope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, net of its residual value, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is reviewed annually.

Assets recognized under prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment are derecognized either upon their disposal (i.e. at the date the recipient obtains control) or when no future eco-\n\nnomic bene/fi.ligat is expected from their use or disposal. Any gain or loss, recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the net disposal proceeds, determined in accordance with the transaction price requirements of IFRS 15, and the carrying amount of the derecognized assets.\n\n## Assets to be relinquished free of charge\n\nThe Group's plants include assets to be relinquished free of charge at the end of the concessions. These mainly regard major water diversion works and the public lands used for the operation of the thermal power plants.\n\nWithin the Italian regulatory framework in force until 2011, if the concessions are not renewed, at those dates all intake and governing works, penstocks, out/fl.ligaow channels and other assets on public lands were to be relinquished free of charge to the State in good operating condition. Accordingly,  depreciation  on  assets  to  be  relinquished was calculated over the sho/r\\_t.ligaer of the term of the concession and the useful life of the assets.\n\nIn the wake of the legislative changes introduced with Law 134 of August 7, 2012, the assets previously classi/fi.ligaed as assets 'to be relinquished free of charge' connected with the  hydroelectric  water  diversion  concessions  are  now considered in the same manner as other categories of 'prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment' and are therefore depreciated over the useful life of the asset (where this exceeds the term of the concession), as discussed in the section above on the 'Depreciable amount of ce/r\\_t.ligaain elements of Italian hydroelectric plants subsequent to enactment of Law 134/2012', which you are invited to consult for more details.\n\nIn accordance with Spanish laws 29/1985 and 46/1999, hydroelectric power stations in Spanish territory operate under administrative concessions at the end of which the plants will be returned to the government in good operating condition. The terms of the concessions extend up to 2078. A number of generation companies that operate in Latin America hold administrative concessions with similar conditions to those applied under the Spanish concession system. These concessions will expire in Argentina in 2087, in Brazil in 2047, in Costa Rica in 2031, in Panama and in Guatemala in 2062.\n\n## Service concession arrangements\n\nWhen acting as operator under 'public-to-private' service concession arrangements, the Group constructs/upgrades infrastructure used to provide a public service and/ or operates and maintains that infrastructure for the years of the concession, in accordance with the terms speci/fi.ligaed in the contract.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Group does not account for the infrastructure operated under a service concession\n\n<!-- image -->",

In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, when the Group provides construction or upgrade services, depending on the characteristics of the service concession arrangement, it recognizes:\n\n- \u00b7 a /fi.liganancial asset, if the Group has an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another /fi.liganancial asset from the grantor (or from a third pa/r\\_t.ligay at the direction of the grantor), that is the grantor has li/t\\_t.ligale discretion to avoid payment; and/or\n- \u00b7 an intangible asset, if the Group receives the right (a license) to charge users of the public service provided and thus does not have an unconditional right to receive cash because the amounts are contingent on the extent that the public uses the service.\n\nIf the Group (as operator) has a contractual right to receive an intangible asset, borrowing costs are capitalized using the criteria speci/fi.ligaed in note 19 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment'.\n\nHowever, for construction/upgrade services, both types of consideration are classi/fi.ligaed as a contract asset during the construction/upgrade period.\n\nFor more details about such consideration, please see note 11.a 'Revenue from sales and services'.\n\nConversely, where the service concession arrangement provides for the infrastructure used for to operate the concessions themselves do not comply with the requirements established by IFRIC 12 and, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, are owned and available to the operator or have an inde/fi.liganite expiry, the carrying amount of the assets a/t\\_t.ligaributable to these concessions  is  recognized  under  'Prope/r\\_t.ligay,  plant  and equipment' and accounted for in accordance with IAS 16. Information on the main characteristics of the Group's service concession arrangements can be found in note 20 'Infrastructure within the scope of 'IFRIC 12 - Service Concession Arrangements''.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease applying the de/fi.liganition of a lease under IFRS 16, that is met if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/fi.ligaed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nWhen the Group acts as a lessee, it recognizes a right-ofuse asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use).\n\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which includes the initial amount of lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to retire and remove the underlying asset and to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located.\n\nRight-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated on a straight-line basis over the sho/r\\_t.ligaer of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the right-of-use assets.\n\n|                                              |   Average residual life  (years) |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Buildings                                    |                                8 |\n| Ground rights of energy plants               |                               32 |\n| Vehicles and other means of transpo/r\\_t.liga |                                4 |\n\nIf the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group at the end of the lease term or if the cost of the right-of-use asset re/fl.ligaects the fact that the Group will exercise a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the underlying asset.\n\nIn  addition,  the  right-of-use  assets  are  subject  to  impairment testing and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date when the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.\n\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the lease liability is measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost using the e/ff.ligaective interest method and is remeasured upon the occurrence of ce/r\\_t.ligaain events.\n\nThe Group applies the sho/r\\_t.liga-term lease recognition exemption to its lease contracts that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date. It also applies the low-value assets recognition exemption to lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low-value whose amount is estimated not material. For example, the Group has leases of ce/r\\_t.ligaain o/ffi.ligace equipment (i.e. personal computers, printing and photocopying machines) that are considered of low value. Lease payments on sho/r\\_t.liga-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nPursuant to IAS 38, intangible assets are identi/fi.ligaable assets without physical substance controlled by the Group, when it is probable that the use of such assets will generate future economic bene/fi.ligats and the related cost can be reliably determined.\n\nThey are measured at purchase or internal development cost for internally generated assets and are recognized only when the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the asset, its intention and ability to complete development and to use or sell the asset and the availability of resources to complete the asset.\n\nThe cost includes any directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable expenses necessary to make the assets ready for their intended use.",

For the estimate of the recoverable amount, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nThe recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset do not generate cash in/fl.ligaows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and therefore it is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset or of a CGU to which it is allocated is greater than its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss and presented under 'Depreciation, amo/r\\_t.ligaization and other impairment losses'.\n\nImpairment losses of CGUs are /fi.ligarstly charged against the carrying amount of any goodwill a/t\\_t.ligaributed to it and then against the other assets, in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to their carrying amount.\n\nIf the reasons for a previously recognized impairment loss no longer apply, the carrying amount of the asset is restored through pro/fi.ligat or loss, under 'Depreciation, amortization and other impairment losses', in an amount that shall not exceed the carrying amount that the asset would have had if the impairment loss had not been recognized. The original amount of goodwill is not restored even if in subsequent years the reasons for the impairment no longer apply.\n\n## Inventories\n\nPursuant to IAS 2, inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value except for inventories involved in trading activities, which are measured at fair value with recognition through pro/fi.ligat or loss.

For more details on inventories, please see note 58 'Environmental programs'.\n\nMaterials and other consumables (including energy commodities) held for use in production are not wri/t\\_t.ligaen down if it is expected that the /fi.liganal product in which they will be incorporated will be sold at a price su/ffi.ligacient to enable recovery of the cost incurred.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments are recognized and measured in accordance with 'IAS 32 - Financial Instruments: Presentation' and 'IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments'.\n\nA /fi.liganancial asset or liability is recognized in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements when, and only when, the Group becomes pa/r\\_t.ligay to the contractual provision of the instrument (i.e. the trade date).\n\nTrade receivables arising from contracts with customers, in the scope of IFRS 15, are initially measured at their transaction price (as de/fi.liganed in IFRS 15) if such receivables do not contain a signi/fi.ligacant /fi.liganancing component or when the Group applies the practical expedient allowed by IFRS 15.\n\nConversely, the Group initially measures /fi.liganancial assets other than the above-mentioned trade receivables at their fair value plus, in the case of a /fi.liganancial asset not measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, transaction costs. Financial assets are classi/fi.ligaed, at initial recognition, as /fi.liganancial assets at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, on the basis of both:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's business model for managing /fi.liganancial assets, that is the way in which the Group manages its /fi.liganancial assets in order to generate cash /fl.ligaows (i.e. collecting contractual cash /fl.ligaows, selling the /fi.liganancial assets, or both); and\n- \u00b7 the contractual cash /fl.ligaow characteristics of the instrument, to determine whether the instrument gives rise to cash /fl.ligaows that are solely payments of principal and interest based on the SPPI test.\n\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, /fi.liganancial assets are classi/fi.ligaed in four categories:\n\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost (debt instruments);\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial assets at fair value through OCI with reclassi/fi.ligacation of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments);\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no reclassi/fi.ligacation of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments); and\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial assets at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost\n\nThis category mainly includes trade receivables, other /fi.liganancial assets and loan assets.\n\nFinancial assets at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost are held within a business model whose objective is to hold /fi.liganancial assets in order to collect contractual cash /fl.ligaows and whose contractual terms give rise, on speci/fi.ligaed dates, to cash /fl.ligaows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nSuch assets are initially recognized at fair value, adjusted for any transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost using the e/ff.ligaective interest method and are subject to impairment.\n\nGains and losses are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss when the asset is derecognized, modi/fi.ligaed or impaired.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - Debt instruments\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are assets held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash /fl.ligaows and selling /fi.liganancial assets and whose contractual cash /fl.ligaows give rise, on speci/fi.ligaed dates, to cash /fl.ligaows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nChanges in fair value for these /fi.liganancial assets are recognized in other comprehensive income as well as loss allowances that do not reduce the carrying amount of the /fi.liganancial assets.\n\nWhen a /fi.liganancial asset is derecognized (e.g., at the time of sale), the cumulative gains and losses previously recognized in equity (except impairment and foreign exchange gains and losses to be recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss) are reversed to pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - Equity instruments\n\nThis category includes mainly equity investments in other entities irrevocably designated as such upon initial recognition.\n\nGains and losses on these /fi.liganancial assets are never reclassi/fi.ligaed to pro/fi.ligat or loss. The Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.\n\nEquity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment testing.",

Dividends on such investments are also recognized as other income in the income statement when the right of payment has been established.\n\n## Impairment of /fi.liganancial assets\n\nAt each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, the Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables and other /fi.liganancial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), contract assets and all other assets within the scope of IFRS 9.\n\nThe impairment model adopted by the Group in compliance with IFRS 9 is based on the determination of expected credit losses (ECL) using a forward-looking approach. For trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, including those with a signi/fi.ligacant /fi.liganancial component, the Group adopts the simpli/fi.ligaed approach, determining expected credit losses over a period corresponding to\n\nthe entire life of the asset, generally equal to 12 months.\n\nFor all /fi.liganancial assets other than trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, the Group applies the general approach under IFRS 9, based on the assessment of a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.\n\nThe Group recognizes in pro/fi.ligat or loss, as an impairment gain or loss, the amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date.\n\nThe Group applies the low credit risk exemption, avoiding the recognition of loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses due to a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk of debt securities at fair value through OCI,\n\nwhose counterpa/r\\_t.ligay has a strong /fi.liganancial capacity to meet its contractual cash /fl.ligaow obligations (e.g., investment grade). For more information on the impairment of /fi.liganancial assets, please see note 48 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThis category includes deposits that are available on demand or at very sho/r\\_t.liga term, as well as highly liquid sho/r\\_t.ligaterm /fi.liganancial investments that are readily conve/r\\_t.ligaible into a known amount of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nIn addition, for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash /fl.ligaows, cash and cash equivalents do not include bank overdrafts at period-end.\n\n## Financial liabilities at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost\n\nThis category mainly includes borrowings, trade payables, lease liabilities and debt instruments.\n\nFinancial liabilities, other than derivatives, are recognized when the Group becomes a pa/r\\_t.ligay to the contractual clauses of the instrument and are initially measured at fair value adjusted for directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable transaction costs. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method. The e/ff.ligaective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the /fi.liganancial instrument or a sho/r\\_t.ligaer period, where appropriate, to the carrying amount of the /fi.liganancial asset or liability.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss mainly include:\n\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial liabilities held for trading incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term;\n- \u00b7 derivative  /fi.liganancial  instruments  entered  into  by  the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as de/fi.liganed by IFRS 9;\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial liabilities that qualify as contingent consideration.\n\n## Derecognition of /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets are derecognized whenever one of the following conditions is met:\n\n- \u00b7 the contractual right to receive the cash /fl.ligaows associated with the asset expires;\n- \u00b7 the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the asset, transferring its rights to receive the cash /fl.ligaows of the asset or assuming a contractual obligation to pay such cash /fl.ligaows to one or more bene/fi.ligaciaries under a contract that meets the requirements provided by IFRS 9 (the 'pass through test');\n- \u00b7 the Group has not transferred or retained substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the asset but has transferred control over the asset.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "On derecognition of a /fi.liganancial asset, the Group recognizes the di/ff.ligaerence between the carrying amount (measured at the date of derecognition) and the consideration received through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognized when they are extinguished, i.e. when the contractual obligation has been discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\nWhen an existing /fi.liganancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially di/ff.ligaerent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modi/fi.ligaed, such an exchange or modi/fi.ligacation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The di/ff.ligaerence in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Derivative /fi.liganancial instruments\n\nDerivative instruments are classi/fi.ligaed as /fi.liganancial assets or liabilities depending on the positive or negative fair value and they are classi/fi.ligaed as 'held for trading' within 'Other business models' and measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, except for those designated as e/ff.ligaective hedging instruments.\n\nAll derivatives held for trading are classi/fi.ligaed as current assets or liabilities.\n\nDerivatives not held for trading purposes, but measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss since they do not qualify for hedge accounting, and derivatives designated as e/ff.ligaective hedging instruments are classi/fi.ligaed as current or not current on the basis of their maturity date and the Group intention to hold the /fi.liganancial instrument till maturity or not.\n\nFor  more  details  on  derivatives  and  hedge  accounting, please see note 51 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nAn embedded derivative is a derivative included in a 'combined' contract (the so-called 'hybrid instrument') that contains another non-derivative contract (the so-called 'host contract') and gives rise to some or all of the combined  contract's  cash  /fl.ligaows.  Embedded  derivatives  are separated from the host contract and accounted for as derivatives when:\n\n- \u00b7 the host contract is not a /fi.liganancial instrument measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss;\n- \u00b7 the economic risks and characteristics of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract;\n- \u00b7 a separate contract with the same terms as the embed-\n- ded derivative would meet the de/fi.liganition of a derivative.\n\nEmbedded derivatives that are separated from the host contract  are  recognized  in  the  consolidated  /fi.liganancial statements at fair value with changes recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss (except when the embedded derivative is pa/r\\_t.liga of a designated hedge relationship).\n\nContracts that do not represent /fi.liganancial instruments to be measured at fair value are analyzed in order to identify\n\nany embedded derivatives, which are to be separated and measured at fair value. This analysis is pe/r\\_f.ligaormed when the Group becomes pa/r\\_t.ligay to the contract or when the contract is renegotiated in a manner that signi/fi.ligacantly changes the original associated cash /fl.ligaows.\n\nThe main Group contracts that may contain embedded derivatives are contracts to buy or sell energy commodities.\n\n## Contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items\n\nIn general, contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items that are entered into and continue to be held for receipt or delivery in accordance with the Group's normal expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are out of the scope of IFRS 9 and then recognized as executory contracts, in accordance with the 'own use exemption'.\n\nA contract to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items is classi/fi.ligaed as 'normal purchase or sale' if it is entered into:\n\n- \u00b7 for the purpose of the physical se/t\\_t.ligalement;\n- \u00b7 in accordance with the entity's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.\n\nMoreover, contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items with physical se/t\\_t.ligalement (for example, /fi.ligaxed-price forward contracts on energy commodities) that do not qualify for the own use exemption are recognized as derivatives measured at fair value from the trade date only if:\n\n- \u00b7 they can be se/t\\_t.ligaled net in cash; and\n- \u00b7 they are not entered into in accordance with the Group's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.\n\nTrading contracts are valued at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss; the results of the measurement of changes in the fair value of contracts still outstanding at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date are recognized on a net basis under the item 'Net results from commodity contracts', while at the se/t\\_t.ligalement date:\n\n- \u00b7 the results of the measurement of changes in the fair value of closed contracts for the sale of energy commodities as well as the related revenue, together with the impact on pro/fi.ligat or loss of the derecognition of the derivative, are recognized under 'Revenue from sales and services';\n- \u00b7 the results of the measurement of changes in the fair value of closed contracts for the purchase of energy commodities as well as the related cost, together with the impact on pro/fi.ligat or loss of the derecognition of the derivative, are recognized under 'Electricity, gas and fuel' and 'Services and other materials'.\n\nContracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items falling within the scope of application of IFRS 9 can also be subsequently designated as hedging instruments if they satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting.\n\nThe Group analyzes all contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial assets on an ongoing basis, with a speci/fi.ligac focus on forward purchases and sales of electricity and energy commodities, in order to determine if they shall be classi/fi.ligaed and treated in accordance with IFRS 9 or if they have been entered into for 'own use'.",

Conversely, during the hyperin/fl.ligaationary period (until it ceases), the gain or loss resulting from adjustments is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss and disclosed separately in /fi.liganancial income and expense.\n\nThese provisions are applied to the Group's transactions in Argentina, whose economy has been declared hyperin/fl.ligaationary since July 1, 2018.\n\n## Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nPursuant to IFRS 5, non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction, rather than through continuing use.\n\nThis  classi/fi.ligacation criterion  is  applicable  only  when non-current assets (or disposal groups) are available in their present condition for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable.\n\nFor  more  details  on  the  requirements  for  determining whether a sale is highly probable, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nIf the Group is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to a sale program involving loss of control of a subsidiary and the requirements provided for under IFRS 5 are met, all the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale when the classi/fi.ligacation criteria are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.\n\nThe Group applies these classi/fi.ligacation criteria as envisaged in IFRS 5 to an investment, or a po/r\\_t.ligaion of an investment, in an associate or a joint venture. Any retained portion of an investment in an associate or a joint venture that has not been classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale is accounted for using the equity method until disposal of the po/r\\_t.ligaion that is classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale takes place.\n\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) and liabilities of disposal groups classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale are presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the consoli-\n\ndated statement of /fi.liganancial position.\n\nThe amounts presented for non-current assets or for the assets and liabilities of disposal groups classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale are not reclassi/fi.ligaed or re-presented for prior periods presented.\n\nImmediately before the initial classi/fi.ligacation of non-current assets (or disposal groups) as held for sale, the carrying amounts of such assets (or disposal groups) are measured in accordance with the accounting standard applicable to those assets or liabilities. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses for any initial or subsequent writedown of the assets (or disposal groups) to fair value less costs to sell and gains for their reversals are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss from continuing operations.\n\nNon-current  assets  are  not  depreciated  (or  amo/r\\_t.ligaized) while they are classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale or while they are pa/r\\_t.liga of a disposal group classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale.\n\nIf a component of the Group is a discontinued operation, the Group presents, in a separate line item of the income statement, a single amount comprising the total of:\n\n- \u00b7 the post-tax pro/fi.ligat or loss of discontinued operations; and\n- \u00b7 the post-tax gain or loss recognized on the measurement at fair value less costs to sell or on the disposal of the assets or disposal groups constituting the discontinued operation.\n\nThe  corresponding  amount  is  restated  in  the  income statement  for  prior  periods  presented  in  the  /fi.liganancial statements, so that the disclosures relate to all operations that are discontinued by the end of the current repo/r\\_t.ligaing period. If the Group ceases to classify a component as held for sale, the results of the component previously presented in discontinued operations are reclassi/fi.ligaed and included in pro/fi.ligat or loss from continuing operations for all periods presented.\n\n## Environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates\n\nIn the absence of speci/fi.ligac IAS/IFRS rules, the accounting treatment adopted by the Group complies with the general rules included in the body of applicable IAS/IFRS accounting standards and with international best practice. In  pa/r\\_t.ligaicular,  the  Group  accounting  treatment  of  environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates re/fl.ligaects the business model of the entities involved and, therefore, the di/ff.ligaerent features of the business conducted by these entities, distinguishing between those that generate electricity from renewable sources, obligated pa/r\\_t.ligaies, traders and other entities that operate in the energy services sector even though they are not obligated pa/r\\_t.ligaies.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligaher details on the application of this accounting model are provided in note 58 'Environmental programs'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Employee bene/fi.ligats\n\n## Post-employment and other long-term bene/fi.ligats\n\nPursuant to IAS 19, the Group determines separately for each plan liabilities related to employee bene/fi.ligats paid upon or after ceasing employment or other long-term bene/fi.ligats accrued during the employment period. The Group uses actuarial assumptions to estimate the amount of the future bene/fi.ligats that employees have accrued at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date (using the projected unit credit method) and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those plans.\n\nThe liability, net of any plan assets, is recognized on an accrual basis over the vesting period of the related rights. These appraisals are pe/r\\_f.ligaormed by independent actuaries.\n\nIf the plan assets exceed the present value of the related de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat obligation, the surplus (up to the limit of any cap) is recognized as an asset.\n\nAs regards the liabilities/(assets) of de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plans, the Group recognizes the cumulative actuarial gains and losses from the actuarial measurement of the liabilities, the return on the plan assets (net of the associated interest income) and the e/ff.ligaect of the asset ceiling (net of the associated interest) in other comprehensive income when they occur. For other long-term bene/fi.ligats, the related actuarial gains and losses are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nIn addition, the Group is involved in de/fi.liganed contribution plans under which it pays /fi.ligaxed contributions to a separate entity (a fund) and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay fu/r\\_t.ligaher contributions if the fund does not hold su/ffi.ligacient assets to pay all employee bene/fi.ligats relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Such plans are usually aimed to supplement pension bene/fi.ligats due to employees post-employment. The related costs are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss on the basis of the amount of contributions paid in the period.\n\n## Termination bene/fi.ligats\n\nPursuant to IAS 19, liabilities for bene/fi.ligats due to employees for the early termination of employee service arise out of the Group's decision to terminate an employee's employment before the normal retirement date or an employee's decision to accept an o/ff.ligaer of bene/fi.ligats in exchange for the termination of employment.\n\nTermination bene/fi.ligats are recognized at the earlier of the following dates:\n\n- \u00b7 when the entity can no longer withdraw its o/ff.ligaer of bene/fi.ligats; and\n- \u00b7 when the entity recognizes a cost for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination bene/fi.ligats.\n\nThe liabilities are measured on the basis of the nature of the employee bene/fi.ligats.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe  Group  unde/r\\_t.ligaakes  share-based  payment  transactions se/t\\_t.ligaled with equity instruments as pa/r\\_t.liga of the remuneration policy adopted for the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer/ General Manager and for key management personnel.\n\nThe most recent long-term incentive plans provide for the grant to recipients of an incentive represented by an equity component (se/t\\_t.ligaled with equity instruments) and a monetary component (paid in cash), which will accrue if speci/fi.ligac conditions are met.\n\nPursuant to IFRS 2, the Group classi/fi.ligaes the monetary component as a cash-se/t\\_t.ligaled transaction if it is based on the price (or value) of the equity instruments of the company that issued the plan or, in other cases, as another long-term employee bene/fi.ligat.\n\nIn order to se/t\\_t.ligale the equity component through the bonus award of Enel shares, a program for the purchase of treasury shares to suppo/r\\_t.liga these plans was approved. For more details on share-based incentive plans, please see note 53 'Share-based payments'.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular for the equity component, the Group recognizes the services rendered by employees as personnel expenses over the period in which the conditions for remaining in service and for achieving ce/r\\_t.ligaain results must be satis/fi.ligaed (vesting period) and indirectly estimates their value, and the corresponding increase in a speci/fi.ligac equity item, on the basis of the fair value of the equity instruments (i.e. the issuer shares) at the grant date.\n\nThe overall expense recognized is adjusted at each repo/r\\_t.ligaing  date  until  the  vesting  date  to  re/fl.ligaect  the  best estimate available to the Group of the number of equity instruments for which the service and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance conditions other than market conditions or non-vesting conditions will be satis/fi.ligaed at the end of the vesting period.\n\nConversely, if the incentive based on equity instruments is paid in cash, the Group recognizes the services rendered by employees as personnel expenses over the vesting period and a corresponding liability measured at the fair value of the liability incurred. Subsequently, and until its extinction, the liability is remeasured at fair value at each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, considering the best possible estimate of the incentive that will vest, with changes in fair value recognized under personnel expenses.\n\n## Provisions for risks and charges\n\nPursuant to IAS 37, provisions are recognized where there is a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, the se/t\\_t.ligalement of which is expected to result in an out/fl.ligaow of resources whose amount can be reliably estimated.

Such a liability is recognized when a constructive obligation is established, i.e. when the Group has approved a detailed formal restructuring plan and has sta/r\\_t.ligaed to implement the plan or has announced its main features to those a/ff.ligaected by it.\n\nProvisions do not include liabilities in respect of unce/r\\_t.ligaain\n\nincome tax treatments that are recognized as tax liabilities.

In this case, the Group assesses whether the warranty provides the customer with assurance that the related product will function as the pa/r\\_t.ligaies intended because it complies with agreed-upon speci/fi.ligacations or whether the warranty provides the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon speci/fi.ligacations.\n\nAfter the assessment, if the Group establishes that an assurance warranty is provided, it recognizes a separate warranty liability and corresponding expense when transferring the product to the customer, as additional costs of providing goods or services, without a/t\\_t.ligaributing any of the transaction price (and therefore revenue) to the warranty. The liability is measured and presented as a provision.\n\nOtherwise, if the Group determines that a service warranty is provided, it accounts for the promised warranty as a pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation in accordance with IFRS 15, recognizing the contract liability as revenue over the period the warranty service is provided and the costs associated as they are incurred.\n\nFinally, if the warranty includes both an assurance element and a service element and the Group cannot reasonably\n\naccount for them separately, then it accounts for both of the warranties together as a single pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation.\n\nChanges in estimates of accruals to the provisions addressed here are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss in the period in which the changes occur, with the exception of those in the costs of decommissioning, retiring and/or restoration resulting from changes in the timetable and costs necessary to extinguish the obligation or from a change in the discount rate. These changes increase or decrease the carrying amount of the related assets and are taken to pro/fi.ligat or loss through depreciation. Where they increase the carrying amount of the assets, it is also determined whether the new carrying amount of the assets is fully recoverable. If this is not the case, a loss equal to the unrecoverable amount is recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nDecreases in estimates are recognized up to the carrying amount of the assets. Any excess is recognized immediately in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nFor more information on the estimation criteria adopted in determining provisions for retiring and/or restoration of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, especially those associated with decommissioning nuclear power plants and storage  of  waste  fuel  and  other  radioactive  materials, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nThe Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers at an amount that re/fl.ligaects the consideration at which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, using the /fi.ligave-step model envisaged by IFRS 15:\n\n- \u00b7 identify the contract with the customer;\n- \u00b7 identify the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligations in the contract, that is, all goods or services promised in the contract;\n- \u00b7 determine  the  transaction  price  at  inception  of  the contract considering any variable considerations, noncash consideration received from a customer or payable to the customer, signi/fi.ligacant /fi.liganancing components;\n- \u00b7 allocate the transaction price, at contract inception, to each separate pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation;\n- \u00b7 recognize revenue, when (or as) each pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation is satis/fi.ligaed by transferring the promised good or service to the customer.\n\nThe Group does not disclose the information about the remaining pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligations in existing contracts if the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation is pa/r\\_t.liga of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less and if the Group recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice the customer.\n\nMore information on the application of this revenue recognition model is provided in note 2.1 'Use of estimates\n\n<!-- image -->",

The loan is initially recognized and measured at fair value and the government grant is measured as the di/ff.ligaerence between the initial carrying amount of the loan and the funds received. The loan is subsequently measured in accordance with the requirements for /fi.liganancial liabilities.\n\nGovernment grants are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group recognizes as expenses the costs that the grants are intended to compensate.\n\nA government grant received to compensate for costs or losses already incurred, or for the purpose of providing immediate /fi.liganancial suppo/r\\_t.liga to the Group without related future costs, is recognized as income in the year in which it becomes enforceable.\n\nWhen government grants are received to purchase, build or otherwise acquire non-current assets (for example, an item of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment or an intangible asset), they are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss over the depreciable/amo/r\\_t.ligaizable life of the asset as a reduction in the depreciation/amo/r\\_t.ligaization charge. If there is insu/ffi.ligacient information to enable adequate a/t\\_t.ligaribution to the /fi.ligaxed assets to which they refer, capital grants are recognized\n\nas deferred income under other liabilities, and credited to pro/fi.ligat or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset. If a government grant is made in a period subsequent to that in which the depreciation of the assets began, the po/r\\_t.ligaion of the grant corresponding to the depreciation recognized in previous periods is recognized directly in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nWhere the Group receives government grants in the form of a transfer of a non-monetary asset for the use of the Group, it accounts for both the grant and the asset at the fair value of the non-monetary asset received at the date of the transfer.\n\n## Net results from commodity contracts\n\nThe net results from commodity contracts include:\n\n- \u00b7 the  net  income  or  expense  from  commodity  derivatives, including derivatives designated as cash /fl.ligaow hedges and derivatives measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, whether se/t\\_t.ligaled or outstanding at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date; and\n- \u00b7 the net gain/(loss) from the measurement through profit or loss of energy commodity contracts with physical se/t\\_t.ligalement still outstanding at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date.\n\n## Dividends\n\nPursuant to 'IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments', dividends are recognized when the unconditional right to receive payment is established.\n\nDividends and interim dividends payable to the Parent's shareholders  and  non-controlling  interests  are  recognized as changes in equity in the period in which they are approved by the Shareholders' Meeting and the Board of Directors, respectively.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIAS 12 speci/fi.ligaes the requirements for the recognition of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The uncertainty in the determination of tax liabilities is de/fi.liganed in accordance with the provisions of 'IFRIC 23 - Unce/r\\_t.ligaainty over Income Tax Treatments'.\n\n## Current income taxes\n\nCurrent income taxes for the year, which are recognized under 'Income tax liabilities' net of payments on account, or under 'Tax assets' where there is a credit balance, are determined using an estimate of taxable income and in conformity with the applicable regulations.\n\nSuch liabilities and assets are determined using the tax rates and tax laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period in the countries where taxable income has been generated.\n\nCurrent income taxes are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss with the exception of current income taxes related to items recognized outside pro/fi.ligat or loss that are recognized in equity.",

Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary di/ff.ligaerences, the carry forward of tax losses and any unused tax credits. For more information concerning the recoverability of such assets, please see the appropriate section of the discussion of estimates.\n\nDeferred taxes and liabilities are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss, with the exception of those in respect of items recognized outside pro/fi.ligat or loss that are recognized in equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are o/ff.ligaset only if there is a legally enforceable right to o/ff.ligaset current tax assets with current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or di/ff.ligaerent taxable entities which intend either to se/t\\_t.ligale current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realize the assets and se/t\\_t.ligale the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which signi/fi.ligacant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be se/t\\_t.ligaled or recovered.\n\n## Unce/r\\_t.ligaainty over income tax treatments\n\nIn de/fi.liganing 'unce/r\\_t.ligaainty', it shall be considered whether a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular tax treatment will be accepted by the relevant taxation authority. If it is deemed probable that the tax treatment will be accepted (where the term 'probable' is de/fi.liganed as 'more likely than not'), then the Group recognizes and measures its current/deferred tax asset or liabilities applying the requirements in IAS 12.\n\nConversely, when the Group feels that it is not likely that the taxation authority will accept the tax treatment for income tax purposes, the Group re/fl.ligaects the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty in the manner that best predicts the resolution of the uncertain tax treatment.\n\nFor more information on unce/r\\_t.ligaainty over tax treatments, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nSince unce/r\\_t.ligaain income tax positions meet the de/fi.liganition of income taxes, the Group presents unce/r\\_t.ligaain tax liabilities/assets as current tax liabilities/assets or deferred tax liabilities/assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 3. New and amended standards and interpretations\n\nThe Group has applied the following standards, interpretations and amendments that took e/ff.ligaect as from January 1, 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 'Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 - Disclosure of Accounting Policies' , issued in February 2021. The amendments are intended to provide suppo/r\\_t.liga in deciding which policies to disclose. In this regard:\n- -the amendments to 'IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial  Statements'  require  disclosures  of  'material' accounting policies rather than 'signi/fi.ligacant' policies;\n- -the amendments to 'IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements' are intended to provide guidance on how to apply the concept of materiality to accounting policy disclosures.\n\nIn the absence of an IFRS de/fi.liganition of 'signi/fi.ligacant' in the context of disclosures on accounting policies, the term has been replaced with 'material'. The de/fi.liganition of material was modi/fi.ligaed in October 2018, and aligned with  the  IFRS  and  the  Conceptual  Framework  and, therefore, is widely understood by primary users of /fi.liganancial statements. In accordance with IAS 1, information on accounting policies is material if, either individually or in combination with other information, it could reasonably be expected to in/fl.ligauence decisions that the primary users of the /fi.liganancial statements make on the basis of such /fi.liganancial statements. When assessing the materiality of the disclosures on accounting policies, it is appropriate to consider both the magnitude of the transactions, other events or conditions, and their nature. However, although a transaction, other event or condition to which the disclosures on accounting policies refer may be material, this does not imply that the corresponding information is material for the purposes of the /fi.liganancial statements. In this context, the amendments to the IFRS Practice Statement 2 seek to provide guidance on how to determine whether disclosure of an accounting policy is material for /fi.liganancial statement purposes.  These  amendments  aim  to:  (i)  clarify  that materiality judgments about disclosures of accounting policies should follow the same guidance in materiality judgments about other information, therefore considering both qualitative and quantitative factors; (ii) underscore the impo/r\\_t.ligaance of providing information on accounting policies that is speci/fi.ligac to the Group; and (iii) provide examples of situations where generic or standardized information, although summarizing or duplicating the requirements of the IFRS, can be considered disclosure of material accounting policies.\n\nThe disclosures on accounting policies have been revised in line with the requirements established by the amendments and have been updated in note 2.2 'Material accounting policies'.\n\n- \u00b7 'Amendments to IAS 8 - De/fi.liganition of Accounting Estimates' ,  issued  in  February  2021. The  amendments clarify how companies should distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. The de/fi.liganition of changes in accounting estimates has been replaced with a de/fi.liganition of accounting estimates as 'monetary amounts in /fi.liganancial statements that are subject to measurement unce/r\\_t.ligaainty'. In order to clarify the interaction between an accounting policy  and  an  accounting  estimate,  IAS  8  has  been amended to state that an accounting standard may require ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial statement items to be measured at monetary amounts that cannot be directly observed, and therefore must be estimated (since they involve unce/r\\_t.ligaainty in the measurement). In such circumstances, accounting estimates are developed to achieve the objective set out by the accounting policy, including the use of judgments and assumptions based on the latest available, reliable information. The amendments explain how measurement techniques and inputs must be used to develop accounting estimates and establish that measurement techniques include estimation techniques. In order to provide greater guidance, the amendments clarify that the e/ff.ligaects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates unless they result from the correction of prior period errors. Changes in accounting estimates resulting from new information are not corrections of errors. The  application  of  the  amendments  did  not  have  a material impact on these consolidated /fi.liganancial statements.\n- \u00b7 'Amendments to IAS 12 - Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction ',  issued  in  May  2021.  The  amendments clarify that the exemption from initial recognition provided for by the standard no longer applies to transactions that give rise to taxable and deductible temporary di/ff.ligaerences of the same amount.\n\nIn general, the initial recognition exemption provided for by IAS 12 prohibits the recognition of deferred assets and liabilities in respect of the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that does not constitute a business combination and a/ff.ligaects neither accounting pro/fi.ligat nor taxable pro/fi.ligat. As illustrated, the amendments have narrowed the scope of the exception.\n\nFor transactions (e.g., leases and decommissioning liabilities) subject to the amendments, the related deferred assets and liabilities shall be recognized from the beginning of the /fi.ligarst comparative period presented, with any cumulative e/ff.ligaect recognized as an adjustment",

In this regard, the application of the amendments did not produce a material impact on retained earnings in the opening equity of the Enel Group at January 1, 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 'Amendments to IAS 12 - International Tax Reform Pillar II Model Rules' , issued in May 2023. The changes were introduced in response to the Pillar II rules issued by the OECD, the aim of which is to ensure that large multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of income tax, generated in a speci/fi.ligac period, in each jurisdiction in which they operate. In general, these rules require the application of a top-up tax that brings the total amount of taxes paid in each jurisdiction in which they operate to a minimum of 15%.\n\nThe changes introduced:\n\n- -a mandatory temporary exception to the accounting for and disclosure of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from the implementation of the Pillar II rules; and\n- -disclosure requirements to help users of the /fi.liganancial statements be/t\\_t.ligaer understand an entity's exposure to income taxes arising from the rule.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, for periods in which Pillar II legislation is enacted but not yet in e/ff.ligaect, the entity shall disclose qualitative information (such as information regarding how the entity is a/ff.ligaected by Pillar II rules and the main jurisdictions in which exposures might exist) and quantitative information (such as indicating the po/r\\_t.ligaion of pro/fi.ligats that could be subject to Pillar II income taxes and\n\n## 4. Minimum tax\n\nThe Pillar II - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (GloBE Rules), which are intended to ensure that large multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of income tax in each jurisdiction in which they operate, have been enacted or substantially enacted in ce/r\\_t.ligaain jurisdictions in which the Enel Group operates. In general, the rules envisage the application of a 'top-up' tax to the excess pro/fi.ligat in a jurisdiction to bring the e/ff.ligaective tax rate on that income up to a minimum of 15%.\n\nFor this purpose, the Group has conducted an assessment of its potential exposure to the top-up tax in such jurisdictions, which found that there are a limited number of circumstances in which the e/ff.ligaective tax rate is below 15%.\n\nthe average e/ff.ligaective tax rate applicable to such pro/fi.ligats; or indicating how the entity's average e/ff.ligaective tax rate would have changed if Pillar II legislation had been in e/ff.ligaect).\n\nThe Group has adopted the mandatory temporary exception to the recognition of deferred taxation, which applies retrospectively. However, since as at December 31, 2022 no new rule for the application of the top-up tax had yet been issued in any jurisdiction in which the Group operates and no related deferred tax had been recognized as of that date, retrospective application has had no impact on the Group's consolidated /fi.liganancial statements.\n\nFor more information on the disclosure requirements, please see note 4 'Minimum tax'.\n\n- \u00b7 'IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts' , issued in May 2017. The new standard was issued by the IASB to replace IFRS 4,  de/fi.liganing  the  principles  for  the  recognition,  measurement,  presentation  and  disclosure  of  insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts issued and held and investment contracts with discretionary participation features. The standard applies to insurance contracts compliant with the de/fi.liganition of IFRS 17, regardless of the issuer, but includes various exceptions and exemption options that allow ce/r\\_t.ligaain types of contracts that meet the de/fi.liganition of insurance contract to be accounted for by applying another standard. Based on the analysis pe/r\\_f.ligaormed, the new standard has had no impact on the Group's consolidated /fi.liganancial statements .\n\nOn the basis of this assessment, the potential top-up tax that the Enel Group will have to pay as the di/ff.ligaerence between the e/ff.ligaective tax rates calculated per jurisdiction based on the GloBE Rules and the minimum rate of 15% will not have a signi/fi.ligacant impact.\n\nIn application of the provisions of the amendment of 'IAS 12 - International Tax Reform - Pillar II Model Rules', the Group has applied the mandatory temporary exemption to requirements regarding deferred taxes deriving from the application of Pillar II. The Group will recognize the taxes emerging from the application of the rules as current taxes when they are incurred (see note 25 'Deferred tax assets and liabilities').\n\n<!-- image -->",

Argentina - Hyperin/fl.ligaationary economy: impact of the application of IAS 29\n\nAs from July 1, 2018, the Argentine economy has been considered hyperin/fl.ligaationary based on the criteria established by 'IAS 29 - Financial Repo/r\\_t.ligaing in Hyperin/fl.ligaationary Economies'. This designation is determined following an assessment of a series of qualitative and quantitative circumstances, including the presence of a cumulative in/fl.ligaation rate of more than 100% over the previous three years.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  preparing  the  consolidated  /fi.liganancial statements at December 31, 2023, and in accordance with IAS 29, ce/r\\_t.ligaain items of the statements of /fi.liganancial position of the investees in Argentina have been remeasured by applying the general consumer price index to historical data in order to re/fl.ligaect changes in the purchasing power of the Argentine peso at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date for those companies.\n\nBearing in mind that the Enel Group acquired control of the Argentine companies on June 25, 2009, the remeasurement of the non-monetary /fi.liganancial statement /fi.ligagures was conducted by applying the in/fl.ligaation indices sta/r\\_t.ligaing from that date. In addition to being already re/fl.ligaected in the opening statement of /fi.liganancial position, the accounting e/ff.ligaects of that remeasurement also include changes during the period. More speci/fi.ligacally, the e/ff.ligaect of the remeasurement of non-monetary items, the equity items and the income statement items recognized in 2023 was recognized in a speci/fi.ligac line of the income statement under /fi.liganancial income and expense. The associated tax e/ff.ligaect was recognized in taxes for the year.\n\nIn order to also take account of the impact of hyperin/fl.ligaation on the exchange rate of the local currency, the income state-\n\nment balances expressed in the hyperin/fl.ligaationary currency have been translated into the Group's presentation currency (euro) applying, in accordance with IAS 21, the closing exchange rate rather than the average rate for the year in order to adjust these amounts to present values.\n\nThe cumulative changes in the general price indices from December 31, 2018 until December 31, 2023

Climate change disclosures\n\nThe move towards 'net zero' is under way worldwide and the processes of decarbonization and electri/fi.ligacation of the global economy are crucial to avoiding the serious consequences of an increase in temperatures of over 1.5 \u00b0C. With this outlook, the Group has set its strategic guidelines as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 allocate capital to suppo/r\\_t.liga a decarbonized electricity supply;\n- \u00b7 enable  the  electri/fi.ligacation  of  customers'  energy  demand;\n- \u00b7 leverage the creation of value along the value chain;\n- \u00b7 bring forward achievement of the sustainable 'net-zero' goals to 2040.\n\nConsidering the risks related to climate change and the commitments established under the Paris Agreement, the Group has decided to achieve the carbon neutrality objec-\n\ntives in advance and re/fl.ligaect its impact on assets, liabilities, and pro/fi.ligat or loss, highlighting its signi/fi.ligacant and foreseeable impacts as required under the Conceptual Framework of the international accounting standards.\n\nIn this regard, in accordance with the provisions of the document published by the IFRS Foundation in July 2023, the Group provides explicit information in the

In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, management monitors and repo/r\\_t.ligas on pe/r\\_f.ligaormance by business line. Accordingly, the Group has adopted the following repo/r\\_t.ligaing sectors:\n\n- \u00b7 primary segment: Business Line;\n- \u00b7 secondary segment: Geographical Area.\n\nThe business line is therefore the main discriminant in the analyses pe/r\\_f.ligaormed and decisions taken by the management of the Enel Group, and is fully consistent with the internal repo/r\\_t.ligaing prepared for these purposes since the results are measured and evaluated /fi.ligarst and foremost for each business line and only thereafter are they broken down by geographical area.\n\nIn this regard, note that the organizational simpli/fi.ligacation process begun in 2023 led to a restructuring of the business  lines  and  geographical  areas,  with  a  consequent need to rede/fi.ligane the segments subject to disclosure in order to present the results of the segments based on the\n\napproach used by management to monitor and present the Group's pe/r\\_f.ligaormance to investors.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, in the presentation of /fi.ligagures by primary segment (Business Line):\n\n- \u00b7 the /fi.ligagures for Enel X, which in the year ended December 31, 2022 had been presented separately, are now repo/r\\_t.ligaed under End-user Markets;\n- \u00b7 the /fi.ligagures for Enel X Way, which in the year ended December 31, 2022 had been presented under Holding, Services and Other, are now repo/r\\_t.ligaed under End-user Markets.\n\nIn  the  presentation  of  /fi.ligagures  by  secondary  segment (Geographical Area), the /fi.ligagures for Latin America, Europe, No/r\\_t.ligah America, and Africa, Asia and Oceania have merged into the 'Rest of the World' area.\n\nFollowing these changes, the /fi.ligagures for the previous year have been adjusted for comparative purposes only.",

The amount due from customers under a construction contract is presented as a contract asset; the amount due to customers under a construction contract is presented as a contract liability.\n\nWhen the Group provides construction/upgrade services, it recognizes intangible assets and/or /fi.liganancial assets, depending on the characteristics of the service concession arrangement.\n\nThe amounts received or receivable relating to both components are initially recognized as revenue from contracts with customers. For more details on revenue recognition, please refer to the section 'Construction contracts'.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the component recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss deriving from the remeasurement at fair value of the /fi.liganancial assets in respect of service concession agreements for the distribution business in Brazil is also classi/fi.ligaed as revenue, in order to adequately re/fl.ligaect the business model in line with the related concession agreement.\n\nRevenues from management and maintenance activities are recognized as revenue from the sale of electricity on the market or to end users (please refer to sections 'Sale of electricity produced by the Group' and 'Sale/transpo/r\\_t.liga of electricity/gas to end users', respectively).\n\n## 11.b Other income \u20ac2,683 million\n\n|                                                                                                                           | 2023   | 2022   | Change   | Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Grants for environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates (1)                                                                    | 346    | 220    | 126      | 57. 3 %  |\n| Other operating grants                                                                                                    | 9      | 28     | (19)     | -67.9%   |\n| Capital grants (electricity and gas business)                                                                             | 28     | 28     | -        | -        |\n| Sundry reimbursements                                                                                                     | 314    | 314    | -        | -        |\n| Gains on the disposal of subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures, joint  operations and non-current assets held for sale | 584    | 1,876  | (1,292)  | -68.9%   |\n| Gains on the disposal of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, and intangible  assets                                     | 44     | 64     | (20)     | -31.3%   |\n| Service continuity bonuses                                                                                                | 13     | 31     | (18)     | -58.1%   |\n| Other income                                                                                                              | 1,345  | 2,303  | (958)    | -41.6%   |\n| Total                                                                                                                     | 2,683  | 4,864  | (2,181)  | -44.8%   |\n\n- (1) For more on 'Grants for environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates', please see note 58 'Environmental programs'.\n\nGains on the disposal of entities amounted to \u20ac584 million in 2023, mainly re/fl.ligaecting the recognition by Enel CIEN (in Brazil) of \u20ac99 million for the end-of-concession indemnity received for the takeover of the concession by another entity, the overall income of \u20ac103 million from the pa/r\\_t.ligaial sale with loss of control of assets held in Australia, the gain on the sale of Arcadia Generaci\u00f3n Solar (\u20ac195 million) and the remeasurement at fair value of the residual interest in Enel Green Power Hellas (\u20ac160 million).\n\nIn 2022, the item mainly included the recognition of gains on the disposal by Enel X International of 1.1% of the investment in U/fi.liganet (\u20ac220 million), the sale by Enel X Srl of\n\n/fi.liganancial companies to Mooney (\u20ac67 million), the sale of 50% of the investment held by Enel Grids in Gridspe/r\\_t.ligaise (\u20ac520 million) and the sale of Enel Chile's interest in Enel Transmisi\u00f3n Chile.\n\n'Other income' decreased by \u20ac958 million, mainly due to the decrease of income of Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile (\u20ac456 million), mainly in respect of the contractual agreement with Shell, the modi/fi.ligacation of which generated an increase in 2022; the decrease in the income connected with the electricity business recognized in Argentina (\u20ac219 million) following the agreements concluded in 2022 be-\n\n<!-- image -->",

The above circumstances constituted evidence of low margins, which, following IAS 36 impairment testing, indicate that their carrying amount cannot be completely recovered.\n\nImpairment losses in 2023 also include value adjustments of thermal generation assets in the non-peninsular terri-\n\ntories in Spain (\u20ac91 million), in line with the decarbonization process pursued by the Group, and the value adjustment of Windpeshi wind project in Colombia (\u20ac171 million) as a result of the implementation of a disposal program for the related assets, which prompted their classi/fi.ligacation as assets held for sale.\n\nImpairment gains of \u20ac39 million mainly regards generation assets in Colombia of Sociedad Po/r\\_t.ligauaria Central Ca/r\\_t.ligaagena SA, which had been wri/t\\_t.ligaen down in 2022 to re/fl.ligaect their realizable value.\n\n'Reclassi/fi.ligacations from/to assets held for sale' refer mainly to electricity distribution and supply assets held by Enel Distribuci\u00f3n Per\u00fa SAA in Peru, generation assets held by Enel  Generaci\u00f3n  Per\u00fa,  Compa\u00f1\u00eda  Energ\u00e9tica  Veracruz, and Enel Generaci\u00f3n Piura, a po/r\\_t.ligafolio of renewables assets consisting of about 150 MW of geothermal and solar plants in No/r\\_t.ligah America, whose sale was /fi.liganalized in January 2024, photovoltaic plants of Arcadia Generaci\u00f3n Solar SA in Chile, sold during 2023, and the Windpeshi wind facility under development.\n\n'Other changes' include the adjustment of plant decommissioning and site restoration costs, which decreased by \u20ac38 million, mainly in Spain, new leases of \u20ac684 million, impairment losses on the prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment of the Argentine companies operating in a hyperin/fl.ligaationary economy in the amount of \u20ac872 million and the e/ff.ligaect of capitalizing interest on loans speci/fi.ligacally dedicated to capital expenditure on prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment of \u20ac303 million (\u20ac251 million in 2022), breaking down as follows.\n\n| Millions of euro         | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro   |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                          | 2023               | Rate %             | 2022               | Rate %             | Change             | Change             |\n| EGP No/r\\_t.ligah America | 70                 | 0.2%               | 83                 | 0.5%               | (13)               | -15.7%             |\n| EGP M\u00e9xico               | 16                 | 9.8%               | 14                 | 7. 0 %             | 2                  | 14.3%              |\n| EGP South Africa         | -                  | -                  | -                  | 6.3%               | -                  | -                  |\n| Enel Am\u00e9ricas Group      | 55                 | 6.4%               | 41                 | 3.2%               | 14                 | 34.1%              |\n| Enel Chile Group         | 90                 | 6.0%               | 91                 | 6.1%               | (1)                | -1.1%              |\n| Endesa Group             | 12                 | 3.2%               | 5                  | 1.4%               | 7                  | -                  |\n| Enel Italia Group        | 58                 | 2.1%               | 8                  | 3.2%               | 50                 | -                  |\n| Nuove Energie            | 2                  | 3.3%               | 2                  | 1.6%               | -                  | -                  |\n| Total                    | 303                |                    | 251                |                    | 52                 | 20.7%              |\n\nAt December 31, 2023, contractual commitments to purchase prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment came to \u20ac4,690 million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the Group has no contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop investment prope/r\\_t.ligay or for repairs, maintenance or enhancements.\n\nThe change in 2023 was mainly due to impairment losses recognized on a number of assets in Spain, a number of disposals in Italy and depreciation charges for the period.\n\nFor more information on the valuation of investment prope/r\\_t.ligay, please see notes 52 'Assets and liabilities measured at fair value', and 52.2 'Assets not measured at fair value in the statement of /fi.liganancial position'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The decrease of \u20ac700 million in goodwill was mainly attributable to Peru for the reclassi/fi.ligacation as assets held for sale of generation and distribution assets (\u20ac570 million), and Chile for the reclassi/fi.ligacation to assets held for sale of Arcadia Generaci\u00f3n Solar (\u20ac46 million).\n\nNew impairment losses were also recognized in 2023 in respect of the CGUs in No/r\\_t.ligah America of Enel X and Enel X Way (\u20ac57 and \u20ac69 million, respectively) following impairment testing conducted in response to changes in macroeconomic conditions.\n\nThe decrease is pa/r\\_t.ligaly o/ff.ligaset by exchange gains recognized in Brazil.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill recognized was estimated by calculating the value in use of the CGUs using discounted cash /fl.ligaow models, which involve estimating expected future cash /fl.ligaows and applying an appropriate discount rate, selected on the basis of market inputs such as risk-free rates, betas and market-risk premiums.\n\nCash /fl.ligaows were determined on the basis of the best information available at the time of the estimate, taking account of the speci/fi.ligac risks of each CGU, and drawn:\n\n- \u00b7 for the explicit period, from the Business Plan approved by the Board of Directors of the Parent on November 22, 2023, containing forecasts for volumes, revenue, operating  costs,  capital  expenditure,  industrial  and commercial organization and developments in the main macroeconomic  variables  (in/fl.ligaation,  nominal  interest rates and exchange rates) and commodity prices. The explicit period of cash /fl.ligaows considered in impairment testing was three years;\n- \u00b7 for subsequent years, from assumptions concerning long-term developments in the main variables that determine cash /fl.ligaows, the average residual useful life of assets or the duration of the concessions.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, the terminal value is calculated based on the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of the businesses related to the various CGUs subject to impairment testing:\n\n- \u00b7 perpetuity, for the businesses of large-hydro (LH) power generation and of distribution, in which the licenses and public concessions are of a long-term nature and renewal can be forecast with reasonable ce/r\\_t.ligaainty; as well as for the Enel X and Enel X Way businesses, as they feature the development of speci/fi.ligac know-how that is sustainable over the long term;\n- \u00b7 annuity, for CGUs that are predominantly characterized by retail business, for which the residual life is, therefore, essentially correlated with the average duration of the customer relationships; as well as for businesses\n\nof  conventional  thermal  power  generation  (Generation and Trading). This method is also used for the renewable energy (Enel Green Power) businesses to take account of: (i) the value resulting from the remaining useful lives of the plants; and (ii) the residual value, in the event of plant decommissioning, associated with licensing rights, the competitiveness of the production facilities (in terms of natural resources), and network interconnectivity.\n\nThe nominal growth rate (g-rate) is equal to the long-term rate of growth in electricity and/or in/fl.ligaation (depending on the country and business involved).\n\nRegarding the assumptions for commodity price developments, the scenarios adopted are consistent with current emissions reductions targets.\n\nNote also that the Group has used sensitivity analysis to take account of the impacts of climate change in the long term. More speci/fi.ligacally:\n\n- \u00b7 we  consider  a  perpetual  long-term  growth  rate  for cash /fl.ligaows after the explicit period that is in line with the change in electricity demand over the 2026-2050 period, based on the speci/fi.ligac features of the businesses concerned, adopting ce/r\\_t.ligaain assumptions concerning the increase in temperature due to climate change and trends connected with the energy transition;\n- \u00b7 we consider changes in the hydroelectric, wind and photovoltaic generation levels of our Po/r\\_t.ligafolio assets, associated with each projection of underlying climate and weather variables (for example, temperature, irradiance, wind speed and precipitation);\n- \u00b7 we assume that the Group will incur the costs provisioned  for  decommissioning  fossil  fuel  generation plants in line with the goal of zero direct (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from retail activities (Scope 3).\n\nIn order to verify the robustness of the value in use of the  CGUs,  sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  for  the main value drivers, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular WACC and the long-term growth rate.\n\nEven in these circumstances, results were consistent with the evidence described previously, /fi.liganding that for all the CGUs analyzed, with the exception of those wri/t\\_t.ligaen down (Enel X No/r\\_t.ligah America and Enel X Way No/r\\_t.ligah America), the value in use exceeded the carrying amount, ensuring the full recoverability of the carrying amounts of those assets in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements of the Enel Group at December 31, 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These emissions also include the use of ancillary services in distribution operations. In pa/r\\_t.liga icular, in 2023 there was an extraordinarily high use of these services in Brazil to deal with the meteorological emergency that occurred in S\u00e3o Paulo in November 2023, which caused the interruption of grid operations. In any event, 95.8% of Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions are covered by all of the above targets, greater than the 95% threshold required under the Science Based Targets initiative and the GHG Protocol.\n- (3) The target is in line with the path to 1.5 \u00b0C set by the SBTi for the electrical services industry (Sectoral Decarbonization Approach, or SDA), although it could not be o/ffi.liga  cially validated because the SBTi does not ce/r\\_t.liga ify targets over a time frame of less than /fi.liga ve years from the presentation date.\n- (4) In 2023, gas sales decreased considerably compared with previous years. Fu/r\\_t.liga hermore, a methodological change in the use of conversion factors has been implemented. These two factors produced a value below the target expected for 2026.\n- (5) The target could not be o/ffi.liga  cially validated because the SBTi does not ce/r\\_t.liga ify targets over a time frame of less than /fi.liga ve years from the presentation date. In addition, the SBTi has not de/fi.liga ned a sectoral decarbonization approach for these types of emissions, so the ambition level cannot be veri/fi.liga ed.\n- (6) Two di/ff.liga erent percentage limits have been set for the target for Scope 3 GHG emissions by the supply chain, as allowed under the SBTi approach, which required coverage of at least 67% of Scope 3 emissions for the 2030 target, and at least 90% for the 2040 target.",

Enel SpA's share capital was unchanged compared with the amount repo/r\\_t.ligaed at December 31, 2022.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, based on the shareholders register and the notices submi/t\\_t.ligaed to CONSOB and received by the Parent pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 120 of Legislative Decree 58 of February 24, 1998, as well as other available information, shareholders with interests of greater than 3% in the Parent's share capital were the Ministry for the Economy and Finance (with a 23.585% stake) and BlackRock Inc. (with a 5.023% stake held for asset management purposes).\n\n## Treasury share reserve \u20ac(59) million\n\nAt December 31, 2023, treasury shares are represented by 9,262,330 ordinary shares of Enel SpA with a par value of \u20ac1.00 each (7,153,795 at December 31, 2022), purchased through an authorized intermediary for a total of \u20ac59 million.\n\n## Other reserves \u20ac6,551 million\n\nShare premium reserve \u20ac7,496 million\n\nPursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 2431 of the Italian Civil Code, the share premium  reserve  contains,  in  the  case  of  the  issue  of shares at a price above par, the di/ff.ligaerence between the issue price of the shares and their par value, including those resulting from conversion from bonds. The reserve, which is a capital reserve, may not be distributed until the legal reserve has reached the threshold established under A/r\\_t.ligaicle 2430 of the Italian Civil Code.\n\nReserve for equity instruments - perpetual hybrid bonds -\u20ac6,553 million\n\nThis reserve repo/r\\_t.ligas the nominal value, net of transaction costs, of the non-conve/r\\_t.ligaible subordinated perpetual hybrid bonds denominated in euros for international investors.\n\nThe change of \u20ac986 million in the reserve re/fl.ligaects the issue of new bonds in the amount of \u20ac1,738 million, net of transaction costs, pa/r\\_t.ligaly o/ff.ligaset by the repurchase and subsequent cancellation of previous bonds in the amount of \u20ac752 million, including transaction costs.\n\nIn 2023, coupons of \u20ac182 million were paid to holders of perpetual hybrid bonds.\n\nLegal reserve \u20ac2,034 million\n\nThe legal reserve is formed as allocation of pa/r\\_t.liga of the net income that, pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 2430 of the Italian Civil Code, cannot be distributed as dividends.\n\nOther reserves \u20ac2,341 million\n\nThese include \u20ac2,215 million related to the remaining portion of the value adjustments carried out when Enel was transformed from a public entity to a joint-stock company. Pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 47 of the Uniform Income Tax Code, this amount does not constitute taxable income when distributed.\n\nTranslation reserve \u20ac(5,289) million\n\nThe increase of \u20ac623 million in the period was mainly due to the change in the consolidation scope connected with stakes held in Romania, Inversora Dock Sud and Central Dock Sud and Enel Generaci\u00f3n Costanera, as well as the net depreciation of the functional currencies used by foreign subsidiaries, mainly in Chile and the United States, against the euro (presentation currency of the Parent).\n\nHedging reserve - \u20ac(1,393) million\n\nThis includes the net expense recognized in equity from the measurement of hedging derivatives. The change in the period is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to developments in commodity prices.\n\nHedging costs reserve \u20ac(38) million\n\nIn application of IFRS 9, this reserve includes the fair value gains and losses on currency basis points and forward points. The change in 2023 is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to developments in commodity prices.\n\nReserve from measurement of /fi.liganancial instruments at FVOCI \u20ac10 million\n\nThis includes net unrealized fair value losses on /fi.liganancial assets.\n\nReserve from equity-accounted investments \u20ac(375) million\n\nThe reserve repo/r\\_t.ligas the share of comprehensive income to be recognized directly in equity of equity-accounted investees. The change in 2023 is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the change in the hedging reserve of Slovak Power Holding.\n\nActuarial reserve \u20ac(1,185) million\n\nThis reserve includes actuarial gains and losses in respect of employee bene/fi.ligat liabilities, net of tax e/ff.ligaects.\n\nReserve from disposal of equity interests without loss of control \u20ac(2,390) million\n\nThis item mainly repo/r\\_t.ligas:\n\n- \u00b7 the gain posted on the public o/ff.ligaering of Enel Green Power shares, net of expenses associated with the disposal and the related taxation;\n- \u00b7 the sale of non-controlling interests recognized as a result of the Enersis (now Enel Am\u00e9ricas and Enel Chile) capital increase;",

For the foreign companies, the item refers to post-employment bene/fi.ligats, of which the most material regard the pension bene/fi.ligat schemes of Endesa in Spain, which break down into three types that di/ff.ligaer on the basis of employee seniority and company. In general, under the framework agreement of October 25, 2000, employees pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in a speci/fi.ligac de/fi.liganed contribution pension plan and, in cases of disability or death of employees in service, a de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plan which is covered by appropriate insurance policies. In addition, the group has two other limited-enrollment plans (i) for current and retired Endesa employees covered by the electricity industry collective bargaining agreement prior to the changes introduced with the framework agreement noted earlier and (ii) for employees of the Catalan\n- companies merged in the past (Fecsa/Enher/HidroEmpord\u00e0). Both are de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plans and bene/fi.ligats are fully insured, with the exception of the former plan for bene/fi.ligats in the event of the death of a retired employee. Finally, the Brazilian companies have also established de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plans;\n- \u00b7 the item 'electricity discount' comprises bene/fi.ligats regarding electricity supply associated in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular with foreign companies;\n- \u00b7 the item 'health insurance' refers to bene/fi.ligats for current or retired employees covering medical expenses;\n- \u00b7 the item 'other bene/fi.ligats' mainly regards the loyalty bonus, which is adopted in various countries and for Italy is represented by the estimated liability for the bene/fi.ligat entitling employees covered by the electricity workers national collective bargaining agreement to a bonus for achievement of seniority milestones (25th and 35th year of service). It also includes other incentive plans, which provide for the award to ce/r\\_t.ligaain Company managers of a monetary bonus subject to speci/fi.ligaed conditions.\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas changes in the de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat obligation for post-employment and other long-term employee bene/fi.ligats at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, as well as a reconciliation of that obligation with the actuarial liability.",

In general, the costs are quanti/fi.ligaed on the basis of a standard contract between Enresa  and  the  electricity  companies  approved  by  the Ministry for the Economy, which regulates the retirement\n\nand closing of nuclear power plants. The time horizon envisaged, three years, corresponds to the period from the termination of power generation to the transfer of plant management to Enresa (so-called post-operational costs) and takes account, among the various assumptions used to estimate the amount, of the quantity of unused nuclear fuel expected at the date of closure of each of the Spanish nuclear plants on the basis of the provisions of the concession agreement.",

        "page_content": "## Site retirement, removal and restoration provision\n\nThis provision represents the present value of the estimated cost for the retirement and removal of non-nuclear plants where there is a legal or constructive obligation to do so. The provision mainly regarded the Endesa Group and Enel Produzione. The change in the provision in 2023\n\nwas mainly linked to the uses and releases of provisions set aside in previous years to deal with the decarbonization process, mainly in Italy, Spain and Chile.\n\nThe following table summarizes the temporal breakdown of payments connected with the site retirement, removal and restoration provision.\n\n| Millions of euro   |                                           |                   |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                    | Payments by time bracket  (nominal value) | Discounted amount |\n| Within 1 year      | 276                                       | 258               |\n| In 1-5 years       | 1,147                                     | 1,045             |\n| More than 5 years  | 2,636                                     | 1 , 374           |\n| Total              | 4,059                                     | 2,677             |\n\n## Litigation provision\n\nThe litigation provision covers contingent liabilities in respect of pending litigation and other disputes. It includes an estimate of the potential liability relating to disputes that arose during the year, as well as revised estimates of the potential costs associated with disputes initiated in prior years, based on the indications of internal and external consultants. The balance for litigation mainly regards the companies in Latin America (\u20ac396 million), Spain (\u20ac158 million) and Italy (\u20ac116 million).\n\nThe amount is vi/r\\_t.ligaually unchanged compared with 2022, as the decrease associated with higher uses and releases in Brazil was o/ff.ligaset by new accruals.\n\n## Provision for environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates\n\nThe provision for environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates covers costs in respect of sho/r\\_t.ligafalls in the environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates need for compliance with national or supranational environmental protection requirements and mainly regards Iberia (Endesa Energ\u00eda and Endesa Generaci\u00f3n SA).\n\n## Provision for taxes and duties\n\nThe provision for taxes and duties covers the estimated liability deriving from tax disputes concerning direct and indirect taxes.\n\nThe balance of the provision also includes the provision for current and potential disputes concerning local prope/r\\_t.ligay tax (whether the Imposta Comunale sugli Immobili -ICI or the Imposta Municipale Unica - IMU) in Italy. In Italy, the Group has taken due account of developments in land registry regulations (which with e/ff.ligaect from January 1, 2016 excluded machinery, devices, equipment and other plant speci/fi.ligac to a production process from the calculation of the imputed rent for buildings classi/fi.ligaed in land registry group D, which includes generation plants) in estimating the liability for such taxes, both for the purposes of quantifying the probable risk associated with pending litigation and generating a reasonable valuation of probable future\n\ncharges on positions that have not yet been assessed by the Revenue Agency and municipalities.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions cover various risks and charges, mainly in connection with regulatory disputes and disputes with local authorities regarding various duties and fees or other charges.\n\nThe increase of \u20ac342 million in other provisions is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to Enel Reinsurance for accruals of provisions for insurance claims (\u20ac217 million) and provisions for regulatory measures, atmospheric events and faults.\n\n## Provision for early retirement incentives and other restructuring plans\n\nThe provision for early retirement incentives and other restructuring plans includes the estimated charges related to binding agreements for the voluntary termination of employment contracts in response to organizational needs. The reduction of \u20ac141 million for the year mainly re/fl.ligaects uses of provisions for incentives established in previous period in Spain and Italy to cover the early termination of employment for ce/r\\_t.ligaain employees.\n\n## Provision for restructuring programs connected with the energy transition\n\nEnel, in its role as a leader of the energy transition, has placed decarbonization and growth of renewables around the world at the center of its strategy.\n\nIn this context, Enel has begun restructuring the activities associated with the energy transition process, which involves thermal generation plants in all the geographical areas in which the Group operates. The consequent revision of processes and operating models will require changes in the roles and skills of employees, which the Group intends to implement with highly sustainable plans based on  redeployment  programs,  with  major  upskilling  and reskilling plans and voluntary individual early retirement\n\n<!-- image -->",

This approach, based on an assessment of any signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, is pe/r\\_f.ligaormed comparing the PD at origination with PD at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, at each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date.\n- Then, based on the results of the assessment, a loss allowance is recognized based on 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL (i.e. staging):\n- -lifetime ECL, for /fi.liganancial assets for which there has been a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk or which are credit impaired (i.e. defaulted based on past due information);\n- \u00b7 the simpli/fi.ligaed approach, for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables with or without a signi/fi.ligacant /fi.liganancing component, based on lifetime ECL without tracking changes in credit risk.\n\nA forward-looking adjustment can be applied considering qualitative and quantitative information in order to re/fl.ligaect future  events  and  macroeconomic  developments  that could impact the risk associated with the po/r\\_t.ligafolio or /fi.liganancial instrument.\n\nDepending on the nature of the /fi.liganancial assets and the credit risk information available, the assessment of the increase in credit risk can be pe/r\\_f.ligaormed on:\n\n- \u00b7 an individual basis, if the receivables are individually signi/fi.ligacant and for all receivables which have been individually identi/fi.ligaed for impairment based on reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable information;\n- \u00b7 a collective basis, if no reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable information is available without undue cost or e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga to measure expected credit losses on an individual instrument basis.\n\nWhen there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a /fi.liganancial asset in its entirety or a po/r\\_t.ligaion thereof, the gross carrying amount of the /fi.liganancial asset shall be reduced.\n\nA  write-o/ff.liga  represents  a  derecognition  event  (e.g.,  the right to cash /fl.ligaows is legally or contractually extinguished, transferred or expired).\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas expected credit losses on /fi.liganancial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost on the basis of the general simpli/fi.ligaed approach.\n\n- -12-month ECL, for /fi.liganancial assets for which there has  not  been  a  signi/fi.ligacant  increase  in  credit  risk since initial recognition;\n\n| Millions of euro                                      | at Dec. 31, 2023   | at Dec. 31, 2023                 | at Dec. 31, 2023   | at Dec. 31, 2022   | at Dec. 31, 2022                 | at Dec. 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                       | Gross amount       | Expected  credit loss  allowance | Total              | Gross amount       | Expected  credit loss  allowance | Total              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                             | 6,772              | -                                | 6,772              | 10,169             | -                                | 10,169             |\n| Trade receivables                                     | 21,548             | 3,775                            | 17,7 7 3           | 20,388             | 3,783                            | 16,605             |\n| Loan assets                                           | 7,579              | 311                              | 7, 2 6 8           | 17, 2 6 2          | 248                              | 17,014             |\n| Other /fi.liganancial assets at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost | 2,403              | 12                               | 2,391              | 2, 176             | 56                               | 2,120              |\n| Total                                                 | 38,302             | 4,098                            | 34,204             | 49,995             | 4,087                            | 45,908             |",

        "page_content": "To measure expected losses, the Group assesses trade receivables and contract assets with the simpli/fi.ligaed approach, both on an individual basis (e.g., government entities, authorities, /fi.liganancial counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies, wholesale sellers, traders and large companies, etc.) and a collective basis (e.g., retail customers).\n\nIn the case of individual assessments, PD is generally obtained from external providers.\n\nOtherwise, in the case of collective assessments, trade receivables are grouped on the basis of their shared credit risk characteristics and information on past due positions, considering a speci/fi.ligac de/fi.liganition of default.\n\nBased on each business and local regulatory framework, as well as di/ff.ligaerences between customer po/r\\_t.ligafolios, including their default and recovery rates (comprising expectations for recovery beyond 90 days):\n\n- \u00b7 the Group mainly de/fi.liganes a defaulted position as one that is 180 days past due. Accordingly, beyond this time limit, trade receivables are presumed to be credit impaired); and\n- \u00b7 speci/fi.ligac clusters are de/fi.liganed on the basis of speci/fi.ligac markets, business and risk characteristics.\n\nContract assets substantially have the same risk characteristics as trade receivables for the same types of contracts.\n\nIn order to measure the ECL for trade receivables on a collective basis, as well as for contract assets, the Group uses the following assumptions regarding the ECL parameters:\n\n- \u00b7 PD, assumed equal to the average default rate, is calculated by cluster and considering historical data from at least 24 months;\n- \u00b7 LGD is a function of the recovery rates for each cluster, discounted using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate; and\n- \u00b7 EAD is estimated as equal to the carrying amount at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date net of cash deposits, including invoices issued but not past due and invoices to be issued.\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas changes in the allowance for expected credit losses on loan assets in accordance with the general approach.\n\n| Millions of euro                  | ECL 12-month allowance   | ECL lifetime allowance   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Opening balance at Jan. 1, 2022   | 65                       | 169                      |\n| Accruals                          | 22                       | 5                        |\n| Uses                              | -                        | -                        |\n| Reversals to pro/fi.ligat or loss | -                        | (11)                     |\n| Other changes                     | (58)                     | 56                       |\n| Closing balance at Dec. 31, 2022  | 29                       | 219                      |\n| Opening balance at Jan. 1, 2023   | 29                       | 219                      |\n| Accruals                          | -                        | 36                       |\n| Uses                              | -                        | 11                       |\n| Reversals to pro/fi.ligat or loss | (32)                     | (6)                      |\n| Other changes                     | 45                       | 9                        |\n| Closing balance at Dec. 31, 2023  | 42                       | 269                      |\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas changes in the allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables in accordance with the simpli/fi.ligaed approach.\n\n| Millions of euro                  |         |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|\n| Opening balance at Jan. 1, 2022   | 3,663   |\n| Accruals                          | 1,375   |\n| Uses                              | (766)   |\n| Reversals to pro/fi.ligat or loss | (265)   |\n| Other changes                     | (224)   |\n| Closing balance at Dec. 31, 2022  | 3,783   |\n| Opening balance at Jan. 1, 2023   | 3,783   |\n| Accruals                          | 1,384   |\n| Uses                              | (1,136) |\n| Reversals to pro/fi.ligat or loss | (210)   |\n| Other changes                     | (46)    |\n| Closing balance at Dec. 31, 2023  | 3,775   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Taking account of hedges of interest rates considered e/ff.ligaective pursuant to the IFRS-EU, 22.8% of the nominal value of long- and medium-term /fi.liganancial debt was exposed to interest rate risk at December 31, 2023 (34.7% at December 31, 2022). These /fi.ligagures are in line with the limits established in the risk management policy.\n\n## Long-term debt - Main covenants\n\nThe Group's main long-term /fi.liganancial liabilities are governed by covenants that are commonly adopted in international business practice. They include in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular bond issues carried out within the framework of the Global/Euro Medium-Term Notes program, issues of subordinated unconve/r\\_t.ligaible hybrid bonds (so-called 'hybrid bonds') and loans granted by banks and other /fi.liganancial institutions (including the European Investment Bank and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA).\n\nThe main covenants regarding bond issues carried out within the framework of the Global/Euro Medium-Term Notes programs of Enel and Enel Finance International NV (including the green bonds of Enel Finance International NV guaranteed by Enel SpA, which are used to /fi.liganance the Group's so-called eligible green projects) and those regarding bonds issued by Enel Finance International NV on the US market guaranteed by Enel SpA can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 negative pledge clauses under which the issuer and the guarantor may not establish or maintain mo/r\\_t.ligagages, liens or other encumbrances on all or pa/r\\_t.liga of their assets or revenue to secure ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial liabilities, unless the same encumbrances are extended equally or pro rata to the bonds in question;\n- \u00b7 pari passu clauses, under which the bonds and the associated security constitute a direct, unconditional and unsecured obligation of the issuer and the guarantor and are issued without preferential rights among them and have at least the same seniority as other present and future unsubordinated and unsecured bonds of the issuer and the guarantor;\n\n<!-- image -->",

All the borrowings considered specify 'events of default' typical of international business practice, such as, for example, insolvency, bankruptcy proceedings or the entity ceases trading.\n\nIn addition, the guarantees issued by Enel in the interest of e-distribuzione SpA for ce/r\\_t.ligaain loans to e-distribuzione SpA from Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA require that at the end of each six-month measurement period Enel's net consolidated /fi.liganancial debt shall not exceed 4.5 times annual consolidated EBITDA.\n\nFinally, the debt of Endesa SA, Enel Am\u00e9ricas SA, Enel Chile SA and the other Spanish and Latin American subsidiaries (notably Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile SA) contains covenants and events of default typical of international business practice.",

|\n\nDevelopments in the indicators shown in the table are periodically veri/fi.ligaed by an external auditor.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and the resulting restrictions on gas impo/r\\_t.ligas from Russia into the EU, which caused a decrease in gas supplies accompanied by a surge in wholesale electricity and gas prices, with serious e/ff.ligaects for households and businesses, prompted EU governments to implement a series of policy responses to mitigate the impact of rising costs and ensure the stability of the energy system.\n\nDespite these policy measures, the Group managed to reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions along the entire value chain by 26.3% overall compared with the previous year. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the Group also reduced the intensity of Scope 1 GHG emissions related to power generation by over 30.6%, going from 229 gCO 2eq /kWh in 2022 to 160 gCO 2eq /kWh in 2023. This reduction re/fl.ligaected a 12.9% increase in consolidated renewables generation and a 37.5% reduction in consolidated thermal generation compared with 2022, a consequence of the Group's strategy to shift its generation mix towards renewables and to advance the decarbonization process.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "However, due to the unprecedented crisis faced by the European energy system in 2022 and 2023, the Group's emissions reduction in 2023 was not su/ffi.ligacient to achieve the Scope 1 GHG emissions intensity target related to electricity generation set for 2023 as announced on the occasion of the Capital Markets Day held in November 2020 for the launch of the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan. As a result of the energy crisis, the intensity value was slightly higher than the target of 148 gCO 2eq /kWh. In the absence of these factors, Enel would have been able to reach an emissions intensity level well below the target of 148 gCO 2eq /kWh.\n\nAs a result, the Group's sustainability-linked instruments that set the Scope 1 emissions intensity target for electricity generation at 148 gCO 2eq /kWh for 2023 will be subject to an increase in the relative step-up.\n\n## 48.4 Derivative /fi.liganancial liabilities\n\nFor  more  information  on  derivative  /fi.liganancial  liabilities, please see note 51 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\n## 48.5 Net gain/(loss)\n\nThe following table shows net gains and losses by category of /fi.liganancial instruments, excluding derivatives.\n\n| Millions of euro                                                              | 2023            | 2023                              | 2022            | 2022                              |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                                                               | Net gain/(loss) | Of which  impairment  (loss)/gain | Net gain/(loss) | Of which  impairment  (loss)/gain |\n| Financial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost                            | (1,112)         | (1,320)                           | (1,242)         | (1,305)                           |\n| Financial assets at FVOCI                                                     |                 |                                   |                 |                                   |\n| Equity investments at FVOCI                                                   | -               | -                                 | -               | -                                 |\n| Other /fi.liganancial assets at FVOCI                                         | 15              | -                                 | (4)             | -                                 |\n| Total /fi.liganancial assets at FVOCI                                         | 15              | -                                 | (4)             | -                                 |\n| Financial assets at FVTPL                                                     |                 |                                   |                 |                                   |\n| Financial assets at FVTPL                                                     | 6               | -                                 | 9               | -                                 |\n| Financial assets designated upon initial recognition (fair value option)      | -               | -                                 | -               | -                                 |\n| Total /fi.liganancial assets at FVTPL                                         | 6               | -                                 | 9               | -                                 |\n| Financial liabilities measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost                       | (2,759)         | -                                 | (2,357)         | -                                 |\n| Financial liabilities at FVTPL                                                |                 |                                   |                 |                                   |\n| Financial liabilities held for trading                                        | -               | -                                 | -               | -                                 |\n| Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition (fair value option) | -               | -                                 | -               | -                                 |\n| Total /fi.liganancial liabilities at FVTPL                                    | -               | -                                 | -               | -                                 |\n\nFor more details on net gains and losses on derivatives, please see note 14 'Net /fi.liganancial income/(expense) from derivatives'.",

Risk management\n\n## Financial risk management governance and objectives\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of its operations, the Enel Group is exposed to a variety of /fi.liganancial risks, notably interest rate risk, commodity risk, currency risk, credit and counterpa/r\\_t.ligay risk and liquidity risk.\n\nAs noted in the section 'Risk management' in the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations, the Group's governance arrangements for /fi.liganancial risks include risk commi/t\\_t.ligaees and the establishment  of  dedicated  policies,  measurement  metrics  and operational limits. Enel's primary objective is to mitigate /fi.liganancial risks appropriately so that they do not give rise to unexpected changes in results.\n\nThe following sections detail the above /fi.liganancial risks.\n\nThere were no changes in the sources of exposure to such risks compared with the previous year.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk derives primarily from the use of /fi.liganancial instruments and manifests itself as unexpected changes in charges on /fi.liganancial liabilities, if indexed to /fl.ligaoating rates and/or exposed to the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty of /fi.liganancial terms and conditions in negotiating new debt instruments, or as an unexpected change in the value of /fi.liganancial instruments measured at fair value (such as /fi.ligaxed-rate debt).\n\nThe main /fi.liganancial liabilities held by the Group include bonds, bank borrowings, borrowings from other lenders, commercial paper, derivatives, cash deposits received to\n\nsecure commercial or derivative contracts (guarantees, cash collateral).\n\nThe Enel Group mainly manages interest rate risk through the de/fi.liganition of an optimal /fi.liganancial structure, with the dual goal of stabilizing borrowing costs and containing the cost of funds.\n\nThis  goal  is  pursued  through  the  diversi/fi.ligacation  of  the po/r\\_t.ligafolio of /fi.liganancial liabilities by contract type, maturity and interest rate, and modifying the risk pro/fi.ligale of speci/fi.ligac exposures using OTC derivatives, mainly interest rate swaps and interest rate options. The term of such derivatives does not exceed the maturity of the underlying /fi.liganancial liability, so that any change in the fair value and/or expected cash /fl.ligaows of such contracts is o/ff.ligaset by a corresponding change in the fair value and/or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged position.\n\nProxy hedging techniques can be used in a number of residual circumstances, when the hedging instruments for the risk factors are not available on the market or are not su/ffi.ligaciently liquid.\n\nUsing interest rate swaps, the Enel Group agrees with the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay  to  periodically  exchange  /fl.ligaoating-rate  interest /fl.ligaows with /fi.ligaxed-rate /fl.ligaows, both calculated on the same notional principal amount.\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas the notional amount of interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, broken down by type of contract.\n\n| Millions of euro                               | Notional amount   |                  |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n|                                                | at Dec. 31, 2023  | at Dec. 31, 2022 |\n| Floating-to-/fi.ligaxed interest rate swaps    | 5,996             | 5,836            |\n| Fixed-to-/fl.ligaoating interest rate swaps    | 1,386             | 1,401            |\n| Floating-to-/fl.ligaoating interest rate swaps | 644               | 618              |\n| Total                                          | 8,026             | 7,855            |\n\nFor more details on interest rate derivatives, please see note 51 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\n## Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis\n\nEnel analyzes the sensitivity of its exposure by estimating the e/ff.ligaects of a change in interest rates on the po/r\\_t.ligafolio of /fi.liganancial instruments.\n\nMore  speci/fi.ligacally,  sensitivity  analysis  measures  the  potential impact on pro/fi.ligat or loss and on equity of market scenarios that would cause a change in the fair value of derivatives or in the /fi.liganancial expense associated with unhedged gross debt.\n\nThese market scenarios are obtained by simulating parallel increases and decreases in the yield curve as at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date.\n\nThere were no changes introduced in the methods and assumptions  used  in  the  sensitivity  analysis  compared with the previous year.\n\nWith all other variables held constant, the Group's pre-tax pro/fi.ligat would be a/ff.ligaected by a change in the level of interest rates as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Taking account of e/ff.ligaective cash /fl.ligaow hedges of interest rate risk (in accordance with the provisions of the IFRS-EU), 82.4% of the nominal value of gross long-term /fi.liganancial debt was hedged at December 31, 2023 (82.0% at December 31, 2022).\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCurrency  risk  mainly  manifests  itself  as  unexpected changes in the /fi.liganancial statement items associated with transactions denominated in a currency other than the presentation currency. The Group's consolidated /fi.liganancial statements are also exposed to translation risk as a result of the conversion of the /fi.liganancial statements of foreign subsidiaries, which are denominated in local currencies, into euros as the Group's presentation currency.\n\nThe Group's exposure to currency risk is connected with the purchase or sale of fuels and power, investments (cash /fl.ligaows for capitalized costs), dividends and the purchase or sale of equity investments, commercial transactions and /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Group policies for managing currency risk provide for the mitigation of the e/ff.ligaects on pro/fi.ligat or loss of changes in the level of exchange rates, with the exception of the translation e/ff.ligaects connected with consolidation.\n\nIn order to minimize the exposure to currency risk, Enel implements  diversi/fi.ligaed  revenue  and  cost  sources  geographically, and uses indexing mechanisms in commercial contracts. Enel also uses various types of derivatives, typically on the OTC market.\n\nstruments  include  cross  currency  interest  rate  swaps, currency forwards and currency swaps. The term of such contracts does not exceed the maturity of the underlying instrument, so that any change in the fair value and/or expected cash /fl.ligaows of such instruments o/ff.ligasets the corresponding change in the fair value and/or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged position.\n\nCross currency interest rate swaps are used to transform a long-term /fi.liganancial liability denominated in currency other than the presentation currency into an equivalent liability in the presentation currency.\n\nCurrency forwards are contracts in which the counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies agree to exchange principal amounts denominated in di/ff.ligaerent currencies at a speci/fi.ligaed future date and exchange rate (the strike). Such contracts may call for the actual exchange of the two principal amounts (deliverable forwards) or payment of the di/ff.ligaerence generated by di/ff.ligaerences between the strike exchange rate and the prevailing exchange rate at maturity (non-deliverable forwards). In the la/t\\_t.ligaer case, the strike rate and/or the spot rate can be determined as averages of the rates observed in a given period.\n\nCurrency swaps are contracts in which the counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies enter into two transactions of the opposite sign at di/ff.ligaerent future dates (normally one spot, the other forward) that provide for the exchange of principal denominated in di/ff.ligaerent currencies.\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas the notional amount of transactions outstanding at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, broken down by type of hedged item.\n\nThe  derivatives  in  the  Group's  po/r\\_t.ligafolio  of  /fi.liganancial  in-\n\n| Millions of euro                                                                                        | Notional amount   | Notional amount   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                                                         | at Dec. 31, 2023  | at Dec. 31, 2022  |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps (CCIRSs) hedging debt denominated in  currencies other than the euro | 25,890            | 28,444            |\n| Currency forwards hedging currency risk on commodities                                                  | 6,496             | 8,392             |\n| Currency forwards/CCIRSs hedging future cash /fl.ligaows in currencies other  than the euro             | 3,134             | 5,333             |\n| Other currency forwards                                                                                 | 602               | 1,497             |\n| Total                                                                                                   | 36,122            | 43,666            |",

Proxy hedging techniques can be used for the industrial po/r\\_t.ligafolios when the hedging instruments for the speci/fi.ligac risk factors generating the exposure are not available on the market or are not su/ffi.ligaciently liquid. In addition, Enel uses po/r\\_t.ligafolio hedging techniques to assess oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities for ne/t\\_t.ligaing intercompany exposures.\n\nThe Group mainly uses plain vanilla derivatives for hedging (more speci/fi.ligacally, forwards, swaps, options on commodities, futures, contracts for di/ff.ligaerences).\n\nSome of these products can be indexed to a variety of underlyings (coal, gas, oil, CO 2 , di/ff.ligaerent geographical areas, etc.) and the approaches can be assessed and adapted to speci/fi.ligac needs.\n\nEnel also engages in proprietary trading in order to maintain a presence in the Group's reference energy commodity markets. These operations consist in taking on exposures in energy commodities (oil products, gas, coal, CO 2 ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates and electricity) using /fi.liganancial derivatives and physical contracts traded on regulated and over-thecounter markets, optimizing pro/fi.ligats through transactions carried out on the basis of expected market developments while always complying with the limits set on the basis of po/r\\_t.ligafolio risk analysis.\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas the notional amount of outstanding transactions at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, broken down by type of instrument.\n\n| Millions of euro              | Notional amount   |                  |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n|                               | at Dec. 31, 2023  | at Dec. 31, 2022 |\n| Forward and futures contracts | 44,307            | 114,128          |\n| Swaps                         | 7, 6 9 4          | 11,271           |\n| Options                       | 1,407             | 504              |\n| Total                         | 53,408            | 125,903          |\n\nFor  more  details,  please  see  note  51  'Derivatives  and hedge accounting'.\n\n## Commodity price risk sensitivity analysis\n\nThe following table presents the results of the analysis of sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the commodity prices underlying the valuation model used in the scenario at the same date, with all other variables held constant.\n\nthe price curve for the main commodities that make up the fuel scenario and the basket of formulas used in the contracts is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the change in the price of electricity, gas and petroleum products and, to a lesser extent, of CO 2 .

Other risks include the reputational and /fi.liganancial risks associated with signi/fi.ligacant exposures to a single counterpa/r\\_t.ligay or groups of related customers, or to counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies operating in the same sector or in the same geographical area.\n\nAccordingly, the exposure to credit and counterpa/r\\_t.ligay risk is a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the following types of transactions:\n\n- \u00b7 the sale and distribution of electricity and gas in free and regulated markets and the supply of goods and services  (trade  receivables  in  respect  of  non-Group debtors);\n- \u00b7 trading  activities  that  involve  the  physical  exchange of assets or transactions in /fi.liganancial instruments (the commodity po/r\\_t.ligafolio);\n- \u00b7 trading in derivatives, bank deposits and, more generally, /fi.liganancial instruments (the /fi.liganancial po/r\\_t.ligafolio).\n\nIn order to minimize credit and counterpa/r\\_t.ligay risk, credit  exposures  are  managed  at  the  region/country/global business line level by di/ff.ligaerent units, thereby ensuring the necessary segregation of risk management and control activities.

This re/fl.ligaects the strengthening of digital collection channels and a sound diversi/fi.ligacation of the customer base.",

Amounts denominated in currencies other than the euro are translated at the o/ffi.ligacial closing exchange rates provided by the World Markets Re/fi.liganitiv (WMR) Company.\n\n| Millions of euro                   | Non-current       | Non-current       | Non-current       | Non-current       | Current           | Current           | Current           | Current           |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                    | Notional          | Notional          | Fair value        | Fair value        | Notional          | Notional          | Fair value        | Fair value        |\n|                                    | at Dec. 31,  2023 | at Dec. 31,  2022 | at Dec. 31,  2023 | at Dec. 31,  2022 | at Dec. 31,  2023 | at Dec. 31,  2022 | at Dec. 31,  2023 | at Dec. 31,  2022 |\n| DERIVATIVE ASSETS                  |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Fair value hedge derivatives:      |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| - on interest rates                | 556               | 154               | 101               | 22                | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 |\n| - on exchange rates                | 90                | 99                | 12                | 15                | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 |\n| Total                              | 646               | 253               | 113               | 37                | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 |\n| Cash /fl.ligaow hedge derivatives: |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| - on interest rates                | 4,090             | 4,949             | 174               | 336               | 54                | 9                 | 1                 | -                 |\n| - on exchange rates                | 11,060            | 16,955            | 1,007             | 1,854             | 4,393             | 4,053             | 145               | 389               |\n| - on commodities                   | 4,094             | 4,321             | 883               | 1,270             | 5,560             | 7, 4 1 6          | 1,818             | 2,366             |\n| Total                              | 19,244            | 26,225            | 2,064             | 3,460             | 10,007            | 11,478            | 1,964             | 2,755             |\n| Trading derivatives:               |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| - on interest rates                | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 |\n| - on exchange rates                | 84                | 19                | 1                 | 1                 | 1,734             | 3,640             | 24                | 74                |\n| - on commodities                   | 858               | 1 ,7 74           | 205               | 472               | 17, 5 1 1         | 49,253            | 4,419             | 12,001            |\n| Total                              | 942               | 1,793             | 206               | 473               | 19,245            | 52,893            | 4,443             | 12,075            |\n| TOTAL DERIVATIVE ASSETS            | 20,832            | 28,271            | 2,383             | 3,970             | 29,252            | 64,371            | 6,407             | 14,830            |",

The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.\n\nHedge accounting is applied to derivatives entered into in order to reduce risks such as interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity price risk (including Vi/r\\_t.ligaual PPAs) when all the criteria provided by IFRS 9 are met.\n\nAt  the  inception  of  the  transaction,  the  Group  documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy. The Group also documents its assessment, both  at  hedge  inception  and  on  an  ongoing  basis,  of whether hedging instruments are highly e/ff.ligaective in o/ff.ligasetting changes in fair values or cash /fl.ligaows of hedged items. For cash /fl.ligaow hedges of forecast transactions designated as hedged items, the Group assesses and documents that they are highly probable and present an exposure to changes in cash /fl.ligaows that a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nDepending on the nature of the risk exposure, the Group designates derivatives as either:\n\n- \u00b7 fair value hedges;\n- \u00b7 cash /fl.ligaow hedges.\n\nFor more details about the nature and the extent of risks arising from /fi.liganancial instruments to which the Group is exposed, please see note 49 'Risk management'.\n\nTo be e/ff.ligaective a hedge relationship shall meet all of the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 existence of an economic relationship between hedging instrument and hedged item;\n- \u00b7 the e/ff.ligaect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes resulting from the economic relationship;\n- \u00b7 the hedge ratio de/fi.liganed at initial designation shall be equal to the one used for risk management purposes (i.e. same quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge the quantity of the hedged item).\n\nBased on the IFRS 9 requirements, the existence of an economic relationship is evaluated by the Group through a qualitative assessment or a quantitative computation, depending on the following circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 if the underlying risk of the hedging instrument and the hedged item is the same, the existence of an economic relationship will be provided through a qualitative analysis;\n- \u00b7 on the other hand, if the underlying risk of the hedging instrument and the hedged item is not the same, the existence of the economic relationship will be demonstrated through a quantitative method in addition to a qualitative analysis of the nature of the economic relationship (i.e. linear regression).\n\nIn order to demonstrate that the behavior of the hedging instrument is in line with that of the hedged item, di/ff.ligaerent scenarios will be analyzed.\n\nFor hedging of commodity price risk, the existence of an economic relationship is deduced from a ranking matrix that de/fi.liganes, for each possible risk component, a set of all standard derivatives available in the market whose ranking\n\n<!-- image -->",

This method compares changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the hypothetical derivative between the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date and the inception date.\n\nThe main causes of hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness can be the following:\n\n- \u00b7 basis di/ff.ligaerences (i.e. the fair value or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged item depend on a variable that is di/ff.ligaerent from the variable that causes the fair value or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedging instrument to change);\n- \u00b7 timing di/ff.ligaerences (i.e. the hedged item and hedging instrument occur or are se/t\\_t.ligaled at di/ff.ligaerent dates);\n- \u00b7 quantity or notional amount di/ff.ligaerences (i.e. the hedged item and hedging instrument are based on di/ff.ligaerent quantities or notional amounts);\n- \u00b7 other risks (i.e. changes in the fair value or cash /fl.ligaows of a derivative hedging instrument or hedged item relate to risks other than the speci/fi.ligac risk being hedged);\n- \u00b7 credit risk (i.e. the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay credit risk di/ff.ligaerently impacts the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items).\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nFair value hedges are mainly used to protect the Group against exposures to changes in the fair value of liabilities or /fi.ligarm commitment a/t\\_t.ligaributable to a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular risk that could a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as hedging instruments are recognized in the income statement, together with changes in the fair val-\n\nue of the hedged item that are a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the hedged risk.\n\nIf the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting,  the  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amount  of  a hedged item for which the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method is used is amo/r\\_t.ligaized to pro/fi.ligat or loss over the period to maturity.\n\n## Cash /fl.ligaow hedges\n\nCash /fl.ligaow hedges are applied in order to hedge the Group exposure to changes in future cash /fl.ligaows that are a/t\\_t.ligaributable to a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable transaction that could affect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nThe e/ff.ligaective po/r\\_t.ligaion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash /fl.ligaow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ine/ff.ligaective po/r\\_t.ligaion is recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\nAmounts accumulated in equity are reclassi/fi.ligaed to pro/fi.ligat or loss in the periods when the hedged item a/ff.ligaects pro/fi.ligat or loss (for example, when the hedged forecast sale takes place).\n\nIf the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-/fi.liganancial asset (i.e. prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment or inventories, etc.) or a non-/fi.liganancial liability, or a hedged forecast transaction for a non-/fi.liganancial asset or a non-/fi.liganancial liability becomes a /fi.ligarm commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied, the amount accumulated in equity (i.e. hedging reserve) shall be removed and included in the initial amount (cost or other carrying amount) of the asset or the liability hedged (i.e. 'basis adjustment').\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was repo/r\\_t.ligaed in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. For hedge relationships using forwards as a hedging instrument, where only the change in the value of the spot element  is  designated  as  the  hedging  instrument,  accounting for the forward element (pro/fi.ligat or loss vs OCI) is de/fi.liganed case by case. This approach is actually applied by the Group for hedging of currency risk on renewables assets.\n\nConversely, for hedge relationships using cross currency interest rate swaps as hedging instruments, the Group separates foreign currency basis spread, in designating the hedging derivative, and present them in other comprehensive income (OCI) as hedging costs.\n\nWith speci/fi.ligac regard to cash /fl.ligaow hedges of commodity risk, in order to improve their consistency with the risk management strategy, the Enel Group applies a dynamic",

        "page_content": "hedge accounting approach based on speci/fi.ligac liquidity requirements (the so-called liquidity-based approach).\n\nThis approach requires the designation of hedges through the use of the most liquid derivatives available on the market and replacing them with others that are more e/ff.ligaective in covering the risk in question.\n\nConsistent with the risk management strategy, the liquidity-based approach allows the roll-over of a derivative by replacing it with a new derivative, not only in the event of expiry but also during the hedge relationship, if and only if the new derivative meets both of the following requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 it represents a best proxy of the old derivative in terms of ranking;\n- \u00b7 it meets speci/fi.ligac liquidity requirements.\n\nSatisfaction of these requirements is veri/fi.ligaed qua/r\\_t.ligaerly. At the roll-over date, the hedge relationship is not discontinued. Accordingly, sta/r\\_t.ligaing from that date, changes in the e/ff.ligaective fair value of the new derivative will be recognized in equity (the hedging reserve), while changes in the fair value of the old derivative are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Reform of benchmarks for the determination of interest rates - IBOR reform\n\n## Overview\n\nInterbank O/ff.ligaered Rates ('IBORs') are benchmark rates at which banks can borrow funds on the interbank market on an unsecured basis for a given period ranging from overnight to 12 months, in a speci/fi.ligac currency.\n\nIn recent years there have been a number of cases of manipulation of these rates by the banks contributing to their calculation. For this reason, regulators around the world have begun a sweeping reform of interest rate benchmarks that includes the replacement of some benchmarks with alternative risk-free rates (the IBOR reform).\n\nThe Group's main exposure is based on Euribor.\n\nEuribor is still considered compliant with the European Benchmarks  Regulation  (BMR)  and  this  permits  market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants to continue to use it for both existing and new contracts.\n\nIn line with the most recent guidance issued by the major regulatory bodies, the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month USD LIBOR benchmarks have become unrepresentative after June 30, 2023 and the alternative reference rate is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).\n\nAs a result of the IBOR reform, a number of temporary exceptions to the rules on hedge relationships have been allowed in implementation of the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in September 2019 (Phase 1) and August 2020 (Phase 2) to address, respectively:\n\n- \u00b7 pre-replacement issues that impact /fi.liganancial repo/r\\_t.ligaing in the period preceding the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark with an alternative risk-free rate (Phase 1); and\n- \u00b7 post-replacement  issues  that  could  impact  /fi.liganancial repo/r\\_t.ligaing when an existing interest rate benchmark is reformed or replaced and there is no longer any initial unce/r\\_t.ligaainty, but hedge contracts and relationships still need to be updated to re/fl.ligaect the new benchmark rates (Phase 2).\n\nImpact of the IBOR reform on the Group\n\nIn a context of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty regarding the IBOR transition in the various countries, the Group has determined the overall number and nominal value of the contracts impacted by the reform. In addition, a number of contractual amendments have previously been implemented in contracts indexed to GBP LIBOR in 2021 and others have been implemented in 2023, considering that, as already mentioned, USD LIBOR benchmarks have become unrepresentative as from June 30, 2023.\n\n## Debt and derivatives\n\nThe  Group's  /fl.ligaoating  rate  debt  is  mainly  benchmarked against Euribor and is almost entirely hedged using /fi.liganancial derivatives.\n\nAt the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, the Group is planning to take no action with regard to Euribor since, as stated above, this benchmark has been comprehensively reformed to comply with the European Benchmarks Regulation. Despite the continuity with Euribor, replacement clauses may be required and could therefore be implemented by the Group in the new contracts in accordance with the evolution of accepted market practice.\n\nDuring 2023, the Group obtained new dollar loans indexed to SOFR and focused on the implementation of how to change all exposures from USD LIBOR to USD SOFR.\n\nThe Group's derivative instruments are managed through contracts that are mainly based on framework agreements de/fi.liganed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).\n\nThe ISDA has revised its standardized contracts in light of the IBOR reform and amended the choices for /fl.ligaoating rates within the 2006 ISDA de/fi.liganitions to include replacement clauses that would apply upon the permanent discontinuation of speci/fi.ligac key benchmarks. These changes took e/ff.ligaect on January 25, 2021. Transactions represented in the 2006 ISDA de/fi.liganitions carried out on January 25, 2021 or later include adjusted /fl.ligaoating-rate options (e.g., the choice of /fl.ligaoating rate with replacement clause), while transactions completed before that date (previous derivative contracts) continue to be based on the 2006 ISDA de/fi.liganitions.\n\nFor this reason, the ISDA published an IBOR Fallback Protocol to facilitate multilateral amendments to include the amended de/fi.liganitions.\n\nAs regards Euribor, the Group is assessing whether to: (i) adopt that protocol in the light of its exposure and developments in the IBOR reform or (ii) adjust in advance any contracts impacted bilaterally by the reform.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Hedge relationships\n\nAt the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, hedged items and hedging instruments are primarily indexed to Euribor, SOFR and SONIA.\n\nThe Group has assessed the impact of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty engendered by the IBOR reform on hedge relationships at December 31, 2023 with reference to both hedging instruments and hedged items. Both the hedged items and the hedging instruments have changed their parameterization from interbank market-based benchmarks (IBORs) to alternative risk-free rates (RFRs) as a result of the contractual amendments that have taken e/ff.ligaect.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, in order to manage the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty associated with both hedging instruments and hedged items indexed to USD LIBOR, until June 30, 2023 the Group has continued to apply the temporary exceptions provided for in the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in September 2019 (Phase 1). It was therefore felt that the benchmark indices for determining the interest rates on which the cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged items or the hedging instruments are based would not change as a consequence of the IBOR reform. The exception was applied for the following hedge relationship requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 determining if a forecast transaction is highly probable;\n- \u00b7 establishing whether the future hedged cash /fl.ligaows will arise in a discontinued cash /fl.ligaow hedge relationship;\n- \u00b7 assessing  the  economic  relationship  between  the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n\nThe hedge relationships impacted may have become ine/ff.ligaective due to di/ff.ligaerent replacements of existing bench-\n\nmarks with alternative risk-free benchmarks. In order to avoid that risk, the Group has sought to implement the replacements at the same time.\n\nIn addition, the Group changed the reference to USD LIBOR in its interest rate hedging instruments used in cash /fl.ligaow hedge  relationships  with  the  new,  economically equivalent, SOFR benchmark in 2023. Consequently, the Group no longer applies the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in September 2019 (Phase 1) to these hedge relationships and, consequently, is applying the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in August 2020 (Phase 2), modifying the formal designation of the hedge relationship as required by the IBOR reform and without considering this event as a termination of the hedge relationship.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, for cash /fl.ligaow hedge relationships, in modifying the description of the hedged item in the hedge relationship, the amounts accumulated in the cash /fl.ligaow hedge reserve were considered on the basis of the alternative benchmark index in relation to which the future hedged cash /fl.ligaows are determined.\n\n## 51.1.1 Hedge relationships by type of risk hedged\n\nInterest rate risk\n\nThe following table shows the notional amount and the average interest rate of instruments hedging the interest rate risk on transactions outstanding at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, broken down by maturity.\n\n|                                               | Maturity   | Maturity   | Maturity   | Maturity   | Maturity   | Maturity   | Maturity   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Millions of euro                              | 2024       | 2025       | 2026       | 2027       | 2028       | Beyond     | Total      |\n| At Dec. 31, 2023                              |            |            |            |            |            |            |            |\n| Interest rate swaps                           |            |            |            |            |            |            |            |\n| Total notional amount                         | 708        | 564        | 879        | 1,975      | 19         | 3,781      | 7, 9 2 6   |\n| Notional amount related to IRSs in euro       | 608        | 564        | 636        | 1,532      | 19         | 3,141      | 6,500      |\n| Average IRS rate in euro                      | 4.56       | 1.92       | 2.12       | 3.38       | 0.86       | 2.37       |            |\n| Notional amount related to IRSs in US dollars | 46         | -          | -          | 444        | -          | 210        | 700        |\n| Average IRS rate in US dollars                | 0.70       |            |            | 3.28       |            | 5.05       |            |",

In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular:\n\n- \u00b7 CCIRSs with a total amount of \u20ac737 million expired;\n- \u00b7 a pa/r\\_t.ligaial unwinding operation of CCIRSs was carried out following the early repurchase of pa/r\\_t.liga of the hybrid bond denominated in US dollars. That transaction, together with the natural expiry of the residual po/r\\_t.ligaion of that liability and the associated CCIRSs, caused a decrease in the notional amount compared with December 31, 2022 of \u20ac1,171 million;\n- \u00b7 new derivatives amounted to \u20ac109 million. The notional amount decreased by \u20ac813 million, re/fl.ligaecting developments in the exchange rate of the euro against the main other currencies and the e/ff.ligaect of amo/r\\_t.ligaization.\n\nThe notional amount of currency forwards at December 31, 2023 amounted to \u20ac6,309 million (\u20ac9,126 million at Decem-\n\n31, 2022), a decrease of \u20ac2,817 million. The exposure to currency risk, especially that associated with the US dollar, is mainly due to purchases of natural gas, purchases of fuel and cash /fl.ligaows in respect of investments.\n\nAfter the turbulence experienced in raw material prices during 2022, which led to a considerable increase in the notional amounts hedged, the notional value of currency hedges on energy commodities returned to normal operating levels in 2023. The deterioration of net fair value of \u20ac137 million re/fl.ligaected normal developments in exchange rates.\n\n## Fair value hedge derivatives\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas net gains and losses recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, re/fl.ligaecting changes in the fair value of fair value hedge derivatives and the hedged item that are a/t\\_t.ligaributable to currency risk for 2023 and the previous year.\n\n| Millions of euro                  | 2023 Net gain/(loss)   | 2022 Net gain/(loss)   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Interest rate hedging instruments | 20                     | (119)                  |\n| Hedged item                       | (12)                   | 129                    |\n| Ine/ff.ligaective po/r\\_t.ligaion  | 8                      | 10                     |\n\nThe following table shows the impact of fair value hedges of currency risk in the statement of /fi.liganancial position at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n| Millions of euro                            | at Dec. 31, 2023   | at Dec. 31, 2023   | at Dec. 31, 2023                                                | at Dec. 31, 2022   | at Dec. 31, 2022                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                             | Notional  amount   | Carrying  amount   | Fair value used  to measure  ine/ff.ligaectiveness  in the year | Notional  amount   | Carrying  amount Fair value used  to measure  ine/ff.ligaectiveness  in the year |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps (CCIRSs) | 1,019              | (66)               | (68)                                                            | 1,097              | (84) (87)                                                                        |\n\nThe following table shows the impact of the hedged item of fair value hedges in the statement of /fi.liganancial position at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n| Millions of euro                             | at Dec. 31, 2023   | at Dec. 31, 2023                                      | at Dec. 31, 2023                                                | at Dec. 31, 2022   | at Dec. 31, 2022                                      | at Dec. 31, 2022                                                |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                              | Carrying  amount   | Cumulative  adjustment of  fair value of  hedged item | Fair value used  to measure  ine/ff.ligaectiveness  in the year | Carrying  amount   | Cumulative  adjustment of  fair value of  hedged item | Fair value used  to measure  ine/ff.ligaectiveness  in the year |\n| Fixed-rate bonds in foreign currencies       | 500                | (77)                                                  | 48                                                              | 458                | (106)                                                 | 90                                                              |\n| Fixed-rate borrowings in foreign  currencies | 434                | (7)                                                   | 24                                                              | 520                | (8)                                                   | (2)                                                             |\n| Total                                        | 934                | (84)                                                  | 72                                                              | 978                | (114)                                                 | 88                                                              |",

The negative fair value of \u20ac29 million deteriorated by \u20ac6 million on the previous year mainly due to developments in the yield curve.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 the notional amount of derivatives on exchange rates was \u20ac3,692 million. After the strains experienced in raw material prices during 2022, which led to a considerable increase in the notional amounts hedged, the notional value of currency hedges on energy commodities returned to normal operating levels in 2023. This produced an overall decrease in the value of the hedges of \u20ac2,069 million. The deterioration of net fair value of \u20ac45 million re/fl.ligaected normal developments in exchange rates.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the notional amount of derivatives on commodities came to \u20ac35,983 million. In absolute terms, the notional amounts decreased compared with 2022 in line with the gradual decline observed in the prices of energy commodities. The fair value of trading derivatives on commodities classi/fi.ligaed as assets mainly re/fl.ligaects the market valuation of hedges of gas and oil amounting to \u20ac3,609 million, derivatives on power amounting to\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\n## 52. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value\n\nThe Group determines fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 whenever such measurement is required by the IFRS as a recognition or measurement criterion.\n\nFair value is de/fi.liganed as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction, between market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants, at the measurement date (i.e. an exit price).\n\nThe best proxy of fair value is market price, i.e. the current publicly available price actually used on a liquid and active market.\n\nThe fair value of assets and liabilities is classi/fi.ligaed in accordance with the three-level hierarchy described below, depending on the inputs and valuation techniques used in determining their fair value:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1, where the fair value is determined on the basis of quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;\n- \u00b7 Level 2, where the fair value is determined on the basis of inputs other than quoted prices included within\n\n\u20ac933 million, derivatives on CO 2 amounting to \u20ac55 million and, to a lesser extent, derivatives on coal and other commodities totaling \u20ac23 million and \u20ac4 million, respectively. The  fair  value  of  trading  derivatives  on  commodities classi/fi.ligaed as liabilities mainly regards hedges of gas and oil  amounting  to  \u20ac3,362  million,  derivatives  on  power amounting to \u20ac1,093 million, and derivatives on CO 2 , coal and other commodities in the amount of \u20ac56 million, \u20ac43 million and \u20ac77 million, respectively.\n\nThese amounts include transactions managed within the trading po/r\\_t.ligafolios and transactions that, although established for hedging purposes, did not meet the requirements for hedge accounting.\n\nIn addition to weather derivative hedges, the 'other' category includes hedges carried out on guarantees of origin and green ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates, i.e. incentive mechanisms for the production of electricity from renewable sources. In addition to the commodity price risk, the Group companies have to manage the risk of /fl.ligauctuations in the price of these ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates which were recently a/ff.ligaected by greater market volatility compared with the past, due to the increasing market a/t\\_t.ligaention to environmental sustainability issues.\n\nLevel 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (such as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices);\n\n- \u00b7 Level 3, where the fair value is determined on the basis of unobservable inputs.\n\nThis note also provides detailed disclosures concerning the valuation techniques and inputs used to pe/r\\_f.ligaorm these measurements.\n\n## To that end:\n\n- \u00b7 recurring fair value measurements of assets or liabilities are those required or permi/t\\_t.ligaed by the IFRS in the statement of /fi.liganancial position at the close of each period;\n- \u00b7 non-recurring fair value measurements are those required or permi/t\\_t.ligaed by the IFRS in the statement of /fi.liganancial position in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular circumstances.\n\nFor general information or speci/fi.ligac disclosures on the accounting treatment of these circumstances, please see note 2 'Accounting policies'.",

This legislation also introduced a number of changes  in  the  ma/t\\_t.ligaer  of  concession  fees,  establishing a /fi.ligaxed and variable component of fees, as well as an obligation to provide free power to public bodies (220 kWh of power for each kW of average nominal capacity of the facilities covered by the concession). In implementation of this national law and under speci/fi.ligac enabling authority, as of today various regions (Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the Province of Trento, Veneto, Calabria, Basilicata, Abruzzo and Umbria) have enacted regional laws implementing state legislation, and requested\n\nThe decrease of \u20ac49,330 million in commitments for 'fuel purchases' mainly regards the decrease in gas prices, especially in Italy and Spain, compared to 2022.\n\nFor more details on the expiry of commitments and guarantees, please see the section 'Commitments to purchase commodities' in note 49.\n\npayment of the dual-component fee and the monetization of free electricity supplies.\n\nEnel Produzione SpA and Enel Green Power SpA challenged before the Superior Public Water Resources Cou/r\\_t.liga implementing acts issued under the individual regional laws and the subsequent payment notices of fees and the monetization of free electricity supplies, asking that they be declared void and raising the question of constitutional illegitimacy of both the national law and the regional laws.\n\nThe companies initiated the proceedings by complaining that the regional implementing acts - as well as the regional legislation which they implement - were constitutionally illegitimate, /fi.ligarst for violation of national legislation and various primary principles protected both by the Italian Constitution and European law concerning legitimate expectations, prope/r\\_t.ligay rights, reasonableness, private initiative, and concessions, where:\n\n- \u00b7 they provide for retroactive application to valid large diversion concessions of the dual-component fee and the obligation to supply free power or its /fi.liganancial equivalent;\n- \u00b7 they order the monetization of the obligation to supply free energy, which is not envisaged in the national law.

This  circumstance  is  in  evident  contrast  with  the principles of reasonableness, propo/r\\_t.ligaionality and legitimate expectation of concession fees, compliance with which is required by constitutional case law if, in the context of longterm relationships, pejorative modi/fi.ligacations are introduced. Both the national law and the regional implementing legislation violate Community principles and constitutional principles such as prope/r\\_t.ligay rights, the principle of legal ce/r\\_t.ligaainty, and the freedom of enterprise. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the rules do not expressly provide for the transfer of the business unit from the outgoing to the successor concession holder, and also establish inadequate criteria for the valorization of the works to be transferred, which threatens to create what is essentially a mechanism for expropriation, in violation of constitutional principles.\n\nThe pending cases against the regions of Lombardy and Piedmont have been adjourned to the collegial hearings of April 24, 2024 and June 12, 2024, while the remaining proceedings are still pending in the preliminary investigation phase.\n\n## Antitrust proceeding 12461 - EE - Contract renewals - Italy\n\nOn December 13, 2022, the Competition Authority noti/fi.ligaed Enel Energia SpA ('the Company' or 'EE') and six other companies (Hera, A2A, Acea, Eni Plenitude, Engie, Edison) that it had initiated a proceeding for unfair commercial practices (violation of ce/r\\_t.ligaain provisions of the Consumer Code and A/r\\_t.ligaicle 3 of Legislative Decree 115/2022, the second 'Aid Decree').\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Competition Authority, among other thing, argued that EE had sent its customers, in the period from May to October 2022, notices of price changes that were allegedly generic and omissive to the extent that they did not specify the expiry date of the /fi.liganancial conditions subject to renewal and represented an unwarranted exercise of ius variandi in modi/fi.ligacation of the /fi.liganancial conditions of the supply relationship, in violation of the aforementioned A/r\\_t.ligaicle 3 of the second Aid Decree.\n\nWith the measure initiating the procedure, the Competition Authority simultaneously prohibited on a precautionary basis the sending of new price change notices and ordered the correction of those already sent.\n\nAll the operators subject to the order, including EE, challenged the provision, which was based on the assumption that any price change had been prohibited to suppliers in the period indicated by the second Aid Decree (August 10 - April 30, then extended until June 30, 2023 by Legislative Decree 198/2022, the 'Milleproroghe Decree').\n\nFollowing the pronouncement of the Council of State of December 22, 2022 and the Milleproroghe Decree of December 29, 2022, which excluded the applicability of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 3 of the Decree to contract renewals (of expiring o/ff.ligaers) in compliance with the contractual terms of notice and without prejudice to the right of withdrawal of the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay, thus distinguishing them from those covered by the ius variandi, the Competition Authority, with a new precautionary measure on December 29, 2022, ordered the pa/r\\_t.ligaial upholding of the original precautionary measure and con/fi.ligarmed the prohibition on changes or renewals of the /fi.liganancial conditions of expiring contracts for which the expiry date was not speci/fi.ligacally identi/fi.ligaed or in any case predeterminable in the associated notice sent to the customer. EE /fi.ligaled an appeal for additional reasons against this measure. With a ruling published on May 19, 2023, the Lazio Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga accepted the arguments of EE and voided the two precautionary measures of the Competition Authority on December 12, 2022 and December 29, 2022, disagreeing  with  the  logical  process  established  by  the Competition Authority as a basis for the provisions, which were deemed to lack grounds for success. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, according to the Cou/r\\_t.liga, the legislator intended to suspend only the changes to the rules po/r\\_t.ligaion of the agreement and not also the updating of expired or expiring prices, as this would /fi.ligax the previous pricing conditions inde/fi.liganitely. Both AGCM and EE appealed the Cou/r\\_t.liga ruling before the Council of State and the proceeding is pending.\n\nIn the meantime, on November 15, 2023, the Competition Authority, acting in the proceeding for unfair commercial practices, issued a ruling /fi.liganding a violation of A/r\\_t.ligaicles 24 and 25 of the Consumer Code, levying a /fi.ligane of \u20ac10 million on EE, which was paid by EE on December 15, 2023. On January 15, 2024, EE appealed to void the /fi.ligane before the Lazio Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga.\n\nIn an order issued following the hearing held on March 20, 2024, the Lazio Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga granted a petition presented jointly by the pa/r\\_t.ligaies to address the grounds for appeal at the hearing on the merits scheduled for July 17, 2024.\n\n## Criminal proceeding against e-distribuzione concerning an accident - Italy\n\nOn July 1, 2021, e-distribuzione SpA was noti/fi.ligaed of a proceeding against a number of its employees and managers and e-distribuzione SpA itself pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001, initiated by the Public Prosecutor's O/ffi.ligace of Taranto, following the accident that occurred on the night between June 27 and 28, 2021 in which an employee of a contractor was injured and subsequently died.\n\nDuring the investigative phase, an unrepeatable technical assessment was ordered and the repo/r\\_t.liga of the Technical Consultant of the Public Prosecutor, dated December 15, 2021, was /fi.ligaled and incorporated in the Public Prosecutor's case.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A notice of conclusion of the preliminary investigation pursuant to Article 415bis of the Code of Criminal Procedure was sent to the remaining defendants and the company and, on April 17, 2023, a notice was served to set the preliminary hearing before the Preliminary Hearing Judge of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Taranto for May 23, 2023. Following adjournments, the preliminary hearing was scheduled to continue on February 20, 2024, when the pa/r\\_t.ligaies were heard, including the request for a plea deal from one of the defendants. The Cou/r\\_t.liga then rescheduled the hearing to May 21, 2024 for the decision to send the case to trial.\n\nIn agreement with the insurance company, a process was de/fi.liganed to reach a se/t\\_t.ligalement with the heirs of the deceased to extinguish the claims formulated by the injured pa/r\\_t.ligaies without admission of liability.\n\n## Arbitration proceedings Enel Produzione SpA - Italy\n\nIn the 4th Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2023 a coal supplier initiated an arbitration proceeding against Enel Produzione requesting the ful/fi.ligallment by the la/t\\_t.ligaer of ce/r\\_t.ligaain coal supply contracts stipulated between the pa/r\\_t.ligaies during 2021, pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of  which  was  suspended  by  Enel  Produzione  in  March 2022 due to the sanctions imposed with EU Regulations no. 269/2014 and no. 833/2014. A claim of about $11 million was /fi.ligaled for supplies already executed and about $62 million for expected supplier, plus interest. The arbitration proceedings are pending and are currently expected to be completed in 2025.\n\n## Green Network litigation - Italy\n\nWith a summons dated May 8, 2019, Green Network SpA (GN) sued Enel Energia SpA (EE) before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Rome to asce/r\\_t.ligaain alleged anti-competitive conduct (including illegal win-back practices) that EE carried out in an attempt to recover customers who would have moved to the competing trader and, as a result, order EE to pay damages quanti/fi.ligaed at \u20ac116,049,056, plus interest and monetary revaluation, in addition to the publication of the sentence. EE formally appeared in cou/r\\_t.liga, contesting the validity of the opposing pa/r\\_t.ligay's claim in fact and law and requesting the complete denial of the claims, as well as an order for the plainti/ff.liga to pay damages for frivolous litigation. After conducting  the  preliminary  investigation  phase,  during which a cou/r\\_t.liga-ordered phonic assessment was pe/r\\_f.ligaormed, the Cou/r\\_t.liga rejected the plainti/ff.liga's fu/r\\_t.ligaher preliminary investigation requests and adjourned the case for summing up to a hearing scheduled for June 27, 2024.\n\n## Penalty proceeding for Enel Energia - Italy\n\nOn February 29, 2024, the Personal Data Protection Authority  (DPA)  announced  that  it  was  levying  a  /fi.ligane  of\n\n\u20ac79,107,101 on Enel Energia SpA, in addition to a number of prescriptive measures.\n\nThe action originates with a proceeding unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by the DPA in July 2023, during which the company was accused of failing to adopt an adequate system for monitoring and controlling the operation of its agencies, which, in the period from 2015 to 2022, also made use of operators who were not o/ffi.ligacially appointed, for the sole purpose of maximizing their pro/fi.ligats even to the detriment of the company itself.\n\nIn the meantime, the company, acting for its own protection, had already taken all the contractually established measures against the agencies involved in the circumstances addressed by the penalty measure and had also /fi.ligaled criminal complaints against the operators who had acted abusively.\n\nThe company, considering the objections raised by the DPA to be unfounded, intends to challenge the provision before the Civil Cou/r\\_t.liga of Rome, /fi.ligaling a request for suspension of both the payment of the /fi.ligane and the prescriptive measures.\n\n## BEG litigation - Italy, France, Luxembourg\n\nFollowing an arbitration proceeding initiated by BEG SpA (BEG) in Italy, Enelpower SpA (now Enelpower Srl) obtained a ruling in its favor in 2002, which was upheld by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation in 2010, which entirely rejected the petition for damages with regard to alleged breach by Enelpower of an agreement concerning the assessment of the possible construction of a hydroelectric power station in Albania. Subsequently, BEG, acting through its subsidiary Albania BEG Ambient, /fi.ligaled suit against Enelpower and Enel SpA (Enel) in Albania concerning the ma/t\\_t.ligaer, obtaining a ruling from the District Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana on March 24, 2009, upheld by the Albanian Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation, ordering Enelpower and Enel to pay to/r\\_t.ligaious damages of about \u20ac25 million for 2004 as well as an unspeci/fi.ligaed amount of to/r\\_t.ligaious damages for subsequent years. Following the ruling, Albania BEG Ambient demanded payment of more than \u20ac430 million.\n\nIn November 2016, Enel and Enelpower /fi.ligaled a petition with the Albanian Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation, asking for the ruling issued by the District Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana on March 24, 2009 to be voided. The proceeding is still pending.\n\nWith a ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal of Rome of March 7, 2022, the fu/r\\_t.ligaher proceedings unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by Enel and Enelpower  before  the  Cou/r\\_t.liga  of  Rome  were  concluded, having sought recognition of BEG's liability for having circumvented the arbitration award rendered in Italy in favor of Enelpower through the aforementioned initiatives unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by the subsidiary ABA. With the ruling, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal of Rome upheld the ruling of /fi.ligarst instance rendered by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Rome on June 16, 2015, which had denied the petition in the proceeding.\n\nOn May 20, 2021, the European Cou/r\\_t.liga of Human Rights (ECHR) issued a ruling with which it decided the appeal",

        "page_content": "brought by BEG against the Italian State for violation of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 6.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. With this decision, the Cou/r\\_t.liga denied BEG's request to reopen the above arbitration proceedings, and also rejected BEG's claim for pecuniary damages amounting to about \u20ac1.2 billion due to the absence of a causal link with the disputed conduct, granting it \u20ac15,000 in non-pecuniary damages.\n\nNonetheless, on December 29, 2021, BEG, with an action that the company and its legal counsel deemed unfounded and specious, also decided to sue the Italian State before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Milan, to demand, as a consequence of the ECHR ruling, damages for to/r\\_t.ligaious liability in an amount of about \u20ac1.8 billion. In this case, BEG also involved Enel and Enelpower by way of a claim of joint and several liability. With an order of June 14, 2022, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Milan, in accepting the objection of territorial incompetence raised by the State A/t\\_t.ligaorney, declared its incompetence to hear the dispute in favor of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Rome, the cou/r\\_t.liga exclusively competent to hear the causes in which the Italian State is involved, ordering BEG to pay the costs of the proceedings in favor of the defendants. BEG did not resume the judgment before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Rome within the legal term of October 14, 2022 and therefore the proceeding was extinguished.\n\nA sho/r\\_t.liga time later, on November 3, 2022, BEG resubmitted the same claims for damages of the terminated proceeding, serving a new writ of summons before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Milan against the same defendants, with the exception of the Italian State, which BEG declared not to wishing to agree to this judgement. Enel and Enelpower are preparing their defenses to proceed with the appearance in cou/r\\_t.liga in order to contest the claim, which is considered entirely specious and unfounded, like the previous similar initiative. Following the hearing for admission of evidence, the Cou/r\\_t.liga issued an order on October 26, 2023 denying the preliminary requests of the plainti/ff.liga and, considering the case ready for decision, scheduled /fi.liganal arguments for October 17, 2024.\n\n## Proceedings unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by Albania BEG Ambient Shpk (ABA) to obtain enforcement of the ruling of the District Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana of March 24, 2009\n\n## Italy\n\nWith an appeal noti/fi.ligaed on September 11, 2023, Albania BEG Ambient ShpK (ABA) initiated a proceeding before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal of Rome against Enel SpA and Enelpower Srl, in order to obtain, pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 67 of Law 218/1995, enforcement of the ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana of March 24, 2009. The two companies are preparing their defense to contest the claim for execution in Italy as well. Following the initial hearing, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal adjourned the proceeding until September 18, 2025 for oral arguments.\n\n## France\n\nIn 2012, ABA /fi.ligaled suit against Enel and Enelpower with the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris in order to render the ruling of the Albanian cou/r\\_t.liga enforceable in France.\n\nOn January 29, 2018, the Tribunal de Grande Instance rejected ABA claim. Among other issues, the Tribunal de Grande Instance ruled that: (i) the Albanian ruling con/fl.ligaicted with an existing decision (the arbitration ruling of 2002) and that (ii) the fact that BEG sought to obtain in Albania what it was not able to obtain in the Italian arbitration proceeding, resubmi/t\\_t.ligaing the same claim through ABA, represented fraud.\n\nSubsequently, with a ruling of May 4, 2021, the Paris Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal denied the appeal by ABA, in full, upholding the ruling at /fi.ligarst instance and, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, fully upholding the non-compatibility of the Albanian ruling with the arbitration award of 2002, ordering it to reimburse Enel and Enelpower \u20ac200,000.00 each for legal costs.\n\nWith a ruling of May 17, 2023 the French Cour de Cassation rejected ABA's appeal, thereby de/fi.liganitively denying the ABA's petition for execution.\n\nFollowing the favorable ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, Enel initiated a separate proceeding to obtain release of the precautionary a/t\\_t.ligaachments granted to ABA of any receivables of Enel in respect of Enel France. With an order of June 16, 2022, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Paris ordered the release of the precautionary a/t\\_t.ligaachments while also ordering ABA to pay Enel a total of about \u20ac146,000 in damages and legal costs. ABA challenged the aforementioned release order and the appeal was granted by the Paris Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal with a decision of May 17, 2023. On June 16, 2023 Enel /fi.ligaled a petition and on December 15, 2023 formally appealed that ruling before the French Cour de Cassation .\n\n## The Netherlands\n\nIn 2014, ABA /fi.ligaled suit with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Amsterdam to render the ruling of the Albanian cou/r\\_t.liga enforceable in the Netherlands.\n\nFollowing an initial ruling of June 29, 2016, in favor of ABA, in a ruling of July 17, 2018, the Amsterdam Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal upheld the appeal advanced by Enel and Enelpower, ruling that the Albanian judgment cannot be recognized and enforced in the Netherlands, as it was arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable and therefore contrary to Dutch public order. Subsequently, the proceeding before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal continued with regard to the subordinate question raised by ABA with which it asked the Dutch cou/r\\_t.liga to rule on the merits of the dispute in Albania and in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular the alleged to/r\\_t.ligaious liability of Enel and Enelpower in the failure to build the power plant in Albania. On December 3, 2019, the Amsterdam Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal issued a de/fi.liganitive ruling in which it rejected any claim made by ABA, thereby con/fi.ligarming the denial of recognition and enforcement of the Albanian ruling in the Netherlands.

Morgan Bank Luxembourg SA was also served with an order for a number of precautionary seizures of any receivables of both Enel Group companies in respect of the bank.\n\nIn parallel ABA /fi.ligaled a claim to obtain enforcement of the ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana in Luxembourg. Owing to a number of procedural delays, the proceeding is still in the initial stages and no ruling has been issued. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, after several legal representatives appointed by ABA withdrew from the cause, in September 2023 the cou/r\\_t.liga suspended the proceeding.\n\n## United States and Ireland\n\nIn 2014, ABA had initiated two proceedings requesting execution of the Albanian sentence before the cou/r\\_t.ligas of the State of New York and Ireland, which both ruled in favor of Enel and Enelpower, respectively, on February 23 and February 26, 2018. Accordingly, there are no lawsuits pending in Ireland or New York State.\n\n## Environmental incentives - Endesa Generaci\u00f3n SA - Spain\n\nFollowing the Decision of November 27, 2017 (the 'Decision') of the European Commission on the issue of environmental incentives for thermal power plants, on March 2, 2018 the Commission's Directorate-General for Competition has initiated a formal enquiry pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 108, paragraph 2, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in order to establish whether the environmental incentive for coal power plants provided for in Spain's Order ITC/3860/2007 represents State aid compatible with the internal market. On April 13, 2018, acting as an interested third pa/r\\_t.ligay, Endesa Generaci\u00f3n submi/t\\_t.ligaed comments contesting this interpretation. Subsequently, on September 8, 2021, the appeal of the decision lodged by Gas Natural (now Naturgy) with the General Cou/r\\_t.liga of the European Union was denied. The ruling was appealed by Naturgy and EDP Espa\u00f1a before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Endesa Generaci\u00f3n /fi.ligaled a request to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in the proceeding and, with an order of June 1, 2022, the CJEU allowed that pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation. Subsequently, following the /fi.ligaling of the ruling of the Advocate General, on December 14, 2023, the CJEU voided both the decision and ruling of the General Cou/r\\_t.liga.\n\n## Bono Social - Spain\n\nIn relation to the various /fi.liganancing schemes for the Bono Social adopted by the Spanish government, with ruling no. 212/2022 of February 21, 2022 the Tribunal Supremo ruled on the appeals /fi.ligaled by Endesa SA, Endesa Energ\u00eda SAU and Energ\u00eda XXI Comercializadora de Referencia SLU (Endesa) and other companies in the energy sector against the third scheme for /fi.liganancing the Bono Social , and for co-/fi.liganancing with government authorities of the supply to vulnerable consumers, envisaged under A/r\\_t.ligaicle 45, paragraph 4 of Spain's Electricity Industry Law 24/2013, Royal Decree Law 7/2016 of December 23 and Royal Decree 897/2017 of October 6.\n\nWith the ruling, the Tribunal Supremo , pa/r\\_t.ligaially allowing the appeals, found that (i) the aforesaid regime was inapplicable; (ii) A/r\\_t.ligaicles 12 to 17 of Royal Decree 897/2017 are inapplicable and void, and (iii) the appellants were entitled to be compensated for the amounts paid to /fi.liganance the Bono Social and provide co-/fi.liganancing with government authorities, and to reimbursement of all costs incurred to ful/fi.ligall the obligations set out in this mechanism, deducting any amounts transferred to customers, where applicable. In the absence of voluntary compliance by the authorities, on November 10, 2022 the companies /fi.ligaled a petition for enforcement of the ruling, requesting immediate payment of the uncontested pa/r\\_t.liga, equal to about \u20ac152 million, for /fi.liganancing costs associated with customers in the regulated market, as well as payment of other amounts as quanti/fi.ligaed in the technical studies prepared by the companies. With an order of May 26, 2023 the Tribunal Supremo (i) ordered the government to pay Endesa \u20ac152,272,229.83, plus interest, (ii) required the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO) to quantify as soon as possible the additional amounts to be paid to Endesa in respect of (a) costs to /fi.liganance the Bono Social for the free market, deducting any amounts transferred to customers, and (b) investments made to implement the Bono Social , and to pay Endesa those amounts, plus interest, within two months. On July 28, 2023, the Secretary of State for Energy (MITECO) announced a resolution that grants Endesa (i) an indemnity of \u20ac171.6 million (including interest) for /fi.liganancing costs associated with customers in the regulated market and (ii) an additional indemnity of \u20ac6.6 million (including interest) for costs incurred to implement the Bono Social . However, the resolution does not provide for any indemnity for the /fi.liganancing costs of the Bono Social for the free market. Therefore, on September 18, 2023 Endesa /fi.ligaled arguments suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by technical studies with the Tribunal Supremo to demonstrate Endesa's entitlement to be indemni/fi.ligaed for the free market segment as well.",

        "page_content": "## 'Endesa I and II' industrial relations dispute Spain\n\nAfter being signed by the social pa/r\\_t.liganers and entering force on January 23, 2020, the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement was published in the Spanish O/ffi.ligacial Journal ( Bolet\u00edn O/fi.ligacial del Estado ) on June 17, 2020, taking full e/ff.ligaect.\n\nOn December 30, 2020, the Audiencia Nacional noti/fi.ligaed Endesa a new petition for a 'collective dispute' initiated by three trade unions with minority representation /fi.ligaled on December 1, 2020, concerning the cancellation of some 'derogatory provisions' of the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement. The plainti/ff.ligas claim that the contested 'derogatory provisions' would imply the illegitimate abolition of social bene/fi.ligats and economic rights of workers. Endesa considers these provisions to be fully legitimate, in line with the arguments made during proceeding concerning the reduction of social bene/fi.ligats for retired personnel. With a ruling of November 15, 2021, the petitions of the plainti/ff.liga unions were rejected, with veri/fi.ligacation of the legitimacy of the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement. The ruling was appealed by the trade unions before the Tribunal Supremo and the proceeding is currently under way.\n\nMoreover, with reference to the 4th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement, on July 7, 2021 the Tribunal Supremo issued a de/fi.liganitive ruling denying the appeals lodged by the  aforementioned  unions  against  the  termination  of the agreement by Endesa, a/ffi.ligarming that social bene/fi.ligats (including those relating to electricity prices) originate exclusively in the collective bargaining agreements, both for employees currently in service and those who have retired, as well as for their family members, with the consequence that the termination of such agreements produces the general contractual regulation of the conditions established therein for employees currently in service and, for those who have retired and their family members, the de/fi.liganitive extinction of all their rights, until new regulations (which came with the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement). That decision is also de/fi.liganitive for the individual proceeding brought concerning the same issue.\n\n## GNL Endesa Generaci\u00f3n SA arbitration proceeding I - Spain\n\nIn the course of an arbitration proceeding to review the price of a long-term supply contract for lique/fi.ligaed natural gas (LNG) initiated by Endesa Generaci\u00f3n SA, the defendant, an LNG production company, /fi.ligaled a counterclaim demanding payment of about $1.283 billion at September 30, 2023. The proceeding was concluded with an award on November 15, 2023, with the pa/r\\_t.ligaial grant of the counterclaim. Both pa/r\\_t.ligaies /fi.ligaled petitions for clari/fi.ligacation and correction of the award; a decision is pending. Meanwhile, the defendant issued an invoice in the amount of $587 million.\n\n## GNL Endesa Generaci\u00f3n SA arbitration proceeding II - Spain\n\nIn March 2023, a lique/fi.ligaed natural gas (LNG) producer initiated an arbitration proceeding within the context of a proceeding for the revision of the price of a long-term supply contract for LNG against Endesa Generaci\u00f3n SA, demanding payment of about $585 million at December 31, 2023. The amount of the claim could be revised depending on market developments in months up to the completion of arbitration proceeding, which is scheduled for the 2nd Half of 2024. The company believes that this counterclaim is unfounded.\n\n## Tractebel litigation - Brazil\n\nIn 1998 the Brazilian company CIEN (now Enel CIEN) signed an agreement with Tractebel (now Engie Brasil Energia SA) for the delivery of electricity from Argentina through its Argentina-Brazil interconnection line. As a result of Argentine regulatory changes introduced as a consequence of the economic crisis in 2002, Enel CIEN was unable to make the electricity available to Tractebel.\n\nIn October 2009, Tractebel sued Enel CIEN for alleged breach of contract. Enel CIEN submi/t\\_t.ligaed its defense citing force majeure as a result of the Argentine crisis as the main argument. Out of cou/r\\_t.liga, Tractebel indicated that it plans to acquire 30% of the interconnection line involved in the dispute. With a ruling of February 16, 2023, the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance denied the grounds of the claim submi/t\\_t.ligaed by Tractebel against Enel CIEN. The ruling was appealed by Tractebel on March 20, 2023, but on February 29, 2024 the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal upheld the decision at /fi.ligarst instance in favor of Enel CIEN. The amount involved in the dispute is estimated at about R$715 million (about \u20ac133 million), plus damages to be quanti/fi.ligaed.\n\nFor similar reasons, the company Furnas, in May 2010, had also presented a sue against Enel CIEN for the failure to deliver electricity, requesting payment of about R$571.6 million (about \u20ac91 million), plus damages to be quanti/fi.ligaed, with a claim to acquire 70% of the interconnection line. The trial concluded in favor of Enel CIEN with a sentence issued by the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a , which became /fi.liganal on October 18, 2019, which rejected all of Furnas' claims.\n\n## Cibran litigation - Brazil\n\nCompanhia  Brasileira  de  Antibi\u00f3ticos  (Cibran)  has  /fi.ligaled six suits against the Enel Group company Ampla Energia e Servi\u00e7os SA (today Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro) to obtain damages for alleged losses incurred as a result of the interruption of electricity service by the Brazilian distribution company between 1987 and 2002, in addition to non-pecuniary damages. The Cou/r\\_t.liga ordered a uni/fi.ligaed technical appraisal for those cases, the /fi.ligandings of which were pa/r\\_t.ligaly unfavorable to Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro.

Cibran subsequently challenged the /fi.ligandings of the new study, but without success.\n\nThe /fi.ligarst suit, regarding the years from 1995 to 1999, was denied in full with a ruling that became de/fi.liganitive on August 24, 2020.\n\nWith regard to the second case, /fi.ligaled in 2006 and regarding the years from 1987 to 1994, on June 1, 2015, the cou/r\\_t.ligas issued a ruling ordering Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro to pay R$96 million (about \u20ac23 million) plus interest in pecuniary damages and R$80,000 (about \u20ac19,000) in non-pecuniary damages. On November 6, 2019, the Tribunal de Justi \u00e7 a of Rio de Janeiro issued a ruling granting Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro's petition, and denying all of Cibran's claims. Subsequently, all the appeals submi/t\\_t.ligaed by Cibran between 2019 and 2022 were denied in full and, accordingly, the decision of November 6, 2019 in favor of Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro became /fi.liganal on March 24, 2023.\n\nThe remaining four suits for the years 2001 and 2002, which had been suspended pending the decision concerning the petition /fi.ligaled in 2006, are waiting to be taken up again. The value of all the disputes is estimated at about R$729 million (about \u20ac131 million).\n\n## Coperva litigation - Brazil\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of the project to expand the grid in rural areas of Brazil, in 1982 Coelce Companhia Energ\u00e9tica do Cear\u00e1 SA (today Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1), then owned by the Brazilian government and now an Enel Group company, had entered into contracts for the use of the grids of a number of cooperatives established speci/fi.ligacally to pursue the expansion project. The contracts provided for the payment of a monthly fee by Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1, which was also required to maintain the networks.\n\nThose  contracts,  between  cooperatives  established  in special  circumstances,  did  not  speci/fi.ligacally  identify  the grids  governed  by  the  agreements,  which  prompted  a number  of  the  cooperatives  to  sue  Enel  Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1 asking for, among other things, a revision of the fees agreed.\n\nThese proceedings include: (a) the suit /fi.ligaled by Cooperativa de Eletri/fi.ligaca\u00e7\u00e3o Rural do Vale do Acarau Ltda (Coperva) with a value of about R$475 million (about \u20ac89 million): Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1 was granted rulings in its favor from the trial cou/r\\_t.liga and the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, but Coperva /fi.ligaled an appeal ( embargo de declara \u00e7\u00e3o) based on procedural issues, which was also denied by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal in a ruling of January 11, 2016. On February 3, 2016, Coperva lodged an extraordinary appeal before the Tribunal Superior de Justi\u00e7a (TSJ) against the ruling on the merits, which was granted on November 5, 2018 for the ruling issued in the previous appeal ( embargo de declara\u00e7\u00e3o ). On December 3, 2018, Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1 /fi.ligaled an appeal ( agravo\n\ninterno ) against this ruling of the TSJ and the proceeding is currently pending; and (b) the suit /fi.ligaled by Cooperativa de Energia, Telefonia e Desenvolvimento Rural do Se/r\\_t.liga\u00e3o Central Ltda (COERCE) with a value of about R$285 million (about \u20ac53 million): in the suit COERCE requested a revision of the fee agreed for the use of its grids to be calculated on the basis of 2% of their value. The judgment is pending before the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance, pending the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of an engineering appraisal.\n\n## ANEEL litigation - Brazil\n\nIn 2014, Eletropaulo (today Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo) initiated an action before the Brazilian federal cou/r\\_t.ligas seeking to void the administrative measure of the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Energia El\u00e9trica (ANEEL, the national electricity agency), which in 2012 retroactively introduced a negative coe/ffi.ligacient to be applied in determining rates for the following regulatory period (2011-2015). With this provision, ANEEL ordered the restitution of the value of some components of the network previously included in rates because they were considered non-existent and denied Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo's request to include additional components in rates. The administrative measure of ANEEL was challenged and on September 9, 2014, it was suspended on a precautionary basis. The /fi.ligarst-instance proceeding has concluded and we are awaiting the decision. The value of the suit is about R$1,3 billion (about \u20ac245 million).\n\n## Endicon - Brazil\n\nOn October 17, 2021 Endicon (former Enel service provider in Brazil) /fi.ligaled a lawsuit against Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro and Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1 in which it seeks total damages of approximately R$500 million (about \u20ac93 million) for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages incurred in connection with ce/r\\_t.ligaain events allegedly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to Group companies, which occurred during the execution of the contracts and from the abusive exercise of contractual rights by the la/t\\_t.ligaer, which is alleged to have produced a loss on the management of the contracts. Following the revocation on May 10, 2022 of the precautionary measure that had been previously noti/fi.ligaed to the companies, on December 2, 2021, Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro and Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1 presented their defenses in the proceedings on the merits, and the evidentiary stage of the /fi.ligarst-instance proceeding is continuing.\n\n## Socrel - Brazil\n\nEnel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo has been sued by Servi\u00e7os de Eletricidade and Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es Ltda (Socrel) for damages for losses caused by an alleged unlawful termination of contract by the Group company that involved a series of contracts between the pa/r\\_t.ligaies, which would have caused Socrel's liquidity crisis.

With the ruling of March 27, 2023, the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo denied the entire substance of the Socrel claim. Socrel challenged the ruling, which was ove/r\\_t.ligaurned with a ruling of November 7, 2023 and remanded for trial at /fi.ligarst instance to hear oral evidence not allowed in the /fi.ligarst proceeding.\n\n## Extraordinary 2022 rate revision (Cear\u00e1) Brazil\n\nOn April 19, 2022, the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Energia El\u00e9trica (ANEEL) issued resolution no. 3.026/2022 with which it authorized an average 24.85% rate increase for 2022 for the electricity distribution services pe/r\\_f.ligaormed by Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1. Both private individuals and public institutions have challenged this resolution before the Federal Regional Cou/r\\_t.liga of the district of Cear\u00e1, for a total of six proceedings requesting, on precautionary basis, the cancellation of the e/ff.ligaects of the resolution and, on a permanent basis, the voidance of the resolution itself, arguing that the rate increase is illegitimate. In all proceedings, Enel  Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o  Cear\u00e1  has  contested  the  petitioners' claims, arguing the legitimacy of the rate adjustment. On June 21, 2022, the Federal Regional Cou/r\\_t.liga rejected the precautionary request and joindered the six proceedings in a single proceeding in consideration of fact that the relief sought and the cause of action are the same. On September 23, 2022, Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1 also submi/t\\_t.ligaed that, as a result of ce/r\\_t.ligaain subsequent legislative measures, the rate had been reduced following an extraordinary rate review and a reduction in taxes. The ruling remains pending. The estimated value of the proceeding has not been determined. Moreover, on July 31, 2023, an additional action was /fi.ligaled by one of the public petitioners with the Federal Regional Cou/r\\_t.liga for reasons connected with the previous actions, arguing that the rate increase was excessive in relation to the poor quality of service provided and alleged contractual breaches, as well as asking for collective non-pecuniary damages of about R$55 million (about \u20ac10.6 million).\n\n## CTEEP - Brazil\n\nOn March 16, 2021 Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo (formerly Eletropaulo Metropolitana Eletricidade de S\u00e3o Paulo SA Eletropaulo) /fi.ligaled a debt collection action before the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo in the amount of  about  R$1.5  billion  against  the  transmission  system operator ISA CTEEP - Companhia de Transmiss\u00e3o de Energia El\u00e9trica (CTEEP) as the original debtor for a liability arising prior to the privatization of Eletropaulo, against Centrais  El\u00e9tricas  Brasileiras  SA  (Eletrobras),  which  had initially been paid by Eletropaulo to the la/t\\_t.ligaer as pa/r\\_t.liga of a se/t\\_t.ligalement agreement. With a decision of September 26, 2023, the competent Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal upheld the ruling\n\nat /fi.ligarst instance, which had denied Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo's claim, also quantifying the defense's legal costs due for losing the cast at 13% of the present value of the claim, for an amount equal, at December 2023, to about R$365 million (about \u20ac 68 million). With a ruling of January 12, 2024 the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal denied the appeal of that decision by Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo. On February 23, 2024 the company also appealed the la/t\\_t.ligaer ruling before the higher cou/r\\_t.ligas.\n\n## Black-out November 2023 S\u00e3o Paulo - Brazil\n\nFollowing the severe weather events that on November 3, 2023 hit the concession area of Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo (ED SP), on December 31, 2023, 341 individual actions and 6 collective actions were /fi.ligaled by representatives of municipalities, unions, political pa/r\\_t.ligaies, the public prosecutor and the public defender's o/ffi.ligace requesting the grant of precautionary measures, the provision of assistance by ED SP, the provision of information/documentation, the maintenance of distribution service levels and the payment of individual and collective pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages to be determined in cou/r\\_t.liga.

More speci/fi.ligacally, the /fi.ligarst collective action, currently in the preliminary stage, was brought by around 1,140 residents of the municipality of Garz\u00f3n, who claim that the construction of the plant would reduce their business revenue by 30%. A second action was brought, between August 2011 and December 2012, by residents and businesses/associations of /fi.ligave municipalities of Huila claiming damages related to the closing of a bridge (Paso El Colegio). With regard to acciones populares , or class action lawsuits, in 2008 a suit was /fi.ligaled by a number of residents of the area demanding, among other things, that the environmental permit be suspended. As pa/r\\_t.liga of this action, on September 11, 2020, the Huila Cou/r\\_t.liga issued\n\na pa/r\\_t.ligaially unfavorable ruling against Emgesa, sentencing it to ful/fi.ligall the obligations already provided for in the environmental license. Both the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (ANLA) and Emgesa challenged this decision before the Council of State. On September 20, 2022, ANLA's appeal was denied because it had been /fi.ligaled late. The proceeding continues in relation to Emgesa's appeal.\n\nAnother acci\u00f3n popular was brought by a number of /fi.ligash farming companies over the alleged impact that /fi.ligalling the Quimbo basin would have on /fi.ligashing in the Betania basin downstream from Quimbo. After a number of precautionary rulings, on February 22, 2016, the Huila Cou/r\\_t.liga issued a ruling allowing generation to continue for six months. The cou/r\\_t.liga ordered Emgesa to prepare a technical design that would ensure compliance with oxygen level requirements and to provide collateral of about 20,000,000,000 Colombian pesos (about \u20ac5.5 million). The Huila Cou/r\\_t.liga subsequently extended the six-month time limit, and therefore, in the absence of contrary cou/r\\_t.liga rulings the Quimbo plant is continuing to generate electricity as the oxygenation system installed by Emgesa has so far demonstrated that it can maintain the oxygen levels required by the cou/r\\_t.liga. On March 22, 2018, ANLA and CAM jointly presented the /fi.liganal repo/r\\_t.liga on the monitoring of water quality downstream of the dam of the El Quimbo hydroelectric plant. Both  authorities  con/fi.ligarmed  the  compliance  of  Emgesa with the oxygen level requirements. On January 12, 2021, it was learned that the ruling of /fi.ligarst instance of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Huila had been issued. The ruling, while acknowledging that the oxygenation system implemented by Emgesa had mitigated the risks associated with the protection of fauna in the Bethany basin, imposed a series of obligations on the environmental authorities involved, as well as on Emgesa itself. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the la/t\\_t.ligaer is required to implement a decontamination project to ensure that the water in the basin does not generate risks for the /fl.ligaora and fauna of the river, which will be subject to veri/fi.ligacation by ANLA, and to make permanent the operation of the oxygenation system, adapting it to comply with the parameters established by ANLA. On March 4, 2021, Emgesa challenged the appeal ruling before the Council of State. On December 31, 2021, the Council of State ruled that Emgesa's appeal was admissible. The proceeding is continuing at the appeal level.\n\n## Nivel de Tensi\u00f3n Uno proceedings - Colombia\n\nThis dispute involves an ' acci\u00f3n de grupo ' brought by Centro M\u00e9dico de la Sabana hospital and other pa/r\\_t.ligaies against  Codensa  (now  Enel  Colombia)  seeking  restitution of allegedly excess rates.

The proceeding is at the preliminary stage. The estimated value of the proceeding is about 2.2 billion Colombian pesos (about \u20ac518 million).\n\n## Kino arbitration - Mexico\n\nOn September 16, 2020, Kino Contractor SA de Cv (Kino Contractor), Kino Facilities Manager SA de Cv (Kino Facilities) and Enel SpA (Enel) were noti/fi.ligaed of a request for arbitration /fi.ligaled by Parque Solar Don Jos\u00e9 SA de Cv, Villanueva Solar SA de Cv and Parque Solar Villanueva Tres SA de Cv (together, 'Project Companies') in which the Project Companies alleged the violation (i) by Kino Contractor of ce/r\\_t.ligaain provisions of the EPC Contract and (ii) by Kino Facilities of ce/r\\_t.ligaain provisions of the Asset Management Agreement, both contracts concerning solar projects owned by the three companies /fi.ligaling for arbitration. Enel - which is the guarantor of the obligations assumed by Kino Contractor and Kino Facilities under the above contracts - has also been called into the arbitration proceeding, but no specific claims have been /fi.ligaled against it for the moment.\n\nThe Project Companies, in which Enel Green Power SpA is a non-controlling shareholder, are controlled by CDPQ Infraestructura Pa/r\\_t.ligaicipaci\u00f3n SA de Cv (which is controlled by Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec) and CKD Infraestructura M\u00e9xico SA de Cv.\n\nOn August 4, 2023, the arbitration ruling was noti/fi.ligaed. The arbitration board declared that it did not have jurisdiction against Enel SpA and, in pa/r\\_t.ligaially granting the claim of the Project Companies, ordered Kino Contractor and Kino Facilities (now Enel Services Mexico SA de Cv - Enel Services) to pay penalties totaling about $77 million, plus interest at an annual rate of 6%. Subsequently, Kino Contractor and Enel Services /fi.ligaled a petition requesting correction of the arbitration award, which was pa/r\\_t.ligaially granted and, on December 13, 2023, they /fi.ligaled a petition to void the award before the Mexican cou/r\\_t.ligas. The proceeding is pending. In December 2023, the Project Companies /fi.ligaled a suit before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga of the State of New York against Enel, in its capacity as guarantor of the obligations assumed by Kino Contractor, to request payment due by the la/t\\_t.ligaer under the provisions of the arbitration award. The substance and legal grounds of the suit are being contested in full and the proceeding is pending.\n\n## Allianz - No/r\\_t.ligah America\n\nOn May 18, 2022, High Lonesome Wind Project LLC was sued in New York Superior Cou/r\\_t.liga by Allianz Risk Transfer Ltd for about $203 million concerning an alleged liability accrued by the company, as of February 2021, in connection with a Proxy Revenue Swap. The claim is being contested in its entirety. The proceedings are currently pending before the Southern District Cou/r\\_t.liga in New York.\n\n## Osage Wind - No/r\\_t.ligah America\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of a lawsuit /fi.ligaled by the United States (in its capacity as trustee of the Osage Nation) and the Osage Mineral Council against Enel Green Power No/r\\_t.ligah America, Enel Kansas LLC and Osage Wind LLC, on December 20, 2023 a ruling of the Oklahoma District Cou/r\\_t.liga ordered the removal of the wind farm and the continuation of the proceeding for damages, which were quanti/fi.ligaed by the plainti/ff.ligas in the amount of at least $25 million. The proceeding is continuing at /fi.ligarst instance and the plainti/ff.ligas' claims have been contested. The ruling, which is not /fi.liganal, will be appealed at the appropriate time.\n\n## Gastalsa - Peru\n\nIn  February  2022,  Enel  Generaci\u00f3n  Piura  SA  (EGPIURA) learned of a precautionary measure issued by the Civil Cou/r\\_t.liga of Talara of the Superior Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice of Sullana ( Juzgado Civil de Talara de la Co/r\\_t.ligae Superior de Justicia de Sullana ) in favor of Empresa de Gas de Talara SA (Gastalsa) which orders the Direcci\u00f3n General de Hidrocarburos del Ministerio de Energ\u00eda y Minas , the Organismo Superior de la Inversi\u00f3n en Energ\u00eda y Miner\u00eda (OSINERGMIN) and the Ministry of Energy to (i) restore the natural gas concession of the Parinas district in favor of Gastalsa; and (ii) proceed with the upgrade and transfer of the pipeline owned by EGPIURA (which supplies natural gas to the Malacas thermal  power  station)  to  Gastalsa.  That  precautionary measure was a consequence of the ruling issued by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Talara pa/r\\_t.ligaially granting a claim /fi.ligaled by Gastalsa requesting to revoke the measure that canceled the concession granted to Gastalsa and the consequent transfer of the gas pipeline owned by EGPIURA to Gastalsa itself. On August 2, 2022, the Sala Civil de la Co/r\\_t.ligae Superior de Justicia de Sullana ruled against Gastalsa in the second-level appeal, referring the case to the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance for a new decision. As a result of that decision, on September 9, 2022, the precautionary measure issued earlier was revoked.\n\nIn the meantime, in July 2022, the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga had granted the petition of the system operator, an interested third pa/r\\_t.ligay, acknowledging that the original petition of Gastalsa had been /fi.ligaled after the time limit. On January 24, 2023 the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga also denied the appeal of that measure, which has thus become /fi.liganal, and ordered the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal to issue a new decision concerning the fo/r\\_f.ligaeiture of the petition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With a measure of September 15, 2023, the cou/r\\_t.liga found the claim that the provision was null raised by EGPIURA and the other pa/r\\_t.ligay was unfounded and scheduled oral arguments for September 25, 2023. EGPIURA and the other pa/r\\_t.ligay in the proceeding appealed that ruling with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, which, with decision of January 20, 2024, revoked the appealed measure and remanded the suit for trial at /fi.ligarst instance. A decision is pending.\n\nIn the meantime, on August 9, 2023 EGPIURA also /fi.ligaled an appeal with the Superior Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice of Lima against the decision of June 27, 2023 of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, arguing that it con/fl.ligaicted with the ruling of the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga of January 24, 2023.\n\nThe hearing to argue the case is scheduled for August 7, 2024.\n\n## Gab\u010d\u00edkovo litigation - Slovakia\n\nSlovensk\u00e9 elektr\u00e1rne (SE) is involved in a number of cases before the national cou/r\\_t.ligas concerning the 720 MW Gab\u010d\u00edkovo  hydroelectric  plant,  which  is  administered by Vodohospod\u00e1rska V\u00fdsatavba \u0160t\u00e1tny Podnik (VV) and whose operation and maintenance, as pa/r\\_t.liga of the privatization of SE in 2006, had been entrusted to SE for a period of 30 years under an operating agreement (the VEG Operating Agreement).\n\nImmediately after the closing of the privatization, the Public Procurement O/ffi.ligace (PPO) /fi.ligaled suit with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava seeking to void the VEG Operating Agreement on the basis of alleged violations of the regulations governing public tenders, qualifying the contract as a service contract and as such governed by those regulations. In November 2011 the trial cou/r\\_t.liga ruled in favor of SE, whereupon the PPO appealed the decision.\n\nIn parallel with the PPO action, VV also /fi.ligaled a number of suits, asking in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular for the voidance of the VEG Operating Agreement. On December 12, 2014, VV withdrew unilaterally from the VEG Operating Agreement, notifying its termination on March 9, 2015, for breach of contract. On March 9, 2015, the decision of the appeals cou/r\\_t.liga overturned the ruling of the trial cou/r\\_t.liga and voided the contract as pa/r\\_t.liga of the action pursued by the PPO. SE lodged an extraordinary appeal against that decision before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga. At a hearing of June 29, 2016, the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga denied the appeal and SE then appealed the ruling to the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga, which denied the appeal with a ruling on January 18, 2017, which then became /fi.liganal.\n\nIn addition, SE lodged a request for arbitration with the Vienna International Arbitral Centre (VIAC) under the VEG Indemnity Agreement. Under that accord, which had been signed as pa/r\\_t.liga of the privatization between the National\n\nPrope/r\\_t.ligay Fund (now MH Manazment - MHM) of the Slovak Republic and SE, the la/t\\_t.ligaer was entitled to an indemnity in the event of the early termination of the VEG Operating Agreement for reasons not a/t\\_t.ligaributable to SE. On June 30, 2017, the arbitration cou/r\\_t.liga issued its ruling denying the request of SE.\n\nIn parallel with this arbitration proceeding, both VV and MHM /fi.ligaled two suits in the Slovakian cou/r\\_t.ligas to void the VEG Indemnity Agreement owing to the alleged connection of the la/t\\_t.ligaer with the VEG Operating Agreement. These proceedings were rejected for procedural reasons on September 27, 2017. Both VV and MHM appealed that decision, and both the appeals were denied upholding the trial cou/r\\_t.liga decision in favor of SE. VV /fi.ligaled a fu/r\\_t.ligaher appeal ( dovolanie ) against that decision on March 9, 2020, with the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga, to which SE replied with a brief submi/t\\_t.ligaed on June 8, 2020. SE also /fi.ligaled an appeal before the Slovak Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga, which was denied on July 29, 2021. On March 24, 2021, the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga ove/r\\_t.ligaurned the decision of the Bratislava Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, referring the judgment to the la/t\\_t.ligaer cou/r\\_t.liga, and the proceeding is currently pending. At the local level, VV has also /fi.ligaled other suits against SE for alleged unjusti/fi.ligaed enrichment (estimated at about \u20ac360 million plus interest) for the period from 2006 to 2015. SE /fi.ligaled counterclaims for all of the proceedings under way. Developments in those proceedings can be summarized as follows:\n\n- i. for 2006-2008, at the hearing of June 26, 2019, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava rejected VV's main claim and, consequently, SE's counterclaim. The ruling in /fi.ligarst instance was appealed by both pa/r\\_t.ligaies before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal of Bratislava. The proceedings relating to 2006 were completed  with  the  decision  of  December  6,  2022, noti/fi.ligaed to SE on February 18, 2023, which upheld the ruling in /fi.ligarst instance. In April 2023, both SE and VV /fi.ligaled extraordinary appeals before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga against the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal ruling and the proceeding is pending. As regards the proceedings relating to 2007, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, in a ruling dated January 31, 2023, noti/fi.ligaed to SE on April 12, 2023, voided the decision of /fi.ligarst instance, referring the case back to the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava for a new judgment. The /fi.ligarst hearing was held on January 8, 2024 and the proceeding was adjourned to a hearing scheduled for September 11, 2024. The proceedings relating to 2008 are still pending;\n- ii. the proceedings relating to the years 2011 and 2015 are all pending before the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance and briefs have been exchanged between the pa/r\\_t.ligaies. For both proceedings, hearings before the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance were postponed several times owing to the pandemic and are now postponed to dates to be determined;\n- iii. the proceedings relating to the years 2009, 2010 and 2013 were completed in the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance with ruling issued by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava on, respectively, November 24, 15 and 22, 2022, rejecting both VV's",

Between December 2022 and January 2023 both SE and VV /fi.ligaled appeals against the rulings relating to the years 2009, 2010 and 2013, and the proceeding is now pending. The proceedings relating to 2014 were completed at /fi.ligarst instance with a ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava of October 10, 2023, which has not yet been published, rejecting the primary claim of VV and, consequently, the counterclaim of SE;\n\n- iv. as regards the proceeding relating to the year 2012, on February 2, 2023 SE was noti/fi.ligaed of the appeal ruling upholding the ruling of /fi.ligarst instance denying of both VV's claim and SE's counterclaim. Both VV and SE, on March 17, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively, have /fi.ligaled an extraordinary appeal with the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga against the appellate ruling and the proceeding is pending.\n\nFinally, in another proceeding VV asked for SE to return the fee for the transfer from SE to VV of the technology assets of the Gab\u010d\u00edkovo plant as pa/r\\_t.liga of the privatization, with a value of about \u20ac43 million plus interest. After issuing a preliminary decision on the case in which it noted the lack of standing of VV, on December 18, 2020, the Cou/r\\_t.liga issued a decision in favor of SE, rejecting VV's claims. On January 4, 2021, VV /fi.ligaled an appeal against that decision, and the proceeding is pending.\n\n## Tax litigation in Brazil\n\n## Withholding Tax - Ampla\n\nIn 1998, Ampla Energia e Servi\u00e7os SA (Ampla) /fi.ligananced the acquisition of Coelce with the issue of bonds in the amount of $350 million ('Fixed Rate Notes' - FRN) subscribed by its Panamanian subsidiary, which had been established to raise funds abroad. Under the special rules then in force, subject to maintaining the bond until 2008, the interest paid by Ampla to its subsidiary was not subject to withholding tax in Brazil.\n\nHowever, the /fi.liganancial crisis of 1998 forced the Panamanian company to re/fi.liganance itself with its Brazilian parent, which for that purpose obtained loans from local banks. The tax authorities considered this /fi.liganancing to be the equivalent of the early extinguishment of the bond, with the consequent loss of entitlement to the exemption from withholding tax.\n\nIn December 2005, Ampla carried out a spin-o/ff.liga that involved the transfer of the residual FRN debt and the associated rights and obligations to Ampla Investimentos e Servi\u00e7os SA.\n\nOn November 6, 2012, the C\u00e2mara Superior de Recursos Fiscais (the highest level of administrative cou/r\\_t.ligas) issued a ruling against Ampla, for which the company promptly asked that body for clari/fi.ligacations. On October 15, 2013, Ampla was noti/fi.ligaed of the denial of the request for clari/fi.ligacation ( embargo de declara\u00e7\u00e3o ), thereby upholding the previous adverse decision. The company provided security\n\nfor the debt and on June 27, 2014 continued litigation before the ordinary cou/r\\_t.ligas ( Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a ).\n\nIn December 2017, the cou/r\\_t.liga appointed an expe/r\\_t.liga to examine the issue in greater detail in suppo/r\\_t.liga of the future ruling. In September 2018, the expe/r\\_t.liga submi/t\\_t.ligaed a repo/r\\_t.liga, requesting additional documentation.\n\nIn December 2018, the company, now Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio  de  Janeiro,  provided  the  additional  documentation and, in view of the conclusions presented by the expe/r\\_t.liga, requested a fu/r\\_t.ligaher expe/r\\_t.liga opinion. The case has been referred to the expe/r\\_t.liga for clari/fi.ligacations regarding the position expressed by the company.\n\nIn July 2021, the supplementary repo/r\\_t.liga was /fi.ligaled by the expe/r\\_t.liga in which the existence of the loan agreements was acknowledged and the bond loan was terminated, both for the principal amount and for interest, mainly through a capital increase. The company, called to pronounce on the repo/r\\_t.liga /fi.ligaled, requests the full cancellation of the tax debt. The amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2023\n\nwas about \u20ac270 million.\n\n## PIS/COFINS/ICMS - Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nIn March 2017, the Supremo Tribunal Federal of Brazil (STF) ruled on the calculation of the PIS and COFINS taxes, con/fi.ligarming the argument that the ICMS ( Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os , tax on the circulation of goods and services) tax was not included in the calculation basis of the PIS and COFINS.\n\nIn May 2021, the STF established that the ruling would have e/ff.ligaect from the judgment of March 2017, except for taxpayers who had /fi.ligaled an appeal before that date.\n\nThe Group's Brazilian companies a/ff.ligaected by the STF ruling had already initiated legal action in their respective federal regional cou/r\\_t.ligas. Subsequently, the la/t\\_t.ligaer noti/fi.ligaed them of the /fi.liganal decision, recognizing the right to deduct the ICMS applied to their operations from the calculation basis of the PIS and COFINS. Since the excess payment of the PIS and COFINS taxes had been transferred to /fi.liganal customers, at the same time as the recognition of these recoverable taxes, a liability in respect of those customers was recognized in the same amount, net of any costs incurred or to be incurred in the legal proceedings. These liabilities represent an obligation to reimburse the recovered taxes to /fi.liganal customers.\n\nIn this regard, Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo initiated two proceedings that led to rulings in its favor. These regarded the periods from December 2003 to December 2014 and from January 2015 onwards. With regard to the second proceeding, the Federal Union /fi.ligaled an action of rescission against the company, disputing the fact that pa/r\\_t.liga of the period in question (prior to March 2017) would be adversely impacted by the STF ruling of May 2021.\n\nIn May 2022, the company challenged this action and will defend its actions through the various levels of the cou/r\\_t.liga system.

The contested period runs from 2017 to 2019.\n\nConsidering its position sound, the company presented its defense at the /fi.ligarst level of administrative adjudication. The amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2023 was about \u20ac158 million.\n\n## PIS - Eletropaulo\n\nIn July 2000, Eletropaulo /fi.ligaled suit seeking a tax credit for PIS  ( Programa  Integra \u00e7 \u00e3o  Social )  paid  in  application  of regulations  (Decree  Laws  2.445/1988  and  2.449/1988) that were subsequently declared unconstitutional by the Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF). In May 2012, the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a (STJ) issued a /fi.liganal ruling in favor of the company that recognized the right to the credit.\n\nIn 2002, before the issue of that favorable /fi.liganal ruling, the company had o/ff.ligaset its credit against other federal taxes. This behavior was contested by the federal tax authorities but the company, claiming it had acted correctly, challenged in cou/r\\_t.liga the assessments issued by the federal tax authorities. Following defeat at the initial level of adjudication, the company appealed.\n\nThe amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2023 was about \u20ac134 million.\n\n## ICMS - Ampla, Coelce and Eletropaulo\n\nThe States of Rio de Janeiro, Cear\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo issued a number of tax assessments against Ampla Energia e Servi\u00e7os  SA  (for  the  years  1996-1999  and  2007-2017), Companhia  Energ\u00e9tica  do  Cear\u00e1  (2003,  2004,  20062012, 2015, 2016 and 2018) and Eletropaulo (2008-2021), challenging the deduction of ICMS ( Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os , tax on the circulation of goods and services) in relation to the purchase of ce/r\\_t.ligaain non-current assets. The companies challenged the assessments, arguing that they correctly deducted the tax and asse/r\\_t.ligaing that the assets, the purchase of which generated the ICMS, are intended for use in their electricity distribution activities.\n\nThe companies are continuing to defend their actions at the various levels of adjudication.\n\nThe amount involved in the disputes totaled approximately \u20ac106 million at December 31, 2023.\n\n## Withholding Tax - Endesa Brasil\n\nOn November 4, 2014, the Brazilian tax authorities issued an assessment against Endesa Brasil SA (now Enel Brasil SA) alleging the failure to apply withholding tax to dividends, reclassi/fi.ligaed as payment of income to non-resident recipients.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, in 2009, Endesa Brasil, as a result of the /fi.ligarst-time application of the IFRS, had derecognized goodwill, recognizing the e/ff.ligaects in equity, on the basis of the correct application of the accounting standards it had adopted. The Brazilian tax authorities, however, asse/r\\_t.ligaed - during an audit - that the accounting treatment was incorrect and that the e/ff.ligaects of the derecognition should have been recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss. As a result, the corresponding amount (about \u20ac202 million) was reclassi/fi.ligaed as a payment of income to non-residents and, therefore, subject to withholding tax of 15%.\n\nIt should be noted that the accounting treatment adopted by the company was agreed with the external auditor and also con/fi.ligarmed by a speci/fi.ligac legal opinion issued by a local /fi.ligarm.\n\nFollowing  unfavorable  rulings  from  the  administrative cou/r\\_t.ligas, the company is continuing to defend its actions in cou/r\\_t.liga and the appropriateness of the accounting treatment.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2022 was about \u20ac77 million.\n\n## ICMS - Coelce\n\nThe  State  of  Cear\u00e1  has  /fi.ligaled  various  tax  assessments against Companhia Energ\u00e9tica do Cear\u00e1 SA over the years (for tax periods 2015-2018), as well as against all other energy distributors in Brazil, demanding the ICMS ( Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os , tax on the circulation of goods and services) on the subsidies paid by the Federal government against the regulatory discounts granted to ce/r\\_t.ligaain consumers.\n\nThe company has appealed the individual assessments and is defending its actions in the various levels of jurisdiction.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2023 was about \u20ac69 million.\n\n## PIS/COFINS - Eletropaulo\n\nSta/r\\_t.ligaing from June 2017, the Federal Tax Authority served a number of tax assessment notices against Eletropaulo (for the 2013-2018 tax periods) contesting the o/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing of tax credits relating to social security contributions (PIS and COFINS), requesting the payment of those contributions. The tax authorities argue that the company has claimed PIS and COFINS credits for the purchase of goods and",

Furthermore, it disputes the claim of a tax credit associated with 'non-technical' losses on the electricity purchased.\n\nThe company has promptly defended the accuracy of its calculations in the various levels of jurisdiction and argued the validity of the o/ff.ligasets claimed.\n\nThe estimated amount involved in the proceeding at December 31, 2023 was about \u20ac55 million.\n\n## ICMS (pro-rata) - Coelce\n\nThe State of Cear\u00e1 has /fi.ligaled various tax assessments against Companhia Energ\u00e9tica do Cear\u00e1 SA over the years (for tax periods from 2005 to 2014), contesting the determination of the deductible po/r\\_t.ligaion of the ICMS ( Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os , tax on the circulation of goods and services) and in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular the method of calculation of the pro-rata deduction with reference to the revenue deriving from the application of a special rate envisaged by the Brazilian government for the sale of electricity to low-income households ( Baixa Renda ).\n\nThe company has appealed the individual assessments, arguing that the tax deduction was calculated correctly. The company is defending its actions in the various levels of jurisdiction.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2023 was about \u20ac52 million.\n\n## PIS - Eletropaulo\n\nIn December 1995, the Brazilian government increased the rate of the federal PIS ( Programa Integra\u00e7 \u00e3 o Social ) tax from 0.50% to 0.65% with the issue of a provisional measure (Executive Provisional Order).\n\nSubsequently, the provisional measure was re-issued /fi.ligave times before its de/fi.liganitive rati/fi.ligacation into law in 1998. Under Brazilian legislation, an increase in the tax rate (or the establishment of a new tax) can only be ordered by law and take e/ff.ligaect 90 days after its publication.\n\nEletropaulo therefore /fi.ligaled suit arguing that an increase in the tax rate would only have been e/ff.ligaective 90 days after the last Provisional Order, claiming that the e/ff.ligaects of the /fi.ligarst four provisional measures should be considered void (since they were never rati/fi.ligaed into law). This dispute ended in April 2008 with recognition of the validity of the increase in the PIS rate sta/r\\_t.ligaing from the /fi.ligarst provisional measure.\n\nIn May 2008, the Brazilian tax authorities /fi.ligaled a suit against Eletropaulo  to  request  payment  of  taxes  corresponding to the rate increase from March 1996 to December 1998. Eletropaulo has fought the request at the various levels of adjudication, arguing that the time limit for the issue of the notice of assessment had lapsed. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, since more than /fi.ligave years have passed since the taxable event (December 1995, the date of the /fi.ligarst provisional measure) without issuing any formal instrument, the right of the tax authorities to request the payment of additional taxes and the author-\n\nity to unde/r\\_t.ligaake legal action to obtain payment have been challenged.\n\nIn 2017, following the unfavorable decisions issued in previous rulings, Eletropaulo /fi.ligaled an appeal in defense of its rights and its actions with the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a (STJ) and the Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF). The proceedings are still pending while the amounts subject to dispute have been covered by a bank guarantee.\n\nWith regard to the request of the O/ffi.ligace of the A/t\\_t.ligaorney General of the Brazilian National Treasury Depa/r\\_t.ligament to replace the bank guarantee with a deposit in cou/r\\_t.liga, the cou/r\\_t.liga of second instance granted the petition. The company therefore replaced the bank guarantee with a cash deposit and /fi.ligaled a clari/fi.ligacation motion against the related decision, which is currently awaiting a decision.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2023 was about \u20ac48 million.\n\n## FINSOCIAL - Eletropaulo\n\nFollowing a /fi.liganal ruling issued by the Federal Regional Cou/r\\_t.liga on September 11, 2011, Eletropaulo was recognized the right to compensation for ce/r\\_t.ligaain FINSOCIAL credits (social contributions) relating to sums paid from September 1989 to March 1992.\n\nDespite the expiration of the relative statute of limitations, the Federal Tax Authority contested the determination of some credits and rejected the corresponding o/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing, issuing tax assessments that the company promptly challenged in the administrative cou/r\\_t.ligas, defending the legitimacy of its calculations and actions.\n\nAfter an unfavorable ruling at /fi.ligarst instance, the company /fi.ligaled an appeal before the administrative cou/r\\_t.liga of second instance.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2023 was about \u20ac48 million.\n\n## Tax litigation in Spain\n\n## Income tax - Enel Iberia, Endesa and subsidiaries\n\nIn 2018, the Spanish tax authorities completed a general audit involving the companies of the Group pa/r\\_t.ligaicipating in the Spanish tax consolidation mechanism. This audit, which began in 2016, involved corporate income tax, value added tax and withholding taxes (mainly for the years 2011 to 2014). With reference to the main claims, the companies involved have challenged the related assessments at the /fi.ligarst administrative level ( Tribunal Econ\u00f3mico-Administrativo Central -TEAC), defending the correctness of their actions.\n\nOn April 4, 2022, the TEAC rejected the appeal and the companies are continuing to defend their actions in cou/r\\_t.liga ( Audiencia Nacional ).\n\nWith regard to the disputes concerning corporate income tax, the issues for which an unfavorable outcome is considered possible amounted to about \u20ac134 million at December 31, 2023:\n\n<!-- image -->",

The company has provided  the  suppo/r\\_t.ligaing  documentation  demonstrating the synergies achieved as a result of the merger in order to prove the existence of a valid economic reason for the transaction. On December 10, 2019, the TEAC denied the appeal and the company is continuing to defend its actions in cou/r\\_t.liga ( Audiencia Nacional ).\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2023 was about \u20ac98 million.\n\n## 58.1 Terms and nature of environmental programs\n\nThe main environmental programs a/ff.ligaecting Group companies are summarized in the following table in accordance with ESMA Public Statement of October 25, 2023 - Priority 1: Climate-related ma/t\\_t.ligaers.\n\n| Program                                              | Terms of the mechanism                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Nature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EU ETS (78)                                          | The scheme, which applies in all EU countries, sets an annual cap on emissions that  is being progressively reduced to bring down the total emissions in Europe.

Conversely, any 'surplus' of ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates purchased at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date is recognized in 'inventories' in accordance with the general principles referred to in note 2.2 'Material accounting policies'.\n\nSome types of environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates accrue in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to:\n\n- \u00b7 electricity generated by plants that use renewable resources (for example, guarantees of origin and renewable energy ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates);\n- \u00b7 energy  savings  ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed  by  the  competent  authority (energy e/ffi.ligaciency ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates).\n\nIn these cases, the right to obtain such ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates can be\n\ntreated as a non-monetary government operating grant and, as such, the Group recognizes that right at fair value under  'other  non-current/current  non-/fi.liganancial  assets'. When the ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates are credited to the ownership account, they are reclassi/fi.ligaed from other assets to inventories.\n\nThe corresponding income is recognized under other operating pro/fi.ligat.\n\nFor Group companies involved in trading activities, environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates represent goods exchanged as pa/r\\_t.liga of their normal business activity and, as such, the purchased ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates are recognized under 'services and other materials'.\n\nRevenue from the sale of such ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates is recognized under 'revenue', with a corresponding decrease in inventories.\n\nContracts for the purchase or sale of environmental certi/fi.ligacates se/t\\_t.ligaled at a future date (for example, forward contracts, etc.) that comply with the de/fi.liganition of derivative are recognized and measured in accordance with the 'own use exemption', at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, or with hedge accounting rules based on speci/fi.ligac circumstances. For fu/r\\_t.ligaher details, please see note 51 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\n## 58.3 Financial impact\n\n## Charges for environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas system charges recognized by obligated Group companies in respect of the ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates necessary to meet compliance obligations for the year based on national and supranational regulations.\n\n| Millions of euro                                                   |       |       |        |        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|--------|\n|                                                                    | 2023  | 2022  | Change | Change |\n| Charges for environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates                |       |       |        |        |\n| System charges - Emissions allowances                              | 2,038 | 2,216 | (178)  | -8.0%  |\n| System charges - Energy e/ffi.ligaciency ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates | 244   | 182   | 62     | 34.1%  |\n| System charges - Guarantees of origin                              | 321   | 112   | 209    | -      |\n| Total                                                              | 2,603 | 2,510 | 93     | 3.7%   |\n\nThe increase in costs for environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates compared with the previous year is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the increase in charges recognized for guarantees of origin by Enel Energia and the Endesa Group, which re/fl.ligaects the increase in the quantity of green energy sold to customers\n\nand the prices of those ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates.\n\nThis e/ff.ligaect was pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by a decrease in charges for emissions allowances, essentially in Italy, mainly connected with a decline in the quantity of electricity produced from fossil sources.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Future accounting standards\n\nThe  following  provides  a  list  of  accounting  standards, amendments and interpretations that will take e/ff.ligaect for the Group after December 31, 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 'Amendments to IAS 1 - Classi/fi.ligacation of Liabilities as Current or Non-current' , issued in January 2020. The amendments regard the provisions of IAS 1 concerning the presentation of liabilities. More speci/fi.ligacally, the changes clarify:\n- -the criteria to adopt in classifying a liability as current or non-current, specifying the meaning of right to defer se/t\\_t.ligalement and that that right must exist at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period;\n- -that the classi/fi.ligacation is una/ff.ligaected by the intentions or expectations of management about the exercise of the right to defer se/t\\_t.ligalement of a liability;\n- -that the right to defer exists if and only if the entity satis/fi.ligaes the terms of the liability at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, even if the creditor does not verify compliance with those terms until later; and\n- -that se/t\\_t.ligalement regards the transfer to the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services.\n\nThe amendments take e/ff.ligaect for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. (79)\n\n- \u00b7 'Amendments to IAS 1 - Non-current Liabilities with Covenants', issued in October 2022. IAS 1 requires classi/fi.ligacation of liabilities as non-current only where an entity has a right to defer se/t\\_t.ligalement in the 12 months following the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date. Neve/r\\_t.ligaheless, the right to do so is often subject to compliance with covenants. The amendments of the standard improve disclosure when the right to defer se/t\\_t.ligalement of a liability for at least 12 months is subject to compliance with covenants and specify that the classi/fi.ligacation of the liability as current or non-current at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date is not a/ff.ligaected by covenants that must be complied with subsequent to the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date.\n\nThe amendments take e/ff.ligaect for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024.\n\n- \u00b7 'Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture', issued in September 2014. The amendments clarify the accounting treatment for sales or contribution of assets between an investor and its associates or joint ventures. They con/fi.ligarm that the accounting treatment depends on whether the assets sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture constitute a 'business' (as de/fi.liganed in IFRS 3). The IASB has deferred the e/ff.ligaective date of these amendments inde/fi.liganitely.\n- \u00b7 'Amendments to IFRS 16 - Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback' , issued in September 2022. The amendments require the seller-lessee to measure the rightof-use asset arising from a sale and leaseback transaction in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the previous carrying amount of the asset involved in the arrangement and in line with the retained right-of-use. Consequently, the seller-lessee will be allowed to recognize only the amount of any capital gain or loss relating to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor.\n\nThe amendments do not prescribe speci/fi.ligac measurement requirements for liabilities deriving from a leaseback. However, they include examples that illustrate the initial and subsequent measurement of the liability by including variable payments that do not depend on an index or a rate. This representation is a depa/r\\_t.ligaure from the general accounting model required by IFRS 16, in which variable payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss in the period in which the event or condition that determines these payments occurs. In this regard, the seller-lessee will have to develop and apply an accounting policy to determine the lease payments such that any amount of retained right-of-use gain or loss is not recognized.\n\nThe amendments take e/ff.ligaect for annual periods beginning January 1, 2024. In conformity with 'IAS 8 - Accounting  Policies,  Changes  in  Accounting  Estimates and Errors', retrospective application is permi/t\\_t.ligaed for sale and leaseback transactions entered into after the date of initial application of IFRS 16.\n\n- \u00b7 'Amendments to IAS 21 - The E/ff.ligaects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: Lack of Exchangeability' , issued in August 2023. The amendments require the application of a consistent approach in determining whether a currency is exchangeable for another and, when it is not, in determining the exchange rate to be used and the disclosure to be provided.\n- The amendments will take e/ff.ligaect, subject to endorsement,  for  annual  periods  beginning  January  1,  2025 (earlier application is permi/t\\_t.ligaed).\n- \u00b7 'Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 - Supplier Finance Arrangements' , issued in May 2023.\n- The amendments clarify the characteristics of supplier /fi.liganance  arrangements  and  require  additional  disclosures concerning these agreements in order to assist users of the /fi.liganancial statements in understanding their related impacts on an entity's liabilities, cash /fl.ligaows and exposure to liquidity risk.\n\nThe IASB granted a transitional exemption by requiring neither comparative information in the /fi.ligarst year of ap-",

Events after the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period\n\n## Finalized the agreement to sell a geothermal and solar po/r\\_t.ligafolio in the United States to Ormat\n\nOn January 4, 2024, Enel SpA, acting through its wholly-owned subsidiary Enel Green Power No/r\\_t.ligah America Inc. (EGPNA), closed an agreement with Ormat Technologies Inc. on the sale of a renewable asset po/r\\_t.ligafolio in the United States for a total of $271 million, equivalent to \u20ac250 million, subject to customary transactional adjustments. The assets sold include EGPNA's entire geothermal po/r\\_t.ligafolio as well as a number of small solar plants, with a total capacity of about 150 MW of operating plants.\n\nThe overall transaction, which was closed following the ful/fi.ligallment of a number of conditions, had a positive e/ff.ligaect on the Enel Group's consolidated net debt of about \u20ac250 million, and a negative impact of around \u20ac30 million on Group pro/fi.ligat, which had already been recognized in 2023 as impairment losses in compliance with IFRS 5.\n\n## Enel issues a dual-tranche \u20ac1.75 billion sustainabilitylinked bond in the Eurobond market\n\nOn January 16, 2024, Enel Finance International NV, a /fi.liganance  company  controlled  by  Enel  SpA,  issued  a  dual-tranche  sustainability-linked  bond  for  institutional investors in the Eurobond market in the total amount of \u20ac1.75 billion.\n\nThe new issue envisages the use of two sustainability Key Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Indicators for each tranche, illustrated in the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, last updated in January 2024.\n\nThe issue is structured in the following two tranches:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac750 million at a /fi.ligaxed rate of 3.375%, with se/t\\_t.ligalement date set on January 23, 2024, maturing July 23, 2028;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac1,000 million at a /fi.ligaxed rate of 3.875%, with se/t\\_t.ligalement date set on January 23, 2024, maturing January 23, 2035.\n\n## Enel issues a new \u20ac900 million perpetual hybrid bond with coupon at 4.75%\n\nOn February 20, 2024, Enel SpA issued a non-conve/r\\_t.ligaible, subordinated perpetual hybrid bond for institutional investors on the European market, denominated in euros, with an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac900 million.\n\nThe transaction re/fi.ligananced the \u20ac900 million equity-accounted perpetual hybrid bond with /fi.ligarst call date in February 2025 and a 3.5% coupon.\n\nThe bond has no /fi.ligaxed maturity, and is due and payable\n\nning on or after January 1, 2024, the new disclosures must be provided no earlier than the annual /fi.liganancial repo/r\\_t.liga at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe Group is assessing the potential impact of the future application of the new provisions.\n\nonly in the event of the winding up or liquidation of the Company. An annual /fi.ligaxed coupon of 4.75% will be paid until (but excluding) the /fi.ligarst reset date of May 27, 2029, which is the last day for the /fi.ligarst optional redemption.\n\n## Pa/r\\_t.liganership with Sosteneo to develop ba/t\\_t.ligaery and opencycle plant projects in Italy\n\nOn March 1, 2024, Enel SpA, acting through its subsidiary Enel Italia SpA, signed an agreement with Sosteneo Fund 1 HoldCo S\u00e0rl, for the acquisition by the la/t\\_t.ligaer of 49% of the share capital of Enel Libra Flexsys Srl, a company wholly-owned by Enel Italia and established for the implementation and operation of a po/r\\_t.ligafolio of Ba/t\\_t.ligaery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and open-cycle gas turbines (OCGT). The agreement provides for payment by Sosteneo HoldCo of approximately \u20ac1.1 billion. The price is also subject to an adjustment mechanism customary for this type of transaction. The enterprise value on a 100% basis of Enel Libra Flexsys recognized in the agreement is equal to around \u20ac2.5 billion once the investment cycle foreseen by the project is completed.\n\nThe transaction is expected to generate upon closing a positive impact of about \u20ac1.1 billion on the Enel Group's consolidated net debt, while it is set to bear no impact on the Group's pe/r\\_f.ligaormance, as Enel will continue to maintain control and fully consolidate Enel Libra Flexsys upon the closing of the transaction.\n\n## Agreement with A2A on electricity distribution operations in a number of municipalities in Lombardy\n\nOn March 9, 2024, the Enel subsidiary e-distribuzione SpA signed an agreement with A2A SpA for the sale to the latter of 90% of the capital of a newly incorporated vehicle to which electricity distribution operations in a number of municipalities of the provinces of Milan and Brescia will be transferred.\n\nThe agreement provides for A2A to pay about \u20ac1.2 billion, based on an enterprise value (for 100% of the company) of around \u20ac1.35 billion. The price, which will be paid at closing, is subject to an adjustment mechanism customary for these kinds of transactions.\n\nUpon completion of the transaction, e-distribuzione will retain a 10% stake in NewCo's capital to suppo/r\\_t.liga the sta/r\\_t.ligaup phase of the company, and which will be subject to a put and call option mechanism that can be triggered sta/r\\_t.ligaing from the /fi.ligarst year from completion of the transaction.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The design of these remuneration instruments is in line with best practices as it complies with the principle  of  establishing  a  link  with  appropriate  financial  and  non-financial performance targets and pursuing the creation of shareholder value over the medium and long term. The proposals to the Board of Directors concerning such forms of compensation and the determination of the associated parameters were prepared by the  Nomination  and  Compensation  Committee,  which  is  made  up  entirely  of independent directors, drawing on the findings of benchmark analyses, including at the international level, conducted by an independent consulting firm (the 'advisor'). In addition, the second section of the Remuneration Report contains, in compliance with the applicable CONSOB  regulations, specific disclosures on the remuneration received in 2023 by the members of the oversight body and by key management personnel (in aggregate form for the latter).\n\nThe  Board  of  Statutory  Auditors  also  supervised  the  process  of  preparing  the remuneration  policy  for  2024  -  described  in  full  in  the  first  section  of  the Remuneration Report, without finding any critical issues. In particular, oversight activity examined the consistency of the various measures envisaged by that policy with (i) the provisions of Directive (EU) 2017/828 as transposed into Italian law, with (ii) the recommendations of the Italian Corporate Governance Code, as well as with (iii) the results of the benchmark analysis carried out, including at the international level, by an independent consulting firm that the Nomination and Compensation Committee elected to engage.\n\nIn addition, during the preparation of the remuneration policy for 2024, the Board of Statutory Auditors - taking account of the recommendations in this regard by the Corporate Governance Code - asked the independent consulting firm to conduct an additional benchmark analysis to ascertain the adequacy of the remuneration paid to the members of the oversight body. This analysis was performed by the advisor with reference to two benchmarks:\n\n- \u00b7 as a benchmark external to Enel, the remuneration of the boards of statutory auditors  reported  in  the  documentation  published  on  the  occasion  of  2023",

At the same time, the analysis found that, compared with the peer group, the remuneration of the members of the Enel Board of Statutory Auditors was instead at the benchmark median for the Chairman and slightly above the median for the other standing Auditors.\n\nAs regards the internal benchmark, the advisor conducted a comparison between the average remuneration per meeting paid to the members of the Board of Statutory Auditors and that paid to the members of the Board of Directors of the Company (excluding the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer), taking into account all meetings in which they respectively participate. This analysis found a significant disparity between the remuneration of the members of the two bodies. The average remuneration per meeting of the directors is more than three times greater than that of the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors and nearly four times that of the other standing members of the Board of Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe Board of Statutory Auditors' oversight activity in 2023 was carried out in 24 meetings and with participation in the 15 meetings of the Board of Directors and participation in the annual Shareholders'  Meeting, and, through the chairman or one or more of its members, in the 14 meetings of the Control and Risk Committee (held jointly with the Board of Statutory Auditors), in the 14 meetings of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, in the 6 meetings of the Related Parties Committee and in the 7 meetings of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ' Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements ' section of our report. We are independent of Enel S.p.A. (the 'parent') in accordance with the ethics and independence rules and standards applicable in Italy to audits of financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

Revenue accrued between the date of the last meter reading and the year-end is based on estimates of the consumption of individual customers, primarily determined on their historical information, adjusted to reflect the climate factors or other matters that may affect the estimated consumption.\n\nThese estimates are very complex given the nature of underlying assumptions.\n\nTherefore, we believe that the recognition of revenue from the supply of electricity and gas not yet invoiced is a key audit matter.\n\n## Our audit procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 understanding the process for the recognition of revenue from the supply of electricity and gas not yet invoiced;\n- \u00b7 assessing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls, including IT controls, deemed material for the purposes of our audit, including by involving our IT specialists;\n- \u00b7 performing substantive procedures on the electricity and gas volumes considered in the estimation;\n- \u00b7 checking the accuracy of the selling prices used in the estimation;\n- \u00b7 comparing the estimates recognised in the consolidated financial statements with the subsequent actual figures;\n- \u00b7 assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes about the revenue from the supply of electricity and gas not yet invoiced.\n\n## Responsibilities of the parent's directors and board of statutory auditors ('Collegio Sindacale') for the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards endorsed by the European Union and the Italian regulations implementing article 9 of Legislative decree no. 38/05 and, within the terms established by the Italian law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe directors are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern and for the appropriate use of the going concern basis in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and for the adequacy of the related disclosures. The use of this basis of accounting is appropriate unless the directors believe that the conditions for liquidating the parent or ceasing operations exist, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Collegio Sindacale is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by the Italian law, the group's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- \u00b7 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance, identified at the appropriate level required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the ethics and independence rules and standards applicable in Italy and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the measures taken to eliminate those threats or the safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are, therefore, the key audit matters.
