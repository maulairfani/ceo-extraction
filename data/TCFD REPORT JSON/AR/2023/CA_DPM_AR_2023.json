        "page_content": "## FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH\n\n## Dear Shareholders\n\nDPM had an exceptional year in 2023. We demonstrated our capability as a leading mid-tier gold producer with strong operational results and robust free cash flow, and we also made an exciting high-grade gold discovery, adding a major organic asset to our growth portfolio.\n\nWith strong overall gold production, we met our guidance while also setting a new gold production record at Ada Tepe. Despite industry-wide inflationary pressures, we successfully managed costs and maintained our position as one of the lowest cost gold producers. Our strong performance combined with a favourable gold price translated into robust free cash flow, allowing us to reinvest in the Company and also return a significant amount to our shareholders through our dividend and share buyback programs. The high-grade gold discovery and aggressive drilling program at \u010coka Rakita in Serbia resulted in a maiden Inferred Mineral Resource estimate, creating the potential for significant organic growth in the vicinity of our existing operations, while we also extended the mine life at Chelopech.\n\nInherent to our purpose as a company, we aim to thrive and grow together with all our stakeholders, and our values and commitment to high standards for sustainability continued to guide our conduct at every level. We finished 2023 with an overall sustainability performance that ranked in the 91st percentile according to the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment.\n\n## REVIEW OF 2023 PERFORMANCE\n\nIn 2023, we produced 296,072 ounces of gold and 30.5 million pounds of copper at an all-in sustaining cost of $849 per ounce of gold sold. This combination of strong production and low costs generated significant free cash flow of $228 million of which $96 million was returned to shareholders through dividends and an enhanced share buy back program. We ended the year with $595 million in cash and no debt.\n\nIn January 2023, we announced a major high-grade discovery at \u010coka Rakita, located just three kilometres from our Timok gold project in Serbia and in regional proximity to our Chelopech mine in Bulgaria. By early December, we had declared an Inferred Mineral Resource estimate at \u010coka Rakita of 1.8 million ounces of gold. At Loma Larga, we completed an Investment Protection Agreement with the Government of Ecuador while we worked to advance permitting, optimize our project feasibility study, and build on our relationship with local communities.\n\n## CHELOPECH: EXTENDING THE LIFE OF OUR LOW/uniF6BACOST FLAGSHIP OPERATION\n\nDecember 2023 marked the 20-year anniversary of DPM's acquisition of Chelopech. We are extremely proud of our team and their deeply ingrained culture of high performance and innovation, which over the years has transformed the mine into a truly world-class, low-cost operation. Chelopech continued its record of strong, reliable production in 2023, producing 161,872 ounces of gold and 30.5 million pounds of copper and achieving its annual guidance.\n\nDAVID RAE President and CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn January 2023, we announced a major high-grade discovery at \u010coka Rakita, located just three kilometres from our Timok gold project in Serbia.",

        "page_content": "Another key accomplishment at Chelopech has been its long history of extending mine life. In November 2023, we announced a further mine life extension to 2032, along with an optimized life of mine ('LOM') plan and updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimate. The new LOM plan adds approximately 128,000 ounces of recoverable gold and 9 million pounds of recoverable copper between 2024 and 2032. During this period, gold and copper grades are expected to increase by 5% and 3%, respectively, and recoveries for gold by 5%.\n\nWe  remain  focused  on  further  extending  Chelopech's  mine  life  through  in-mine  exploration  and  an aggressive brownfield exploration program, and we are encouraged by positive results from our recent drilling campaign.\n\n## ADA TEPE: ACHIEVES RECORD PRODUCTION\n\nAda Tepe is one of the highest grade and lowest cost open pit mines in the world. In 2023, Ada Tepe not only achieved its gold production guidance, it also set a new record with output of 134,200 ounces of gold, a 43 per cent increase over 2022. Ada Tepe's all-in sustaining cost was particularly impressive and was below the low-end of the guidance range for the year.\n\nExploration activities at Ada Tepe in 2023 were focused on a resource extension drill program and other satellite targets on the mine concession, while in the second half of the year we began a 15,000-metre brownfield drilling campaign at the newly granted Krumovitsa exploration licence.\n\n## TSUMEB: DIVESTING TO FOCUS ON DPM'S CORE MINING BUSINESS\n\nIn early March of 2024, DPM announced the sale of the Tsumeb smelter to a subsidiary of Sinomine Resource Group Co. Ltd. ('Sinomine') for consideration of $49 million. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nGiven our plan to process all Chelopech concentrate at other third-party smelters beginning in 2024, Tsumeb was no longer strategic to DPM's portfolio, and its sale allows DPM to increase our focus and resources on our core business of mining.\n\nWe would like to thank the government of Namibia, the community of Tsumeb and most importantly, our employees for their support over the past 13 years. We will work closely with Sinomine to ensure a smooth transition to support a successful future for the operation and all of its stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAda Tepe is one of the highest grade and lowest cost open pit mines in the world.",

        "page_content": "## BUILDING A STRONG FUTURE\n\n## \u010cOKA RAKITA: HIGH/uniF6BAGRADE ORGANIC GROWTH\n\nOur discovery at \u010coka Rakita in Serbia early in the year signalled a significant organic addition to DPM's portfolio and transformed our prospects for the future in a region where we have had a presence for many years. In early December 2023, after only one year of drilling, we announced a maiden Inferred Mineral Resource estimate of 9.8 million tonnes at a grade of 5.7 grams per tonne for 1.8 million ounces of gold. This remarkably rapid development confirms the potential of \u010coka Rakita as a high-quality gold project. We are continuing to accelerate the project through our development pipeline, including advancing a Preliminary Economic Assessment, scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\u010coka Rakita has the benefit of existing infrastructure, including close proximity to existing roads and power lines. With metallurgical test work demonstrating gold recoveries of approximately 90%, the project will also benefit from the nearby regional expertise in underground mining and processing from our Chelopech operation in Bulgaria.\n\nPlanned exploration activities in 2024 include drilling with the goal of upgrading the current Mineral Resource to the Indicated Mineral Resource category; infill drilling to test the extents of the Mineral Resource; and additional exploration drilling on existing targets across four licences held by DPM surrounding \u010coka Rakita.\n\n## LOMA LARGA: FUTURE GROWTH AND EXPLORATION POTENTIAL\n\nLoma Larga in Ecuador is a high-quality underground gold copper development project with the potential for meaningful gold production growth.\n\nIn 2023, we updated the feasibility study and continue to work on optimization opportunities for Loma Larga, which includes leveraging our expertise with similar deposits such as Chelopech. We also entered into an investment protection agreement with the Government of Ecuador, providing tax stability and incentives as well as legal protections such as resolution of disputes through international arbitration.\n\nWe are continuing to engage with the government and neighbouring communities on activities related to permitting for the project and stakeholder relations. During 2023, the Constitutional Court in Ecuador provided clarity regarding the permitting process for the project, and together with the new government, DPM is working actively to fulfill the requirements, including re-initiating the environmental consultation process in March 2024.\n\nAt the Tierras Coloradas exploration project, also in Ecuador, we drilled approximately 6,500 metres of the planned 10,000-metre campaign in 2023, and expect to complete the remainder by the end of the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWe will continue to be disciplined with respect to future investment in Loma Larga and Tierras Coloradas, which will be based on the overall operating environment in-country and the Company's other capital allocation priorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur discovery at \u010coka Rakita in Serbia early in the year signalled a significant organic addition to DPM's portfolio and transformed our prospects for the future in a region.",

We further strengthened our balance sheet, increasing our cash position by $162 million to $595 million by year end.\n\nWe continued our strong track record of disciplined capital allocation, as well as returning excess capital to shareholders through a sustainable quarterly dividend and share repurchases under our normal course issuer bid. In 2023, we returned $96 million to shareholders, representing 42% of free cash flow, through $30 million in dividends paid and $66 million for share repurchases.\n\nWe are currently reviewing our capital allocation strategy with a view to balancing the need to fund our growth with returning capital to shareholders. With our strong cash position, no debt, and a $150 million undrawn credit facility, we are in a unique position among growing gold producers to fund our development pipeline internally while continuing to pay a quarterly dividend.\n\n## INDUSTRY/uniF6BALEADING ESG\n\nOur approach to sustainability is based on generating a net positive impact from our operations - minimizing environmental impact; maximizing  socio-economic  value;  nurturing  trusted  stakeholder  relationships;  and  building  sustainable  livelihoods.  Delivering excellence in sustainability performance continues to be a competitive advantage that has helped DPM unlock real value and deliver superior long-term returns for all of our stakeholders.\n\nDPM's long history in Bulgaria provides countless examples of these principles in action, - whether through our mutually beneficial stakeholder relationships at Chelopech, or the extensive public consultation and engagement process that helped transform Ada Tepe from a project into the first new mine permitted in the Balkans in over 40 years. In 2023, we were pleased to celebrate the 20th anniversary of DPM's strong relationships in Bulgaria, including a visit from our Board of Directors and an event featuring many representatives from the local communities, governments and other partnerships DPM has developed over its 20-year history in Bulgaria.\n\nOur pursuit of superior ESG performance in 2023 was reflected once again in positive ratings from ESG rating agencies. DPM scored in the 91st percentile among metals and mining companies in the 2023 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment for the third consecutive year. We were also included in the 2024 Sustainability Yearbook, which features companies that scored in the top 15 per cent of their industry.\n\n## UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO DELIVER SUPERIOR VALUE\n\nOur current three-year outlook is for continued strong production from our operations with all-in sustaining costs remaining in the low quartile for the industry. Looking further down the road, we are excited by the potential of the projects in our growth pipeline and encouraged by our history of exploration success, while our financial strength positions us well to fund our existing projects as well as assess potential new opportunities.\n\nWe continue to believe that DPM represents compelling value given our track record of delivering results and our unique combination of strengths, including:\n\n- \u00b7  Strong and consistent production from our operations;\n- \u00b7  An all-in sustaining cost that ranks among the lowest in the gold industry;\n- \u00b7  Strong free cash flow generation;\n- \u00b7  A proven record of disciplined capital allocation and returning capital to shareholders;\n- \u00b7  Attractive growth pipeline;\n- \u00b7  The financial strength to internally fund our growth pipeline;\n- \u00b7  Leading ESG performance; and\n- \u00b7  A strong technical team with a history of adding value through innovation.\n\nWe are proud of what we accomplished in 2023 to deliver on our core purpose - to unlock resources and generate value to thrive and grow together. We also believe that we are well positioned to continue delivering on this purpose for the benefit of all our stakeholders in the coming years.\n\nIn closing, I would like to thank our dedicated global team for delivering a year of outstanding results, our neighbouring communities for their continued partnership, and our shareholders for your ongoing support.\n\nTo all of you, we look forward to sharing a promising future together.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDavid Rae\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer",

On January 31, 2024, DPM reacquired the 8% ownership interest from Greyhorse Mining (Proprietary) Limited (\"GHM\") and resumed its 100% ownership interest in Tsumeb.\n\nIn  2023,  the  Company  decided  to  undertake  a  strategic  review  of  its  Tsumeb  operation,  including  a potential  sale,  given  that  the  smelter  is  no  longer  expected  to  process  any  Chelopech  concentrate commencing in 2024 and as a result, it is no longer seen as strategic to DPM's asset portfolio. As a result, the assets and liabilities of Tsumeb have been presented as held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial  position  as  at  December  31,  2023  and  the  operating  results  and  cash  flows  of  Tsumeb  have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. As a consequence, certain comparative figures in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and cash flows have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.\n\nAll  operational  and  financial  information  contained  in  this  MD&A  are  related  to  continuing  operations, unless otherwise stated.",

Consolidated all-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold was within the guidance range for the year.\n\n- \u00b7 Gold  contained  in  concentrate  produced in  the  fourth  quarter  and  full  year  of  2023  of  77,083 ounces and 296,072 ounces, respectively, was 5% and 8% higher than the corresponding periods in 2022 due primarily to mining in higher grade zones at Ada Tepe, partially offset by lower gold grades at Chelopech, in-line with the mine plans for both operations.\n- \u00b7 Payable gold in concentrate sold in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 of 69,564 ounces and 265,743  ounces,  respectively,  was  6%  and  9%  higher  than  the  corresponding  periods  in  2022 primarily reflecting higher gold production.\n- \u00b7 Copper production in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023  of  8.2  million  pounds  was  11%  higher  than  the corresponding period in 2022 due primarily to higher copper grades. Copper production in 2023 of 30.5 million pounds was comparable to 2022 due primarily to lower copper grades largely offset by higher volumes of ore processed.\n- \u00b7 Payable copper in concentrate sold in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023  of  7.0  million  pounds  was  4% higher  than  the  corresponding  period  in  2022  due  primarily  to  higher  copper  production,  partially offset by the timing of deliveries. Payable copper in 2023 of 26.7 million pounds was comparable to 2022, consistent with copper production.\n- \u00b7 All-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $876 was 13% lower than  the  corresponding  period  in  2022  due  primarily  to  higher  volumes  of  gold  sold,  lower  cash outlays for sustaining capital expenditures, lower prices for power, and higher by-product credits as a result of higher volumes and realized prices of copper sold, partially offset by a stronger Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. All-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold in 2023 of $849 was 4% lower than 2022 due primarily to higher volumes of gold sold, lower treatment and freight charges at Chelopech and lower prices for power, partially offset by higher local currency mine operating costs reflecting higher costs for labour and direct materials, lower by-product credits as a result of lower volumes and realized  prices  of  copper  sold,  and  higher  share-based  compensation  expenses  reflecting  DPM's strong share price performance.\n- \u00b7 Sustaining  capital  expenditures incurred  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023  of  $8.0  million  were  38% lower than the corresponding period in 2022 of $12.9 million due primarily to the planned upgrade of the tailings management facility at Chelopech, which occurred throughout 2022 and was completed in the second quarter of 2023. Sustaining capital expenditures in 2023 of $31.2 million were 21% lower",

Revenue in 2023 of $520.1 million was 20% higher than 2022 due primarily to higher volumes and realized prices of gold sold, and lower treatment and freight charges at Chelopech as a result of increased deliveries to thirdparty smelters, partially offset by lower volumes and realized prices of copper sold.\n- \u00b7 Cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $61.0 million decreased compared to $65.1 million in the  corresponding  period  in  2022  due  primarily  to  lower  prices  for  power  and  lower  depreciation expenses. Cost of sales in 2023 of $244.2 million increased compared to $236.7 million in 2022 due primarily  to  higher  local  currency  mine  operating  costs  reflecting  higher  costs  for  labour  and  direct materials, partially offset by lower prices for power.\n- \u00b7 Net earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $52.1 million ($0.29 per share) increased compared to $22.1 million ($0.12 per share) in the corresponding period in 2022 due primarily to higher volumes and realized prices of gold and copper sold, partially offset by higher planned  exploration  and  evaluation  expenses.  Net  earnings  from  continuing  operations  in  2023  of $182.0 million ($0.98 per share) increased compared to $116.6 million ($0.61 per share) in 2022 due primarily to higher volumes and realized prices of gold sold, lower treatment and freight charges at Chelopech and higher interest income, partially offset by higher planned exploration and evaluation expenses,  and  higher  share-based  compensation  expenses  reflecting  DPM's  strong  share performance. Net earnings (loss) in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 of $57.5 million ($0.32 per share) and $192.9 million ($1.04 per share), respectively, increased compared to $33.3 million ($0.18  per  share)  and  $35.9  million  ($0.19  per  share)  in  the  corresponding  periods  in  2022  due primarily to the same factors affecting net earnings from continuing operations. Net earnings in 2022 were also impacted by an impairment charge of $85.0 million in respect of the Tsumeb smelter, which was included in net loss from discontinued operations in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations in  the  fourth  quarter and full year of 2023 of $50.1  million  ($0.28  per  share)  and  $180.0  million  ($0.97  per  share),  respectively,  increased compared to $22.1 million ($0.12 per share) and $118.9 million ($0.62 per share) in the corresponding periods in 2022 due primarily to the same factors affecting net earnings from continuing operations, except for adjusting items mainly related to gains or losses on derivatives.\n- \u00b7 Earnings before income taxes from continuing operations in  the  fourth  quarter  and full year of 2023  of  $58.5  million  and  $205.7  million,  respectively,  increased  compared  to    $26.4  million  and $139.4  million  in  the  corresponding  periods  in  2022,  reflecting  the  same  factors  that  affected  net earnings from continuing operations, except for income taxes, which are excluded.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 of $72.0 million and $268.4 million, respectively, increased compared to $45.5 million and $222.9 million in the corresponding periods in 2022, reflecting the same factors that affected adjusted net earnings from continuing  operations,  except  for  interest,  income  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization,  which  are excluded from adjusted EBITDA.",

Cash provided  from  operating  activities  from  continuing  operations  in  2023  of  $261.6  million  was  25% higher than 2022 due primarily to higher adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations generated in the year, partially offset by the timing of deliveries and subsequent receipt of cash and the timing of payments to suppliers.\n- \u00b7 Free  cash  flow  from  continuing  operations in  the  fourth  quarter  and  full  year  of  2023  of  $49.3 million  and  $227.9  million,  respectively,  was  $19.3  million  and  $77.4  million  higher  than  the corresponding periods in 2022 due primarily to higher adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations generated in the periods and lower cash outlays for sustaining capital expenditures. Free cash flow is calculated before changes in working capital.\n- \u00b7 Return of capital to shareholders through dividends paid of $30.2 million  ($0.04  per  share)  and payments for shares repurchased under the Normal Course Issuer Bid ('NCIB') of $65.6 million in 2023, which in aggregate represented 42% of free cash flow, in-line with the Company's commitment to  a  sustainable  quarterly  dividend  and  its  share  buyback  program  reflecting  strong  ongoing operational performance and significant free cash flow generation.\n- \u00b7 Strong balance sheet as at December 31, 2023 with $595.3 million in cash and cash equivalent, an undrawn $150.0 million RCF and no debt.\n\n## Growth, Exploration and Other Highlights\n\n- \u00b7 Chelopech life of mine plan: In November 2023, DPM announced a mine life extension to 2032, an optimized life of mine ('LOM') plan, and updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimate for the Chelopech mine. The updated LOM adds approximately 128,000 ounces of recovered gold and 9 million  pounds of recovered copper between 2024 and 2032. During this period, LOM gold grades and copper grades increased by 5% and 3%, respectively, and recoveries for gold increased by 5%.\n- \u00b7 \u010coka Rakita gold project: The Company completed a maiden Mineral Resource estimate ('MRE') for the \u010coka Rakita project in Serbia in December 2023, within 11 months of announcing the initial discovery. DPM is advancing a preliminary economic assessment ('PEA') for the project targeting a throughput  rate  of  850,000  tonnes  per  annum,  which  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  the  second quarter of 2024. Exploration activities continue to focus on an accelerated drilling program extending the limits of \u010coka Rakita, which remains open to the northeast and southwest, and the Company is aggressively pursuing additional skarn targets on four licences.\n- \u00b7 Loma Larga gold project :  The Company continued to progress activities related to permitting and stakeholder  relations  during  the  fourth  quarter.  In  October  2023,  a  new  President  of  Ecuador  was elected and the Company is working with the newly formed government to fulfill the requirements of the August 2023 ruling by the Provincial Court of Azuay. The Company entered into an investment protection agreement ('IPA') for the project, providing further legal protections and tax stability. DPM will  continue  to  progress  on  the  updated  feasibility  study  ('FS')  in  order  to  pursue  additional optimization opportunities and to potentially incorporate the results of drilling, once DPM is able to recommence those activities.\n- \u00b7 Tierras  Coloradas  exploration  prospect :  The  Company  commenced  a  10,000-metre  drilling program at Tierras Coloradas in August 2023. This drilling program is designed to follow up results reported in the first quarter of 2023 which confirmed two well-mineralized high-grade vein systems that remain open in multiple directions, and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2024.",

        "page_content": "DPM achieved its 2023 gold and copper production and delivery guidance as a result of continued strong operating performance at Chelopech and Ada Tepe.\n\nBoth Chelopech and Ada Tepe achieved a cash cost per tonne of ore processed below the low end of their  respective  guidance  ranges  for  the  year  due  primarily  to  lower  than  expected  local  currency operating expenses reflecting improvement to the local inflationary environment during the year.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold in 2023 of $849 was at the higher end of the guidance range of $700 to $860, due primarily to higher treatment charges at Chelopech, lower by-product credits as a result  of  lower  volumes  and  prices  of  copper  sold,  and  higher  share-based  compensation  expense reflecting strong DPM share price performance, partially offset by lower cash outlays for sustaining capital and lower than expected local currency operating costs.\n\nComplex concentrate smelted and cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted from discontinued operations  were  below  and  above  the  2023  guidance  ranges,  respectively,  due  to  the  unplanned downtime and the Ausmelt furnace maintenance, which was extended in order to complete repairs to the off-gas system in 2023.\n\nSustaining capital expenditures in 2023 of $45 million was below the low end of the guidance range of $46 million and $57 million, due primarily to the timing of digital and technology related initiatives, as well as  benefits  from  the  cost  optimizations  of  the  Ausmelt  furnace  maintenance  in  2023  related  to discontinued operations.\n\nGrowth  and  other  capital  expenditures  in  2023  of  $30  million  was  at  the  lower  end  of  the  updated consolidated guidance range of $30 million and $39 million, due primarily to the timing of a capitalized lease related to the electric mobile equipment as part of the Company's ESG initiatives, which is deferred to 2024.\n\n## THREE-YEAR OUTLOOK\n\nDPM continues to focus on optimizing its existing mining operations and transforming its growth pipeline by  advancing  its  development  projects  and  exploration  activities,  as  highlighted  in  the  2024  to  2026 outlook and detailed 2024 guidance below.",

        "page_content": "## 2024 to 2026 Outlook\n\nThe production outlook for 2024 to 2026 is based on historical performance and experience at DPM's operations and in the case of its mining operations is consistent with the production schedules outlined in the news release for Chelopech entitled 'Dundee Precious Metals Extends Life of Mine Plan to 2032 for the  Chelopech  Mine  in  Bulgaria  and  Provides  Mineral  Reserve  and  Mineral  Resource  Update  and Highlights  from  Exploration  Activities'  dated  November  29,  2023,  the  technical  report  for  Chelopech entitled  'NI  43-101  Technical  Report  -  Mineral  Resource  and  Reserve  Update,  Chelopech  Mine, Chelopech, Bulgaria' with an effective date of March 31, 2022 (the 'Chelopech Technical Report'), and the technical report for Ada Tepe entitled 'NI 43-101 Technical Report - Mineral Resource and Reserve Update, Ada Tepe Mine, Krumovgrad, Bulgaria' with an effective date of December 31, 2022, all of which have  been  filed  on  SEDAR+  (www.sedarplus.ca)  and  are  posted  on  the  Company's  website (www.dundeeprecious.com). For 2025 and 2026, production and cost estimates do not fully incorporate operating performance improvements in respect of mine throughput and potential changes to mine grades and  recoveries.  The  2024  to  2026  outlook  is  forward  looking  and  based  on  certain  estimates  and assumptions which involve risks and uncertainties and is predicated on the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts and any related international action having no material impact on DPM's production and costs. Actual  results  may  vary  materially  from  management's  expectations.  See  the  'Cautionary  Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements' and 'Risks and Uncertainties' sections later in this MD&A for further information.\n\nHighlights of the three-year outlook include:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintains strong gold production levels : Over the next three years, gold production is expected to average  approximately  240,000  ounces  per  year  based  on  current  mine  plans,  with  a  forecasted reduction in the current 2026 outlook as Ada Tepe reaches the end of its mine life. The outlook for production will be updated, pending the completion of the Osino acquisition, which is targeted for the first half of 2024.\n- \u00b7 Stable  copper  production :  Copper  production  over  the  next  three  years  is  expected  to  average approximately  33  million  pounds  per  year  based  on  current  mine  plans,  with  higher  forecasted production in 2025 as compared to the previous outlook.\n- \u00b7 All-in sustaining cost: All-in  sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold is expected to range between $790 and $930 in 2024, which is higher than previously expected due primarily to lower by-product credits reflecting a lower copper price assumption and lower volumes of copper sold, and higher local currency  operating  costs.  2025  outlook  for  all-in  sustaining  cost  per  ounce  of  gold  sold  remains unchanged from the previous outlook range of $720 to $880, which is lower than 2024 due primarily to higher anticipated volumes of copper sold. All-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold in 2026 is expected to be between $760 and $900, higher than 2025 due primarily to lower volume of gold sold from Ada Tepe.\n- \u00b7 Sustaining capital expenditures: Sustaining capital expenditures are expected to trend lower over the  next  three  years  due  primarily  to  the  gradual  reduction  in  activities  at  Ada  Tepe  as  the  mine approaches its end of life in 2026.\n\nIn  December 2023, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Osino. The acquisition of Osino is subject to the approval of Osino's securityholders as well as applicable regulatory  approvals, including  approval  under  the  Namibia  Competition Act. In  addition, each  of DPM and Osino has the right to terminate the transaction in certain circumstances. Provided that all approvals are obtained and neither party exercises its right to terminate, the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2024, following which DPM will provide an update to its 2024 guidance and three-year outlook in due course.",

The rate of capital expenditures is also expected to vary from quarter to quarter based on the schedule for, and execution of, each capital project.\n\nAdditional detail on the Company's three-year outlook is set out below:\n\n## Chelopech\n\nGold  and  copper  contained  in  concentrate  produced  are  expected  to  be  consistent  with  production schedules and expected grades outlined in the most recently issued technical report. Gold contained in concentrate produced remains unchanged from the previous outlook for 2024 and 2025, with the outlook for  2026  slightly  below  the  2025  production  level,  in-line  with  the  mine  plan.  The  outlook  for  copper contained in concentrate produced remains unchanged in 2024 and 2025 from the previous outlook and is expected to remain at the consistent production level in 2026.\n\nCash cost per tonne of ore processed in 2024 is expected to be higher than 2023, due primarily to higher local currency operating costs.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold in 2024 is expected to be lower than 2023, due primarily to lower  treatment  charges  as  all  Chelopech  concentrates  will  now  be  delivered  to  third-party  smelters, partially offset by higher local currency operating costs.",

        "page_content": "Sustaining capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to be lower than 2023 results, mainly due to the completion of the tailings management facility in 2023. Sustaining capital expenditures are expected to trend lower in 2025 and 2026 due primarily to lower expenditures related to mobile equipment. Growth capital  expenditures  related  to  resource  development  drilling  and  margin  improvement  projects  are expected to be between $2 million and $3 million in 2024, relatively consistent year over year.\n\n## Ada Tepe\n\nGold contained in concentrate produced remains unchanged from the previous outlook for 2024 and 2025 and is expected to be lower in 2026, in-line with the mine plan as the mine reaches its end of life before the end of 2026.\n\nCash  cost  per  tonne  of  ore  processed  is  expected  to  be  higher  in  2024  as  compared  to  2023,  due primarily to higher operating costs.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold is expected to be higher in 2024 as compared to 2023, due primarily to lower volumes of gold sold and higher local currency operating costs.\n\nSustaining capital expenditures are expected to be slightly higher than the previous outlook range of $10 million to $12 million in 2024 due primarily to higher deferred stripping costs and increased costs related to Ada Tepe's integrated waste management facility, before reducing to a range of $8 million to $10 million in 2025, in line with the previous outlook, and reducing further to a range of $4 million to $5 million in 2026 as the mine reaches the end of its life.\n\n## Loma Larga gold project\n\nGrowth capital expenditures for 2024 associated with the Loma Larga gold project are expected to be between  $10  million  and  $11  million,  approximately  half  of  the  amount  spent  in  2023,  covering  the estimated running costs for the year, which mainly include general and administrative expenses, certain permitting, social and environmental related activities. In 2023, higher spend was a result of the additional scope  of  work  related  to  the  updated  FS  work  as  well  as  increased  activities  related  to  stakeholder engagement. DPM will continue to take a disciplined approach with respect to future investments in the Loma Larga gold project, based on the receipt of key milestones, overall operating environment in-country and other capital allocation priorities.\n\nSee the 'Development and Other Major Projects - Loma Larga Gold Project' section contained in this MD&A for further details.\n\n## Exploration and evaluation expenses\n\nExploration expenditures in 2024 are expected to be between $33 million and $39 million due primarily to higher expected drilling activities at \u010coka Rakita and at the new Potaj \u010cuka prospect located to the north of \u010coka Rakita in Serbia, as well as a new drilling program at the new Krumovitsa licence at Ada Tepe in Bulgaria.\n\nEvaluation expenditures in 2024 are expected to be between $10 million and $13 million related to the PEA for the \u010coka Rakita project, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2024. If positive  results  are  achieved  from  the  PEA  and  the  Company decides to proceed with a pre-feasibility study  ('PFS'),  the  Company  may  increase  its  guidance  for  evaluation  expenditures.  The  amount  and timing for this additional funding is dependent on the timing of the completion of the PEA.\n\nSee  the  'Exploration'  and  'Development  and  Other  Major  Projects  -  \u010coka  Rakita  Project'  sections contained in this MD&A for further details.",

|\n\n## Metals production\n\nGold  contained  in  gold-copper  concentrate  produced  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023  of  30,067  was comparable to the corresponding period in 2022 due primarily to higher gold recoveries largely offset by lower gold grades. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, gold contained in pyrite concentrate produced in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by 23% to 11,804 ounces due primarily to lower gold grades and recoveries.",

        "page_content": "Relative  to  2022,  gold  contained  in  gold-copper  concentrate  produced  in  2023  decreased  by  11%  to 107,359  ounces  due  primarily  to  lower  gold  grades  and  recoveries,  in-line  with  the  mine  plan.  Gold contained in pyrite concentrate produced in 2023 of 54,513 ounces was 8% lower than 2022 due primarily to lower gold grades.\n\nCopper  production  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023  of  8.2  million  pounds  was  11%  higher  than  the corresponding period in 2022 due primarily to higher copper grades. Copper production in 2023 of 30.5 million  pounds  was  comparable  to  2022  due  primarily  to  lower  copper  grades  largely  offset  by  higher volumes of ore processed.\n\n## Metals sold\n\nRelative to the fourth quarter of 2022, payable gold in gold-copper concentrate sold in the fourth quarter of  2023  decreased  by  4%  to  27,576  ounces,  due  primarily  to  the  timing  of  deliveries.  Payable  gold  in pyrite concentrate sold decreased by 16% to 8,700 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to the corresponding period in 2022, due primarily to lower gold production.\n\nRelative  to  2022,  payable  gold  in  gold-copper  concentrate  sold  in  2023  decreased  by  11%  to  98,130 ounces  and  payable  gold  in  pyrite  concentrate  sold  in  2023  decreased  by  8%  to  37,732  ounces, respectively, reflecting lower gold production.\n\nPayable copper in the fourth quarter of 2023 of 7.0 million pounds was 4% higher than the corresponding period  in  2022  due  primarily  to  higher  copper  production,  partially  offset  by  the  timing  of  deliveries. Payable  copper  in  2023  of  26.7  million  pounds  was  comparable  to  2022,  consistent  with  copper production.\n\n## Inventory\n\nGold-copper  concentrate  inventory  totalled  1,112 tonnes  as  at December  31, 2023, down  from  1,841 tonnes as at December 31, 2022. Pyrite concentrate inventory totalled 17,641 tonnes as at December 31, 2023, up from 14,241 tonnes as at December 31, 2022. These changes in inventory were due primarily to the timing of deliveries.\n\n## Cash cost measures\n\nCash  cost per  tonne  of ore  processed  in  the  fourth  quarter  and  full  year  of 2023  of $51  and  $50, respectively, was  comparable  to  the  corresponding  periods  in  2022  due  primarily  to  higher  prices  for labour and direct materials and a stronger Euro relative to the U.S. dollar, largely offset by lower prices for power and higher volumes of ore processed.\n\nCash  cost  per  ounce  of  gold  sold  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023  of  $814  was  6%  lower  than  the corresponding  period  in  2022  due  primarily  to  higher  by-product credits  reflecting  higher  volumes  and prices  of copper  sold  and  lower  prices  for  power, partially  offset by  lower  volumes  of gold  sold  and  a stronger  Euro  relative  to  the  U.S. dollar. Cash  cost per  ounce  of gold  sold  in  2023  of $796  was  12% higher than 2022 due primarily to lower volumes of gold sold, lower by-product credits reflecting lower volumes  and  prices  of copper  sold, higher  prices  for  labour  and  direct materials  and  a  stronger  Euro relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower treatment and freight charges as a result of increased deliveries to third-party smelters and lower prices for power.\n\nAll-in  sustaining  cost per  ounce  of gold  sold  in  the  fourth  quarter  and  full  year  of 2023  was  $985  and $955, respectively, compared to $1,127 and $858 in the corresponding periods in 2022 due primarily to the same factors impacting cash cost per ounce of gold sold, as well as lower cash outlays for sustaining capital expenditures.",

The  planned  upgrade  of the  tailings  management facility  was completed in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n## Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource update\n\nOn November 29, 2023, the Company announced a mine life extension to 2032 and an interim update to the  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserve  estimates  and  LOM  plan  for  the  Chelopech  mine. The updated Mineral Reserve estimate for Chelopech, effective as of May 31, 2023, consists of total Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves with 17.6 million tonnes ('Mt') grading 2.77 g/t of gold, 0.79% copper and 8.63 g/t of silver, for 1.57 million ounces of gold, 305.3 million pounds of copper and 4.99 million ounces of silver.\n\nCompared to the December 31, 2022 Mineral Reserve estimate, the Company successfully added 1% to contained  ounces  of gold  with  contained  pounds  of copper  decreasing  by  2%  relative  to  the  previous Mineral  Reserve  estimate, extending  the  LOM  to  2032. The  updated  LOM  plan  added  approximately 128,000 ounces of recovered gold and 9 million pounds of recovered copper between 2024 and 2032, with average LOM gold grade and copper grades increased by 5% and 3% respectively, and recoveries for gold increased by approximately 5%.\n\nCurrent Mineral Resources, effective as of May 31, 2023 and exclusive of Mineral Reserves, consist of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources with 15.4 Mt grading 2.39 g/t of gold, 0.78% copper and 9.41 g/t of silver, for 1.185 million ounces of gold, 265 million pounds of copper and 4.669 million ounces of silver.\n\nInferred Mineral Resources were 4.3 Mt grading 2.00 g/t of gold, 0.71% copper and 8.90 g/t of silver, for 0.274 million ounces of gold, 67 million pounds of copper and 1.219 million ounces of silver. The Mineral Resources demonstrate the potential to extend the mine life, if such Mineral Resources are converted to Mineral Reserves.\n\nSee the Company's press release dated November 29, 2023 entitled 'Dundee Precious Metals Extends Life  of Mine  Plan  to  2032  for  the  Chelopech  Mine  in  Bulgaria; Provides  Mineral  Reserve  and  Mineral Resource  Update  and  Highlights  from  Exploration  Activities'  for  additional  information, including  key assumptions and parameters relating to the foregoing Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates, as  well  as  the  Chelopech  Technical  Report, which  have  been  posted  on  the  Company's  website  at www.dundeeprecious.com and have been filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.",

The Ada Tepe mine achieved record production for both the quarter and the year.\n\n## Gold sold\n\nPayable gold in concentrate sold in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 of 33,288 ounces and 129,881 ounces, respectively, was 25% and 43% higher than the corresponding periods in 2022, consistent with higher production.\n\n## Inventory\n\nGold  concentrate  inventory  totalled  184 tonnes  as  at  December  31,  2023,  up  from  97  tonnes  as  at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Cash cost measures\n\nCash  cost per  tonne  of ore  processed  in  the  fourth  quarter  and  full  year  of 2023  of $72  and  $67, respectively, was  24%  and  22%  higher  than  the  corresponding  periods  in  2022  due  primarily  to  lower volumes of ore processed. Cash cost per tonne of ore processed in 2023 was also impacted by higher royalties reflecting higher contained ounces of gold mined.",

The accelerated grade control drilling program at Ada Tepe was completed in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER MAJOR PROJECTS\n\n## \u010coka Rakita Project\n\nIn December 2023, DPM announced an Inferred Mineral Resource of 9.79 Mt at a grade of 5.67 g/t for 1.78  million  ounces  of gold  at \u010coka  Rakita, and  subsequently  filed  a  technical  report entitled  'Maiden Mineral Resource Estimate - \u010coka Rakita Gold Project, Serbia', with an effective date of November 26, 2023, (the \u010coka Rakita Technical Report'). The maiden MRE was completed after only one full year of drilling on the project, and is based on approximately 81,000 metres of drilling in 173 holes. The Inferred Mineral  Resource  contains  a  significant portion  of gold  ounces  within  a  continuous  high-grade  core  of mineralization that amounts to 2.81 Mt at a grade of 10.12 g/t Au for 0.914 million ounces of gold.\n\nBased on the favourable size and quality of the MRE, DPM will continue to accelerate the project and expects to complete a PEA in the second quarter of 2024, targeting a throughput rate of 850,000 tonnes per annum.\n\n\u010coka  Rakita  benefits  from  good  infrastructure, including  existing  nearby  roads  and  power  lines. The project is located in close regional proximity to DPM's existing operations in Bulgaria and is a strong fit with  the  Company's  underground  mining  and  processing  expertise,  with  metallurgical  test  work demonstrating gold recoveries of approximately 90% by gravity concentration and conventional flotation.\n\nDPM is continuing its drilling program focused on extending the limits of \u010coka Rakita, which remains open to the northeast and to the southwest, and is also aggressively pursuing additional skarn targets on the \u010coka  Rakita  licence  as  well  as  on  three  additional  licences  to  the  north  and  the  south.  See  the 'Exploration  -  Serbia  Exploration'  section  contained  in  this  MD&A for  additional  details  on  the  drilling program at \u010coka Rakita.\n\nThe Company has budgeted between $10 million and $13 million on the PEA for the project in 2024.\n\nSee  the  Company's  news  release  dated  December  11,  2023  entitled  'Dundee  Precious  Metals Announces  High-Grade  Underground  Maiden  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  of 1.8  Million  Inferred  Gold Ounces  at its  \u010coka  Rakita  Project in  Serbia'  and  the  \u010coka  Rakita  Technical  Report, respectively, for additional information, which have been posted on the Company's website at www.dundeeprecious.com and have been filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.",

        "page_content": "## Loma Larga Gold Project\n\nAt the Loma Larga project in Ecuador, the Company continued to progress activities related to permitting and stakeholder relations. In October 2023, a new President of Ecuador was elected and the Company is working with the newly formed government to fulfill the requirements of the August 2023 ruling by the Provincial Court of Azuay in connection with the Constitutional Protective Action that was filed in 2022 (the 'Action').\n\nBased on the Company's analysis, the decision reaffirmed DPM's concessions for the Loma Larga project and clarified  that free, prior  and  informed  consultation  of certain  local  indigenous  populations  must be carried  out by  the  state, which  the  Company  had  already  planned  as  part of its  development of the project. The decision also held that environmental consultation with communities in the project's area of influence  and  certain  additional  reports  on  the  impact  of  the  project  on  water  resources  and  the Quimsacocha National Recreation Area would need to be provided by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition to the court prior to advancing the project to the exploitation phase.\n\nIn line with this ruling, the Government of Ecuador commenced the environmental consultation process for  the  Loma  Larga  project. DPM  will  continue  to  support the  Government of Ecuador  and  proactively engage with stakeholders for the fulfillment of the conditions established by the court.\n\nAs  previously  reported, DPM  will  continue  optimizating  the  updated  FS in  order  to  evaluate  additional opportunities  and  to  potentially  incorporate  the  results  of  drilling,  once  these  activities  are  able  to recommence.  These  scope  changes,  combined  with  inflationary  pressures  consistent  with  general industry  trends,  are  expected  to  result  in  a  significant  increase  to  the  estimated  initial  capital  and operating costs for the project. This may impact project economics and other parameters, including the Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserve  estimate, which  are  being  assessed  as  the  additional  work required  for  the  updated  FS nears  completion. DPM  will  continue  to  take  a  disciplined  approach  with respect to future investments in the Loma Larga project, based on the receipt of key milestones and the overall operating environment in-country, and other capital allocation priorities.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, the Company entered into an IPA with the Government of Ecuador for Loma  Larga. The  IPA provides  tax  stability  and  certain  tax  incentives, as  well  as  legal  protections including stability of the regulatory framework and resolution of disputes through international arbitration.\n\nThe Company maintains a constructive relationship with government institutions and other stakeholders involved with the development of the project.\n\nThe Company has budgeted between $10 million and $11 million for the project in 2024, approximately half of the amount spent in 2023.\n\nFor further details on the Action, please see the news releases issued on February 24, 2022, July 13, 2022 and August 29, 2023, which are available on the Company's website at www.dundeeprecious.com and have been filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.

        "page_content": "## EXPLORATION\n\n## Chelopech Mine\n\nDPM continues to aggressively focus on extending Chelopech's mine life through its successful in-mine exploration program. In 2023, the Company continued to advance in-mine exploration activities aimed at resource  development,  drilling  approximately  44,500  metres  with  total  244  holes,  which  included approximately  26,300  metres  of  extensional  drilling  designed  to  explore  for  new  mineralization  along interpreted geological trends and to test several potential exploration targets.\n\nA total of 13,972 metres of underground drilling were undertaken from four positions towards Target 11, which is located in the northeastern area of the mine. Drilling expanded both the mineralized contour and the enveloping silica alteration zone.\n\nStructurally controlled zones of pyrite rich, high-sulphidation mineralization located on the northern flank of Chelopech were identified. Approximately 2,000 metres were drilled towards Targets 183, 184 and 185 from two positions. As a result, the existing mineralization in the most northwestern parts of the deposit was extended.\n\nIn 2023, approximately 3,725 metres were completed as part of a larger program to test the potential of the Quartz-Barite-Gold-Sulphide ('QBGS') zone, which is located in the southeastern section of the mine. The results of this  program returned sporadic, narrow intervals with occasional elevated grade values. Extensions  to  the  silica  envelope  of  Block  18  were  encountered.  The  QBGS  zone  remains  open  in multiple directions and further resource definition drilling is planned to delineate this zone.\n\nIn addition, the in-mine drilling program has focused on testing the upper levels of the western part of the deposit. Approximately 4,600 metres were completed in the gaps between Blocks 150 and 151, as well as Blocks 103 - 153 and 150 - 153. No significant mineralization was detected in the gap areas, however, the ore bodies located in the blocks stated above were either confirmed or extended. High-grade contour of  Block  150  was  extended  by  approximately  20  metres  to  the  southeast  and  by  15  metres  vertically. Furthermore, the contours of silica alteration of Blocks 150 and 151 were expanded locally. Additionally, the  silica  contour  of  Block  153  was  expanded,  by  approximately  70  metres,  both  along  strike  and vertically.\n\nHoles drilled as part of the drilling program towards Block 7 demonstrated significant intersections and extended the upper extents of the block's mineralization contours.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Mineral Resource development strategy for Chelopech will be focused on extensional drilling in:\n\n- \u00b7 The Target North zone, which is located on the northern flank of the Chelopech mine concession and  is  manifested  as  an  isolated,  structurally  and  lithologically  controlled  intervals  of  highsulphidation  type  of  mineralization.  Several  extensional  drilling  programs  are  planned  for  the target,  including  testing  the  northern  area  of  Block  19  for  high-grade  structurally  controlled orebodies between levels 450 and 500, and drilling to the west of Block 147 to explore for similar bodies at a depth of levels 200 to 500.\n- \u00b7 An area northwest from Block 147 (Target 147 deep). This peripheral part of the deposit is highly prospective, with lithological and structural characteristics suggesting a steeply dipping, lens like shape of mineralization. Mineralization is located on the contact zone between a breccia body and a coherent magmatic rock.\n- \u00b7 Extensional  drilling  south-east  from  Block  700  is  planned  to  better  assess  the  economic significance  of  the  QBGS  zone.  This  program  is  a  continuation  of  previous  successful  drilling campaigns and will focus on identifying an extension of the mineralized system to the south-east and at depth.",

Approximately 6,800 metres of surface diamond drilling were completed.\n\nAt the Sharlo Dere prospect, a 50-metre by 50-metre infill drilling program has been completed  which is aimed  at assessing  the  economic  potential  at the  Sharlo  Dere  prospect. For  more  details  about the brownfield  exploration  results  for  Sharlo  Dere, please  refer  to  the  Company's  news  release  issued  on November 29, 2023, which is available on the Company's website at www.dundeeprecious.com and has been filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\nIn  January  2024,  the  Company  received  the  Commercial  Discovery  Certificate  from  the  Bulgarian authorities  for  the  Sveta  Petka  exploration  licence, which  includes  the  Wedge, West Shaft, Krasta and Petrovden prospects. This allows the Company to apply for concession rights in 2024 for the area which is now designated as Chelopech North.\n\nAn intensive drilling campaign on the Brevene exploration licence has been completed and application for Geological Discovery was filed in December in 2023, with the goal of obtaining the Geological Discovery Certificate in mid-2024.\n\nThe  Company  has  planned  a  total  of  $4  million  to  $5  million  for  Chelopech  brownfield  exploration activities in 2024.\n\n## Ada Tepe Brownfield Exploration\n\nDuring  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023,  exploration  activities  at  Ada  Tepe  camp  were  focused  on  a  target delineation campaign and scout drilling on the new Krumovitsa exploration licence.\n\n## Krumovitsa Exploration Licence\n\nScout drilling of several epithermal sediment hosted targets was advanced in the fourth quarter of 2023, and is planned to continue in the first quarter of 2024. The exploration team has continued systematic geological  mapping  and  rock  sampling  in  conjunction  with  spectral  data  acquisition  and  interpretation. Additionally,  the  Company  deployed  a  passive  seismic  orientation  survey  to  understand  the  basin morphology and enhance undercover targeting.\n\n## Chiirite Exploration Licence\n\nPermitting for drilling at Kara Tepe is ongoing and drilling is planned to commence in the second quarter of 2024, pending the positive outcome of the associated Environmental Impact Assessment process.\n\nThe Company has planned a total of $4 million to $5 million for Ada Tepe brownfield exploration activities and another $1 million to $2 million for Ada Tepe greenfield exploration activities in 2024.\n\n## Serbia Exploration\n\nIn the fourth quarter, exploration activities in Serbia continued to focus on an accelerated drilling program at the \u010coka Rakita deposit, with approximately 19,500 metres completed.",

Scout drilling intercepted  favourable  geological  indicators  on  the  north  and  north  west flank  of the  system  where additional marble hosted skarn mineralization was encountered.\n\nFollowing the grant of the two new exploration licences over the area hosting the Timok gold project, the Company  is  currently  preparing  an  aggressive  exploration  program  and  plans  to  start  testing  the favourable stratigraphy for carbonate replacement and skarns on the new Potaj \u010cuka exploration licence, located to the north of \u010coka Rakita, as well as on the new Pe\u0161ter Jug exploration licence, which is to the west of \u010coka Rakita. This program is expected to commence in early 2024, pending approval of the work program and permitting procedures, with approximately 25,000 meters of drilling planned for the first year of exploration at these targets.\n\nThe Company has budgeted between $20 million and $22 million for Serbian exploration activities.\n\nFor further details, see the Company's news release dated December 11, 2023 entitled 'Dundee Precious Metals Announces High-Grade Underground Maiden Mineral Resource Estimate of 1.8 Million Inferred Gold Ounces at its \u010coka Rakita Project in Serbia' and the \u010coka Rakita Technical Report, respectively, for additional information, which have been posted on the Company's website at www.dundeeprecious.com and have been filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\n## Ecuador Exploration\n\n## Loma Larga Concessions\n\nOn the Loma Larga concessions, drilling activities remain paused following the decision on the appeal of the Action, which was received in mid-August 2023. (see the 'Development and Other Major Projects Loma Larga Gold Project' section contained in this MD&A for further details). The 15,800-metre program consists of hydrogeological, geotechnical, metallurgical, condemnation and extensional drilling.\n\n## Tierras Coloradas Concessions\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Company reported the results of a 2,700-metre diamond drilling program completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. The drilling program was designed to test a series of epithermal veins, previously identified by field work and scout drilling in 2020. Drilling confirmed two high-grade vein systems that remain open in multiple directions.\n\nThe  Company  commenced  a  10,000-metre  drilling  program  in  August  2023,  completed  a  total  of approximately 4,200 metres during the fourth quarter of 2023 for a total of approximately 6,500 metres for the year. Assay results are pending. The primary focus of the drilling campaign is to further assess the extension and geometry of the Aparecida and La Tuna vein systems, to test other additional high-grade veins and to follow up on soil anomalies with high-sulfidation epithermal or porphyry type geochemical signatures.\n\nDuring  2023, detailed  surface  mapping  was  performed  in  conjunction  with  soil  and  rock  chip-channel sampling, in order to determine the surface footprint and identify drilling targets. Additional field work will continue in the first quarter of 2024.",

As a result, the assets and liabilities of Tsumeb have been presented as held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial  position  as  at  December  31,  2023  and  the  operating  results  and  cash  flows  of  Tsumeb  have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Complex concentrate smelted in 2023 of 188,803 tonnes was 14,681 tonnes higher than 2022 due primarily to increased plant availability following the completion of the maintenance work in the third quarter of 2023.",

Sulphuric acid production in 2023 of 195,265 tonnes was 3,121 tonnes lower than 2022, due primarily to lower sulphuric acid contained in complex concentrate smelted.\n\nSulphuric acid deliveries in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 of 58,528 tonnes and 185,197 tonnes, respectively,  were  1,415  tonnes  and  18,715  tonnes  lower  than  the  corresponding  periods  in  2022 reflecting the timing of deliveries.\n\n## Cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted\n\nCash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $320 was $123 lower than the corresponding period in 2022 due primarily to higher volumes of complex concentrate smelted reflecting improved operating performance following the Ausmelt furnace maintenance shutdown, partially offset by lower sulphuric acid by-product credits. Cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted in 2023 of $414 was $49 lower than 2022 due primarily to higher volumes of complex concentrate smelted and a weaker ZAR relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower sulphuric acid by-product credits.\n\n## Tsumeb capital expenditures\n\nCapital  expenditures  in  the  fourth  quarter  and  full  year  of 2023  were  $3.4  million  and  $14.0  million, respectively, compared to $3.8 million and $19.8 million in the corresponding periods in 2022, reflecting benefits from the cost optimizations of the Ausmelt furnace maintenance shutdown in 2023.\n\n## Tsumeb revenue\n\nRevenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $36.7 million compared to $39.9 million in the corresponding period  in  2022  due  primarily  to  lower  estimated  metal  recoveries, partially  offset by  higher  volumes  of complex concentrate smelted. Revenue in 2023 was $114.3 million compared to $136.3 million in 2022 due primarily to lower estimated metal recoveries and lower acid revenue resulting from lower volumes and market prices, partially offset by higher volumes of complex concentrate smelted.\n\n## Tsumeb cost of sales\n\nCost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $27.9 million was $1.9 million higher than the corresponding period in 2022 due primarily to higher volumes of complex concentrate smelted. Cost of sales in 2023 of $99.0 million was $21.8 million lower than 2022 due primarily to a weaker ZAR relative to the U.S. dollar and lower depreciation expense following the impairment charge taken in the third quarter of 2022.\n\n## Tsumeb impairment charge\n\nDuring  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  the  carrying  value  of Tsumeb  exceeded  its  estimated recoverable  amount  resulting  in  an  impairment  charge  of  $85.0  million.  This  charge  was  primarily attributable to lower forecast toll revenue as a result of an expected reduction in higher arsenic bearing third-party concentrate feed being received by the smelter, commencing in 2024, concurrent with when the smelter is not expected to be processing any Chelopech concentrate.",

Net  earnings  from discontinued  operations  in  2023  of  $10.9  million,  increased  compared  to  a  net  loss  from  discontinued operations  of  $80.7  million  in  2022  due  primarily  to  the  impairment  charge  of  $85.0  million  and restructuring costs of $5.7 million.\n\n## Adjusted net earnings from discontinued operations\n\nAdjusted net earnings from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 was $5.4 million and $10.9 million, respectively, compared to $11.2 million and $10.1 million in the corresponding periods  in  2022  due  primarily  to  the  same  factors  affecting  net  earnings  (loss)  from  discontinued operations, except for adjusting items mainly related to the impairment charge and restructuring costs.\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA from discontinued operations\n\nAdjusted EBITDA from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 was $7.6 million and $18.8 million, respectively, compared to $12.8 million and $30.0 million in the corresponding periods in 2022 due primarily to the same factors affecting adjusted net earnings from discontinued operations, except  for  interest,  income  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization,  which  are  excluded  from  adjusted EBITDA.\n\n## Tsumeb secondary materials\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, Tsumeb had approximately $45.9 million of recoverable third party in-process secondary materials, which it is obligated to process and return, generally in the form of blister, to IXM S.A. ('IXM') pursuant to a tolling agreement.\n\nIn  April  2021,  the  Company  and  IXM  agreed  to  amend  the  existing  tolling  agreement  to  provide  for, among  other  things:  i)  targeted  declining  excess  secondary  material  balances,  above  which  excess secondary material would be required to be purchased by the Company; ii) the elimination of all excess secondary material by April 30, 2023; iii) an increase in the defined level of normal secondary material; and iv) an extension of the tolling agreement by three years to December 31, 2026.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the value of excess secondary materials, as defined in the tolling agreement, was approximately $9.8 million.  Given  the  fact  that  the  Company  had  a  receivable  from  IXM  of  $17.2 million related to the estimated metal exposure at Tsumeb as at December 31, 2023, IXM has agreed to waive the requirement to purchase secondary material above the agreed normal levels.\n\n## MARKET REVIEW\n\n## Commodity prices\n\nCommodity prices are the principal determinants of the Company's results of continuing operations and financial condition.",

The  average  realized  copper  price  for  the  fourth quarter and full year of 2023 of $3.74 and $3.82 per pound, respectively, was 2% higher than and 4% lower than the corresponding periods in 2022, also reflecting year over year changes in market prices.\n\nThe price  of gold  is  subject to  volatile  price  movements  over  short periods  of time  and  is  affected  by numerous industry and macro-economic factors that are beyond the Company's control including, but not limited to, the supply of and demand for gold, interest rates (and interest rate expectations), inflation rates (and inflation expectations), currency movements and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, economic data  and  market volatility, as  well  as  central  bank  reserves  and  investor  behaviours. These  diverse sources of impacts can counterbalance one another and provide gold with its uniquely stable performance at times. Over the course of 2023,  average price of gold increased by 8% and reached a record high daily close price of $2,078 per ounce in late December. Gold prices in 2023 were impacted by demand from emerging markets, central banks, as well as increased geopolitics risks, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates and the U.S dollar strength.\n\nOverall, our view is that the demand for gold, amount of gold in the central bank reserves, the value of the U.S. dollar, and the desire to hold gold as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, all help drive the price of gold in the near-term.\n\nThe price of copper is largely influenced by the health of the global economy. This is due to its widespread applications  in  all  sectors  of the  economy, such  as  power  generation  and  transmission, construction, transportation, factory  equipment and  electronics. Copper  prices  remained  largely  flat year  over  year, having seen strong gains in the first quarter of 2023, declines in middle of the year before rebounding in the  fourth  quarter. Tight supply  and  fluctuating  demand, particularly  from  slowing  economic  activity  in China were the significant factors impacting copper in 2023. In the short term the copper market may face constrained supply growth in light of recent announcements of lower forecasted production from a few larger mines.\n\nIn  the  long  run,  the  supply  and  demand  fundamentals  are  supportive  for  copper  prices,  with  the expectation  of eventually  increasing  global  demand, particularly  for  the  green  energy  transition, facing potential constrained growth of supply.\n\nThe  Company  regularly  enters  into  cash  settled  commodity  swap  contracts  to  swap  future  contracted monthly average metal prices for fixed metal prices in order to reduce the price exposure associated with the time lag between the provisional and final determination of its gold and copper concentrate sales ('QP Hedges'). In  addition, the  Company  periodically  enters  into  cash  settled  commodity  swap  and  option contracts  to  reduce  its  price  exposure  on  future  sales  associated  with  projected  payable  copper production  ('Production  Hedges')  given  the  higher  volatility  in  copper  prices. The  Company  sells  and hedges  gold  and  copper  metal  contained  in  concentrates  produced  at  prices  that  are  effectively determined by reference to the traded prices on major commodity exchanges, including the LME and the LBMA. The Company currently has no hedges in place for its expected payable  copper  to  be  sold  in 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Foreign exchange rates\n\nAs an entity reporting in U.S. dollars with operations in several countries, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Bulgarian lev, which is pegged to the Euro, the Namibian dollar, which is pegged to the South African rand ('ZAR') on a 1:1 basis, and the Canadian dollar ('Cdn$') can also impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe following table sets out the average foreign exchange rates for the principal currencies impacting the Company and highlights the overall year over year strengthening (weakening) of the U.S. dollar relative to these currencies.\n\n| Foreign Exchange Rates   |   Fourth Quarter |   Fourth Quarter | Fourth Quarter   |   Full Year |   Full Year | Full Year   |\n|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| (Market Average)         |        2023      |        2022      | Change           |   2023      |   2022      | Change      |\n| US$/Cdn$                 |           1.3619 |           1.358  | 0%               |      1.3495 |      1.3017 | 4%          |\n| Euro/US$                 |           1.0764 |           1.0211 | (5%)             |      1.0815 |      1.0541 | (3%)        |\n| US$/ZAR                  |          18.7168 |          17.6117 | 6%               |     18.4389 |     16.3531 | 13%         |\n\nIn  2023, the  U.S. dollar  showed  resilience  as  the  U.S economy  defied  expectations  of a  significant slowdown, lowering inflation and an end to the Federal Reserve's rate hike cycle. Specifically, the U.S dollar performance varied against different currencies.\n\nThe  U.S dollar  appreciated  approximately  4%  against the  Canadian  dollar  in  2023  and  ranged  from $1.3125 to $1.3900 throughout the year. The significant driver was the strength of the US economy which benefited from government spending related to the Inflation Reduction Act and resilience of household spending. Heading into 2024, the direction of the U.S dollar relative to the Canadian dollar is expected to be  driven  by  the  central  bank  monetary  policy  decision  in  each  respective  country  and  growth  of the global economy effecting risk appetite for commodities and US treasuries.\n\nThe U.S dollar depreciated by 3% against the Euro over the course of 2023 and showed much lower volatility compared to the previous year in which the European Union ('EU') was absorbing the impact of the fuel and energy price shocks. Heading into 2024, the U.S dollar is expected to be largely determined by the timing of the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts throughout the year, and the central bank's ability to successfully orchestrate a soft landing for the US economy.\n\nThe U.S dollar appreciated by 13% against the ZAR in 2023. This was largely driven by the performance of the South African economy being negatively impacted by the nationwide power shortages that have become a recurring issue during the year and this situation is likely to continue into 2024 and beyond.\n\nFluctuations in these exchange rates increase the volatility of the Company's cost measures reported in the U.S. dollars. The Company periodically undertakes to purchase, in advance, a portion of its foreign denominated cash flow requirements on a spot or forward basis to reduce this exposure. The Company also  enters  into  foreign  exchange  option  contracts  in  order  to  reduce  the  foreign  exchange  exposure associated  with  projected  operating  expenses  and  capital  expenditures  denominated  in  foreign currencies. In 2023, approximately 84% of Namibian dollar operating expenses related to discontinued operations  for  2023  were  hedged  with  option  contracts  providing, on  a  US$/ZAR  basis, a  weighted average floor rate of 15.69 and a weighted average ceiling rate of 17.69. In addition, approximately 62% of projected Namibian dollar operating expenses related to discontinued operations for 2024 have been hedged with option contracts providing a weighted average floor rate of 17.94 and a weighted average ceiling rate of 20.24. The Company currently has no Euro or Canadian dollar hedges in place.",

        "page_content": "## Energy costs\n\nEnergy  costs  are  the  single  largest  cost  to  the  Company's  producing  mines  other  than  labour  costs, representing approximately 12% of its total mine cash cost at an average annual consumption rate of approximately  165,000  megawatt  hours  ('MWh').  The  fluctuation  in  energy  costs  can  also  impact  the Company's key cost measures and results of  continuing operations.\n\nEuropean  energy  prices  continued  to  rise  through  the  first  half  of  2023,  resulting  from  the  effects  of distorted energy supply chains due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine before stabilizing and posting modest declines for the remainder of the year. Bulgarian energy prices showed a sharper decline during the year, reaching a 30-month low of Bulgarian lev 160 per MWh ($89 per MWh) in December 2023.\n\nThe Company's Chelopech and Ada Tepe mines are located in Bulgaria, Eastern Europe. As Bulgaria is a net exporter of power, Chelopech and Ada Tepe are not currently reliant on Russia for their power needs. In  addition,  the  Company's  exposures  to  the  rising  prices  for  energy  were  mitigated  by  the  Bulgarian government power subsidies starting from October 2021 and extended through to the end of 2023. The power subsidies were applicable to both residential and commercial business operations to mitigate the surge in electricity prices. In 2023, the Company paid an average of Bulgarian lev 220 per MWh ($122 per MWh), net of the government power subsidy, which was based on progressive measures enacted through the year with set price thresholds per MWh. This was slightly lower than in 2022 which the Company paid an average of Bulgarian lev 269 per MWh ($147 per MWh). No further government power subsidies have been announced by the Bulgarian government beyond 2023.\n\n## Fuel costs\n\nFuel costs are also a significant cost element to the Company through direct purchases of fuel and diesel related to operation of mobile fleet, or indirectly through transportation costs as well as costs for other direct materials including grinding media, reagents and certain spare parts which rely on fuel as an input cost. In aggregate, approximately 25% to 30% of the Company's mine cash costs are directly or indirectly impacted by fuel costs. Fuel costs are affected directly by the crude oil prices, and therefore, fluctuations in  the  crude  oil  prices  can  also  impact  the  Company's  key  cost  measures  and  results  of  continuing operations.\n\nCrude  oil  prices  typically  fluctuate  based  on  seasonal  demand  and  supply  and  global  political  and economic events. One of the main benchmarks for fuel prices, Brent Crude, saw significantly less volatility in 2023, with average prices declining by approximately 19% year over year compared to an increase of 42% in 2022. Global markets have largely adjusted to events of the previous year, with the EU reducing its  imports  of  crude  oil  from  Russia,  demand  for  global  crude  oil  falling  short  of  expectations  on  lower economic growth and higher crude oil supply from non-OPEC+ member such as the United States, Brazil and  Guyana.  Those  factors  helped  to  offset  the  impacts  from  reduction  in  supply  from  members  of OPEC+ along with heightened geopolitical risks in the Middle East in the fourth quarter of 2023. These key drivers are expected to continue to impact crude oil prices in 2024.\n\nThe Company does not have any oil hedges in place.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2023,  the  Company  held  cash  of  $595.3  million,  and  $150.0  million  of  undrawn capacity under its RCF.\n\nThe Company's liquidity  is  impacted  by  several  factors  which  include, but are  not limited  to, gold  and copper  market prices, production  levels, capital  expenditures, operating  cash  costs, interest rates  and foreign exchange rates. These factors are monitored by the Company on a regular basis.",

The Company may, from time to time, raise additional capital or amend its RCF to ensure it maintains its financial strength and has sufficient liquidity to support the funding requirements associated with one or more of its growth capital projects and the overall needs of the business.\n\n## Capital Allocation - Osino Acquisition, Declaration of Dividend and Share Repurchases\n\nAs part of its strategy, the Company adheres to a disciplined capital allocation framework that is based on three fundamental considerations - balance sheet strength, reinvestment in the business, and the return of  excess  capital  to  shareholders.  Maintaining  a  strong  balance  sheet  includes  ensuring  adequate liquidity,  managing  within  prudent  financial  metrics,  and  building  a  strong  cash  position  to  support accretive growth. Reinvestment in the business includes investing in its operating assets to sustain and optimize performance; investing in resource development to extend the life of its mines and to identify new gold resources; further advancing existing resources towards production; as well as investing in new projects to grow beyond its existing asset base. Returning capital to shareholders includes dividends, and under  certain  circumstances,  opportunistic  share  repurchases.  These  alternatives  are  not  mutually exclusive, nor are they exhaustive, and are assessed in a balanced manner with a view to maximizing total shareholder returns over the long-term.\n\n## Acquisition of Osino\n\nOn December 18, 2023, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement whereby DPM will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Osino (the \"Osino Shares\") for consideration consisting of Cdn$0.775 in cash per Osino Share and 0.0801 of a DPM common share per Osino Share. The  principal  assets  of Osino  are  comprised  of the  Twin  Hills  open  pit gold  project, as  well  as  an extensive exploration portfolio, in Namibia. The acquisition of Osino is subject to the approval of Osino's securityholders  as  well  as  applicable  regulatory  approvals,  including  approval  under  the  Namibia Competition Act. In addition, each of DPM and Osino has the right to terminate the transaction in certain circumstances. Provided that all approvals are obtained and neither party exercises its right to terminate, the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2024.\n\nConcurrently  with  the  transaction, DPM  agreed  to  purchase  an  aggregate  of Cdn$10  million  Osino Shares, in two equal tranches at a price of Cdn$1.13 per share pursuant to a private placement. The first tranche  of  the  private  placement  was  completed  on  December  22,  2023,  whereby  DPM  acquired 4,424,779 Osino Shares at a cost of $3.8 million (Cdn$5.0 million), and the second and final tranche was completed on January 30, 2024, whereby DPM acquired an additional 4,424,778 Osino Shares at a cost of $3.7 million (Cdn$5.0 million).\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, DPM held a total of 8,235,379 Osino Shares with a fair value of $8.2 million, which was included in investment at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position.\n\n## Declaration of dividend\n\nIn  2023, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.04 (2022 - $0.04) per common share to its shareholders  of record  resulting  in  total  dividend  distributions  of $29.6  million (2022  -  $30.5  million) recognized  against  its  retained  earnings  in  the  audited  consolidated  statements  of  changes  in shareholders' equity. The Company paid an aggregate of $30.2 million (2022 - $28.6 million) of dividends which were included in cash used in financing activities in the audited consolidated statements of cash flows  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023  and  recognized  a  dividend  payable  of  $7.3  million (December 31, 2022 - $7.6 million) in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the audited consolidated statements of financial position as at December 31, 2023.",

The price that the Company will pay for common shares in open market transactions will be the market price at the time of purchase and any common shares that are purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled.\n\nThe  Company's  Board  of  Directors  authorized  management  to  repurchase  up  to  $100  million  of  the Company's shares over a period of twelve months, which began on March 1, 2023.\n\nDuring  the  year  ended  December  31, 2023, the  Company  purchased  a  total  of 9,738,063  (2022  2,471,500)  shares, all  of which  were  cancelled  as  at December  31, 2023. The  total  cost of these purchases was $65.6 million (2022 - $13.6 million) at an average price per share of $6.74 (Cdn$9.10) (2022 - $5.51 (Cdn$7.14)), of which $29.6 million (2022 - $7.5 million) was recognized as a reduction in share  capital,  and  $36.0  million  (2022  -  $6.1  million)  as  a  reduction  in  retained  earnings  in  the consolidated  statements  of changes  in  shareholders' equity. Cash  payments  of $65.6  million  (2022  $13.6 million) were included in cash used in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Board of Directors has approved the renewal of the NCIB (the 'New Bid') and the Company expects to seek acceptance thereof from the TSX in due course during the first quarter of 2024. If accepted, the New Bid will be made in accordance with the applicable rules and policies of the TSX and applicable Canadian securities laws, and the Company expects be able to purchase up to 10% of the public float of common shares over a period of twelve months commencing after the receipt of TSX approval.\n\nIn the event that the New Bid is accepted by the TSX, the actual timing and number of common shares that  may  be  purchased  thereunder  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  DPM's  capital  allocation framework, having  regard  for  such  things  as  DPM's  financial  position, business  outlook  and  ongoing capital requirements, as well as its share price and overall market conditions. The Company is currently reviewing its capital allocation strategy in balancing between the capital required for its growth projects and return of capital to shareholders.",

Cash  provided  from  operating activities of continuing operations in 2023 of $261.6 million was 25% higher than 2022 due primarily to higher adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations generated in the year, partially offset by the timing of deliveries and subsequent receipt of cash and the timing of payments to suppliers.\n\nFree  cash  flow  from  in  the  fourth  quarter  and  full  year  of  2023  of  $49.3  million  and  $227.9  million, respectively,  was  $19.3  million  and  $77.4  million  higher  than  the  corresponding  periods  in  2022  due primarily to higher adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations generated in the periods and lower cash outlays for sustaining capital expenditures. Free cash flow is calculated before changes in working capital.\n\n## Investing activities\n\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $18.0 million while cash provided from investing activities of continuing operations in 2023 was $0.6 million, compared to  cash  used  in  investing  activities  of  continuing  operations  of  $21.1  million  and  $67.0  million  in  the corresponding periods in 2022.",

As  a  result, DPM  exchanged  its  ownership  interest in  Sabina  for 13,940,753  common  shares  of B2Gold, valued  at $56.8  million  (Cdn$76.1  million)  at the  date  of the transaction. On de-recognition of its investment in Sabina, the Company recognized a fair value gain of $2.2 million in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company subsequently disposed of all B2Gold common shares held for cash proceeds of $56.5 million and transferred the accumulated fair value gains of $17.7  million  on  Sabina  common  shares  from  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  to retained earnings in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n## Commodity Swap Contracts\n\nThe Company is subject to price risk associated with fluctuations in the market prices for metals. The Company  regularly  enters  into  cash  settled  QP Hedges  from  time  to  time  to  swap  future  contracted monthly average metal prices for fixed metal prices to eliminate or substantially reduce the metal price exposure  associated  with  the  time  lag  between  the  provisional  and  final  determination  of concentrate sales.\n\nThe Company designates the spot component of commodity swap contracts in respect of QP Hedges as fair  value hedges. The fair value gain or loss on QP Hedges is calculated based on the corresponding LME forward copper prices and New York Commodity Exchange forward gold prices, as applicable.\n\nAs  at December  31, 2023, the  impact of a  5%  increase  or  decrease  in  metal  prices  impacting  the Company's accounts receivable and outstanding commodity swap contracts, with all other variables held constant, would decrease or increase earnings before income taxes from continuing operations by $1.2 million (2022 - $0.6 million) and would decrease or increase equity by $1.1 million (2022 - $0.6 million).",

        "page_content": "## Foreign Exchange Option Contracts related to discontinued operations\n\nThe Company's foreign currency exposures arise primarily from a significant portion of its operating and capital  costs  being  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar,  the  Company's  functional currency. The Company enters into foreign exchange option contracts from time to time in order to reduce the foreign exchange exposure associated with projected operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange option contracts are entered into, to provide price protection  below  a  specified  'floor'  rate  and  participation  up  to  a  specified  'ceiling'  rate.  The  option contracts entered into are comprised of a series of call options and put options (which when combined create a price 'collar') that are structured so as to provide for a zero upfront cash cost.\n\nThe Company designates the intrinsic value of foreign exchange option contracts as cash flow hedges. The time value component of foreign exchange option contracts is treated as a separate cost of hedging. The  fair  value  gain  or  loss  on  foreign  exchange  option  contracts  was  calculated  based  on  foreign exchange  forward  rates  quoted  in  the  market.  As  at  December  31,  2023,  approximately  64%  of  the Company's  projected  Namibian  dollar  operating  expenses  for  2024,  which  is  linked  to  the  ZAR,  have been hedged.\n\nThe  Company  is  also  exposed  to  credit  and  liquidity  risks  in  the  event  of  non-performance  by counterparties in connection with its commodity swap contracts and foreign exchange option contracts. These risks, which are monitored on a regular basis, are mitigated, in part, by entering into transactions with  financially  sound  counterparties  and,  where  possible,  ensuring  contracts  are  governed  by  legally enforceable master agreements.\n\n## OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n\nThe Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.",

Estimates and assumptions are evaluated and are based on management's experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances. However, actual  outcomes  can  differ  from  these estimates.\n\nThe  significant  areas  of  estimation  and  uncertainty  considered  by  management  in  preparing  the consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to:\n\n## Mineral exploration and evaluation expenditures\n\nExploration and evaluation activities involve the search for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, the assessment  of  technical  and  operational  feasibility  and  the  determination  of  an  identified  Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve's commercial viability.\n\nThe application of the Company's accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditures requires judgment in determining whether it is probable that future economic benefits will be generated from the exploitation of an exploration and evaluation asset when activities have not yet reached a stage where a reasonable  assessment of the  existence  of Mineral  Reserves  can  be  determined. The  estimation  of Mineral Resources is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates regarding economic  and  geological  data  and  these  assumptions  and  estimates  impact  the  decision  to  either expense or capitalize exploration and evaluation expenditures. Management is required to make certain estimates  and  assumptions  about  future  events  and  circumstances  in  order  to  determine  if  an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any revision to any of these assumptions and estimates could result in the impairment of the capitalized exploration and evaluation costs. If new information  becomes  available  after  expenditures  have  been  capitalized  that  the  recovery  of  these expenditures  is  no  longer  probable, the  expenditures  capitalized  are  written  down  to  the  recoverable amount and charged to net earnings (loss) in the period the new information becomes available.\n\n## Mine properties\n\n## Commencement of commercial production\n\nAll  expenditures  undertaken  in  the  development, construction, installation  and/or  completion  of mine production  facilities  are  capitalized  and  initially  classified  as  'Mines  under  construction'.  Upon  the commencement of commercial production, all related assets included in 'Mines under construction' are reclassified to 'Mine Properties - Producing mines' or 'Property, plant and equipment'.",

        "page_content": "Determination of commencement of commercial production is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates. The commencement of commercial production is defined as the date when the  mine  is  capable  of  operating  in  the  manner  intended  by  management.  The  Company  considers primarily  the  following  factors,  among  others,  when  determining  the  commencement  of  commercial production:\n\n- \u00b7 All major capital expenditures to achieve a consistent level of production and desired capacity have been incurred;\n- \u00b7 A reasonable period of testing of the mine plant and equipment has been completed;\n- \u00b7 A predetermined percentage of design capacity of the mine and mill has been reached; and\n- \u00b7 Required production levels, grades and recoveries have been achieved.\n\n## Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates\n\nThe estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, as defined under NI 43-101, is a complex process  and  requires  significant  assumptions  and  estimates.  The  Company  prepares  its  Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates based on information related to the geological data on the size, depth and shape of the ore body which is compiled by appropriately qualified persons. Mineral Resource and  Mineral  Reserve  estimates  are  based  upon  factors  such  as  metal  prices, capital  requirements, production costs, foreign exchange rates, geotechnical and geological assumptions and judgments made in  estimating  the  size  and  grade  of the  ore  body. Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserve  estimates, together  with  forecast production, determine  the  life  of mine  estimates  and  therefore  changes  in  the Mineral  Resource  or  Mineral  Reserve  estimates  may  impact  the  carrying  value  of  exploration  and evaluation assets, mine properties, property, plant and equipment, depletion and depreciation charges, rehabilitation provisions and deferred income tax assets.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the carrying values of mine properties, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are  assessed  for  impairment if indicators  of potential  impairment or  reversal  of previously recognized impairment exist. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount is calculated. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal ('FVLCD') and its value in use based on discounted cash flows. This is determined on an asset-by-asset basis, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets  or  groups  of assets. If this  is  the  case, individual  assets  are  grouped  together  into  a  Cash Generating Unit ('CGU') for impairment purposes. Such CGUs represent the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. Management has assessed the Company's CGUs as being an individual operating site.\n\nThe assessment of impairment is based on a number of external and internal factors, some of which are outside of the Company's control, and requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to these factors  for  each  CGU. External  factors  include  market considerations  ranging  from  overall  economic activity and the supply of and demand for the materials used in and products produced by the Company to  changes  in  commodity  prices,  toll  rates,  discount  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates  and  regulatory requirements.  Internal  factors  include  considerations  such  as  production  volume,  ability  to  convert resources  into  reserves, capital  and  operating  expenditures, and  future  development and  expansion plans.",

        "page_content": "These  significant  estimates  and  assumptions,  some  of  which  may  be  subjective,  require  that management make  decisions  based  on  the  best available  information  at each  reporting  period. It is possible  that the  actual  recoverable  amount could  be  significantly  different than  those  estimates. A significant decline in the asset's market value, reductions in metal price forecasts, increases in estimated future  costs  of production, increases  in  estimated  future  capital  costs, reductions  in  the  amount of recoverable reserves, resources and exploration potential, and/or adverse market conditions can result in a  write-down  of  the  carrying  amounts  of  the  Company's  assets.  Judgment  is  also  required  when considering whether significant changes in any of these items indicate a previous impairment may have reversed.\n\n## Rehabilitation provisions\n\nMining, processing, development and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing  the  protection  of the  environment. The  Company  recognizes  a  liability  for  its  rehabilitation obligations in the period when a legal and/or constructive obligation is identified. The liability is measured at the present value of the estimated costs required to rehabilitate operating locations based on the riskfree nominal discount rates that are specific to the countries in which the operations are located.\n\nThe  nature  of  these  restoration  and  rehabilitation  activities  includes:  i)  dismantling  and  removing structures; ii) rehabilitating mines and tailing dams; iii) dismantling operating facilities; iv) closure of plant and waste sites; and v) restoration, reclamation and re-vegetation of affected areas.\n\nSignificant estimates  and  assumptions  are  made  by  management in  determining  the  nature  and  costs associated with the rehabilitation liability. The estimates and assumptions required include estimates of the  timing, extent and  costs  of rehabilitation  activities, technology  changes, regulatory  changes, and changes in the discount and inflation rates. These uncertainties may result in future expenditures being different from the amounts currently provided.\n\nChanges in the underlying assumptions used to estimate the rehabilitation liability as well as changes to environmental  laws  and  regulations  could  cause  material  changes  in  the  expected  cost and  expected future settlement value.\n\nAt as  December  31, 2023, the  undiscounted  future  cost for  estimated  mine  closure  and  rehabilitation costs before inflation was estimated to be $78.2 million. The carrying value of the estimated mine closure and rehabilitation cost was $51.0 million at December 31, 2023 and $50.3 million at December 31, 2022. All these amounts included the rehabilitation costs at Tsumeb.\n\n## Revenue recognition related to toll smelting arrangements\n\nRevenue from processing concentrate is recognized when concentrate has been smelted and is based on the toll rate specified in the toll agreement, which can vary based on the composition of the concentrate processed  and  prevailing  market conditions  at the  time  the  agreement was  entered. Revenue  from processing  concentrate  is  adjusted  for  any  over  or  under  recoveries  of metals  delivered  relative  to contracted  rates  under  the  tolling  agreement between Tsumeb  and  IXM. These  adjustments  represent metal exposure and are calculated by comparing (i) the copper, gold and silver content in the concentrate received and processed by Tsumeb multiplied by the percentage accountable in the IXM contract to (ii) the accountable copper, gold and silver in the blister delivered to IXM and in the in-circuit material still being processed by Tsumeb.\n\nMany aspects of the metal exposure are subject to estimation, including the amount of metal contained in concentrate  received,  in-circuit  material  and  blister  delivered  where  final  assays  have  not  been completed. These significant estimates are based on the Company's process knowledge, joint surveys with IXM and multiple assay results, the final results of which could differ from initial estimates.",

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be generated in future periods to utilize these deductible temporary differences.\n\nJudgment  is  required  in  determining  whether  deferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognized  on  the consolidated statements of financial  position.  Deferred  income  tax  assets,  including  those  arising  from unutilized tax losses, require management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate future taxable income in order to utilize the deferred income tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations or other activities and the application of existing tax laws in  each  jurisdiction.  To  the  extent  that  future  cash  flows  and  taxable  income  differ  significantly  from estimates,  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  realize  the  net  deferred  income  tax  assets  recorded  on  the reporting date could be impacted.\n\nAdditionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates could impact tax deductions in future periods and the value of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nCertain financial measures referred to in this MD&A are not measures recognized under IFRS and are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures or ratios. These measures have no standardized meanings under  IFRS  and  may  not  be  comparable  to  similar  measures  presented  by  other  companies. The definitions  established  and  calculations  performed  by  DPM  are  based  on  management's  reasonable judgment and are consistently applied. These measures are used by management and investors to assist with assessing the Company's performance, including its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its return objectives and support its investing activities and debt service obligations. In addition, the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors uses certain of these measures, together with other measures, to set incentive compensation goals and assess performance. These measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in  accordance  with  IFRS. Non-GAAP financial  measures  and  ratios, together  with other financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS, are considered to be important factors that assist investors in assessing the Company's performance.\n\n## Non-GAAP Cash Cost and All-in Sustaining Cost Measures\n\nMine  cash  cost; smelter  cash  cost; mine  cash  cost of sales; and  all-in  sustaining  cost are  non-GAAP financial  measures. Cash  cost per  tonne  of ore  processed; cash  cost per  ounce  of gold  sold; all-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold; and cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted are nonGAAP ratios. These  measures  capture  the  important components  of the  Company's  production  and related  costs. Management and  investors  utilize  these  metrics  as  an  important tool  to  monitor  cost performance at the Company's operations. In addition, the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors uses certain of these measures, together with other measures, to set incentive compensation goals and assess performance.",

The operating results and financial condition are also subject to numerous external factors, which include economic, social, geopolitical, warfare, environmental, regulatory, health, legal, tax and market risks impacting, among other things, precious metals and copper prices, sulphuric acid prices, toll  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates,  inflation,  the  availability  and  cost  of  capital  to  fund  the  capital requirements of the business and the supply chain related to the business, uncertainty of production and cost estimates and the potential for unexpected costs and expenses, and changes in general economic conditions or conditions in the financial markets. Each of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future business, results of operations and financial condition, and could cause actual results  to  differ  materially  from  those  described  in  any  Forward-Looking  Statements  contained  in  this MD&A. The Company endeavours to manage these risks and uncertainties with good governance and in a  balanced  manner  with  a  view  to  mitigating  risk  while  maximizing  total  shareholder  returns.  The Company continually strives to identify and to effectively manage the risks of each of its business units. This  includes  developing  appropriate  risk  management strategies, policies  and  procedures, processes and systems. There can be no assurance that the Company has been or will be successful in identifying all risks or that any risk-mitigating strategies adopted to reduce or eliminate risk will be successful.",

        "page_content": "The following subsections describe some of the more significant business risks and uncertainties affecting the Company. These risks, along with other potential risks not specifically discussed in this MD&A, should be  considered  when  evaluating  the  Company  and  its  three-year  outlook  along  with  the  more comprehensive  discussion  of  risks  contained  in  the  'Risk  Factors'  section  of  our  most  recent AIF. Additional risks not identified below may affect the Company.\n\n## Metal Prices\n\nThe fluctuation in the price of a metal sold by the Company can significantly impact revenues as well as all-in  sustaining  cost per  ounce  of gold  and  other  cost measures  that are  reported  net of by-product credits. Accordingly, the prices of gold and copper are major factors influencing the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, and, in turn, the price for its common shares.\n\nMetal prices can fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the Company's control, including  overall  global  market conditions; the  sale  or  purchase  of gold  and  silver  by  various  central banks, financial institutions and Exchange Traded Funds; interest rates; foreign exchange rates; inflation or deflation; global and regional supply and demand; and the political and economic conditions of major gold, silver and copper producing and consuming countries throughout the world. If gold and/or copper prices were to decline significantly from current levels, there can be no assurance that cash flow from operations, together with cash on hand and available credit under the Company's RCF, will be sufficient to meet the  Company's  operating  and  capital  requirements, including  its  contractual  commitments  and mandatory debt repayments, and the Company could be forced to discontinue production, reassess the feasibility  of a  particular  project, and/or  could  lose  its  interest in, or  be  forced  to  sell, some  of its properties. In  addition, a  significant commodity  price  decline  could  result in  significant reductions  in Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates, which could have a material adverse impact on the value of one or more of the Company's cash generating units and result in an impairment of the carrying value of certain assets, including exploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, and property, plant and equipment.\n\nIn  accordance  with  established  risk  management  policies  approved  by  our  Board  of  Directors,  the Company  enters  into  QP Hedges  to  reduce  the  metal  price  exposure  associated  with  the  time  lag between  the  provisional  and  final  determination  of concentrate  sales. The  Company  also  selectively enters into Production Hedges to reduce its price exposure on future sales and in respect of certain cost measures  that are  impacted  by  variability  in  by-product metal  credits. These  Production  Hedges  are entered primarily to provide price protection below a specified 'floor' price and, to reduce the upfront cost of these contracts, are typically accompanied by option contracts that provide price participation up to a specified 'ceiling' price. The Company sells and hedges gold and copper metal contained in concentrates produced at prices that are effectively determined by reference to the traded prices on major commodity exchanges, including the LME and the LBMA.\n\n## International Conflicts and Geopolitical Risks\n\nInternational conflicts and other geopolitical tensions and events, including war, military action, terrorism, trade disputes and international responses thereto have historically led to, and may in the future lead to, uncertainty or volatility in global commodity and financial markets, and/or disruptions to supply chains and shipping  lanes. World-wide  political  and  economic  risks  are  intensifying, including  as  a  result of the conflicts  in  Ukraine  and  the  Middle  East,  which  create  significant  levels  of  uncertainty.  Volatility  in commodity prices and supply chain and shipping lanes disruptions may adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent and duration of the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts and related international action cannot be accurately predicted at this time and the effects of such conflict may magnify the impact of the other risks, including those relating to commodity price volatility and global financial conditions.",

        "page_content": "The Company's Chelopech and Ada Tepe mines are located in Bulgaria, Eastern Europe. Bulgaria does not share a border with either Russia or Ukraine and is part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the  EU. The  main  sources  of Bulgaria's  electric  energy  are  nuclear  and  coal  facilities, which  together comprise approximately 80% of Bulgaria's total energy generation. Although Russia has halted natural gas deliveries to Bulgaria, approximately 5% of Bulgaria's total energy supply is generated from natural gas and DPM has not experienced and does not anticipate any disruption of power supply to its mines as a result. In June 2022, the Council of Europe adopted sanctions that, among other things, prohibit the purchase, import or  transfer  of crude  oil  and  certain  petroleum  products  from  Russia  to  the  EU. A temporary  exemption  is  available  for  those  EU  member  states  that, due  to  their  geographic  situation, suffer from a specific dependence on Russian supplies and have no viable alternative options. Bulgaria has secured this exemption until end of 2024. As a result, the impact of the conflict in Ukraine on the Company has been limited to date to increased costs for energy, fuel and other direct materials.\n\nFurther escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, including an outbreak of and/or expansion of hostilities into other  countries  or  regions  within  Europe  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's operations due to, among other factors, disruption in the Company's supply chain, increased input costs, and increased risk (or perception of increased risk) in the profile of the Company's operations in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn addition, the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and the Hamas, and the potential for a wider regional conflict, has also had a significant impact on global stability. Attacks by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea has put significant risks on shipping lanes in the area and has resulted in increased shipping costs to various business entities including the Company. Continued attacks on shipping in the Middle East may result in further increases in shipping costs and longer transit times and delays in delivering products or procuring supplies. Further escalation of the conflict may spark confrontations in other parts of the Middle East and have further adverse consequences on global markets, supply chains and shipping lanes and the Company's business.\n\nThe Company continues to monitor these events and will proactively manage the situation, although there is  no  assurance  that the  Company's  operations  will  not be  adversely  affected  by  current geopolitical tensions and/or associated government sanctions.\n\n## Inflation and Global Economic Conditions\n\nThe global economy has faced significant instability in recent years, marked by increased inflation and supply  chain  disruptions. Global  economic  conditions  could  further  deteriorate, and  the  economy  may contract and enter into a recession. Additionally, future economic shocks may be precipitated by a number of causes, including  geopolitical  instability, a  rise  in  the  price  of oil  and  other  energy  costs, natural disasters, and outbreaks of pandemic or epidemic medical issues or other public health emergencies. Any sudden or rapid destabilization of global economic conditions could impact the Company's ability to obtain equity  or  debt  financing  in  the  future  on  terms  favourable  to  the  Company. Additionally,  any  such occurrence could cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which may result in  impairment charges. Further, in  such  an  event, the  Company's  operations  and  financial condition could be adversely impacted.\n\nIn addition to potentially affecting the price of gold, copper and silver, general inflationary pressures may also affect labour, commodity and other input costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and capital expenditures for the development of its projects. The Company has been impacted by these inflationary pressures in the form of higher costs for key  inputs  required  for  its  operations,  most  notably  higher  energy  costs. The  Company  has  made assumptions  around  the  expected  costs  of these  key  inputs, and  the  Company's  actual  costs  in  an inflationary environment may differ materially from those assumptions. These inflationary impacts may be felt directly  through  purchases  of diesel  and  fuel, as  well  as  through  higher  transportation  costs, and indirectly through higher costs of products which rely on energy as an input cost.",

        "page_content": "## Smelter Toll Rates, Sulphuric Acid Prices, Metal Recoveries and Feed\n\nThe availability of sufficient volumes of high value complex concentrate, at suitable toll rates, is critical to the ongoing viability and profitability of the Tsumeb smelter, given the fixed cost nature of the operation. To facilitate the procurement of complex concentrates, the Company entered into an agreement with IXM that currently matures on December 31, 2026. There is no assurance that this agreement will be renewed with IXM upon its expiry.\n\nUnder this agreement, the Company typically secures complex concentrate volumes at specified toll rates covering  the  next 12-24  months. As  at December  31, 2023, the  Company  has  contracted  high  value complex concentrate covering over 75% of its expected concentrate requirements through to the end of 2024. There can be no assurance that such concentrate will be available to the smelter in the future or that the parties will agree on contracted toll rates that will be sufficient to generate an adequate return. Failure  to  find  sufficient  quantities  of  suitable  high  value  complex  concentrate  to  be  processed  at acceptable toll rates could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nUnder the agreement with IXM, Tsumeb must return specified quantities of copper, gold and silver, and maintain specified maximum levels of in-process metal. Metal over and under recoveries at the smelter are  subject to  smelter  processing  capabilities, contracted  terms, and  various  estimates, including  the quantities  of metal  contained  in  concentrate  received, material  in-process  and  blister  delivered. These estimates  are  based  on  the  Company's  process  knowledge  and  multiple  assay  results. Actual  metal deliveries could differ materially from initial estimates and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's  business, financial  condition  and  results  of operations  as  any  over  or  under  recovery  of metals  is  recorded  in  revenue. In  the  event that in-process  metals  at the  smelter  exceed  specified maximum contractual levels, Tsumeb may be required to purchase such excess in-process metal. IXM may agree to waive such purchase requirement, as it did in all applicable years, when in-process metal exceeded maximum contractual levels.\n\nTsumeb produces sulphuric acid as a by-product of the smelting operation. Historically, the vast majority of this sulphuric acid has been sold to customers in Namibia, with the balance exported to other countries in  Africa. The  revenue  from  sulphuric  acid  sales  makes  up  approximately  15%  to  20%  of Tsumeb's revenue and changes in the market price of and demand for sulphuric acid can have a material impact on Tsumeb's financial results. As at December 31, 2023, approximately 90% of Tsumeb's forecast sulphuric acid  production  over  the  next three  years  is  expected  to  be  sold  domestically  under  a  reference  price contract which includes floor and ceiling prices. The remainder of Tsumeb's sulphuric acid production is expected to be sold at market terms under spot or longer-term agreements. An inability to sell or deliver sufficient acid production whereby Tsumeb's sulphuric acid storage capacity is exceeded would result in a reduction of smelter operating levels up to and including a full stoppage.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nBy virtue of its international operations, the Company incurs costs and expenses in a number of foreign currencies.  The  revenue  from  its  mining  and  smelting  operations  received  by  the  Company  is denominated in U.S. dollars since the prices of the metals that it produces are referenced in U.S. dollars, while  the  majority  of  operating  and  capital  expenditures  of  its  mining  and  smelter  operations  are denominated in Bulgarian lev, which is pegged to the Euro, the Namibian dollar, which is tied to the ZAR, and  the  Canadian  dollar. Fluctuations  in  these  foreign  exchange  rates  give  rise  to  foreign  exchange exposures, either  favourable  or  unfavourable, which  could  have  a  material  impact on  the  Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain currencies can also have an impact on commodity prices quoted in U.S. dollars, such that a stronger U.S. dollar tends to have a negative impact on U.S. quoted prices while a weaker U.S. dollar tends to have a favourable  impact. As  a  result, this  relationship  is  considered  in  conjunction  with  the  Company's  risk assessment.",

Such risks include, without limitation, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, disruptions in the supply of critical materials and supplies, disruptions  due  to  pandemic  conditions, delays  in  obtaining  work  visas  or  other  authorizations, labour disputes, changes  in  laws, technical  difficulties  or  failures, equipment failure, failure  of retaining  dams around  tailings  disposal  areas  which  may  result  in  environmental  pollution  and  consequent  liability, unusual and unexpected geologic formations, seismic activity, rock bursts, cave-ins, flooding and other conditions  involved  in  the  drilling  and  removal  of material. Such  risks  could  result in  damage  to, or destruction of, mines and other processing facilities, damage to life or property, environmental damage, delays in mining and processing, delays in scheduled maintenance, losses and possible legal liability. Any prolonged  downtime  or  shutdowns  at the  Company's  mining  and  processing  facilities  could  have  a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nSuccess of the Company's operations also depends on adequate public infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, power sources and water supplies are important determinants which affect capital and operating costs. Natural  events, such  as  seismic  events  and  severe  climatic  conditions, as  well  as  sabotage, government or  other  interference  in  the  maintenance  or  provision  of such  infrastructure  could  have  a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\n\nThe  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves  disclosed  by  the  Company  are  estimates  and  no assurance can be given that the anticipated tonnages and grades will be achieved or that the indicated level  of  recovery  will  be  realized. There  are  numerous  uncertainties  inherent  in  estimating  Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, including many factors beyond the Company's control. Such estimation is  a  subjective  process  and  the  accuracy  of any  estimate  is  a  function  of the  quantity  and  quality  of available  data  and  of  the  assumptions  made  and  judgments  used  in  engineering  and  geological interpretation. Short-term operating factors, such as the need for orderly development of the ore bodies or the processing of new or different ore grades, may cause the mining operation to be unprofitable in any particular accounting period. In addition, there can be no assurance that gold, silver or copper recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production.\n\nFluctuations in gold, silver and copper prices, results of drilling, change in cut-off grades, metallurgical testing, production and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimates may require revision  of such  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserve  estimates. The  volume  and  grade  of Mineral Reserves  mined  and  processed, and  the  recovery  rates  achieved  may  not be  the  same  as  currently anticipated. Any material reduction in the estimated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves could have a  material  adverse  impact on  the  Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. A significant decrease  in  the  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserve  estimates  could  have  a  material adverse  impact on  the  carrying  value  of exploration  and  evaluation  assets, mine  properties, property, plant and equipment, depletion and depreciation charges, and estimated mine closure and rehabilitation costs, and could result in an impairment of the carrying value.",

        "page_content": "## Need for Mineral Reserves\n\nAs  mines  have  limited  lives  based  on  Proven  and  Probable  Mineral  Reserves, the  Company  must continually  develop, replace  and  expand  its  Mineral  Reserves  and  Mineral  Resources  as  its  mines produce gold, copper and silver concentrates. The Company's ability to maintain or increase its annual production of gold, copper and silver and its aggregate Mineral Reserves will be significantly dependent on its ability to expand its Mineral Resource base both at its existing mines and new mines it intends to bring into production in the future.\n\n## Exploration\n\nExploration  is  speculative  and  involves  many  risks  that  even  a  combination  of  careful  evaluation, experience and knowledge utilized by the Company may not eliminate. Once a site with mineralization is discovered, it may  take  several  years  from  the  initial  phases  of drilling  until  production  is  possible. Substantial expenditures are normally required to locate and establish Mineral Reserves and to permit and  construct  mining  and  processing  facilities.  While  the  discovery  of  mineralization  may  result  in substantial rewards if an ore body is proven, few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines.\n\n## Financing, Interest Rate and Liquidity\n\nThe  Company  relies  on  the  cash  flows  generated  from  its  mining  and  smelting  operations, including provisional payments received from its customers, cash on hand, available credit under its RCF, and its ability  to  raise  debt and  equity  from  the  capital  markets  to  fund  its  operating, investment and  liquidity needs. The cyclical nature of the Company's businesses, general economic conditions and the volatility of capital  markets are such that conditions could change dramatically, affecting the Company's cash flow generating  capability,  its  ability  to  maintain,  or  draw  upon,  its  RCF  or  the  existing  terms  under  its concentrate  sales  or  toll  agreements, as  well  as  its  liquidity, cost of capital  and  its  ability  to  access additional capital, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's earnings and cash flows and, in  turn, could  affect total  shareholder  returns. To  reduce  these  risks, the  Company: (i)  prepares regular cash flow forecasts to monitor its capital requirements, available liquidity and compliance with its debt covenants; (ii)  strives  to  maintain  a  prudent capital  structure  that is  comprised  primarily  of equity financing  and  a  long-term  committed  RCF; and  (iii)  targets  a  minimum  level  of liquidity  comprised  of surplus cash balances and/or available committed lines of credit to avoid being placed into a situation where it is  required  to  raise  additional  capital  at times  when  the  costs  or  terms  would  be  regarded  as unfavourable.\n\nThe Company's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the interest earned  on  the  Company's  cash  and  cash  equivalent and  short-term  investments, as  well  as  potential interest paid on future drawdowns under its RCF, which is based on a floating reference rate.\n\nFurthermore, there  can  be  no  assurance  that the  Company's  operations  will  be  profitable  or  that the Company will be able to raise capital on terms that it considers reasonable. Adverse commodity market, general economic conditions and adverse capital market conditions could result in a delay or the indefinite postponement of development or construction projects and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and share price.",

The Company's operations are subject to all of the  hazards  and  risks  normally  encountered  in  the  mining  and  smelting  sectors  including:  adverse environmental  conditions; industrial  and  environmental  accidents; metallurgical  and  other  processing problems; unusual or unexpected rock formations; ground or slope failures; structural cave-ins or slides; flooding or fires; seismic activity; rock bursts; equipment failures; failures to contain hazardous materials (including arsenic) within the designated areas; and periodic interruptions due to weather conditions; as well as intentional acts by individuals or groups who intend to harm or disrupt the Company's operations. These  risks  could  result  in  the  destruction  of  mines  or  processing  facilities,  the  failure  of  tailings management facilities  and  damage  to  infrastructure, causing  partial  or  complete  shutdowns, personal injury or death, environmental or other damage to the Company's properties or the properties of others, monetary losses and potential legal liability. Although the Company conducts extensive maintenance and monitoring and incurs significant costs to maintain its operations, equipment and infrastructure, including tailings  management facilities, unanticipated  failures  or  damage  may  occur  that could  cause  injuries, production loss or environmental pollution resulting in significant legal and/or economic liability.\n\nThe Company's mining and smelting operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulations  in  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  it operates. These  regulations  address, among  other things, emissions; air  and  water  quality  standards; land  use; rehabilitation  and  reclamation; and  safety and  work  environment  standards,  including  human  rights.  They  also  set  forth  limitations  on  the generation,  transportation,  storage  and  disposal  of  various  wastes,  including  hazardous  wastes. Environmental, health  and  safety  legislation  continues  to  evolve  and, while  the  Company  takes  active steps to monitor this legislation, it could result in stricter standards and enforcement, increased capital and  operating  costs  and  burdens  to  achieve  compliance,  increased  fines  and  penalties  for  noncompliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing the Company's mining, processing, development and exploration activities, or more stringent implementation  thereof, could  have  a  material  adverse  impact on  the  Company's  business, financial  condition  and  results  of  operations,  and  cause  increases  in  exploration  expenses,  capital expenditures,  production  costs  or  future  rehabilitation  costs  or  reduction  in  levels  of  production  at producing properties or require abandonment or delays in development of new mining properties and/or expansion of existing properties.\n\nEnvironmental  hazards  may  exist on  the  properties  in  which  the  Company  holds  interests, which  are unknown to the Company at present, and which have been caused by previous or existing owners or operators  of the  properties. The  Company  may  also  acquire  properties  with  known  or  undiscovered environmental risk. Any indemnifications by the previous owners or others may not be adequate to pay all the fines, penalties and costs incurred related to such properties. Some of the Company's properties have also  been  used  for  mining, processing, smelting  and  related  operations  for  many  years  before  the Company  acquired  them  and  were  acquired  'as  is'  or  with  assumed  environmental  liabilities  from previous owners or operators. The Company has been required to address contamination at its properties in the past and may need to do so in the future, either for existing environmental conditions or for leaks, discharges or contamination that may arise from its ongoing operations or other contingencies. The cost of addressing  environmental  conditions  or  risks, and  liabilities  associated  with  environmental  damage may  be  significant, and  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact on  the  Company's  business, financial condition and results of operations. Production at the Company's mines and processing facilities involves the use of various chemicals, including certain chemicals that are designated as hazardous substances. Contamination from hazardous substances, either at the Company's own properties or other locations for which it may be responsible, may subject the Company to liability for the investigation or remediation of contamination, as well as for claims seeking to recover costs for related property damage, personal injury or damage to natural resources. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.",

        "page_content": "In 2016, the Company completed a major multi-year capital program at its smelter in Namibia directed at modernizing the environmental equipment being utilized and debottlenecking its processing capacity. This included  the  completion  of  a  sulphuric  acid  plant,  which  has  reduced  the  plant's  SO 2 emissions.  The Company's environmental and occupational health and safety performance will be subject to continued monitoring  by  the  Namibian  authorities  and  deviation  from  expected  environmental  and  occupational health and safety outcomes could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future production, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Osino Acquisition\n\nThere is no certainty that the acquisition will be completed in accordance with the terms of the current agreement, or at all. Each of the Company and Osino has the right to terminate the acquisition in certain circumstances.  In  addition,  the  completion  of  the  acquisition  is  subject  to  a  number  of  conditions precedent, certain of which may be outside of the control of both parties, including the approval under the Namibia Competition Act. These factors may affect the ability of the Company to complete the acquisition of  Osino  on  the  terms  the  parties  have  agreed  upon  or  at  all. A  substantial  delay  in  obtaining  certain regulatory  approvals  or  the  imposition  of  unfavourable  terms  or  conditions  in  any  approval  could  also have an adverse effect on the business financial condition or results of operations of the Company.\n\n## DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nThe Company's management, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer ('CEO') and the Chief Financial Officer ('CFO'), has designed disclosure controls and procedures ('DC&P') and internal control over  financial  reporting  ('ICFR'),  as  defined  in  NI  52-109,  based  on  the  Internal  Control  -  Integrated Framework  (2013)  developed  by  COSO  (Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway Commission).\n\nThe CEO and CFO evaluated or caused to be evaluated under their supervision the design and operating effectiveness of the DC&P and ICFR as defined by NI 52-109 as at December 31, 2023. Based on this evaluation,  the  CEO  and  CFO  concluded  that  the  Company's  DC&P  and  ICFR  were  designed  and operating effectively as at December 31, 2023.\n\nNI 52-109 also requires Canadian public companies to disclose in their MD&A any change in ICFR that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, ICFR. No material changes were made to the ICFR in the year ended December 31, 2023. Only reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance that misstatements are prevented or detected on a timely basis by ICFR can be provided due to the inherent limitations  of  the  ICFR  system.  Such  limitations  also  apply  to  the  effectiveness  of  ICFR  as  it  is  also possible  that  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions  or  deterioration  in compliance with policies and procedures.\n\n## CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain  statements  and  other  information  included  in  this  MD&A and  our  other  disclosure  documents constitute 'forward looking information' or 'forward looking statements' within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, which we refer to collectively hereinafter as 'Forward Looking Statements'.\n\nForward Looking Statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, but not always, identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as 'plans', 'expects', 'is expected', 'budget', 'scheduled',  'estimates',  'forecasts',  'guidance',  'outlook',  'intends',  'anticipates',  'believes',  or variations of such words and phrases or that state that certain actions, events or results 'may', 'could',",

Without limitation  to  the  foregoing, the  following  section  outlines  certain  specific  Forward  Looking Statements  contained  in  the  'Three-Year  Outlook'  section  of this  MD&A, unless  otherwise  noted, and provides certain material assumptions used to develop such Forward Looking Statements and material risk  factors  that could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  the  Forward  Looking  Statements (which are provided without limitation to the additional general risk factors discussed herein):\n\nOre processed: assumes Chelopech and Ada Tepe mines perform at planned levels. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which is failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated.\n\nCash cost per tonne of ore processed: assumes Chelopech and Ada Tepe ore mined/milled are in line with  the  guidance  provided; foreign  exchange  rates  remain  at or  around  current levels; and  operating expenses  at Chelopech  and Ada  Tepe  are  at planned  levels. Subject to  a  number  of risks, the  more significant of which are: lower than anticipated ore mined/milled; a weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro; and unexpected increases in labour and other operating costs.\n\nMetals contained in concentrate produced: assumes grades and recoveries are consistent with current estimates of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves and DPM's current expectations; and ore mined/ milled is consistent with guidance. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which are: lower than anticipated ore grades, recovery rates and ore mined/milled.",

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Recognition of the Tsumeb metal exposure adjustment\n\nRefer to note 2.2 - Material accounting policy information and note 3 - Assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Company's assets held for sale included a metal recovery of $17.2 million related to estimated metal exposure at Tsumeb.\n\nRevenue from processing concentrate is adjusted for any over or under recoveries of metals delivered relative to contracted rates under the tolling agreement between Tsumeb and its customer. These metal exposure adjustments are calculated by comparing (i) the copper, gold and silver (together, metal) content in the concentrate received and processed by Tsumeb multiplied by the percentage payable in the agreement to (ii) the metal in the blister delivered to the customer and in the in-circuit material still being processed.\n\nThe metal exposure adjustment is subject to estimation, including the amount of metal contained in concentrate received, in-circuit material and blister delivered where final assays have not been completed.\n\nWe considered this a key audit matter due to (i) the significant judgment by management in estimating the Tsumeb metal exposure adjustment, including a high degree of estimation uncertainty and (ii) the significant audit effort and subjectivity in performing procedures related to management's assumptions.\n\nOur approach to addressing the matter included the following procedures, among others:\n\n- \uf0b7 Tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to the metal exposure process, including management's estimate of the metal exposure adjustment.\n- \uf0b7 Observed the metal stockpile survey performed near year-end.\n- \uf0b7 Obtained a customer confirmation in respect of the quantities of concentrate treated, blister returned and metal in-circuit at year-end.\n- \uf0b7 Tested how management estimated the Tsumeb metal exposure adjustment at yearend and evaluated the reasonableness of the estimated amount of metal contained in concentrate received, in-circuit material and blister delivered, where final assays have not been completed at year-end, by comparing to historical recovery rates and historical adjustments to provisional assays.",

We also:\n\n- \uf0b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \uf0b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \uf0b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \uf0b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.",

The Company controls an entity when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nThe Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The fair value of the acquisition of a subsidiary is based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the fair value of the consideration. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed includes any  contingent  consideration  arrangement. Acquisition  related  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred. At  the date  of  acquisition,  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination are measured initially at their fair values. The Company also recognizes any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value.\n\nThe excess, if any, of the consideration paid and the amount of any non-controlling interest recognized over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In the case of a bargain purchase, where the total consideration paid and the non-controlling interest recognized are less than the fair  value  of  the  net  assets  of  the  subsidiary  acquired,  the  difference  is  recognized  directly  in  the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is acquired by the Company and they are  deconsolidated  from  the  date  that  control  ceases. The  financial  statements  of  the  subsidiaries  are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company using consistent accounting policies. All inter-company balances, revenues and expenses and earnings and losses resulting from inter-company transactions are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are a separate component of the Company's  equity.  Non-controlling  interests  consist  of  the  non-controlling  interests  on  the  date  of  the original business combination plus the non-controlling interests' share of changes in equity since the date of acquisition.\n\n## (b) Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities and  contingent  liabilities  on  the  date  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  amounts  of revenues and expenses during the period reported. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated and are based on management's experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  However,  actual  outcomes  can  differ  from  these estimates.\n\nThe  significant  areas  of  estimation  and/or  judgment  considered  by  management  in  preparing  the consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates (note 2.2(l)) ;\n- \u00b7 impairment of non-financial assets (note 2.2(p)) ;\n- \u00b7 rehabilitation provisions and contingencies (note 2.2(q)) ;\n- \u00b7 revenue recognition related to toll smelting arrangements (note 2.2(t)) ; and\n- \u00b7 deferred income tax assets and liabilities (note 2.2(w)) .\n\n## (c) Presentation and functional currency\n\nThe  Company's  presentation  currency  is  the  U.S.  dollar  and  the  functional  currency  of  DPM  and  its consolidated  subsidiaries  is  the  U.S.  dollar  as  it  was  assessed  by  management  as  being  the  primary currency of the economic environment in which the Company operates.",

Non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rates on the dates that their fair values  are  determined.  Non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  that  are measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. Income and expense items are translated at the exchange rate on the dates of the transactions. Exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of these amounts are included in net earnings (loss), except those arising on the translation of equity instruments that are fair valued through other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nForeign operations are comprised of subsidiaries of the Company that have a functional currency other than  the  U.S.  dollar.  The  assets  and  liabilities  of  foreign  operations,  including  fair  value  adjustments arising  on  acquisition,  are  translated  into  U.S.  dollars  at  exchange  rates  on  the  reporting  date.  The income  and  expenses  of  foreign  operations  are  translated  into  U.S.  dollars  at  exchange  rates  on  the dates  of  the  transactions.  Foreign  currency  differences  are  recognized  as  currency  translation adjustments  in  other  comprehensive  income  (loss). Accumulated  currency  translation  adjustments  are reclassified to net earnings (loss) upon the disposal of the associated foreign operation when the gain or loss on disposal is recognized.\n\n## (e) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash deposits, guaranteed investment certificates ('GICs') and/or other highly rated and liquid securities with an original maturity of less than three months. As at December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents comprised of cash at banks of $490.3 million (December 31, 2022 $383.4  million)  and  GICs  of  $105.0  million  (December  31,  2022  -  $49.8  million)  in  the  consolidated statements of financial position.\n\n## (f) Inventories\n\nInventories of ore and concentrate are measured and valued at the lower of average production cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of the concentrate in the ordinary course of business based on the prevailing metal prices on the reporting date, less estimated costs to complete production and to bring the concentrate to sale. Production costs that are inventoried include the costs directly related to bringing the inventory to its current condition and location, such as materials, labour,  other  direct  costs  (including  external  services  and  depreciation,  depletion  and  amortization), production related overheads and royalties.\n\nInventories of sulphuric acid, arsenic calcines, spare parts, supplies and other materials are valued at the lower  of  average  cost  and  net  realizable  value.  Obsolete,  redundant  and  slow  moving  inventories  are identified  at  each  reporting  date  and  written  down  to  their  net  realizable  values.  Arsenic  calcines  not expected to be processed in the next 12 months are classified as long-term inventory and included in other long-term assets.",

The Company determines the classification of financial assets at the time of initial recognition based on the Company's business model and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nAll financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not at FVPL, directly  attributable  transaction  costs  on  the  trade  date  at  which  the  Company  becomes  a  party  to  the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nFinancial  assets  with  embedded  derivatives  are  considered  in  their  entirety  when  determining  their classification  at  FVPL  or  at  amortized  cost.  The  Company  has  classified  accounts  receivable  on provisionally  priced  sales  as  financial  assets  measured  at  FVPL.  Other  accounts  receivable  held  for collection of contractual cash flows are measured at amortized cost.\n\n## Subsequent measurement - Financial assets at FVPL\n\nFinancial assets measured at FVPL include financial assets management intends to sell in the short term and  any  derivative  financial  instrument  that  is  not  designated  as  a  hedging  instrument  in  a  hedge relationship. Financial assets measured at FVPL are carried at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position with changes in fair value recognized in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). The Company's investment in warrants, embedded derivatives, accounts receivable on provisionally priced sales and foreign exchange forward contracts not related to hedging activities are classified as financial assets at FVPL.\n\n## Subsequent measurement - Financial assets at FVOCI\n\nFinancial assets measured at FVOCI are non-derivative financial assets that are not held for trading and the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to measure the assets at FVOCI. The Company's investments in publicly traded equity securities are classified as financial assets at FVOCI.\n\nAfter initial measurement, investments measured at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with unrealized  gains  or  losses  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  in  the  consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\n## Subsequent measurement - Financial assets at amortized cost\n\nFinancial  assets  measured  at  amortized  cost  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  that  are  held  for collection  of  contractual  cash  flows,  where  those  cash  flows  represent  repayments  of  principal  and interest. The Company's other accounts receivable is classified as financial assets at amortized cost.\n\nDividends  from  all  financial  assets  are  recognized  in  other  income  and  expense  in  the  consolidated statements of earnings (loss) when the right to receive the dividend is established.",

The Company has elected to apply the simplified approach to impairment as permitted by IFRS 9, Financial Instruments , which requires the expected lifetime loss to be recognized at the time of initial recognition of the receivable. To measure estimated credit losses, accounts receivable have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics, including the number of days past due. An impairment loss is reversed in subsequent periods if the amount of the expected loss decreases and the decrease can be objectively related to an event occurring after the initial impairment was recognized.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortized cost, unless they are required to be measured at FVPL as is  the  case  for  held  for  trading  or  derivative  instruments,  or  the  Company  has  opted  to  measure  the financial  liability  at  FVPL.  The  Company's  financial  liabilities  include  accounts  payable  and  accrued liabilities, which are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nA  financial  liability  is  derecognized  when  the  obligation  under  the  liability  is  discharged,  cancelled  or expires  with  any  associated  gain  or  loss  recognized  in  other  income  and  expense  in  the  consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\n## (h) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the dates they are entered into and are subsequently re-measured  at  their  fair  value  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period.  The  method  of  recognizing  the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.\n\nFor a derivative instrument to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company documents at the inception of the  transaction  the  relationship  between  a  hedging  instrument  and  hedged  item,  as  well  as  its  risk management  objectives  and  strategy  for  undertaking  the  hedging  transaction.  The  Company  also documents its assessment, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative used to hedge an underlying exposure is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item.\n\nThe  full  fair  value  of  a  hedging  derivative  is  classified  as  a  non-current  asset  or  liability  when  the remaining maturity is more than 12 months.",

For hedges  of  operating  expenses,  the  accumulated  fair  value  change  initially  recognized  in  other comprehensive  income  (loss)  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  comprehensive  income  (loss)  is subsequently recognized in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) in the period when  the  underlying  hedged  operating  expenses  occur.  For  hedges  of  capital  expenditures,  the accumulated  fair  value  change  initially  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  in  the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) is subsequently included in the carrying value of the underlying assets hedged in the period the underlying hedged capital expenditures occur.\n\nThe time value, which forms a component of these foreign exchange option contracts, is treated as a separate cost of hedging. As a result, any unrealized fair value change in the time value component of the outstanding foreign exchange option contracts is initially recognized as a deferred cost of hedging in other comprehensive  income  (loss)  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  comprehensive  income  (loss).  The accumulated cost of hedging is subsequently recognized in cost of sales or included in the carrying value of  the  underlying  assets  hedged  in  the  period  the  underlying  hedged  operating  expenses  or  capital expenditures occur.\n\n## Commodity swap contracts designated as fair value hedges\n\nThe Company designates the spot component of commodity swap contracts to hedge the metal price exposure  associated  with  the  time  lag  between  the  provisional  and  final  determination  of  concentrate sales ('QP Hedges') as a fair value hedge.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in fair value of the spot component of these commodity swap contracts are recognized in revenue in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss), together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged accounts receivable on the provisionally priced sales.\n\nThe forward point component of these commodity swap contracts is accounted for separately as a cost of hedging. As a result, any change in the fair value of the forward point component is recognized in revenue in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nWhen a  hedging  instrument  expires,  or  is  sold  or  terminated,  or  when  a  hedge  no  longer  meets  the criteria  for  cash  flow  hedge  accounting,  the  accumulated  deferred  gains  or  losses  remain  in  other comprehensive income (loss) until the period the underlying transaction that was hedged occurs at which point they are reclassified and recognized in revenue in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). If the underlying hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the accumulated gains or losses that were  initially  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  are  immediately  reclassified  to  other income and expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nThe gains or losses relating  to  the  ineffective  portion  of  all  cash  flow  or  fair  value  hedges,  if  any,  are recognized immediately in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\n## (i) Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.",

Such techniques may include using recent arm's length transactions; reference to the current fair  value  of  another  instrument  that  is  substantially  the  same;  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  or  other valuation  models. These valuation models require the use of assumptions, including future stock price volatility and probability of exercise.\n\nChanges  in  the  underlying  assumptions  could  materially  impact  the  Company's  investments  at  FVPL. Further details on measurement of the fair values of financial instruments are provided in note 7 .\n\n## (k) Mineral exploration and evaluation expenditures\n\nExploration and evaluation activities involve the search for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, the assessment  of  technical  and  operational  feasibility  and  the  determination  of  an  identified  Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve's commercial viability. Once the legal right to explore has been acquired, exploration and evaluation expenditures are expensed as incurred until economic production is probable. Exploration expenditures in areas where there is a reasonable expectation to convert existing estimated Mineral Resources to estimated Mineral Reserves or to add additional Mineral Resources with additional drilling  and  evaluations  in  areas  near  existing  Mineral  Resources  or  Mineral  Reserves  and  existing  or planned production facilities, are capitalized.\n\nExploration properties that contain Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, but for which a development decision has not yet been made, are subject to periodic review for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the project's carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nExploration and evaluation assets are reclassified to 'Mine Properties - Mines under construction' when the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting the Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves are  demonstrable  and  construction  has  commenced  or  a  decision  to  construct  has  been  made. Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  assessed  for  impairment  before  reclassification  to  'Mines  under construction', and the impairment charge, if any, is recognized through net earnings (loss).\n\nThe application of the Company's accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditures requires judgment in determining whether it is probable that future economic benefits will be generated from the exploitation of an exploration and evaluation asset when activities have not yet reached a stage where a reasonable  assessment  of  the  existence  of  Mineral  Reserves  can  be  determined.  The  estimation  of Mineral Resources is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates regarding economic  and  geological  data  and  these  assumptions  and  estimates  impact  the  decision  to  either expense or capitalize exploration and evaluation expenditures. Management is required to make certain estimates  and  assumptions  about  future  events  and  circumstances  in  order  to  determine  if  an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any revision to any of these assumptions and estimates could result in the impairment of the capitalized exploration and evaluation costs. If new information  becomes  available  after  expenditures  have  been  capitalized  that  the  recovery  of  these expenditures  is  no  longer  probable,  the  expenditures  capitalized  are  written  down  to  the  recoverable amount and charged to net earnings (loss) in the period the new information becomes available.",

All expenditures related to the construction of mine declines and ore body access, including mine shafts and ventilation raises, are considered to be capital development and are capitalized. Expenses incurred after reaching the ore body are regarded as operating development costs and are included in the cost of ore hoisted.\n\nUpon  the  commencement  of  commercial  production,  all  related  assets  included  in  'Mines  under construction' are reclassified to 'Mine Properties - Producing mines' or 'Property, plant and equipment'. Determination of commencement of commercial production is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates. The commencement of commercial production is defined as the date when the  mine  is  capable  of  operating  in  the  manner  intended  by  management.  The  Company  considers primarily  the  following  factors,  among  others,  when  determining  the  commencement  of  commercial production:\n\n- \u00b7 All major capital expenditures to achieve a consistent level of production and desired capacity have been incurred;\n- \u00b7 A reasonable period of testing of the mine plant and equipment has been completed;\n- \u00b7 A predetermined percentage of design capacity of the mine and mill has been reached; and\n- \u00b7 Required production levels, grades and recoveries have been achieved.\n\n## Mine Properties - Producing mines\n\nAll  assets  reclassified  from  'Mines  under  construction'  to  'Producing  mines'  are  stated  at  cost  less accumulated depletion and accumulated impairment charges. Costs incurred for the acquisition of land are stated at cost.\n\nThe initial cost of a producing mine comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing it to a working condition for its intended use, the initial estimate of the rehabilitation costs,  and  for  qualifying  assets,  applicable  borrowing  costs  during  construction. The  purchase  price  or construction  cost  is  the  aggregate  amount  of  cash  consideration  paid  and  the  fair  value  of  any  other consideration given to acquire the asset.\n\nWhen a mine construction project moves into production, the capitalization of certain mine construction costs ceases, and from that point on, costs are either regarded as inventory costs or expensed as cost of sales, except for costs related to mine additions or improvements, open pit stripping activities that provide a future benefit, and underground mine development or mineable reserve development, which qualify for capitalization.\n\n## Depletion\n\nThe depletion of a producing mine asset is based on the unit-of-production method over the estimated economic life of the related deposit.",

The Company prepares its Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates based on information related to the geological data on the size, depth and shape of the ore body  which  is  compiled  by  appropriately  qualified  persons.  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserve estimates are based upon factors such as metal prices, capital requirements, production costs, foreign exchange rates, geotechnical and geological assumptions and judgments made in estimating the size and grade  of  the  ore  body.  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral  Reserve  estimates,  together  with  forecast production,  determine  the  life  of  mine  estimates  and  therefore  changes  in  the  Mineral  Resource  or Mineral  Reserve  estimates  may  impact  the  carrying  value  of  exploration  and  evaluation  assets (note 2.2(k)) , mine properties, property, plant and equipment (note 2.2(m)), depletion and depreciation charges (note 2.2(m)), rehabilitation provisions (note 2.2(q)), and deferred income tax assets (note 2.2(w)).\n\n## (m) Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated impairment charges.\n\nThe initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing it to a working condition for its intended use, the initial estimate of the rehabilitation  costs,  and  for  qualifying  assets,  applicable  borrowing  costs  during  construction.  The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount of cash consideration paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. Where an item of property, plant and equipment is comprised  of  significant  components  with  different  useful  lives,  the  components  are  accounted  for  as separate items of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets relating to leases are also included in property, plant and equipment (note 2.2(r)) .\n\n## Depreciation\n\nThe depreciation of property, plant and equipment related to a mine is based on the unit-of-production method over the estimated economic life of the related deposit, except in the case of an asset whose estimated useful life is less than the life of the deposit, in which case the asset is depreciated over its estimated  useful  life  based  on  the  straight-line  method.  For  all  other  property,  plant  and  equipment, depreciation is based on the estimated useful life of the asset on a straight-line basis. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in a capitalized exploration or development project is capitalized to the project.\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment, which are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, is as follows:\n\n| Asset Category          | Estimated useful life  (Years)   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Buildings               | 10 - 20                          |\n| Machinery and Equipment | 3 - 20                           |\n| Vehicles                | 5                                |\n| Computer Hardware       | 2 - 4                            |\n| Office Equipment        | 3 - 10                           |\n\nConstruction work-in-progress includes property, plant and equipment in the course of construction and is carried at cost less any recognized impairment charge. These assets are reclassified to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment and depreciation of these assets commences when they are completed and ready for their intended use.",

Any  gain  or  loss  arising  on  derecognition  of  the  asset,  calculated  as  the  difference  between  the  net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.\n\nThe residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of all assets are reviewed at each financial year  end  and  are  adjusted  prospectively,  if  appropriate.  Significant  judgment  is  involved  in  the determination of estimated residual values and useful lives. The actual residual values and useful lives may differ from current estimates.\n\nDepreciation of mine specific assets is based on the unit-of-production method. The life of these assets is assessed annually with regard to both their anticipated useful life and the present assessments of the economically recoverable reserves and resources of the mine property where these assets are located. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable reserves and resources. Any changes to these calculations based on new information are accounted for prospectively.\n\nRates of depreciation and, in turn, the annual depreciation expense could therefore be materially affected by  changes  in  underlying  estimates.  Changes  in  estimates  can  be  the  result  of  differences  in  actual production or changes in forecast future production, changes in Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves through exploration activities, differences between estimated and actual costs of mining and differences in metal prices used in the estimation of Mineral Reserves.\n\n## Major maintenance and repairs\n\nExpenditures on major maintenance include the cost of replacing part of an asset and overhaul costs. When part of an asset is being replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the replacement or overhauled item will flow to the Company through an extended life, the expenditure is capitalized as a separate asset and the carrying amount of the replaced part is written off.\n\n## (n) Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets include software, exploration and software licences and long-term customer contracts.\n\nIntangible assets acquired are measured upon initial recognition at cost, which comprises the purchase price plus any costs directly attributable to the preparation of the asset for its intended use. Identifiable intangible assets acquired through business combinations are initially recognized at fair value as at the date of acquisition.\n\nResearch expenditures are recognized as an expense as incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of an identifiable software product are capitalized and recognized as an intangible asset.\n\nIntangible  assets  are  carried  at  cost  less  accumulated  amortization  and  any  accumulated  impairment charges and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\n\nThe amortization periods applicable to intangible assets over their estimated useful lives are as follows:\n\n| Asset Category                    | Estimated useful life  (Years)   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Computer Software                 | 3 - 5                            |\n| Exploration and Software Licences | 3 - 5                            |",

The amortization expense attributable to an intangible asset is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) in the applicable expense category to which the intangible asset relates.\n\nThe  gain  or  loss  arising  from  the  derecognition  of  an  intangible  asset  is  measured  as  the  difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.\n\n## (o) Assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current assets or assets in a disposal group that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as assets held for sale. For this to be the case, the asset or a disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets or disposal groups and its sale must be highly probable.\n\nA disposal group is a group of assets which the Company intends to dispose of in a single transaction. These  assets  are  measured  at  the  lower  of  their  carrying  amount  and  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell. Impairment  charges  on  initial  classification  as  held  for  sale  and  subsequent  gains  or  losses  on  remeasurement are recognized in net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations. The reversal  of  any previously  recognized  impairment  charge  cannot  exceed  the  carrying  amount  that  would  have  been determined had no impairment charge been recognized for the asset held for sale.\n\nAssets and liabilities in a disposal group are classified as held for sale and are presented separately in the consolidated statements of financial position.\n\nThe measurement of assets held for sale requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the carrying  value  and  its  recoverability  through  sale. Actual  sale  proceeds  may  differ  materially  from  the carrying value.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Company that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a separate line of business or geographical area of operations. The operating results  and  cash  flows  of  discontinued  operations  are  presented  separately  in  the  consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and cash flows.\n\n## (p) Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the carrying values of mine properties, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment  are  assessed  for  impairment  if  indicators  of  potential  impairment  exist.  If  any  indication  of potential impairment exists, an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount is calculated. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal ('FVLCD') and its value in use based on discounted cash flows. This is determined on an asset-by-asset basis, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If this is the case, individual assets are grouped together into a Cash Generating Unit ('CGU') for impairment purposes. Such CGUs represent the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. Management has assessed the Company's CGUs as being an individual operating site.\n\nIf  the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount with the corresponding impairment being charged to earnings  (loss)  in  the  period  of  impairment.  Impairment  charge  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated statements of earnings (loss) in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.",

If a change has occurred, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount for the previously impaired asset or CGU. A previously recognized  impairment  charge  is  reversed  only  if  there  has  been  a  change  in  the  estimates  used  to determine the asset or CGU's recoverable amount since the last impairment charge was recognized. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to its newly determined recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of  depreciation  and  amortization,  had  no  impairment  charge  been  recognized  for  the  asset  or  CGU  in prior years.\n\nThe assessment of impairment is based on a number of external and internal factors, some of which are outside of the Company's control, and requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to these factors  for  each  CGU.  External  factors  include  market  considerations  ranging  from  overall  economic activity and the supply of and demand for the materials used in and products produced by the Company to  changes  in  commodity  prices,  toll  rates,  discount  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates  and  regulatory requirements.  Internal  factors  include  considerations  such  as  production  volume,  ability  to  convert resources  into  reserves,  capital  and  operating  expenditures,  and  future  development  and  expansion plans.\n\nThese  significant  estimates  and  assumptions,  some  of  which  may  be  subjective,  require  that management  make  decisions  based  on  the  best  available  information  at  each  reporting  period.  It  is possible  that  the  actual  recoverable  amount  could  be  significantly  different  than  those  estimates.  A significant decline in the asset's market value, reductions in metal price forecasts, increases in estimated future  costs  of  production,  increases  in  estimated  future  capital  costs,  reductions  in  the  amount  of recoverable reserves, resources and exploration potential, and/or adverse market conditions can result in a  write-down  of  the  carrying  amounts  of  the  Company's  assets.  Judgment  is  also  required  when considering whether significant changes in any of these items indicate a previous impairment may have reversed.\n\n## (q) Provisions and contingencies\n\n## General\n\nProvisions are recognized when: a) the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; and b) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made for the amount of the obligation. Where  some  or  all  of  the  expenditure  required  to  settle  a  provision  is  expected  to  be  reimbursed  by another party, the reimbursement shall be recognized when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be  received  if  the  Company  settles  the  obligation.  The  reimbursement  shall  be  treated  as  a  separate asset. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pretax discount rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision as a result of the passage of time is recognized in finance cost in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nA  contingent  liability  is  not  recognized  in  the  case  where  no  reliable  estimate  can  be  made;  however, disclosure is required unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. By its nature, a contingent liability will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail  to  occur.  The  assessment  of  a  contingent  liability  inherently  involves  the  exercise  of  significant judgment and estimates of the outcome of future events.",

The  Company  recognizes  a  liability  for  its  rehabilitation obligations in the period when a legal and/or constructive obligation is identified. The liability is measured at the present value of the estimated costs required to rehabilitate operating locations based on the risk free  nominal  discount  rates  that  are  specific  to  the  countries  in  which  the  operations  are  located.  A corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related asset is recorded and depreciated in the same manner as the related asset.\n\nThe  nature  of  these  restoration  and  rehabilitation  activities  includes:  i)  dismantling  and  removing structures; ii) rehabilitating mines and tailing dams; iii) dismantling operating facilities; iv) closure of plant and waste sites; and v) restoration, reclamation and re-vegetation of affected areas. Other environmental costs incurred at the operating sites, such as environmental monitoring, water management and waste management costs, are charged to profit or loss when incurred.\n\nThe  liability  is  accreted  over  time  to  its  expected  future  settlement  value.  The  accretion  expense  is recognized in finance costs in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nThe Company assesses its rehabilitation provisions at each reporting date. The rehabilitation liability and related assets are adjusted at each reporting date for changes in the discount rates and in the estimated amount,  timing  and  cost  of  the  work  to  be  carried  out. Any  reduction  in  the  rehabilitation  liability  and therefore any deduction in the related rehabilitation asset may not exceed the carrying amount of that asset. If it does, any excess over the carrying value is immediately credited to profit or loss.\n\nSignificant  estimates  and  assumptions  are  made  by  management  in  determining  the  nature  and  costs associated with the rehabilitation liability. The estimates and assumptions required include estimates of the  timing,  extent  and  costs  of  rehabilitation  activities,  technology  changes,  regulatory  changes,  and changes in the discount and inflation rates. These uncertainties may result in future expenditures being different from the amounts currently provided.\n\n## (r) Leases\n\nThe determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the agreement on the inception date.\n\nAs  a  lessee,  the  Company  recognizes  a  lease  obligation  and  a  right-of-use  asset  in  the  consolidated statements of financial position on a present-value basis at the date when the leased asset is available for use.  Each  lease  payment  is  apportioned  between  a  finance  charge  and  a  reduction  of  the  lease obligation. Finance charges are recognized in finance costs in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).  The  right-of-use  asset  is  included  in  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  is  depreciated  over  the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nLease obligations are initially measured at the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees;\n- \u00b7 the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00b7 payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising that option.\n\nLease  payments  are  discounted  using  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease,  or  if  this  rate  cannot  be determined, the Company's incremental borrowing rate.",

Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise primarily small equipment.\n\n## (s) Share capital\n\nCommon shares issued by DPM are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares are recognized in equity as a deduction from the share proceeds. Costs to repurchase and cancel the Company's shares are recognized as a reduction in share capital to the extent of its book value. The excess of the purchase price over the book value is recognized as a reduction in contributed surplus to the extent of available surplus and any further excess is recognized as a reduction in retained earnings in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity.\n\n## (t) Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from the sale of concentrate containing gold, copper and silver is recognized when control has been transferred, which is considered to occur when products have been delivered and the significant risks  of  loss  have  been  transferred  to  the  buyer. Revenue  is  measured  based  on  the  consideration specified in the contract.\n\nRevenue from the sale of concentrate is initially recorded based on a provisional value which is a function of prevailing market prices, estimated weights and grades less smelter and other commercial deductions. Under the terms of the concentrate sales contracts, the final metal price for the payable metal is based on a predetermined quotational period of London Metal Exchange and London Bullion Market daily prices. The price  of  the  concentrate  is  the  sum  of  the  metal  payments  less  the  sum  of  specified  deductions, including  treatment  and  refining  charges,  penalties  for  deleterious  elements,  and  freight.  The  terms  of these contracts result in embedded derivatives because of the timing difference between the prevailing metal prices for provisional payments and the actual contractual metal prices used for final settlement. These embedded derivatives are adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period through to the date of final price determination with any adjustments recognized in revenue.\n\nAny  adjustments  to  the  amount  receivable  for  each  shipment  on  the  settlement  date,  caused  by  final assay results, are adjusted through revenue at the time of determination.\n\nRevenue  from  processing  concentrate  is  recognized  when  the  concentrate  has  been  smelted  and  is based on the toll rate specified in the toll agreement, which can vary based on the composition of the concentrate processed and prevailing market conditions at the time the agreement was entered. Under each toll  agreement, Tsumeb  incurs  a  carrying  charge  in  respect  of  the  concentrate  it  processes  until blister copper is delivered. This carrying charge is recorded as a reduction of revenue.",

('IXM'). These adjustments represent metal exposure and are calculated by comparing (i) the copper, gold and silver  content  in  the  concentrate  received  and  processed  by  Tsumeb  multiplied  by  the  percentage accountable in the IXM contract to (ii) the accountable copper, gold and silver in the blister delivered to IXM and in the in-circuit material still being processed by Tsumeb. Many aspects of the metal exposure are  subject  to  estimation,  including  the  amount  of  metal  contained  in  concentrate  received,  in-circuit material and blister delivered where final assays have not been completed. These significant estimates are based on the Company's process knowledge, joint surveys with IXM and multiple assay results, the final results of which could differ from initial estimates.\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  sulphuric  acid,  a  by-product  from  processing  concentrate  at  the  Tsumeb smelter, is measured at the price specified in the sales contract and is recognized when the control has been transferred, which is considered to occur when the products have been delivered to the location specified in the sales contract and the risk of loss has been transferred to the buyer.\n\n## (u) Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly related to the acquisition and the construction of a qualifying capital asset are capitalized  and  added  to  the  cost  of  the  asset  until  such  time  as  the  asset  is  considered  substantially ready  for  its  intended  use.  Where  funds  are  borrowed  specifically  to  finance  a  project,  the  amount capitalized represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where funds used to finance a project form part  of  general  borrowings,  the  amount  capitalized  is  calculated  using  the  weighted  average  cost applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Company during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## (v) Share-based compensation transactions\n\n## Equity-settled transactions\n\nStock options are granted to directors and selected employees to buy common shares of the Company. Stock options vest equally over a three-year period and expire five years from the date of grant. Grants of stock  options  are  based  on  the  five-day  volume  weighted  average  price  ('Market  Price')  of  DPM's common shares on the TSX the day before the effective grant date and reflect the Company's estimate of the  number  of  awards  that  will  ultimately  vest.  Stock  options  are  measured  on  the  date  of  grant  by reference to the fair value determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model, further details of which are given in note 17. The value is recognized as a general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and an increase to contributed surplus in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled.\n\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding stock options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.",

The DSUs are paid in cash following separation of a director from the Company based on the closing price of DPM's common shares on the applicable redemption date as elected by the director. The cost of the DSUs is measured initially at fair value based on the closing price of DPM's common shares preceding the day the DSUs are granted. The cost of the DSUs is recognized as a liability under share-based compensation liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position and as a general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). The liability is remeasured to fair value based on the Market Price of DPM's common shares at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with  changes  in  fair  value  recognized  in  general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the  consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nA  Share  Unit  ('SU')  Plan  was  established  for  directors,  certain  employees  and  eligible  contractors ('Participant')  of  DPM  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  in  consideration  of  past  services  to  the Company.\n\nUnder this plan, the Board of Directors may, at its sole discretion, (i) grant non-performance based SUs, referred to as restricted share units ('RSUs') and SUs with a performance-based component, referred to as performance share units ('PSUs'), subject to performance conditions to be achieved by the Company; and (ii) determine the entitlement date or dates of such RSUs and PSUs. Non-performance based RSUs vest equally over a three-year period and are paid in cash based on the Market Price of DPM's publicly traded common shares on the entitlement date or dates. PSUs vest after three years from the grant date and are paid in cash based on the Market Price of DPM's common shares, subject to performance criteria established by the Board of Directors on the entitlement date or dates.\n\nThe cost of the RSUs and PSUs is measured initially at fair value on the grant date based on the Market Price  of  DPM's  common  shares  preceding  the  effective  grant  date.  The  cost  of  RSUs  and  PSUs  is recognized as a liability under share-based compensation liabilities, with the current portion recognized in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, in the consolidated statements of financial position and as an expense  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  (loss)  over  the  vesting  period.  The  liability  is remeasured to fair value based on the Market Price of DPM's common shares and, in the case of PSUs, subject  to  performance  criteria,  at  each  reporting  date  up  to  and  including  the  settlement  date,  with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\n## (w) Income taxes\n\n## Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities on the taxable loss or income for the period. The tax rates and tax laws used  to  compute  the  amount  are  those  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  by  the  end  of  the  reporting period.\n\nCurrent income tax assets and current income tax liabilities are only offset if a legally enforceable right exists to offset the amounts and the Company intends to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.",

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be generated in future periods to utilize these deductible temporary differences.\n\nThe following temporary differences do not result in deferred income tax assets or liabilities:\n\n- \u00b7 The initial recognition of assets or liabilities, not arising from a business combination, that does not affect accounting or taxable profit;\n- \u00b7 Initial recognition of goodwill, if any; and\n- \u00b7 Investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities where the timing of the reversal of temporary differences can be controlled and reversal in the foreseeable future is not probable.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable  that  future  taxable  income  will  be  generated  to  allow  the  deferred  income  tax  asset  to  be recovered.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the period when the asset is expected to be realized or the liability is expected to be settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to offset current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\n\nCurrent and deferred income taxes related to items recognized directly in equity are recognized in equity and not in profit or loss. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations  in  which  applicable  tax  regulations  are  subject  to  interpretation  and  establishes  provisions where appropriate.\n\nJudgment  is  required  in  determining  whether  deferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognized  on  the consolidated statements of financial  position.  Deferred  income  tax  assets,  including  those  arising  from unutilized tax losses, require management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate future taxable income in order to utilize the deferred income tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations or other activities and the application of existing tax laws in  each  jurisdiction.  To  the  extent  that  future  cash  flows  and  taxable  income  differ  significantly  from estimates,  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  realize  the  net  deferred  income  tax  assets  recorded  on  the reporting date could be impacted.\n\nAdditionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates could impact tax deductions in future periods and the value of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\n\n## (x) Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period.",

The  number  of  additional  shares  for  inclusion  in  diluted  earnings  per  share  is  determined  using  the treasury  stock  method,  whereby  stock  options  and  warrants,  whose  exercise  price  is  less  than  the average market price of the Company's common shares, are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period with proceeds based on the average market price for the period.

AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE OSINO RESOURCES CORP. ('OSINO')\n\nOn December 18, 2023, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement whereby DPM will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Osino (the \"Osino Shares\") for consideration consisting of Cdn$0.775 in cash per Osino Share and 0.0801 of a DPM common share per Osino Share. The  principal  assets  of  Osino  are  comprised  of  the  Twin  Hills  open  pit  gold  project,  as  well  as  an extensive exploration portfolio, in Namibia. The acquisition of Osino is subject to the approval of Osino's securityholders  as  well  as  applicable  regulatory  approvals,  including  approval  under  the  Namibia Competition Act. In addition, each of DPM and Osino has the right to terminate the transaction in certain circumstances. Provided that all approvals are obtained and neither party exercises its right to terminate, the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2024.\n\nConcurrently  with  the  transaction,  DPM  agreed  to  purchase  an  aggregate  of  Cdn$10  million  Osino Shares, in two equal tranches at a price of Cdn$1.13 per share pursuant to a private placement.

Foreign  exchange  option  contracts  are  entered  into  to  provide  price  protection below a specified 'floor' rate and participation up to a specified 'ceiling' rate. The option contracts entered into  are  comprised  of  a  series  of  call  options  and  put  options  (which  when  combined  create  a  price 'collar') that are structured so as to provide for a zero upfront cash cost.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange option contracts in respect of a  portion  of  its  projected  Namibian  dollar  (\"NAD\")  operating  expenses  which  are  linked  to  the  South African Rand ('ZAR') as summarized in the table below:\n\n| Year of projected  operating expenses   | Amount hedged  in ZAR   | Call options sold  Weighted average   | Put options purchased  Weighted average   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                         | (i)                     | ceiling rate US$/ZAR                  | floor rate US$/ZAR                        |\n| 2024                                    | 964,081,956             | 20.24                                 | 17.94                                     |",

The time value component of foreign exchange option contracts is treated as a separate cost of hedging.\n\nThe fair  value  gain  or  loss  on  these  outstanding  contracts  was  calculated  based  on  foreign  exchange forward rates quoted in the market. As at December 31, 2023, the net fair value gain on all outstanding foreign  exchange  option  contracts  was  $0.8  million,  which  was  included  in  assets  held  for  sale. As  at December 31, 2022, the net fair value loss of $1.8 million was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\n\nThe  Company  recognized  realized  losses  of  $3.8  million  (2022  -  $1.1  million)  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2023 in net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations on the spot component of settled contracts.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized unrealized losses of $3.3 million (2022 - $1.5 million) in other comprehensive income (loss) on the spot component of the outstanding foreign exchange option contracts. The Company also recognized unrealized gains of $2.0 million (2022 - $0.1 million)  on  the  time  value  component  of  the  outstanding  foreign  exchange  option  contracts  in  other comprehensive income (loss) as a deferred cost of hedging.\n\n## Effects of hedge accounting\n\nHedge  effectiveness  is  determined  at  the  inception  of  the  hedge  relationship,  and  through  periodic prospective  effectiveness  assessments  to  ensure  that  an  economic  relationship  exists  between  the hedged items (the Company's accounts receivable on provisionally priced sales, projected payable metal production,  and  projected  operating  expenses  and  capital  expenditures  denominated  in  foreign currencies) and the hedging instruments (commodity swap contracts and foreign exchange forward and option contracts). The hedges are effective when the critical terms of the hedging instrument match with the critical terms of the hedged item.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\n\n- \u00b7 Differences  in  the  timing  and/or  amount  of  the  cash  flows  of  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging instrument; and\n- \u00b7 Fair value movements related to counterparty credit risk, which impact the hedging instrument and the hedged item differently.\n\nThe Company's hedging relationships are such that the ratio between the underlying hedged item and the hedging  instrument  is  1:1.  To  measure  for  potential  hedge  ineffectiveness,  the  Company  compares change in the fair value of the hedging instrument to change in the fair value of the underlying hedged item.",

DEBT\n\n## (a) DPM Revolving Credit Facility\n\nDPM has a committed revolving credit facility (the 'RCF') with a consortium of four banks that matures in July 2026, and is secured by pledges of DPM's investments in Ada Tepe, Chelopech and the Loma Larga gold  project  and  by  guarantees  from  each  of  the  subsidiaries  that  hold  these  assets.  Initially,  DPM  is permitted  to  borrow  up  to  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $150.0  million,  which  can  be  increased pursuant to an accordion feature that permits, subject to certain conditions, the facility to be increased to $250.0 million. The cost of borrowing is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR'), plus a spread,  which  is  currently  2.25%,  and  can  range  between  2.25%  and  3.50%  depending  upon  DPM's leverage. The RCF contains financial covenants that require DPM to maintain: (i) a Debt Leverage Ratio below  3.75:1,  and  (ii)  a  minimum  net  worth  equal  to  $600  million  plus  (minus)  50%  of  ongoing  net earnings (loss) plus 50% of all equity raised by DPM, in each case, after March 31, 2022, and as defined under the RCF.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023 and 2022, DPM was in compliance with all financial covenants and $nil was drawn under the RCF.\n\n## (b) Other credit agreements and guarantees\n\nChelopech and Ada Tepe have a $21.0 million multi-purpose credit facility that matures on November 30, 2024 and is guaranteed by DPM. As at December 31, 2023, $18.6 million (December 31, 2022 - $17.3 million) had been utilized in the form of letters of credit and letters of guarantee, primarily in respect of concession contracts with the Bulgarian Ministry of Energy.\n\nChelopech  and Ada  Tepe  also  have  a  Euro  21.0  million  ($23.2  million)  credit  facility  to  support  mine closure  and  rehabilitation  obligations  in  respect  of  concession  contracts  with  the  Bulgarian  Ministry  of Energy. This credit facility matures on November 30, 2024 and is guaranteed by DPM. As at December 31, 2023, $23.2 million (December 31, 2022 - $22.5 million) had been utilized in the form of letters of guarantee.\n\nAda Tepe also has a $10.3 million multi-purpose credit facility that matures on November 30, 2024 and is guaranteed by DPM. As at December 31, 2023, $1.6 million (December 31, 2022 - $0.2 million) had been utilized in the form of letters of credit and letters of guarantee, primarily in respect of exploration contracts with the Bulgarian Ministry of Energy.\n\nAdvances under these facilities  bear  interest  at  a  rate  equal  to  the  one  month  SOFR  plus  2.5%.  The letters of credit and guarantee bear a fee of 0.6% based on the amounts issued.",

Pursuant to the plan, the exercise price of the stock option cannot be less than the Market Price of DPM's common shares on the trading date preceding the effective date of the stock option grant. The aggregate number of shares that can be issued from treasury under this plan is 12,500,000. Stock options granted vest equally over a three-year period and expire five years from the date of grant.\n\nDuring  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  the  Company  granted  264,250  (2022  -  649,468)  stock options with a fair value of $0.7 million (2022 - $1.1 million). The estimated value of the stock options granted  will  be  recognized  as  an  expense  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  (loss)  and  an addition to contributed surplus in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity over the vesting period. The Company recorded stock option expenses of $0.9 million (2022 - $1.1 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023 under this stock option plan.\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2023,  there  was  $0.6  million  (December  31,  2022  -  $0.8  million)  of  expenses remaining to be charged to net earnings in future periods relating to unvested stock options.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  options  granted  was  estimated  using  the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model.  The expected volatility is estimated based on the historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values at the time the options were granted were as follows:\n\n|                                   | 2023   | 2022           |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|----------------|\n| Five year risk free interest rate | 3.1%   | 2.4% - 3.3%    |\n| Expected life in years            | 5.00   | 4.75           |\n| Expected volatility               | 47.32% | 45.7% - 46.78% |\n| Dividends per share               | 0.16   | 0.16           |",

COMMITMENTS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\n\n## (a) Commitments\n\nThe  Company  had  the  following  minimum  contractual  commitments  from  continuing  operations  as  at December 31, 2023:\n\n|                      | up to 1 year   | 1 - 5 years   | Total   |\n|----------------------|----------------|---------------|---------|\n| Capital commitments  | 6,431          | -             | 6,431   |\n| Purchase commitments | 12,315         | 4             | 12,319  |\n| Total commitments    | 18,746         | 4             | 18,750  |\n\n## (b) Contingencies\n\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings, from time to time, arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  its business. It is not expected that any material liability will arise from current legal proceedings or have a material adverse effect on the Company's future business, operations or financial condition.\n\n## 27. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Company's principal financial liabilities comprise accounts payable and accrued liabilities and longterm  debt.  The  main  purpose  of  these  financial  instruments  is  to  assist  with  the  management  of  the Company's short term and long term cash flow requirements. The Company has various financial assets, such as cash and accounts receivable, which arise directly from its operations.\n\nThe main risks that could adversely affect the Company's financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are market risk (which includes commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. Management reviews each of these risks and establishes policies for managing them as summarized below.\n\nThe following discussion also includes a sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes  in  market  variables  on  the  Company's  financial  instruments  and  the  impact  on  net  earnings (loss) and shareholders' equity, where applicable. Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash, accounts receivable, investments at fair value, commodity swap contracts, foreign exchange option contracts,  long-term  debt,  accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities.  The  sensitivity  has  been  prepared using financial assets and liabilities held as at the reporting dates.\n\nThe Company has established financial risk management policies to identify and analyze the risks of the Company,  to  set  appropriate  risk  limits  and  controls,  and  to  monitor  risks  and  adherence  to  limits. Financial  risk  management  policies  and  systems  are  reviewed  regularly  to  reflect  changes  in  market conditions and the Company's activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and  procedures,  aims  to  develop  a  disciplined  and  constructive  control  environment  in  which  all employees involved in financial risk management activities understand their roles and obligations.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the future cash flows or the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk is comprised of three types of risks: commodity price risk,  interest  rate  risk  and  foreign  currency  risk. The  impact of each of these components is discussed below.",

The Company sells its products at prices that are effectively determined by reference to the traded prices on the London Metal Exchange and London Bullion Market. The prices of gold and copper are major factors influencing the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company regularly enters into commodity swap contracts to reduce the price exposure associated with the time lag between the  provisional  and  final  determination  of  its  concentrate  sales.  In  addition,  the  Company  periodically enters into  commodity swap contracts to reduce the price exposure associated with projected payable copper production.\n\nThe  Company's  risk  management  policy,  which  was  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  requires provisional  concentrate  sales  to  be  fully  hedged  and  permits  hedging  up  to  90%,  85%  and  80%  of  its projected payable copper production in the subsequent 1, 2, and 3 year reporting periods, respectively.\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2023,  the  impact  of  a  5%  increase  or  decrease  in  metal  prices  impacting  the Company's accounts receivable and outstanding commodity swap contracts, with all other variables held constant, would decrease or increase earnings before income taxes from continuing operations by $1.2 million (2022 - $0.6 million) and would decrease or increase equity by $1.1 million (2022 - $0.6 million).\n\nThe  following  table  demonstrates  the  effect  on  2023  and  2022  earnings  before  income  taxes  from continuing  operations  of  a  5%  increase  in  commodity  prices  on  its  sales,  excluding  the  impact  of  any hedges and with all other variables held constant. The impact on equity is the same as the impact on net earnings from continuing operations.\n\n## Effect of a 5% increase in metal prices on earnings before income taxes\n\n## from continuing operations\n\n|                | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Gold           | 25,884 | 21,911 |\n| Copper         | 5,140  | 5,487  |\n| Total increase | 31,024 | 27,398 |\n\nThe  effect  of  a  5%  decrease  in  metal  prices,  excluding  the  impact  of  any  hedges  and  with  all  other variables held constant, would decrease earnings before income taxes from continuing operations by an equivalent amount.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows or fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest  rates  relates  primarily  to  the  Company's  cash  and  floating  rate  denominated  debt  and  other financial  liabilities. As  at  December  31,  2023,  the  Company  had  no  debt  or  floating  rate  denominated financial  liabilities.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  a  100  basis  point  increase  or  decrease  in interest rates across the yield curve, with all other variables held constant, would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes from continuing operations by $6.0 million (2022 - $4.3 million). The impact on equity is the same as the impact on net earnings from continuing operations.",

The  Company  periodically  undertakes  to  purchase,  in  advance,  a  portion  of  its  foreign denominated cash flow requirements on a spot or forward basis to reduce this exposure. The Company also  enters  into  foreign  exchange  option  contracts  in  order  to  reduce  the  foreign  exchange  exposure associated  with  projected  operating  expenses  and  capital  expenditures  denominated  in  foreign currencies.\n\nThe Company's risk management policy, which was approved by the Board of Directors, permits up to 85%, 80% and 75% of its projected operating expenses denominated in foreign currency to be hedged in the subsequent 1, 2, and 3 year reporting periods, respectively. The policy also permits projected capital expenditures denominated in foreign currency to be fully hedged.\n\nThe  following  table  demonstrates  the  effect  on  2023  and  2022  earnings  before  income  taxes  from continuing operations and equity of a 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Company's key foreign currencies on the Company's outstanding financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, excluding the impact of any hedges and with all other variables held constant.\n\nEffect of a 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar on\n\n## Earnings before income taxes\n\n|                 | from continuing operations   | from continuing operations   | Equity   | Equity   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|----------|----------|\n|                 | 2023                         | 2022                         | 2023     | 2022     |\n| Euro            | 1,719                        | 2,091                        | 1,561    | 1,822    |\n| Canadian Dollar | (1,301)                      | (1,082)                      | (758)    | 946      |\n| Total increase  | 418                          | 1,009                        | 803      | 2,768    |\n\nThe effect of a 5% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies on the Company's outstanding foreign denominated financial assets and liabilities, excluding the impact of any hedges and with all other variables held constant, would be to decrease earnings before income taxes from continuing operations and equity by equivalent amounts.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe exposure to credit risk arises through the potential failure of a customer or another third party to meet its contractual obligations to the Company. During 2023, the Company had contracts with 12 customers in connection with its mining operations, one of whom accounted for approximately 50% (2022 - 39%) of the Company's revenue from continuing  operations.  Under  the  terms  of  the  Company's  concentrate  sales contracts, the purchasers make an initial advance payment equal to 70% to 100% of the provisional value of  each lot  at  the  time  title  transfers. This  serves  to  mitigate  a  portion  of  the  Company's  credit  risk.  In 2023, the Company also had contracts with four customers in connection with its smelting operations, one of whom accounted for approximately 86% (2022 - 83%) of the Company's revenue from discontinued operations.\n\nWith respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Company, which comprise cash, equity  investments  and  derivative  financial  assets,  the  Company's  maximum  exposure  is  equal  to  the carrying amount of these instruments. The Company limits its counterparty credit risk on these assets by dealing  with  highly  rated  counterparties,  issuers  that  are  subject  to  minimum  credit  ratings,  and/or maximum prescribed exposures.",

The cyclical nature of the Company's businesses and the volatility of capital markets are such that conditions could change dramatically, affecting the Company's cash flow generating capability, its ability to maintain, or draw upon, its RCF or the existing terms under its concentrate sales and/or smelting agreements, as well as its liquidity, cost of capital and its ability to access new capital, which could adversely affect the Company's earnings and cash flows and, in turn, could affect total shareholder returns. To reduce these risks, the Company: (i) prepares regular cash flow forecasts to monitor its capital requirements, available liquidity  and  compliance  to  debt  covenants;  (ii)  strives  to  maintain  a  prudent  capital  structure  that  is comprised primarily of equity financing and long-term debt, currently in the form of a committed RCF; and (iii) targets a minimum level of liquidity comprised of surplus cash balances and/or undrawn committed lines  of  credit  to  avoid  having  to  raise  additional  capital  at  times  when  the  costs  or  terms  would  be regarded as unfavourable.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  the  maturity  profile  of  the  Company's  financial  liabilities  based  on contractual undiscounted payments.\n\n|                                          | up to 1 year   | 1 - 5 years   | over 5 years   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------|\n| Accounts payable and accrued liabilities | 77,460         | -             | -              | 77,460  |\n| Commodity swap contracts                 | 1,179          | -             | -              | 1,179   |\n| Lease obligations                        | 3,761          | 8,841         | 1,147          | 13,749  |\n| Other obligations                        | 1,793          | 1,061         | 676            | 3,530   |\n|                                          | 84,193         | 9,902         | 1,823          | 95,918  |\n\n|                                          |              |             | As at December 31, 2022   | As at December 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                          | up to 1 year | 1 - 5 years | over 5 years              | Total                     |\n| Accounts payable and accrued liabilities | 81,165       | -           | -                         | 81,165                    |\n| Commodity swap contracts                 | 3,259        | -           | -                         | 3,259                     |\n| Foreign exchange option contracts        | 1,787        | -           | -                         | 1,787                     |\n| Foreign exchange forward contracts       | 318          | -           | -                         | 318                       |\n| Lease obligations                        | 5,416        | 9,854       | 1,403                     | 16,673                    |\n| Other obligations                        | 127          | 1,567       | 486                       | 2,180                     |\n|                                          | 92,072       | 11,421      | 1,889                     | 105,382                   |",

See note 13 for  discussion on the Company's compliance with these requirements. The Company monitors its financial position and the potential impact of adverse market  conditions  on  an  ongoing  basis.  The  Company  manages  its  capital  structure  and  makes adjustments  to  it  based  on  prevailing  market  conditions  and  according  to  its  business  strategy.  The Company's  long  term  funding  strategy  is  to  maintain  a  capital  structure  comprised  primarily  of  equity sourced  from  equity  offerings  and  net  earnings  generated  from  its  businesses  and,  as  a  result,  the targeted level of debt making up the Company's capital base is relatively low. Given the long term nature of  the  assets  being  funded  and  the  U.S.  dollar  denominated  revenue  stream  generated  therefrom,  the Company's general strategy around any debt financing is to raise long-term U.S. dollar denominated debt to supplement these equity financings.\n\nOverall  financial  leverage  is  monitored  based  upon  a  number  of  non-financial  and  financial  factors, including a number of credit related ratios contained in DPM's loan agreements and net debt (defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents) as a percentage of total capital (defined as total equity plus net debt). As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all loan covenants and its net debt as a percentage of total capital was negative 113% (December 31, 2022 - negative 77%).\n\n## 28. OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nOperating segments are components of an entity whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance and for which separate financial information is available.\n\nThe Company has two reportable operating segments - Chelopech and Ada Tepe in Bulgaria. The nature of  their  operations,  products  and  services  are  described  in note  1 , Corporate  Information .  These segments  are  organized  predominantly  by  the  products  and  services  provided  to  customers  and geography  of  the  businesses.  The  Corporate  and  Other  segment  includes  corporate,  exploration  and evaluation and other income and cost items that do not pertain directly to an operating segment. There are no significant inter-segment transactions that have not been eliminated on consolidation.\n\nThe operating results of Tsumeb have been presented as a discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities of Tsumeb have been presented as held for sale as a result of the Company's plan to sell the smelter (note 3).\n\nThe  accounting  policies  of  the  segments  are  the  same  as  those  described  in note  2.2,  Material Accounting  Policy  Information .  Segment  performance  is  evaluated  based  on  several  operating  and financial measures, including net earnings (loss), which is measured consistently with net earnings (loss) in the consolidated financial statements.",

( DPM ) in response to reporting requirements for relevant Canadian companies under Canada's Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act ( the Act ) and has been organized to address each area specified under the Act's reporting requirements.\n\n## PART 1: Statement of Commitment\n\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that in 2021, there were approximately 28 million people around the world working in forced labour situations. That statistic is a grim reminder of the scope of modern slavery, its invasive presence in global supply chains, and the extent of its destructive impact on individual lives and communities.\n\nCompanies everywhere share a clear responsibility for reducing and mitigating the risks of forced labour and child labour in their own organizations and supply chains.\n\nFor DPM, that responsibility begins with our overarching commitment to human rights, embedded in our corporate values, our Corporate Responsibility Policy, our Code of Business Conduct & Ethics, and our Human Rights Standard, which establishes specific requirements aimed at preventing any form of human rights abuse at our operations or in our supply chain. Those commitments are in turn guided by the standards established in ILO Conventions, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the United Nations Global Compact, and are consistent with (or exceed) the laws, regulations and standards in the countries where we operate.\n\nIn 2023, Canada joined other jurisdictions, including Australia, the UK, and the US, in introducing legislation to increase transparency of modern slavery in supply chains by requiring, among other measures, annual reporting.\n\nThe following is DPM's first report under the Act, which has been organized to address the information required by section 11 of the Act. It provides a comprehensive account of the policies, programs, and specific actions DPM implemented in the previous year to prevent and reduce the risk of forced labour and child labour in our operations and supply chains - including, among other measures, country and supplier risk assessments, supplier screening, employee training, and providing safe and secure channels for employees, stakeholders, communities, suppliers and their respective workers to report human rights concerns.\n\nWe remain committed to open and transparent annual reporting on our approach, progress, and challenges.\n\n(signed) \" David Rae \"\n\nDavid Rae\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer",

        "page_content": "## PART 2: DPM's Corporate Structure, Activities and Supply Chains\n\nDPM is a Canadian-based international gold mining company that is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Our operations and projects are located in Bulgaria, Namibia, Serbia and Ecuador. We operate the Chelopech underground gold-copper mine and the Ada Tepe open pit gold mine, both located in Bulgaria, as well as the Tsumeb specialty smelter located in Namibia.\n\nDPM also owns the Loma Larga project in Ecuador and the \u010coka Rakita project in Serbia; and holds interests in a number of other gold development and exploration properties in various locations in Serbia and Ecuador.\n\nWe have incorporated principles of responsible business conduct through the adoption of various policies and programs, including our Code of Business Conduct & Ethics, Corporate Responsibility Policy and Human Rights Standard described in further detail below.\n\nIn 2022, our global workforce encompassed over 2,000 full time employees and engaged approximately 1,600 contractors. Approximately 75% of our total employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nWe monitor the countries where we operate to identify developments that could lead to governance, environmental and social risks, including risks associated with forced labour or child labour.\n\nThe countries where we currently operate, Bulgaria and Namibia, along with the countries where we have exploration and/or development projects, Ecuador and Serbia respectively, have different exposures to and potential for forced labour and child labour (as detailed below). Our approach to identifying the parts of our business and supply chain that carry risk of forced labour and child labour, and steps taken to assess and manage that risk, is informed by our country-level and operational-level risk profile assessments. The purpose of these assessments is to identify areas of higher risk; we then use this information to prioritize our efforts in implementing and monitoring a targeted set of controls.\n\nAs described below, DPM developed an internal risk-rating of forced labour and child labour based upon a composite assessment of a number of international human rights and modern slavery indices. Based on this risk assessment, we have determined that our current operating assets have a low risk of forced labour and child labour.\n\nHowever, we acknowledge that risks can also arise in our extended supply chain. As required by the Act, this report describes the measures taken in 2023 to identify, mitigate and eliminate the risks of forced labour and/or child labour at both our operations and within our supply chain.\n\nThe mining industry's value chain spans a global complex network. DPM has a diverse global supply chain through which we procure a range of goods and services to support our exploration, mining, processing, transportation and corporate support activities. Our operations' supply chains are primarily locally and/or regionally based. Overall, the majority of the company's goods are procured from suppliers based in Bulgaria, Serbia and Canada respectively. The majority of our supplier spending can be generalized into the procurement of goods, construction, operational and technical services and support and administrative functions. Our risk assessment of forced labour and/or child labour in this supply chain is described in detail in Part 4 of this report.",

This includes human rights and, specifically, the risks of forced labour and child labour. A core component of the Sustainability Committee's mandate is to provide oversight of potential human rights impacts associated with our operations and in the communities in which we operate. Composed entirely of independent directors, the Sustainability Committee meets quarterly, including an in-camera session without management present at each meeting.\n\nAt the executive level, the Senior Vice President (SVP), Sustainable Business Development reports directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and is responsible for sustainability and human rights at the group level. The Director, Sustainability reports directly to the SVP, Sustainable Business Development and leads DPM's overall human rights management strategy, working across the Executive team and Sustainability Directors at each operational site to integrate human rights management throughout the Company's operational and functional areas.\n\nThe SVP, European Operations  and the Vice President and Managing Director of our Namibian smelter, both of whom report directly to the CEO, have direct oversight and leadership of their site-level teams that manage human rights-related risks throughout their operations and respective supply chains. Similarly, the General Manager of the Company's activities in Ecuador and the General Manager of Exploration, overseeing our Serbian activities, both provide leadership and management of this issue throughout their teams as well.\n\n## Policies and due diligence\n\nWhen we conduct business the right way, we build trust with one another and with all our external stakeholders. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code) is established by the DPM Board of Directors as a statement of the principles and commitments intended to direct and guide the conduct of the Company. The Code sets the expectation that we conduct our business with respect for the human rights of all individuals affected by our business activities. It reflects our values, describes the Company's expectations, and serves as a resource to help guide our decisions. The Code applies to everyone who works for DPM, including employees and members of our Board of Directors, and to third parties, including suppliers working with us or on our behalf, who are contractually required by the Company to comply with the Code. The Code sets the expectation that all third parties (i.e., anyone who does business with DPM, including our suppliers) adhere to principles consistent with those set out in our Code and aligned with our core values. Additionally, our contracts with suppliers include provisions requiring the suppliers to comply with local laws and regulations and applicable professional standards.\n\nOur Code explicitly refers to our Corporate Responsibility Policy which outlines our commitment to managing the Company's impacts across all areas of our business including, among others, conducting our business in a manner that respects human rights and striving to avoid contributing to adverse human rights impacts, including child and forced labour. The policy further elaborates that DPM, its employees and members of our Board of Directors are expected to understand the Company's impact and influence across the entire value chain and, wherever possible, apply responsible business practices to sourcing and materials stewardship.",

        "page_content": "To operationalize our policy commitments, we developed a Human Rights Standard that explicitly outlines the minimum requirements with which all our sites must comply, including requirements regarding forced and child labour. It is informed by the principles contained in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which include guiding principles regarding forced labour and child labour and provide guidance on the following:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying, preventing, mitigating and being accountable for our human rights impacts using a riskbased due diligence approach;\n- \u00b7 preventing or mitigating adverse human rights impacts that directly or indirectly arise from our operations;\n- \u00b7 processes for the remediation of adverse human rights impacts within our sphere of influence;\n- \u00b7 ensuring employees, communities, stakeholders, security providers and third parties (including suppliers) are aware of our commitment to respect human rights and that the Company's business is conducted with respect for human rights; and\n- \u00b7 in line with the Company's values and the principles set out in our Code, encourage individuals to report and 'speak-up' when they see something that could result in a violation of, or an adverse impact on, human rights, which encompasses child and forced labour.\n\nOur Human Rights Standard applies to everyone who works for the Company, including all employees and our Board of Directors. It also directly applies to certain third-party suppliers who have contractually committed to complying with our policies and standards and sets the expectation that all third parties (i.e., anyone who does business with DPM, including our suppliers) adhere to principles consistent with those set out in the standard.\n\nTo further enable our workforce to live the principles and commitments espoused in our Code, Corporate Responsibility Policy and Human Rights Standard described above, we currently use a comprehensive risk-based third-party due diligence process (3PDD) that was developed to manage bribery, corruption, reputational and sanction compliance risks. In 2023, we modified our 3PDD to include human-rights related due diligence, including forced labour and child labour. The 3PDD process is used as an input to determine the measures we take to engage with our suppliers' compliance with the Code.\n\n## PART 4: The parts of DPM's business and supply chain that carry a risk of forced labor or child labour, and the steps taken to assess and mitigate that risk.\n\n## Human Rights risk assessment - DPM assets\n\nThroughout 2023, we engaged in risk-based human rights risk assessments across our sites including our operations in Bulgaria and Namibia, development projects in Serbia and Ecuador and our corporate head office in Canada. The results of those assessments allowed us to begin implementing more immediate controls related to child and forced labour in the short-term (such as internal training), while also helping to identify areas of opportunities to further integrate human rights considerations into company processes like our supply chain procurement processes.\n\nIn addition to assessing the activities connected to our own operational boundaries, we also conducted a risk assessment of each country where our assets are located to better contextualize and understand the potential risk for human rights impacts and vulnerabilities for forced labour and child labour to occur. Our country-specific assessments also reviewed governance indicators such as the rule of law, political stability, level of corruption and conflict-",

The process involved identifying and assessing over 1,900 Tier 1 suppliers, the products and services we procured, classified into 8 broader industry categories, and evaluating each supplier's country of origin risk, across 40 different countries.\n\nAs described above, as a result of our assessment of our Tier 1 suppliers we have begun incorporating human-rights related questions, with an emphasis on forced labour and child labour, as a consideration during supplier pre-qualification.\n\n## Sector Risk\n\nAfter conducting a detailed desk-top evaluation of our supplier base 1 which involved referencing credible sources of information about the risks of forced labour and child labour and then subsequently evaluating where our operations and supply chain could be exposed to those risks, we believe that the following sector categories and their associated goods/services could potentially be at a higher risk for forced labour and/or child labour:\n\n| Sector and potential related risks for forced/child  labour                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Goods/Services  commonly  provided by that  sector   | Description relevant to  DPM                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Construction Services  - Risk of workers to excessive recruitment fees and debt bondage - Dangerous working conditions with high levels of industrial accidents - Risks of workers being subject to late or non-payment of wages - Restrictions on movement                    | Drilling,  Procurement and  Construction  Management | Building, maintenance,  demolition, renovation  and repair of structures                                                                                                                                          |\n| Manufacturing  - Hazardous/undesirable work - Vulnerable, easily replaced, and/or low-skilled workforce - Migrant workforce - Presence of labor contractors, recruiters, agents or other middlemen in labor supply chain - Long, complex, and/or non-transparent supply chains | Electronics,  machinery,  equipment, spare  parts    | Manufacturing involves  the transformation of raw  materials from  agriculture, forestry,  fishing, and mining or  quarrying, as well as the  transformation of other  manufacturing products  into new products. |",

In addition, across our sites, we also have implemented grievance mechanisms accessible to our stakeholders and communities so that we may receive and address complaints or grievances in an expedited and transparent manner. These processes are available for workers in our extended supply chain to report on risks associated with forced labour and child labour and are publicly available on our website for\n\neveryone to utilize.\n\nWe have four reporting channels as part of the Speak-Up process, including the EthicsPoint hotline, which allows for anonymous reporting of misconduct and ethical concerns. Reports submitted through the hotline are referred to the Corporate Compliance Officer (except when the Corporate Compliance Officer is personally implicated or the reports implicate a member of the Executive team or a member of Board of Directors, in which case the report is appropriately escalated) and to the appropriate Board Committee Chair, depending on the nature of the report. The Board receives quarterly updates on Speak-Up reports received and the status of investigations, if any, and Committee Chairs discuss the reports at their respective meetings. The Code includes protection from retaliation for anyone who files a report, raises a concern, or participates in an investigation in good faith.\n\nFor performance reporting on our Speak-Up reports, please see more in our 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\nAt the site level, we have also provided a local grievance mechanism to receive human rights grievances with the intention of transparent and expeditious resolution and a commitment to non-retaliation against anyone who submits a complaint.\n\nThe Company did not receive any grievances related to forced labour or child labour and has not changed its business relationships as a result of our due diligence efforts relating to forced labour or child labour in 2023 and as such, has no measures to report with respect to remediation.\n\n## PART 6: Modern slavery awareness training compliance for employees\n\nOur Human Rights Standard includes providing human rights training at all our sites. Although our employees receive training in good governance practices (such as anti-bribery, anticorruption, and workplace harassment) that are associated with preventing and mitigating human rights risks, we recognize that we need to provide more updated training across our operations to specifically address the risks of forced labour and child labour in our supply chains.\n\nUsing our risk-based approach (as described above), in 2023, we identified the increased potential for human rights risks to occur at our development project in Ecuador. As such, we engaged an independent, internationally recognized third party to conduct in-person, participatory and comprehensive human rights training. A full day of training focused on the Voluntary Principles for Security and Human Rights for our security personnel followed by a second day of training focused on overall human rights identification and mitigation, with an",
